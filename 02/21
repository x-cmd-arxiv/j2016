Here, we examine introductory physics\nstudents' ability to use analogies in solving problems involving Newton's\nsecond law. Students enrolled in an algebra-based introductory physics course\nwere given a solved problem involving tension in a rope and were then asked to\nsolve another problem for which the physics is very similar but involved a\nfrictional force.

The\naverage velocity distribution functions, computed in the solar wind rest frame,\nwere further separated based on the angle between the upstream solar wind\nvelocity and the IMF. Several proton populations were identified from the\nvelocity distribution and their possible entry mechanism were inferred based on\nthe characteristics of the velocity distribution. These entry mechanisms\ninclude (i) diffusion of solar wind protons into the wake along IMF, (ii) the\nsolar wind protons with finite gyro-radii that are aided by the wake boundary\nelectric field, (iii) solar wind protons with gyro-radii larger than lunar\nradii from the tail of the solar wind velocity distribution, and (iv)\nscattering of solar wind protons from the dayside lunar surface or from\nmagnetic anomalies. In order to gain more insight into the entry mechanisms\nassociated with different populations, backtracing is carried out for each of\nthese populations. For most of the populations, the source of the protons\nobtained from backtracing is found to be in agreement with that inferred from\nthe velocity distribution.

Our estimators generalize those typically used to calculate these\nstatistics on point process data, allowing them to be calculated on RMs which\nassign continuous values to spatial regions, for instance to model protein\nintensity. The clustering index (H*) compares Ripley's H function calculated\nempirically to its distribution under complete spatial randomness (CSR),\nleading us to consider CSR null hypotheses for RMs which are not\npoint-processes when generalizing this statistic. We thus consider restricted\nclasses of completely random measures which can be simulated directly (Gamma\nprocesses and Marked Poisson Processes), as well as the general class of all\nCSR RMs, for which we derive an exact permutation-based H* estimator.

Reports found in the literature reveal two apparent\nconflicting visions of how RSEs should be modeled. From one side, the\nPoissonian processes, of which consecutive events follow each other at a\nrelatively regular time and should not be correlated. On the other side, the\nself-exciting processes, which are able to generate bursts of correlated events\nand periods of inactivities. The existence of many and sometimes conflicting\napproaches to model RSEs is a consequence of the unpredictability of the\naggregated dynamics of our individual and routine activities, which sometimes\nshow simple patterns, but sometimes results in irregular rising and falling\ntrends. In this paper we propose a highly parsimonious way to characterize\ngeneral RSEs, namely the Burstiness Scale (BuSca) model. BuSca views each RSE\nas a mix of two independent process: a Poissonian and a self-exciting one. Here\nwe describe a fast method to extract the two parameters of BuSca that,\ntogether, gives the burstyness scale, which represents how much of the RSE is\ndue to bursty and viral effects. We validated our method in eight diverse and\nlarge datasets containing real random series of events seen in Twitter, Yelp,\ne-mail conversations, Digg, and online forums. Results showed that, even using\nonly two parameters, BuSca is able to accurately describe RSEs seen in these\ndiverse systems, what can leverage many applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2016 16:47:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

The post-filter is also used to estimate the reliability of\nspectral features and compute a missing feature mask.

We studied\nrobotic agents playing Chain Catch game as a Multi-Agent System (MAS). Our game\nstarts with a traditional Catch game similar to Pursuit evasion, and further\nextends it to form a growing chain of predator agents to chase remaining preys.\nHence Chain Catch is a combination of two challenges - pursuit domain and\nrobotic chain formation. These are games that require team of robotic agents to\ncooperate among themselves and to compete with other group of agents through\nquick decision making. In this paper, we present a Chain Catch simulator that\nallows us to incorporate game rules, design strategies and simulate the game\nplay. We developed cost model driven strategies for each of Escapee, Catcher\nand Chain. Our results show that Sliding slope strategy is the best strategy\nfor Escapees whereas Tagging method is the best method for chain s movement in\nChain Catch. We also use production quality robots to implement the game play\nin a physical environment and analyze game strategies on real robots. Our real\nrobots implementation in different scenarios shows that game strategies work as\nexpected and a complete chain formation takes place successfully in each game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2016 21:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

In the first method, a numerically simulated lens\nphase distribution is loaded directly onto the SLM, together with the cubic\nphase distribution. An Airy beam is generated at the focal plane of the\nnumerical lens. We provide for the first time a quantitative properties of the\nformed Airy beam. We derive the formula for deflection of the intensity maximum\nof the so formed Airy beam, which is different to the quadratic deflection\ntypical of Airy beams. We cross-validate the derived formula by both\nsimulations and experiment. The second method is based on the fact that a\nsystem consisting of a transmissive SLM sandwiched between two polarisers can\ncreate a transmission function with negative values. This observation alone has\nthe potential for various other wavefront modulations where the transmission\nfunction requires negative values. As an example for this method, we\ndemonstrate that a wavefront can be modulated by passing the SLM system with\ntransmission function with negative values by loading an Airy function\ndistribution directly onto SLM. Since the Airy function is a real-valued\nfunction but also with negative values, an Airy beam can be generated by direct\ntransfer of the Airy function distribution onto such an SLM system. In this\nway, an Airy beam is generated immediately behind the SLM. As both new methods\ndo not employ a physical lens, the two setups are more compact than\nconventional setups for creating Airy beams.

Depending on the\naim of an analysis, either a supervised or an unsupervised learning approach\ncan be applied. Under a supervised context, an HMM is trained to classify\nunlabelled acceleration data into a finite set of pre-specified categories,\nwhereas we will demonstrate how an unsupervised learning approach can be used\nto infer new aspects of animal behaviour.

The derivation of the response\nfunctions is based on the elegant functional path integral approach which\nallows us to calculate the density-density and spin-spin correlation functions\nby introducing the external sources for the density and the spin density. Since\nthe generating functional cannot be evaluated exactly, we consider two gapless\napproximations which ensure a gapless collective mode (Goldstone mode) in the\nsuperfluid state: the BCS-Leggett mean-field theory and the\nGaussian-pair-fluctuation (GPF) theory. In the mean-field theory, our results\nof the response functions agree with the known results from the random phase\napproximation. We further consider the pair fluctuation effects and establish a\ntheoretical framework for the dynamic responses within the GPF theory. We show\nthat the GPF response theory naturally recover three kinds of famous\ndiagrammatic contributions: the Self-Energy contribution, the Aslamazov-Lakin\ncontribution, and the Maki-Thompson contribution. We also show that unlike the\nequilibrium state, in evaluating the response functions, the linear\n(first-order) terms in the external sources as well as the induced order\nparameter perturbations should be treated carefully. In the superfluid state,\nthere is an additional order parameter contribution which ensures that in the\nstatic and long wavelength limit, the density response function recovers the\nresult of the compressibility (compressibility sum rule).

A gene expression signature (GES) is\nreported for lethal PC in biopsy specimens obtained at the time of diagnosis\nfrom patients with Gleason 6 and Gleason 7 tumors in a Swedish watchful waiting\ncohort with up to 30 years follow-up. A 98-genes GES identified 89 and 100\npercent of all death events 4 years after diagnosis in G7 and G6 patients,\nrespectively; at 6 years follow-up, 83 and 100 percent of all deaths events\nwere captured.

Therefore this\nis an ideal platform for the experimental realization of a strongly interacting\nFermi superfluid with narrow resonance. We show that the transition temperature\nfor the Fermi superfluid in this system, especially at the BCS side of the\nresonance, is even higher than that in a wide resonance, which is also due to\nthe narrow character of this resonance. Our results will encourage experimental\nefforts to realize Fermi superfluid in the alkali-earth-like Yb-173 system, the\nproperties of which will be complementary to extensively studied Fermi\nsuperfluids nearby a wide resonance in alkali K-40 and Li-6 systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2016 08:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-14"}

The present paper continues the same line of study, where we focus\non partitioning weighted uniform hypergraphs---a problem often encountered in\ncomputer vision. This work is motivated by two issues that arise when a\nhypergraph partitioning approach is used to tackle computer vision problems:\n(i) The uniform hypergraphs constructed for higher-order learning contain all\nedges, but most have negligible weights. Thus, the adjacency tensor is nearly\nsparse, and yet, not binary. (ii) A more serious concern is that standard\npartitioning algorithms need to compute all edge weights, which is\ncomputationally expensive for hypergraphs. This is usually resolved in practice\nby merging the clustering algorithm with a tensor sampling strategy---an\napproach that is yet to be analysed rigorously. We build on our earlier work on\npartitioning dense unweighted uniform hypergraphs (Ghoshdastidar and Dukkipati,\nICML, 2015), and address the aforementioned issues by proposing provable and\nefficient partitioning algorithms. Our analysis justifies the empirical success\nof practical sampling techniques.

Axion monodromy\nscenarios are setups where the axion shift symmetry is broken by some effect\nsuch that the axion can traverse a large number of periods potentially leading\nto super-Planckian excursions. We study such scenarios in type IIA string\ntheory where the axion shift symmetry is broken by background fluxes. In\nparticular we calculate the backreaction of the energy density induced by the\naxion vacuum expectation value on its own field space metric. We find universal\nbehaviour for all the compactifications studied where up to a certain critical\naxion value there is only a small backreaction effect. Beyond the critical\nvalue the backreaction is strong and implies that the proper field distance as\nmeasured by the backreacted metric increases at best logarithmically with the\naxion vev, thereby placing strong limitations on extending the field distance\nany further. The critical axion value can be made arbitrarily large by the\nchoice of fluxes. However the backreaction of these fluxes on the axion field\nspace metric ensures a precise cancellation such that the proper field distance\nup to the critical axion value is flux independent and remains sub-Planckian.\nWe also study an axion alignment scenario for type IIA compactifications on a\ntwisted torus with four fundamental axions mixing to leave an axion with an\neffective decay constant which is flux dependent. There is a choice of fluxes\nfor which the alignment parameter is unconstrained by tadpoles and can in\nprinciple lead to a parametrically enhanced effective decay constant. However\nwe show that these fluxes backreact on the fundamental decay constants so as to\nprecisely cancel any enhancement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2016 11:01:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 14:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

A kernel method is used to build nonparametric\nestimates for the component probability density functions in Bayes theorem from\na set of over one hundred thousand batted ball measurements recorded by the\nHITf/x system during the 2014 major league baseball (MLB) season.\nCross-validation is used to determine the optimal vector of smoothing\nparameters for the density estimates. Properties of the mapping are visualized\nby considering reduced-dimension subsets of the batted ball parameter space. We\nuse the mapping to derive statistics for intrinsic quality of contact for\nbatters and pitchers which have the potential to improve the accuracy of player\nmodels and forecasting systems. We also show that the new approach leads to a\nsimple automated measure of contact-adjusted defense and provides insight into\nthe impact of environmental variables on batted balls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2016 06:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-02"}
