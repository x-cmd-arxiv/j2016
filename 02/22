The boundary of the body is formed by the unit\nvectors. We also have a so-called Minkowski functional to measure the length of\nvectors. By changing the origin in the interior of the body we have a smoothly\nvarying family of Minkowski functionals. This is called the Funk metric. Under\nsome regularity conditions the Minkowski functionals allow us to measure the\nvolume (area) of the indicatrix bodies (hypersurfaces). Some homogenity\nproperties provide the volume and the area to be proportional. The area as the\nfunction of the base point varying in the interior of $K$ is strictly convex\n[25]. This is called the area function of the Funk manifold. If the minimum is\nattained at the origin then $K$ is said to be balanced. The idea comes from the\ngeneralization of Brickell's theorem [6] for Finsler manifolds with balanced\nindicatrices [25]. As a continuation of [25] we are going to investigate\nanalytic properties and the asymptotic behavior of the area function of a Funk\nmanifold. We prove that the area function is locally analytic and the area can\nbe arbitrary large near to the boundary of $K$. Therefore the minimum always\nattained at a uniquely determined interior point of $K$. If we apply the result\nto the indicatrices of a Finsler manifold point by point then the uniquely\ndefined minima of the area functions constitute a vector field. We prove that\nit is differentiable. Therefore each indicatrix body can be translated in such\na way that the translated body is balanced and we always have an associated\nFinsler manifold with balanced indicatrices. Finsler manifolds having balanced\nindicatrices represent a class of Finsler spaces such that the so-called\nBrickell's conjecture holds [6], see also [25].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2016 18:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

Here\nwe consider an alternative scenario, that Jupiter's core may have accumulated\nin the innermost parts of the protoplanetary disk. A growing body of research\nsuggests that small particles (\"pebbles\") continually drift inward through the\ndisk. If a fraction of drifting pebbles is trapped at the inner edge of the\ndisk a several Earth-mass core can quickly grow. Subsequently, the core may\nmigrate outward beyond the snow line via planet-disk interactions. Of course,\nto reach the outer Solar System Jupiter's core must traverse the terrestrial\nplanet-forming region.\n  We use N-body simulations including synthetic forces from an underlying\ngaseous disk to study how the outward migration of Jupiter's core sculpts the\nterrestrial zone. If the outward migration is fast (Tmig~10^4 years), the core\nsimply migrates past resident planetesimals and planetary embryos. However, if\nits migration is slower (Tmig~10^5 years) the core removes solids from the\ninner disk by shepherding objects in mean motion resonances. In many cases the\ndisk interior to 0.5-1 AU is cleared of embryos and most planetesimals. By\ngenerating a mass deficit close to the Sun, the outward migration of Jupiter's\ncore may thus explain the absence of terrestrial planets closer than Mercury.\nJupiter's migrating core often stimulates the growth of another large\n(~Earth-mass) core -- that may provide a seed for Saturn's core -- trapped in\nexterior resonance. The migrating core also may transport a fraction of\nterrestrial planetesimals, such as the putative parent bodies of iron\nmeteorites, to the asteroid belt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2016 20:12:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 13:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The effective\nuse of random projections requires efficient coding schemes for quantizing\n(real-valued) projected data into integers. In this paper, we focus on a simple\n2-bit coding scheme. In particular, we develop accurate nonlinear estimators of\ndata similarity based on the 2-bit strategy. This work will have important\npractical applications. For example, in the task of near neighbor search, a\ncrucial step (often called re-ranking) is to compute or estimate data\nsimilarities once a set of candidate data points have been identified by hash\ntable techniques. This re-ranking step can take advantage of the proposed\ncoding scheme and estimator.\n  As a related task, in this paper, we also study a simple uniform quantization\nscheme for the purpose of building hash tables with projected data. Our\nanalysis shows that typically only a small number of bits are needed. For\nexample, when the target similarity level is high, 2 or 3 bits might be\nsufficient. When the target similarity level is not so high, it is preferable\nto use only 1 or 2 bits. Therefore, a 2-bit scheme appears to be overall a good\nchoice for the task of sublinear time approximate near neighbor search via hash\ntables.\n  Combining these results, we conclude that 2-bit random projections should be\nrecommended for approximate near neighbor search and similarity estimation.\nExtensive experimental results are provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2016 20:46:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

However, operation in noisy\nenvironments may lead to significant degradation of the received signal. To\naddress this issue, we propose employing an acoustic sensor array which is\nmounted on the eyeglasses frames. The signals from the array are processed by\nan algorithm with the purpose of acquiring the user's desired near-filed speech\nsignal while suppressing noise signals originating from the environment. The\narray is comprised of two AVSs which are located at the fore of the glasses'\ntemples. Each AVS consists of four collocated subsensors: one pressure sensor\n(with an omnidirectional response) and three particle-velocity sensors (with\ndipole responses) oriented in mutually orthogonal directions. The array\nconfiguration is designed to boost the input power of the desired signal, and\nto ensure that the characteristics of the noise at the different channels are\nsufficiently diverse (lending towards more effective noise suppression). Since\nchanges in the array's position correspond to the desired speaker's movement,\nthe relative source-receiver position remains unchanged; hence, the need to\ntrack fluctuations of the steering vector is avoided. Conversely, the spatial\nstatistics of the noise are subject to rapid and abrupt changes due to sudden\nmovement and rotation of the user's head. Consequently, the algorithm must be\ncapable of rapid adaptation. We propose an algorithm which incorporates\ndetection of the desired speech in the time-frequency domain, and employs this\ninformation to adaptively update estimates of the noise statistics.

Our approach combines a stochastic landscape model with\na spatially-explicit model of population dynamics. It enables us to analyze the\neffect of the landscape composition (proportion of semi-natural habitat,\nnon-treated crops, slightly treated crops and conventionally treated crops) on\nthe effectiveness of pest biocontrol. Effectiveness is measured through\nenvironmental and agronomical descriptors, measuring respectively the impact of\nthe pesticides on the environment and the average agronomic productivity of the\nwhole landscape taking into account losses caused by pests.\n  Conclusions: The effectiveness of the pesticide, the intensity of the\ntreatment and the pest intrinsic growth rate are found to be the main drivers\nof landscape productivity. The loss in productivity due to a reduced use of\npesticide can be partly compensated by biocontrol. However, the model suggests\nthat it is not possible to maintain a constant level of productivity while\nreducing the use of pesticides, even with highly efficient natural enemies.\nFragmentation of the semi-natural habitats and increased crop rotation tend to\nslightly enhance the effectiveness of biocontrol but have a marginal effect\ncompared to the predation rate by natural enemies.\n  This note was written in the framework of the ANR project PEERLESS\n\"Predictive Ecological Engineering for Landscape Ecosystem Services and\nSustainability\"(ANR-12-AGRO-0006).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2016 21:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

As companies move towards an\nincreasingly specialized production function and their reach is becoming truly\nglobal, their aptitude in managing and shaping their inter-organizational\nnetwork is a determining factor in measuring their health. Current models of\ncompany financial health often lack variables explaining the\ninter-organizational network, and as such, assume that (1) all networks are the\nsame and (2) the performance of partners do not impact companies. This paper\naims to be a first step in the direction of removing these assumptions.\nSpecifically, the impact is illustrated by examining the effects of customer\nand supplier concentrations and partners' credit risk on credit-default swap\n(CDS) spreads while controlling for credit risk and size. We rely upon\nsupply-chain data from Bloomberg that provides insight into companies'\nrelationships. The empirical results show that a well diversified customer\nnetwork lowers CDS spread, while having stable partners with low default\nprobabilities increase spreads. The latter result suggests that successful\ncompanies do not focus on building a stable eco-system around themselves, but\ninstead focus on their own profit maximization at the cost of the financial\nhealth of their suppliers' and customers'. At a more general level, the results\nindicate the importance of considering the inter-organizational networks, and\nhighlight the value of including network variables in credit risk models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2016 21:28:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

The bulge X-shaped structure comprises\nstars that formed in the disk at different locations.

Here, we explore the organization of neural\ncodewords using retinal data by computing the entropy of codewords as a\nfunction of Hamming distance from a particular reference codeword.\nSpecifically, we report that the retinal codewords in the state space are\ndivided into multiple distinct clusters separated by entropy-gaps, and that\nthis structure is shared with well-known associative memory networks in a\nrecallable phase.

Hence the detection and characterization of a\nhyperchaotic attractor is usually done using the spectrum of Lyapunov Exponents\n(LEs) that measure this rate of divergence along each direction. Though\nhyperchaos arise in different dynamical situations and find several practical\napplications, a proper understanding of the geometric structure of a\nhyperchaotic attractor still remains an unsolved problem. In this paper, we\npresent strong numerical evidence to suggest that the geometric structure of a\nhyperchaotic attractor can be characterized using a multifractal spectrum with\ntwo superimposed components.

By\ncontrast, other more familiar problems that require the consideration of two\nimportant principles (e.g., conservation of both energy and momentum for a\nballistic pendulum) are quickly solved by the same professors. The responses of\nstudents who were given the same problem reflected no overarching strategies or\nsystematic approaches, and a much wider variety of incorrect responses were\ngiven. This investigation highlights the importance of teaching effective\nproblem solving heuristics, and suggests that instructors assess the difficulty\nof a problem from the perspective of beginning students.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 03:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

Our method iteratively learns the\nbest hash functions during the column generation procedure. Existing hashing\nmethods optimize over simple objectives such as the reconstruction error or\ngraph Laplacian related loss functions, instead of the performance evaluation\ncriteria of interest---multivariate performance measures such as the AUC and\nNDCG.

For optimizing general\nranking measures, the resulting optimization problem can involve exponentially\nor infinitely many variables and constraints, which is more challenging than\nstandard structured output learning.

We show that there exist groups of central type $G$ such that\n$H^2(G,\\C^*)$ admits more than one such orbit of non-degenerate classes. We\ncompute the family $\\Lambda$ of positive integers $n$ such that there is a\nunique group of central type of order $n^2$, namely $C_n\\times C_n$. The family\n$\\Lambda$ is of square-free integers and contains all prime numbers. It is\nobtained by a full description of all groups of central type whose orders are\ncube-free. We establish the maximal connected gradings of all finite\ndimensional semisimple complex algebras using the fact that such gradings are\ndetermined by dimensions of complex projective representations of finite\ngroups. In some cases we give a description of the corresponding fundamental\ngroups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 09:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

The\npresent contribution represents a step in the upscaling process from\nparticle-scale simulations toward large-scale applications involving complex\nflow geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 10:37:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2016 17:32:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2016 12:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-08"}

Therefore, we can ask: is disc fragmentation a hierarchical\nprocess? Or, can a disc fragment go on to produce its own self-gravitating\ncircumfragmentary disc that produces daughter fragments?\n  We investigate this using a set of nested 1D self-gravitating disc models. We\ncalculate the radial structure of a marginally stable, self-gravitating\ncircumstellar disc, and compute its propensity to fragmentation. We use this\ndata to construct the local fragment properties at this radius. For each\ncircumstellar disc model that results in fragmentation, we then compute a\nmarginally stable self-gravitating circumfragmentary disc model.\n  In general, the circumfragmentary discs are geometrically thick and truncated\ninside the Hill radius, and are hence stable against daughter fragmentation.\nThe typical steady-state accretion rate is between 0.1 and 10 percent of the\nlocal circumstellar disc accretion rate. The lifetime of the circumfragmentary\ndiscs' self-gravitating phase is somewhat less than 0.1 Myr, quite comparable\nwith that of the circumstellar disc. We should therefore expect that disc\nfragments will not produce satellites via gravitational instability, but\nequally the self-gravitating phase of circumfragmentary discs is likely to\naffect the properties of satellites subsequently formed via core accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 10:38:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

This paper investigates a different approach: we\nhypothesized that a change in the potassium level may be a harbinger of short\nsurvivability, rather than crossing of absolute boundaries. Our objectives\nwere: (1) to examine if a \"change in mean\" indicator has the ability to\ndistinguish between survivors and non-survivors of MI hospitalization, and if\nso, (2) to formulate a framework for detecting life-threatening changes in\npotassium level of patients hospitalized with MI. The study included 195\npatients who were hospitalized for MI from 2002 to 2014, with at least 40\npotassium measurements (i.e., severely ill). In a retrospective analysis we\nfound evidence that the \"change in mean\" criterion significantly discriminated\nbetween survivors and non-survivors. A threshold for raising an alarm was\nspecified by plotting an ROC curve and choosing the value that yields the best\ncombination of sensitivity and specificity. In this case, the method detected\n~80% of the patients that eventually died, while wrongly alerting for only ~40%\nof the survivors. The proposed approach is not intended for replacing the\nabsolute-level protocols but to add valuable knowledge to cardiologists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 10:49:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

Previous work on collective sensing shows that gregarious\nindividuals obtain an evolutionary advantage by exploiting collective sensing\nwhen competing against solitary individuals. This work addresses the question\nof whether collective sensing allows for the emergence of groups from a\npopulation of individuals without predetermined behaviors. It is assumed that\ngroup membership does not lessen competition on the limited resources in the\nenvironment, e.g. groups do not improve foraging efficiency. Experiments are\nrun in an agent-based evolutionary model of a foraging task, where the fitness\nof the agents depends on their foraging strategy. The foraging strategy of\nagents is determined by a neural network, which does not require explicit\nmodeling of the environment and of the interactions between agents. Experiments\ndemonstrate that gregarious behavior is not the evolutionary-fittest strategy\nif resources are abundant, thus invalidating previous findings in a specific\nregion of the parameter space. In other words, resource scarcity makes\ngregarious behavior so valuable as to make up for the increased competition\nover the few available resources. Furthermore, it is shown that a population of\nsolitary agents can evolve gregarious behavior in response to a sudden scarcity\nof resources, thus individuating a possible mechanism that leads to gregarious\nbehavior in nature. The evolutionary process operates on the whole parameter\nspace of the neural networks, hence these behaviors are selected among an\nunconstrained set of behavioral models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 11:33:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 10:20:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Feb 2018 15:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-24"}

It was shown that the Dirac magnon\nHamiltonian preserves time-reversal symmetry defined with the sublattice pseudo\nspins and the Dirac points are robust against magnon-magnon interactions. The\nDirac points also occur at nonzero energy. In this paper, we propose a simple\nrealization of nontrivial topology (magnon edge states) in this system.

A suitable example is parasite spreading:\nseveral parasites may be transmitted among their hosts through different\nmechanisms, each one giving rise to a network of interactions. Modelling these\nnetworked, ecological interactions at the same time is still an open challenge.\nWe present a novel spatially-embedded multiplex network framework for modelling\nmulti-host infection spreading through multiple routes of transmission. Our\nmodel is inspired by T. cruzi, a parasite transmitted by trophic and vectorial\nmechanisms. Our ecological network model is represented by a multiplex in which\nnodes represent species populations interacting through a food web and a\nparasite contaminative layer at the same time. We modelled an SI dynamics in\ntwo different scenarios: a simple theoretical food web and an empirical one.\nOur simulations in both scenarios show that the infection is more widespread\nwhen both the trophic and the contaminative interactions are considered with\nequal rates. This indicates that trophic and contaminative transmission may\nhave additive effects in real ecosystems. We also find that the ratio of\nvectors-to-host in the community (i) crucially influences the infection spread,\n(ii) regulates a percolating phase transition in the rate of parasite\ntransmission and (iii) increases the infection rate in hosts. By immunising the\nsame fractions of predator and prey populations, we show that the multiplex\ntopology is fundamental in outlining the role that each host species plays in\nparasite transmission in a given ecosystem. We also show that the multiplex\nmodels provide a richer phenomenology in terms of parasite spreading dynamics\ncompared to mono-layer models.

ALM, which is in essence an adaptive fuzzy learning method, models\na Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) system with several Single-Input\nSingle-Output (SISO) subsystems. Ink Drop Spread (IDS) operator, which is the\nmain processing engine of this method, extracts useful features from the data\nwithout complicated computations and provides stability and convergence as\nwell. Despite great performance of ALM in applications such as classification,\nclustering, and modelling, an efficient hardware implementation has remained a\nchallenging problem. Large amount of memory required to store the information\nof IDS planes as well as the high computational cost of the IDS computing\nsystem are two main barriers to ALM becoming more popular. In this paper, a\nnovel learning method is proposed based on the idea of IDS, but with a novel\napproach that eliminates the computational cost of IDS operator. Unlike\ntraditional approaches, our proposed method finds functions to describe the IDS\nplane that eliminates the need for large amount of memory to a great extent.\nNarrow Path and Spread, which are two main features used in the inference\nengine of ALM, are then extracted from IDS planes with minimum amount of memory\nusage and power consumption. Our proposed algorithm is fully compatible with\nmemristor-crossbar implementation that leads to a significant decrease in the\nnumber of required memristors (from O(n^2) to O(3n)).

The\ninhomogeneity arises as the combined effect of $(i)$ the initial conditions for\nisocurvature fields (obtained after a fast-roll stage finishing many\n$e$-foldings before cosmological scales exit the horizon), $(ii)$ their\ninflationary fluctuations and $(iii)$ their coupling to other degrees of\nfreedom. Our case of interest is when these fields (interpreted as the\nprecursors of large-angle anomalies) leave an observable imprint only in\nisolated patches of the Universe. When the latter intersect the last scattering\nsurface, such imprints arise in the CMB. Nevertheless, due to their\nstatistically inhomogeneous nature, these imprints are difficult to detect, for\nthey become hidden in the background similarly to the Cold Spot. We then\ncompute the probability that a single isocurvature field becomes inhomogeneous\nat the end of inflation and find that, if the appropriate conditions are given\n(which depend exclusively on the preexisting fast-roll stage), this probability\nis at the percent level.

However, their\nphysical status in literature are quite different. On the one hand, the second\nKelvin's relation is associated with the microscopic reversibility, considered\nas a fundamental thermodynamical property. On the other hand, the first\nKelvin's relation is traditionally introduced only as a convenient mathematical\nrelation between Seebeck and Thomson coefficients. In the present article, we\nstress that, contrary to common believes, this relation may demonstrates deeper\ninsights than a bold mathematical expression between thermoelectric\ncoefficients. It actually reflects the coexistence of two different mechanisms\ntaking place inside thermoelectric systems: Energy conversion and\nreorganization of heat flow when Seebeck coefficient varies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2016 18:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

However, RCTs cannot always be\napplied for practical or ethical reasons. To investigate the current practices\nin rare diseases, we review evaluations of therapeutic interventions in\npaediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). In\nparticular, we shed light on the endpoints used, the study designs implemented\nand the statistical methodologies applied.\n  METHODS: We conducted literature searches to identify relevant primary\nstudies. Data on study design, objectives, endpoints, patient characteristics,\nrandomization and masking, type of intervention, control, withdrawals and\nstatistical methodology were extracted from the selected studies. The risk of\nbias and the quality of the studies were assessed.\n  RESULTS: Twelve (seven) primary studies on paediatric MS (CJD) were included\nin the qualitative synthesis. No double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled\ntrial for evaluating interventions in paediatric MS has been published yet.\nEvidence from one open-label RCT is available. The observational studies are\nbefore-after studies or controlled studies. Three of the seven selected studies\non CJD are RCTs, of which two received the maximum mark on the Oxford Quality\nScale. Four trials are controlled observational studies.\n  CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from double-blind RCTs on the efficacy of treatments\nappears to be variable between rare diseases. With regard to paediatric\nconditions it remains to be seen what impact regulators will have through e.g.,\npaediatric investigation plans. Overall, there is space for improvement by\nusing innovative trial designs and data analysis techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2016 16:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-25"}

The structured matrix is obtained as the\nlifting of the multi-shot data. The smooth phase-modulations between shots\nmanifest as null-space vectors of this matrix, which implies that the\nstructured matrix is low-rank. The missing entries of the structured matrix are\nfilled in using a nuclear-norm minimization algorithm subject to the\ndata-consistency. The formulation enables the natural introduction of\nsmoothness regularization, thus enabling implicit motion-compensated recovery\nof fully-sampled as well as under-sampled MS-DW data.\n  Results: Our experiments on in-vivo data show effective removal of the\nghosting artifacts arising from intershot motion in MS-DW data using the\nproposed method.

It is often the case, however,\nthat discrete-time approaches are employed to analyze such models or to\nsimulate them numerically. In such cases, time is discretized into uniform\nsteps and transition rates between states are replaced by transition\nprobabilities. In this paper, we illustrate potential limitations to this\napproach. We show how discretizing time leads to a restriction on the values of\nthe model parameters that can accurately be studied. We examine numerical\nsimulation schemes employed in the literature, showing how synchronous-type\nupdating schemes can bias discrete-time formalisms when compared against\ncontinuous-time formalisms. Event-based simulations, such as the Gillespie\nalgorithm, are proposed as optimal simulation schemes both in terms of\nreplicating the continuous-time process and computational speed.
