To overcome this situation, query expansion techniques aim at\ntransforming the user request by adding new terms, referred as expansion\nfeatures, that better describe the real intent of the users. We propose a\nmethod that relies exclusively on relevant structures (as opposed to the use of\nsemantics) found in knowledge bases (KBs) to extract the expansion features. We\ncall our method Structural Query Expansion (SQE). The structural analysis of\nKBs takes us to propose a set of structural motifs that connect their strongly\nrelated entries, which can be used to extract expansion features. In this paper\nwe use Wikipedia as our KB, which is probably one of the largest sources of\ninformation. SQE is capable of achieving more than 150% improvement over non\nexpanded queries and is able to identify the expansion features in less than\n0.2 seconds in the worst case scenario. Most significantly, we believe that we\nare contributing to open new research directions in query expansion, proposing\na method that is orthogonal to many current systems. For example, SQE improves\npseudo-relevance feedback techniques up to 13%\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 16:09:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 10:00:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-13"}

The\nfresh item is that the well-known asymptotically flat solutions of the\nEinstein-Maxwell theory are transformed to a new coordinate system with\nsurprising and (seemingly) inexplicable results. We begin with the standard\ndescription of (Null) Asymptotically Flat Space-Times described in conventional\nBondi-coordinates. After transforming the variables (mainly the asymptotic Weyl\ntensor components) to a very special set of NU (Newman-Unti) coordinates, we\nfind a series of relations totally mimicking standard Newtonian classical\nmechanics and Maxwell theory. The surprising and troubling aspect of these\nrelations is that the associated motion and radiation does not take place in\nphysical space-time. Instead these relations takes place in an unusual\ninherited complex four-dimensional manifold referred to as H-Space that has no\nimmediate relationship with space-time.

In zero field, GdPtBi is a zero-gap semiconductor with\nquadratic bands. In a magnetic field, the Zeeman energy leads to Weyl nodes.

The impacts of climate extremes\non forest productivity and health are complicated by potential interactions\nwith disturbance events and stand dynamics. The effects of stand dynamics on\nforest responses to climate and disturbance are particularly important given\nforest characteristics driven by stand dynamics can be modified through forest\nmanagement with the goal of increasing forest resistance and resilience to\nclimate change. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian state-space model allowing\nclimate effects on tree growth to vary over time and in relation to climate\nextremes, disturbance events, and stand dynamics. We apply the model to a\ndendrochronology dataset comprising measurements from forest stands of varying\ncomposition, structure, and development stage in northeastern Minnesota.\nResults indicate average forest growth was most sensitive to variables\ndescribing climatic water deficit. Forest growth responses to water deficit\nwere partitioned into responses driven by climatic threshold exceedances and\ninteractions with forest tent caterpillar defoliation. Forest growth was both\nresistant and resilient to climate extremes with the majority of forest growth\nresponses occurring after multiple climatic threshold exceedances or insect\ndefoliation events. Forest growth was most sensitive to water deficit during\nperiods of high stem density following major regeneration events when average\ninter-tree competition was high. Results suggest that forest growth resistance\nand resilience to interactions between climate extremes and insect defoliation\ncan be increased through management steps such as thinning to reduce\ncompetition during early stages of stand development and small-group selection\nharvests to maintain forest structures characteristic of older, mature stands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 16:42:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2016 20:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-05"}

In order to better understand the\norigin of these currents and their role in M- and X-class flares, I review all\nactive-region observations made with SDO/HMI and SDO/AIA from 2010/05 through\n2014/10 within approximately 40 degrees from disk center. I select the roughly\n4% of all regions that display a distinctly nonpotential coronal configuration\nin loops with a length comparable to the scale of the active region, and all\nthat emit GOES X-class flares. The data for 41 regions confirm, with a single\nexception, that strong-field, high-gradient polarity inversion lines (SHILs)\ncreated during emergence of magnetic flux into, and related displacement\nwithin, pre-existing active regions are associated with X-class flares. Obvious\nnonpotentiality in the active region-scale loops occurs in 6 of 10 selected\nregions with X-class flares, all with relatively long SHILs along their primary\npolarity inversion line, or with a long internal filament there.\nNonpotentiality can exist in active regions well past the flux-emergence phase,\noften with reduced or absent flaring. I conclude that the dynamics of the flux\ninvolved in the compact SHILs is of preeminent importance for the large-flare\npotential of active regions within the next day, but that their associated\ncurrents may not reveal themselves in active region-scale nonpotentiality. In\ncontrast, active region-scale nonpotentiality, which can persist for many days,\nmay inform us about the eruption potential other than those from SHILs which is\nalmost never associated with X-class flaring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 17:43:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

Recently, the introduction of residual connections in\nconjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art\nperformance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the\nlatest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question of whether\nthere are any benefit in combining the Inception architecture with residual\nconnections.

With this prospect in mind, we scrutinize the gamma-ray\nemission from this source, finding that it prefers a spatially extended profile\nover that of a single point-like source with 5.1 sigma statistical\nsignificance.

The ratio of the low-temperature energy\ngap to the critical temperature explicitly violates the predictions of the BCS\ntheory: $2\\Delta\\left(0\\right)/k_{B}T_{C}\\in\\left<4.84,5.85\\right>$.\nAdditionally, the free energy difference between the superconducting and normal\nstate, the thermodynamic critical field, and the specific heat of the\nsuperconducting state have been determined. Due to the significant\nstrong-coupling and retardation effects those quantities cannot be correctly\ndescribed in the framework of the BCS theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 23:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

We\nstudy the possibilities and limitations of such mechanisms using tools from\ndifferential privacy. We begin by designing a private one-shot wagering\nmechanism in which bettors specify a belief about the likelihood of a future\nevent and a corresponding monetary wager. Wagers are redistributed among\nbettors in a way that more highly rewards those with accurate predictions. We\nprovide a class of wagering mechanisms that are guaranteed to satisfy\ntruthfulness, budget balance in expectation, and other desirable properties\nwhile additionally guaranteeing epsilon-joint differential privacy in the\nbettors' reported beliefs, and analyze the trade-off between the achievable\nlevel of privacy and the sensitivity of a bettor's payment to her own report.\nWe then ask whether it is possible to obtain privacy in dynamic prediction\nmarkets, focusing our attention on the popular cost-function framework in which\nsecurities with payments linked to future events are bought and sold by an\nautomated market maker.

New theoretical results\ndemonstrate the order-optimality of KRR and the existing RAPPOR mechanism at\ndifferent privacy regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 03:48:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 19:08:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 18:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-16"}

The dynamics of the model is defined by a simple\nmatrix, M. Each row of M corresponds to a macrostate of the system, e.g. net\nalignment, while the elements in the row represent microstates. The constant\nnumber of elements in each row ensures constant entropy, which allows\nreversible fluctuations, similar to information theory where a constant number\nof bits allows reversible computations. Many elements in M come from the\nmicrostates of the system, but many others come from the bath. Bypassing the\nbath states yields fluctuations that exhibit standard white noise; whereas with\nbath states the power spectral density varies as S(f)~1/f over a wide range of\nfrequencies, f. Thus, the explicit entropy bath is the mechanism of 1/f noise\nin this model.

To\ncharacterize a certain (globally) stable behavior for such a class of systems,\nthe stochastic asymptotic weak stability is proposed in this paper which\nsuggests the transition measure of the state to be convergent and the\nergodicity. By defining stochastic weak passivity that admits stochastic\npassivity only outside a ball centered around the desired state but not in the\nwhole state space, we develop stochastic weak passivity theorems to ensure that\nthe stochastic systems with nonvanishing noise can be globally\\locally\nstabilized in weak sense through negative feedback law.

Despite negatively-charged nitrogen-vacancy\n(NV$^-$) centres being discussed as a potential laser medium since the 1980's,\nthere have been no definitive observations of stimulated emission from\nensembles of NV$^-$ to date. Reasons for this lack of demonstration include the\nshort excited state lifetime and the occurrence of photo-ionisation to the\nneutral charge state by light around the zero-phonon line. Here we show both\ntheoretical and experimental evidence for stimulated emission from NV$^-$\nstates using light in the phonon-sidebands. Our system uses a continuous wave\npump laser at 532 nm and a pulsed stimulating laser that is swept across the\nphononic sidebands of the NV$^-$. Optimal stimulated emission is demonstrated\nin the vicinity of the three-phonon line at 700 nm. Furthermore, we show the\ntransition from stimulated emission to photoionisation as the stimulating laser\nwavelength is reduced from 700nm to 620 nm. While lasing at the zero-phonon\nline is suppressed by ionisation, our results open the possibility of diamond\nlasers based on NV centres, tuneable over the phonon-sideband. This broadens\nthe applications of NV magnetometers from single centre nanoscale sensors to a\nnew generation of ultra-precise ensemble laser sensors, which exploit the\ncontrast and signal amplification of a lasing system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 07:09:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

Mainly three particular profiles are considered: the Rayleigh limit,\nquasi-Keplerian, and solid-body rotation. In each case we begin by computing\nlinear instability curves and their dependence on the magnetic Prandtl number\nPm. For the azimuthal wavenumber m=1 modes, the instability curves always scale\nwith the Reynolds number and the Hartmann number. For sufficiently small Pm\nthese modes therefore only become unstable for magnetic Mach numbers less than\nunity, and are thus not relevant for most astrophysical applications. However,\nmodes with m>10 can behave very differently. For sufficiently flat profiles,\nthey scale with the magnetic Reynolds number and the Lundquist number, thereby\nallowing instability also for the large magnetic Mach numbers of astrophysical\nobjects. We further compute fully nonlinear, three-dimensional equilibration of\nthese instabilities, and investigate how the energy is distributed among the\nazimuthal (m) and axial (k) wavenumbers. In comparison spectra become steeper\nfor large m, reflecting the smoothing action of shear. On the other hand\nkinetic and magnetic energy spectra exhibit similar behavior: if several\nazimuthal modes are already linearly unstable they are relatively flat, but for\nthe rigidly rotating case where m=1 is the only unstable mode they are so steep\nthat neither Kolmogorov nor Iroshnikov-Kraichnan spectra fit the results.

The latter, compared with the standard model, has an extended field\ncontent adopting now an additional $A_4$ symmetry structure (along with the\nstandard model symmetry). As before, the see-saw mechanism can be realized in\nseveral models of different types depending on different ways of neutrino mass\ngeneration corresponding to the introduction of new (heavy in general) fields\nwith different symmetry structures. In the present paper, a general description\nof all these see-saw types is made with a more detailed investigation on type-I\nmodels, while for type-II and type-III models a similar strategy can be\nfollowed. As within the original see-saw mechanism, the symmetry structure of\nthe standard model fields decides the number and the symmetry structure of the\nnew fields. In a model considered here, the scalar sector consists of three\nstandard-model-Higgs-like iso-doublets ($SU_L(2)$-doublets) forming together an\n$A_4$-triplet, and three iso-singlets transforming as three singlets (1,$1^{'}$\nand $1^{''}$) of $A_4$. In the lepton sector, the three left-handed lepton\niso-doublets form an $A_4$-triplet, while the three right-handed charged\nleptons are either $A_4$-singlets in one version of the model, or components of\nan $A_4$-triplet in another version. To generate neutrino masses through, say,\nthe type-I see-saw mechanism, it is natural to add four right-handed neutrino\nmultiplets, including one $A_4$-triplet and three $A_4$-singlets. For an\ninterpretation, the model is applied to deriving some physics quantities such\nas neutrinoless double beta decay effective mass $|\\langle m_{ee}\\rangle|$, CP\nviolation phase $\\delta_{CP}$ and Jarlskog parameter $J_{CP}$, which can be\nverified experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 08:58:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 07:59:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 01:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-14"}

It achieves scalability through 3-Dimensional\nDiscrete Wavelet Transform (3-D DWT) and better compression ratio by exploiting\nthe inherent sparsity of the high-frequency wavelet sub-bands through CS. By\nusing 3-D DWT and a proposed adaptive measurement scheme called AMS at the\nencoder, one can succeed in improving the compression ratio and reducing the\ncomplexity of the decoder. The proposed video codec uses only 7% of the total\nnumber of multipliers needed in a conventional CS-based video coding system. A\ncodebook of Bernoulli matrices with different sizes corresponding to the\npredefined sparsity levels is maintained at both the encoder and the decoder.\nBased on the calculated l0-norm of the input vector, one of the sixteen\npossible Bernoulli matrices will be selected for taking the CS measurements and\nits index will be transmitted along with the measurements. Based on this index,\nthe corresponding Bernoulli matrix has been used in CS reconstruction algorithm\nto get back the high-frequency wavelet sub-bands at the decoder.

Just\nafter the particle production, when the Higgs field is going away from the ESP,\nthese gauge bosons gain mass and decay or annihilate into Standard Model (SM)\nfermions. Left-handed neutrinos can be generated in that way. If one assumes\nthe see-saw mechanism, the mass matrix of a pair of left and right-handed\nneutrinos is non-diagonal. Although their mixing in the mass eigenstates is\nnegligible in the true vacuum, it could be significant near the edge of the\nHiggs oscillation, where the off-diagonal component is large. Therefore, the\nleft-handed neutrinos generated from the gauge bosons can start neutrino\noscillation between the right-handed neutrinos. We study the particle\nproduction when such L-R neutrino oscillation is significant. For a working\nexample, the non-thermal leptogenesis scenario after Higgs inflation is\nexamined, which cannot be realized without the L-R neutrino oscillation.

The main bottlenecks lie in the construction of\nthe potential energy surface and in the size of the excitation space in the\nvibrational configuration interaction (VCI) calculations. To address these\nchallanges, we use localized-mode coordinates to construct potential energy\nsurfaces and perform vibrational self-consistent field (L-VSCF) and L-VCI\ncalculations [P. T. Panek, Ch. R. Jacob, ChemPhysChem 15, 3365 (2014)] for all\nvibrational modes of two prototypical test cases, the ethene and furan\nmolecules. We find that the mutual coupling between modes is reduced when\nswitching from normal-mode coordinates to localized-mode coordinates. When\nusing such localized-mode coordinates, we observe a faster convergence of the\n$n$-mode expansion of the potential energy surface. This makes it possible to\nneglect higher-order contributions in the $n$-mode expansion of the potential\nenergy surface or to approximate higher-oder contributions in hybrid potential\nenergy surfaces, which reduced the computational effort for the construction of\nthe anharmonic potential energy surface significantly. Moreover, we find that\nwhen using localized-mode coordinates, the convergence with respect to the VCI\nexcitation space proceeds more smoothly and that the error at low orders is\nreduced significantly. This makes it possible to devise low-cost models for\nobtaining a first approximation of anharmonic corrections.

Among the emission lines, HeII 4686 attains\na flux in excess of Hgamma, the full set of OIII and NIII lines involved in the\nBowen fluorescence mechanism are strong and varying in intensity in phase with\nHeII 4686, and OIV and [NeV] are present. A large increase in the radiation\noutput from the hot source is reponsible for a large expansion in the ionized\nfraction of the M giant wind. The wind is completely ionized in the direction\nto the observer. A high electron density is supported by the weakness of\nforbidden lines and by the large amplitude and short time scale of the\nreprocessing by the nebular material of the highly variable photo-ionization\ninput from the hot source. During the super-active state the nebula is varying\nto and from ionization-bounded and density-bounded conditions, and the\naugmented irradiation of the cool giant has changed the spectral type of its\nside facing the hot source from M3III to M2III, i.e. an increase of ~80 K in\neffective temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 11:31:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

While every\nfast radio burst has a dispersion measurement, none before now have had a\nredshift measurement, due to the difficulty in pinpointing their celestial\ncoordinates. Here we present the discovery of a fast radio burst and the\nidentification of a fading radio transient lasting $\\sim 6$ days after the\nevent, which we use to identify the host galaxy; we measure the galaxy's\nredshift to be $z=0.492\\pm0.008$.

The $\\sim6$-day transient is largely consistent with a short\ngamma-ray burst radio afterglow, and its existence and timescale do not support\nprogenitor models such as giant pulses from pulsars, and supernovae. This\ncontrasts with the interpretation of another recently discovered fast radio\nburst, suggesting there are at least two classes of bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 12:29:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-26"}

Active\nlearning works by selecting the most informative sample among unlabeled data\nand querying the label of that point from user. Many different methods such as\nuncertainty sampling and minimum risk sampling have been utilized to select the\nmost informative sample in active learning.

We also discuss the implications of such measurements\nboth for improved precision measurements of Newton's constant and for a new\ngeneration of experiments at the interface between quantum physics and gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 14:57:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 20:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-31"}

In specific, the\nhyperfine masses of the color-spin interaction are calculated for the possible\nstates in spin-0, spin-1, spin-2 channels. The two states in spin-0 channel as\nwell as the two states in spin-1 channel are diagonalized in order to generate\nthe physical hyperfine masses. By matching the difference in hyperfine masses\nwith the splitting in corresponding hadron masses and using the $X(3872)$ mass\nas an input, we estimate the masses corresponding to the states $J^{PC}=0^{++},\n1^{+-},2^{++}$. We find the masses of two states in $1^{+-}$ are close to those\nof $X(3823)$, $X(3900)$, and the mass of the $2^{++}$ state is close to that of\n$X(3940)$. For them, the discrepancies are about $\\sim 10$ MeV. This may\nsuggest that the quantum numbers of the controversial states are\n$X(3823)=1^{+-}, X(3900)=1^{+-}, X(3940)=2^{++}$. In this work, we use the same\ninputs parameters, the constituent quark masses and the strength of the\ncolor-spin interaction, that have been adopted in the previous work on the $D$\nor $B$-meson excited states. There, it was shown that the four-quark structure\ncan be manifested in their excited states. Thus, our results in this work\nprovide a consistent treatment on open- and hidden-charm mesons as far as the\nfour-quark model is concerned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 14:58:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 09:09:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 10:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

We posit a principal who controls the flow of information\nfrom agents that came before, and strives to coordinate the agents towards a\nsocially optimal balance between exploration and exploitation, not using any\nmonetary transfers. The goal is to design a recommendation policy for the\nprincipal which respects agents' incentives and minimizes a suitable notion of\nregret.\n  We extend prior work in this direction to allow the agents to interact with\none another in a shared environment: at each time step, multiple agents arrive\nto play a Bayesian game, receive recommendations, choose their actions, receive\ntheir payoffs, and then leave the game forever. The agents now face two sources\nof uncertainty: the actions of the other agents and the parameters of the\nuncertain game environment.\n  Our main contribution is to show that the principal can achieve constant\nregret when the utilities are deterministic (where the constant depends on the\nprior distribution, but not on the time horizon), and logarithmic regret when\nthe utilities are stochastic. As a key technical tool, we introduce the concept\nof explorable actions, the actions which some incentive-compatible policy can\nrecommend with non-zero probability.

All of these efforts are both motivated and made more effective by\nthe collection and presentation of data on the presence, persistence, and\npromise of women in physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 02:20:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-28"}

With\ninput about 20-second accented speech, this system achieves classification rate\nof 51% on a 7-way classification system focusing on the major types of accents\nin English, which is competitive to the state-of-the-art results in this field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 02:50:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-28"}
