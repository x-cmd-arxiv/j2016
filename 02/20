We consider a version\nformulated for complete, asymptotically Poincar\\'e-Einstein Riemannian metrics\n$(M,g)$ with bounded scalar curvature $R\\ge -n(n-1)$. This version then asserts\nthat any such $(M,g)$ must have mass not less than the mass $m_0$ of a metric\n$g_0$ induced on a time-symmetric slice of a certain AdS soliton spacetime. The\nconjecture remains unproved, having so far resisted standard techniques. Little\nis known other than that the conjecture is true for metrics which are\nsufficiently small perturbations of $g_0$. We pose another test for the\nconjecture. We assume its validity and attempt to prove as a corollary the\ncorresponding scalar curvature rigidity statement, that $g_0$ is the unique\nasymptotically Poincar\\'e-Einstein metric with mass $m=m_0$ obeying $R\\ge\n-n(n-1)$. Were a second such metric $g_1$ not isometric to $g_0$ to exist, it\nthen may well admit perturbations of lower mass, contradicting the assumed\nvalidity of the conjecture. We find that the minimum mass metric must be static\nEinstein, so the problem is reduced to that of static uniqueness. When $n=3$\nthe manifold is isometric to a time-symmetric slice of an AdS soliton\nspacetime, unless it has a non-compact horizon. En route we study the mass\naspect, obtaining and generalizing known results. The mass aspect is (i)\nrelated to the holographic energy density, (ii) a weighted invariant under\nboundary conformal transformations when the bulk dimension is odd, and (iii)\nzero for negative Einstein manifolds with Einstein conformal boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2016 16:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 06:41:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-02"}

In this paper, we apply the concept of spatial\ncoupling to CBs to improve the performance of the original CBs and analyze the\nperformance of the resulting spatially-coupled CBs (SC-CBs). We introduce an\nequivalent bipartite graph representation of CBs with identical\niteration-by-iteration finite-length and asymptotic performance. Based on this\nequivalent representation, we then analyze the asymptotic performance of\nsingle-layer CBs and SC-CBs under the MP decoding algorithm proposed by Lu et\nal.. In particular, we derive the potential threshold of the uncoupled system\nand show that it is equal to the area threshold. We also derive the Maxwell\ndecoder for CBs and prove that the potential threshold is an upper bound on the\nMaxwell decoding threshold. We show that the area under the extended MP\nextrinsic information transfer curve is equal to zero precisely at the area\nthreshold. This, combined with the analysis of the Maxwell decoder and\nsimulation results, leads us to the conjecture that the potential threshold is\nequal to the Maxwell decoding threshold and hence a lower bound on the maximum\na posteriori decoding threshold. Interestingly, SC-CBs do not show the\nwell-known phenomenon of threshold saturation of the MP decoding threshold to\nthe potential threshold characteristic of spatially-coupled low-density\nparity-check codes and other coupled systems. However, SC-CBs yield better MP\ndecoding thresholds than their uncoupled counterparts.

While in the traditional compressive\nsensing (CS) framework, the goal is to recover the complete sparse signal, in\nsparse signal detection, complete signal recovery may not be necessary to make\na reliable detection decision. In particular, detection can be performed based\non partially or inaccurately estimated signals which requires less\ncomputational burden than that is required for complete signal recovery. To\nthat end, we investigate the problem of sparse signal detection based on\npartially estimated support set. First, we discuss how to determine the minimum\nfraction of the support set to be known so that a desired detection performance\nis achieved in a centralized setting. Second, we develop two distributed\nalgorithms for sparse signal detection when the raw compressed observations are\nnot available at the central fusion center. In these algorithms, the final\ndecision statistic is computed based on locally estimated partial support sets\nvia orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) at individual nodes.

Positive-ion-mode proton transfer, chemical fragmentation from a\nmicro-discharge, and NO+ adducts combine to allow broad chemical sensitivity.\nWe analyze noise properties of the ion source and report chemical responsivity\nfor a wide range of volatile organic compounds.

Our model\nutilizes physically motivated analytic fits to 1D radiative transfer\nsimulations of HII regions around dark matter halos in a representative cosmic\nvolume. Constraining our simulations with observed and extrapolated UV\nluminosity functions of high redshift galaxies, we find that for a fixed halo\nmass, stellar populations forming in bursty models produce larger HII regions\nwhich leave behind long-lived relic HII regions which are able to maintain\npartial ionization in the intergalactic medium (IGM) in a manner similar to an\nearly X-ray background. The overall effect is a significant increase in the\noptical depth of the IGM, $\\tau_e$, and a milder increase of the redshift of\nreionization. To produce $\\tau_e =0.066$ observed by Planck and complete\nreionization by redshift $z_{\\rm re}\\sim 6$, models with bursty SF require an\nescape fraction $f_{\\rm esc}\\sim 2\\%-10\\%$ that is 2-10 times lower than\n$f_{\\rm esc}\\sim 17\\%$ found assuming continuous SF and is consistent with\nupper limits on $f_{\\rm esc}$ from observations at $z=0$ and $z\\sim 1.3-6$.

In most cases,\nthe width of such filters is broad compared to typical line widths, and the\nthroughput of the filters varies substantially within the bandpass. This leads\nto substantial uncertainties in redshifts and fluxes that are derived from the\nobservations with one specific NB. In this work we demonstrate that the\nuncertainty in measured line parameters can be sharply reduced by using\nrepeated observations of the same target field with filters that have slightly\ndifferent transmittance curves. Such data are routinely collected with some\nlarge field imaging cameras that use multiple detectors and a separate filter\nfor each of the detectors. An example is the NB118 data from ESO's VISTA\nInfraRed CAMera (VIRCAM). We carefully developed and characterized this method\nto determine more accurate redshift and line flux estimates from the ratio of\napparent fluxes measured from observations in different narrowband filters and\nseveral matching broadband filters. Then, we tested the obtainable quality of\nparameter estimation both on simulated and actual observations for the example\nof Ha in the VIRCAM NB118 filters combined with broadband data in Y, J, H. We\nfind that by using this method, the errors in the measured lines fluxes can be\nreduced up to almost an order of magnitude and that an accuracy in wavelength\nof better than 1nm can be achieved with the ~13nm wide NB118 filters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2016 21:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-18"}

Slow\nretrograde precession of the line-of-nodes results in a signal---the negative\nsuperhump---with a period slightly less than the orbital period. Previous\nstudies have shown that tilted disks exhibit negative superhumps, but a\nconsensus on how a disk initially tilts has not been reached. Analytical work\nby Lai suggests that a magnetic field on the primary can lead to a tilt\ninstability in a disk when the dipole moment is offset in angle from the spin\naxis of the primary and when the primary's spin axis is, itself, not aligned\nwith the angular momentum axis of the binary orbit. However, Lai did not apply\nhis work to the formation of negative superhumps. In this paper, we add Lai's\nmodel to an existing smoothed particle hydrodynamics code. Using this code, we\ndemonstrate the emergence of negative superhumps in the \"light curve\" for a\nrange of magnetic dipole moments. We show that the period deficits calculated\nfrom these negative superhumps match those in simulations using manually tilted\ndisks. When positive superhumps appear ($q \\lesssim 0.33$), we show that the\nperiod excesses calculated from these signals are also consistent with previous\nresults. Using examples, we show that the disks are tilted, though the tilt\nvaries periodically, and that they precess in the retrograde direction. The\nmagnetic fields found to lead to the emergence of negative superhumps lie in\nthe kilogauss regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2016 21:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

A straightforward addition of DBOC to BO PESs in the FSSH method,\nFSSH+D, has been shown to lead to numerically much inferior results for models\ncontaining conical intersections. More sophisticated variation of the DBOC\ninclusion, phase-space surface-hopping (PSSH) was more successful than FSSH+D\nbut on model problems without conical intersections. This work comprehensively\nassesses the role of DBOC in nonadiabatic dynamics of two electronic state\nproblems and the performance of FSSH, FSSH+D, and PSSH methods in variety of\none- and two-dimensional models. Our results show that the inclusion of DBOC\ncan enhance the accuracy of surface hopping simulations when two conditions are\nsimultaneously satisfied: 1) nuclei have kinetic energy lower than DBOC and 2)\nPESs are not strongly nonadiabatically coupled. The inclusion of DBOC is\ndetrimental in situations where its energy scale becomes very high or even\ndiverges, because in these regions PESs are also very strongly coupled. In this\ncase, the true quantum formalism heavily relies on an interplay between\ndiagonal and off-diagonal nonadiabatic couplings while surface hopping\napproaches treat diagonal terms as PESs and off-diagonal ones stochastically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2016 22:07:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 16:05:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-02"}

Based on the SMA CO observations, we discover clear and\nlarge systematic velocity gradients, perpendicular to the jet axis, in the\nblueshifted and redshifted bullets. After discussing several alternative\ninterpretations, such as twin-jets, jet precession, warped disk, and internal\nhelical shock, we suggest that the systematic velocity gradients observed in\nthe bullets result from the rotation of the SVS13A jet. From the SMA CO images,\nthe measured rotation velocities are 11.7-13.7 km/s for the blueshifted bullet\nand 4.7+/-0.5 km/s for the redshifted bullet. The estimated specific angular\nmomenta of the two bullets are comparable to those of dense cores, about 10\ntimes larger than those of protostellar envelopes, and about 20 times larger\nthan those of circumstellar disks. If the velocity gradients are due to the\nrotation of the SVS13A jet, the significant amount of specific angular momenta\nof the bullets indicates that the rotation of jets/outflows is a key mechanism\nto resolve the so-called 'angular momentum problem' in the field of star\nformation.

The abstract nature of the laws of physics and the chain of\nreasoning required to draw meaningful inferences makes these issues critical.\nIn order to help students, it is crucial to consider the difficulty of a\nproblem from the perspective of students. We are developing and evaluating\ninteractive problem-solving tutorials to help students in the introductory\nphysics courses learn effective problem-solving strategies while solidifying\nphysics concepts. The self-paced tutorials can provide guidance and support for\na variety of problem solving techniques, and opportunity for knowledge and\nskill acquisition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2016 01:14:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

The competition emerges when positive\nshort-range interactions of strength $K$ arranged in a linear chain tend to\nestablish an anti-parallel spin order, whereas negative long-range interactions\n$-J$ tend to align them in parallel. Thus, no ferromagnetic order exists for\n$K/J > 0.25$. So, the phase-diagrams were scanned by varying the values of $K$\nin this interval. As in other similar study done for the spin-1 case, the\nsecond-order frontier separating the ferromagnetic and the paramagnetic phases\nis transformed gradually into a first-order line, when $K/J$ is greater than a\ncertain critical value.

The stacked loops are\nsharply bent, implying that they are greatly impacted by the magnetic tension\nforce. When another more reconnection process takes place, one new loop is\nformed and stacks with the previously formed ones. Meanwhile, the stacked loops\nretract suddenly and move toward the balance position, performing an overshoot\nmovement, which led to an oscillation with an average period of about 45 s. The\noscillation of newly formed loops after magnetic reconnection in the\nchromosphere is observed for the first time. We suggest that the stability of\nthe stacked loops is destroyed due to the join of the last new loop and then\nsuddenly retract under the effect of magnetic tension. Because of the\nretraction, another lower loop is pushed outward and performs an oscillation\nwith the period of about 25 s.

While changes in total, spectrally-integrated, solar\nirradiance lead to small variations in global mean surface temperature, the\n`top-down' UV effect preferentially influences on regional scales at\nmid-to-high latitudes with, in particular, a solar signal noted in the North\nAtlantic Oscillation (NAO). The amplitude of the UV variability is fundamental\nin determining the magnitude of the climate response but understanding of the\nUV variations has been challenged recently by measurements from the SOlar\nRadiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) satellite, which show UV solar cycle\nchanges up to 10 times larger than previously thought.

The end result was that this\nmethod of network optimisation allowed for significantly improved fault\ndetection performance\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2016 14:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

We call the paired problems \"isomorphic\" because they require the\nsame physics principle to solve them. We analyze written responses and\nindividual discussions to a range of isomorphic problems. We examine potential\nfactors that may help or hinder transfer of problem-solving skills from one\nproblem in a pair to the other. For some paired isomorphic problems, one\ncontext often turned out to be easier for students in that it was more often\ncorrectly solved than the other. When quantitative and conceptual questions\nwere paired and given back to back, students who answered both questions in the\nIPP often performed better on the conceptual questions than those who answered\nthe corresponding conceptual questions only. Although students often took\nadvantage of the quantitative counterpart to answer a conceptual question of an\nIPP correctly, when only given the conceptual question, students seldom tried\nto convert it into a quantitative question, solve it and then reason about the\nsolution conceptually. Misconceptions associated with friction in some problems\nwere so robust that pairing them with isomorphic problems not involving\nfriction did not help students discern their underlying similarities.\nAlternatively, from the knowledge in pieces perspective, the activation of the\nknowledge resource related to friction was so strongly and automatically\ntriggered by the context, which is outside the conscious control of the\nstudent, that students did not look for analogies with paired problems or other\naids that may be present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2016 04:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-25"}

It will show how to expand Jaccard distance, which works on\nfinite sets, to potentially-infinite regular languages. The entropy of a\nregular language plays a large role in the extension. Much of the paper is\nspent investigating the entropy of a regular language. This includes addressing\nissues that have required previous authors to rely on the upper limit of\nShannon's traditional formulation of entropy, because its limit does not always\nexist. The paper also includes proposing a new limit based formulation for the\nentropy of a regular language and proves that formulation to both exist and be\nequivalent to Shannon's original formulation (when it exists). Additionally,\nthe proposed formulation is shown to equal an analogous but formally quite\ndifferent notion of topological entropy from Symbolic Dynamics -- consequently\nalso showing Shannon's original formulation to be equivalent to topological\nentropy. Surprisingly, the natural Jaccard-like entropy distance is trivial in\nmost cases. Instead, the {\\it entropy sum} distance metric is suggested, and\nshown to be granular in certain situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2016 21:49:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-26"}
