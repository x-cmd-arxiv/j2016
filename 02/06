To that end we introduce\nthe concept of holomorphic ideal, which allows one to define a blow-up in the\ncategory of smooth manifolds. We then investigate which generalized complex\nsubmanifolds are suitable for blowing up. Two classes naturally appear;\ngeneralized Poisson submanifolds and generalized Poisson transversals,\nsubmanifolds which look complex, respectively symplectic in transverse\ndirections. We show that generalized Poisson submanifolds carry a canonical\nholomorphic ideal and give a necessary and sufficient condition for the\ncorresponding blow-up to be generalized complex. For the generalized Poisson\ntransversals we give a normal form for a neighborhood of the submanifold, and\nuse that to define a generalized complex blow-up, which is up to deformation\nindependent of choices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 16:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

However, ionizing\nradiation therapy is not the only option, as the high-energy photons delivering\ntheir cell-killing radiation energy into cancerous tumor can lead to\nsignificant damage to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor, located throughout\nthe beam's path. Therefore, in nowadays, advances in ionizing radiation therapy\nare competitive to non-ionizing ones, as for example the laser light based\ntherapy, resulting in a synergism that has revolutionized medicine. The use of\nnon-invasive or minimally invasive (e.g. through flexible endoscopes)\ntherapeutic procedures in the management of patients represents a very\ninteresting treatment option. Moreover, as the major breakthrough in cancer\nmanagement is the individualized patient treatment, new biophotonic techniques,\ne.g. photo-activated drug carriers, help the improvement of treatment efficacy\nand/or normal tissue toxicity. Additionally, recent studies support that laser\ntechnology progresses could revolutionize cancer proton therapy, by reducing\nthe cost of the needed installations. The aim of this review is to present some\nlaser-based future objectives for cancer radiation therapy, aiming to address\nthe relevant advances in the ionizing and non-ionizing radiation therapy, i.e.\nprotons and heavy ions therapy, as well as photodynamic targeted and molecular\ntherapies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 16:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-08"}

Previous studies mainly use vector magnetic field data taken for\nevents near the disk center. In this paper, we analyze the magnetic field\nevolution associated with the 2012 October 23 X1.8 flare in NOAA AR 11598 that\nis close to the solar limb, using both the 45 s cadence line-of-sight and 12\nminute cadence vector magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on\nboard Solar Dynamic Observatory. This flare is classified as a circular-ribbon\nflare with spine-fan type magnetic topology containing a null point. In the\nline-of-sight magnetograms, there are two apparent polarity inversion lines\n(PIL). The PIL closer to the limb is affected more by the projection effect.\nBetween these two PILs there lie positive polarity magnetic fields, which are\nsurrounded by negative polarity fields outside the PILs. We find that after the\nflare, both the apparent limb-ward and disk-ward negative fluxes decrease,\nwhile the positive flux in-between increases. We also find that the horizontal\nmagnetic fields have a significant increase along the disk-ward PIL, while in\nsurrounding area, they decrease. Synthesizing the observed field changes, we\nconclude that the magnetic fields collapse toward the surface above the\ndisk-ward PIL as depicted in the coronal implosion scenario, while the\nperipheral field turns to a more vertical configuration after the flare. We\nalso suggest that this event is an asymmetric circular-ribbon flare: a flux\nrope is likely present above the disk-ward PIL. Its eruption causes the\ninstability of the entire fan-spine structure and the implosion near that PIL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 16:10:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

The limiting stationary distribution of the Markov\nchain represents the fraction of the time spent in each state during the\nstochastic process. A standard way to compute this distribution for a random\nwalk on a finite set of states is to compute the Perron vector of the\nassociated transition matrix. There are algebraic analogues of this Perron\nvector in terms of transition probability tensors of higher-order Markov\nchains. These vectors are nonnegative, have dimension equal to the dimension of\nthe state space, and sum to one and are derived by making an algebraic\nsubstitution in the equation for the joint-stationary distribution of a\nhigher-order Markov chains.

For example, a $2\\to4$\ngluon scattering process has a singularity in which each incoming gluon splits\ninto a pair of gluons, followed by a pair of $2\\to2$ collisions between the\ngluon pairs. This singularity mimics double parton scattering because it occurs\nwhen the transverse momentum of a pair of outgoing gluons vanishes. The\nsingularity is logarithmic at fixed order in perturbation theory. We exploit\nthe duality between scattering amplitudes and polygonal Wilson loops to study\nsix-point amplitudes in this limit to high loop order in planar ${\\cal N}=4$\nsuper-Yang-Mills theory. The singular configuration corresponds to the limit in\nwhich a hexagonal Wilson loop develops a self-crossing. The singular terms are\ngoverned by an evolution equation, in which the hexagon mixes into a pair of\nboxes; the mixing back is suppressed in the planar (large $N_c$) limit. Because\nthe kinematic dependence of the box Wilson loops is dictated by (dual)\nconformal invariance, the complete kinematic dependence of the singular terms\nfor the self-crossing hexagon on the one nonsingular variable is determined to\nall loop orders. The complete logarithmic dependence on the singular variable\ncan be obtained through nine loops, up to a couple of constants, using a\ncorrespondence with the multi-Regge limit. As a byproduct, we obtain a simple\nformula for the leading logs to all loop orders. We also show that, although\nthe MHV six-gluon amplitude is singular, remarkably, the transcendental\nfunctions entering the non-MHV amplitude are finite in the same limit, at least\nthrough four loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 17:40:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2016 12:14:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 16:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

The high quality of the resulting DHIGLS products enables a variety\nof new studies in directions of low Galactic column density. We analyze the\nangular power spectra of maps of the integrated H I emission (column density)\nfrom the data cubes for several distinct velocity ranges. Fitting power\nspectrum models based on a power law, but including the effects of the\nsynthesized beam and noise at high spatial frequencies, we find exponents\nranging from -2.5 to -3.0..

This wireless access is evaluated under disruptive\nusage scenarios, such as flash crowds, which can mean unwanted severe\ncongestion on a specific operator network whilst the remaining available\ncapacity from other access technologies is not being used.

In this\npaper we present the deep photometry inside two square degrees around the\nbright galaxy NGC1399 in the core of the cluster. We found a very extended and\ndiffuse envelope surrounding the luminous galaxy NGC1399: we map the surface\nbrightness out to 33 arcmin (~ 192 kpc) from the galaxy center and down to\nabout 31 mag/arcsec^2 in the g band. The deep photometry allows us to detect a\nfaint stellar bridge in the intracluster region between NGC1399 and NGC1387. By\nanalyzing the integrated colors of this feature, we argue that it could be due\nto the ongoing interaction between the two galaxies, where the outer envelope\nof NGC1387 on its east side is stripped away. By fitting the light profile, we\nfound that it exists a physical break radius in the total light distribution at\nR=10 arcmin (~58 kpc) that sets the transition region between the bright\ncentral galaxy and the outer exponential stellar halo. We discuss the main\nimplications of this work on the build-up of the stellar halo at the center of\nthe Fornax cluster. By comparing with the numerical simulations of the stellar\nhalo formation for the most massive BCGs, we find that the observed stellar\nhalo mass fraction is consistent with a halo formed through the multiple\naccretion of progenitors with a stellar mass in the range 10^8 - 10^11 M_sun.\nThis might suggest that the halo of NGC1399 has also gone through a major\nmerging event. The absence of a significant number of luminous stellar streams\nand tidal tails out to 192 kpc suggests that the epoch of this strong\ninteraction goes back to an early formation epoch. Therefore, differently from\nthe Virgo cluster, the extended stellar halo around NGC1399 is characterised by\na more diffuse and well-mixed component, including the ICL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 20:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

It is steeper than the M ~ V^3 scaling relating halo virial masses and\ncircular velocities and its zero point implies that galaxies comprise a very\nsmall fraction of available baryons. Such low galaxy formation efficiencies may\nin principle be explained by winds driven by evolving stars, but the tightness\nof the BTF relation argues against the substantial scatter expected from such\nvigorous feedback mechanism. We use the APOSTLE/EAGLE simulations to show that\nthe BTF relation is well reproduced in LCDM simulations that match the size and\nnumber of galaxies as a function of stellar mass. In such models, galaxy\nrotation velocities are proportional to halo virial velocity and the steep\nvelocity-mass dependence results from the decline in galaxy formation\nefficiency with decreasing halo mass needed to reconcile the CDM halo mass\nfunction with the galaxy luminosity function. Despite the strong feedback, the\nscatter in the simulated BTF is smaller than observed, even when considering\nall simulated galaxies and not just rotationally-supported ones. The\nsimulations predict that the BTF should become increasingly steep at the faint\nend, although the velocity scatter at fixed mass should remain small.

The\nchallenge is to maintain gauge invariance, while simultaneously incorporating\nadditional self-energy terms arising from strong correlation effects. Central\nto our approach is the application of the Ward-Takahashi identity, which\nintroduces collective mode contributions in the response functions and\nguarantees that the $f$-sum rule is satisfied. We outline a powerful and very\ngeneral method to determine these collective modes in a manner compatible with\ngauge invariance. Finally, as an alternative approach, we contrast with the\npath integral formalism. Here, the calculation of gauge invariant response\nappears more straightforward. However, the collective modes introduced are\nessentially those of strict BCS theory, with no modification from correlation\neffects.

We define a main sample of ~800\nsources with full Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) coverage between 0.15 <\nlambda < 500 microns and an extended sample with ~5000 sources in which we\nremove the constraints on the Ultraviolet and Near-Infrared bands.

One of the most intriguing issues is whether or not the\nanomalous U(1) symmetry in the flavor sector is effectively restored along with\nthe chiral symmetry. This may determine the universality class of the chiral\nphase transition. Since the physics near the chiral phase transition is\nessentially non-perturbative, we employ first principles lattice techniques to\naddress this issue. We use overlap fermions, which have exact chiral symmetry\non the lattice, to probe the anomalous U(1) symmetry violation of 2+1 flavor\ndynamical QCD configurations with domain wall fermions. The latter also\noptimally preserves chiral and flavor symmetries on the lattice, since it is\nknown that the remnant chiral symmetry of the light quarks influences the\nscaling of the chiral condensate in the crossover transition region. We observe\nthat the anomalous U(1) is not effectively restored in the chiral crossover\nregion. We perform a systematic study of the finite size and cut-off effects\nsince the signals of U(1) violation are sensitive to it.

This situation arises in a host of modern applications\nwhen data is transmitted or stored prior to determining the downstream\ninference task. Given a bitrate constraint and a distortion measure between the\ndata and its compressed version, let us consider the joint distribution\nachieving Shannon's rate-distortion (RD) function. Given an estimator and a\nloss function associated with the downstream inference task, define the\nrate-distortion risk as the expected loss under the RD-achieving distribution.\nWe provide general conditions under which the operational risk in estimating\nfrom the compressed data is asymptotically equivalent to the RD risk. The main\ntheoretical tools to prove this equivalence are transportation-cost\ninequalities in conjunction with properties of compression codes achieving\nShannon's RD function. Whenever such equivalence holds, a recipe for designing\nestimators from datasets undergoing lossy compression without specifying the\nactual compression technique emerges: design the estimator to minimize the RD\nrisk. Our conditions simplified in the special cases of discrete memoryless or\nmultivariate normal data. For these scenarios, we derive explicit expressions\nfor the RD risk of several estimators and compare them to the optimal source\ncoding performance associated with full knowledge of the relation between the\nlatent signal and the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2016 02:05:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Jan 2017 08:20:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 00:56:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 17 May 2019 23:04:26 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2019 13:44:21 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 2019 03:27:54 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 22:23:28 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 17:24:13 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2021 18:08:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

It has\nalso received a surge of interest for shallow learning, e.g., logistic\nregression. However, the independent sampling for dropout could be suboptimal\nfor the sake of convergence. In this paper, we propose to use multinomial\nsampling for dropout, i.e., sampling features or neurons according to a\nmultinomial distribution with different probabilities for different\nfeatures/neurons. To exhibit the optimal dropout probabilities, we analyze the\nshallow learning with multinomial dropout and establish the risk bound for\nstochastic optimization. By minimizing a sampling dependent factor in the risk\nbound, we obtain a distribution-dependent dropout with sampling probabilities\ndependent on the second order statistics of the data distribution. To tackle\nthe issue of evolving distribution of neurons in deep learning, we propose an\nefficient adaptive dropout (named \\textbf{evolutional dropout}) that computes\nthe sampling probabilities on-the-fly from a mini-batch of examples. Empirical\nstudies on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed dropouts\nachieve not only much faster convergence and but also a smaller testing error\nthan the standard dropout.

When the driving powerincreases beyond the\nstatic energy balance, the steady states lose their stabilities via Hopf\nbifurcations and the resonator produces stable self-sustained\noscillation(limit-circle behavior) of discrete energies with step-like\namplitudes due to the parametric effect of the quadratic coupling, which can be\nunderstood roughly by the power balance between gain and loss on the resonator.\nA further increase of the pumping power can induce chaotic dynamic of the\nresonator via a typical routine of period-doubling bifurcation but which can be\nstabilized by the parametric effect through an inversion bifurcation process\nback to limit-circle states.

In this study, we\npropose a simplification of the unified gas kinetic scheme. It allows almost\nidentical numerical cost as the DOM, but predicts numerical results as accurate\nas the UGKS. Based on the observation that the equilibrium part of the UGKS\nfluxes can be evaluated analytically, the equilibrium part in the UGKS flux is\nnot necessary to be discretized in velocity space. In the simplified scheme,\nthe numerical flux for the velocity distribution function and the numerical\nflux for the macroscopic conservative quantities are evaluated separately. The\nsimplification is equivalent to a flux hybridization of the gas kinetic scheme\nfor the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations and conventional discrete ordinate method.\nSeveral simplification strategies are tested, through which we can identify the\nkey ingredient of the Navier-Stokes asymptotic preserving property.

Two quantitative measures of modulated light curves are employed as\nthe proxies of magnetic activity for solar-type stars observed with Kepler\ntelescope. The first is named autocorrelation index $i_{AC}$, which describes\nthe degree of periodicity of the light curve, the second is the effective\nfluctuation range of the light curve $R_{eff}$, which reflects the depth of\nrotational modulation. The two measures are complementary and depict different\naspects of magnetic activities on solar-type stars.

In this paper, we provide provable\nrecovery guarantee of weighted low-rank via a simple alternating minimization\nalgorithm. In particular, for a natural class of matrices and weights and\nwithout any assumption on the noise, we bound the spectral norm of the\ndifference between the recovered matrix and the ground truth, by the spectral\nnorm of the weighted noise plus an additive error that decreases exponentially\nwith the number of rounds of alternating minimization, from either\ninitialization by SVD or, more importantly, random initialization. These\nprovide the first theoretical results for weighted low-rank via alternating\nminimization with non-binary deterministic weights, significantly generalizing\nthose for matrix completion, the special case with binary weights, since our\nassumptions are similar or weaker than those made in existing works.\nFurthermore, this is achieved by a very simple algorithm that improves the\nvanilla alternating minimization with a simple clipping step.\n  The key technical challenge is that under non-binary deterministic weights,\nna\\\"ive alternating steps will destroy the incoherence and spectral properties\nof the intermediate solutions, which are needed for making progress towards the\nground truth. We show that the properties only need to hold in an average sense\nand can be achieved by the clipping step.\n  We further provide an alternating algorithm that uses a whitening step that\nkeeps the properties via SDP and Rademacher rounding and thus requires weaker\nassumptions.

By enforcing all the invariance conditions in\n2D materials and including Ge $3d$ and Sn $4d$ electrons as valence electrons\nfor germanene and stanene respectively, the lattice dynamics in these materials\nare accurately described. A large acoustic-optical gap and the bunching of the\nacoustic phonon branches significantly reduce phonon scattering in stanene,\nleading to higher thermal conductivity than germanene. The vibrational origin\nof the acoustic-optical gap can be attributed to the buckled structure.\nInterestingly, a buckled system has two competing influences on phonon\ntransport: the breaking of the symmetry selection rule leads to reduced thermal\nconductivity, and the enlarging of the acoustic-optical gap results in enhanced\nthermal conductivity. The size dependence of thermal conductivity is\ninvestigated as well.

A widely accepted reason\nbehind such outcome is the unavoidable loss of non-topological information\n(such as node attributes) encountered when the original complex system is\nrepresented as a network. In this article we emphasize that the observed\ndiscrepancies may also be caused by a different reason: the external\nclassification itself. For this end we use scientific publication data which i)\nexhibit a well defined modular structure and ii) hold an expert-made\nclassification of research articles. Having represented the articles and the\nextracted scientific concepts both as a bipartite network and as its unipartite\nprojection, we applied modularity optimization to uncover the inner thematic\nstructure. The resulting clusters are shown to partly reflect the author-made\nclassification, although some significant discrepancies are observed. A\ndetailed analysis of these discrepancies shows that they carry essential\ninformation about the system, mainly related to the use of similar techniques\nand methods across different (sub)disciplines, that is otherwise omitted when\nonly the external classification is considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2016 13:49:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-25"}

We apply several statistical methods, such as Principal\nComponents Analysis and Correspondence Analysis to identify the way Marketing\nvocabulary is evolving. Similarly those articles that introduce new vocabulary\nare identified and the preferred words by authors are also detected. In order\nto provide an easy-to-understand explanation, we provide our results\ngraphically. A word-cloud with the most frequent words is given first. Secondly\nabstracts-words are represented on the factorial plane. Finally one\nrepresentation of word-years allows us to detect changes on the vocabulary\nthrough the passing of time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 18:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-14"}

The relationships between spatially averaged\nvariables are hysteretic even when unique relationships are imposed at the\nplant scale. The characteristics of these hysteretic relationships depend on\nthe size of the averaging area and the spatial properties of the soil,\nvegetation, and rainfall. We upscale the plant-scale relationships to the scale\nof a regional land-surface model based on simulation data obtained through\nexplicit representation of spatial heterogeneity in rainfall and vegetation\ntype. The proposed upscaled function improves predictions of spatially averaged\nsoil moisture and evapotranspiration relative to the effective-parameter\napproach for a water-limited Texas shrubland. The degree of improvement is a\nfunction of the scales of heterogeneity and the size of the averaging area. We\nalso find that single-valued functions fail to predict spatially averaged\nleakage accurately. Furthermore, the spatial heterogeneity results in\nscale-dependent hysteretic relationships for the statistical-dynamic and\nMontaldo & Albertson approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 17:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-17"}

This article will apply the laddering technique to see how personal\nvalues (or managerial functions) influence a companys adoption of analytical\ntools. A set of ten in-depth interviews are conducted with CEOs, analytics\nconsultants, academics and businessmen in order to establish quantitative\nrelations among attributes, consequences and personal values. Two easy-to-read\noutputs are provided to interpret our results. The most important links are\nquantitatively associated through an implication matrix, and then visually\nrepresented on a hierarchical value map.

In MPH, a newly joining peer selects a peer whose physical hop count\n(i.e., the number of ASes traversed on the content delivery path) from it is\nthe minimum as its providing peer. However, MPH shows high inter-AS traffic\nvolume when the number of joining peers is large. In this paper, we propose\nIMPH that tries to further decrease the inter-AS traffic volume by distributing\npeers with one logical hop count (i.e., the number of peers or origin streaming\nservers (OSSes) traversed on the content delivery path from an OSS to the peer)\nto many ASes and encouraging the following peers to find their providing peers\nwithin the same AS. Numerical examples show that IMPH achieves at the maximum\nof 64% lower inter-AS traffic volume than MPH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2016 09:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-17"}
