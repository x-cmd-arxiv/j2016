Crowd workers complete simple binary microtasks whose\nresults are aggregated to give the final result. We consider the novel scenario\nwhere workers have a reject option so they may skip microtasks when they are\nunable or choose not to respond. For example, in mismatched speech\ntranscription, workers who do not know the language may not be able to respond\nto microtasks focused on phonological dimensions outside their categorical\nperception. We present an aggregation approach using a weighted majority voting\nrule, where each worker's response is assigned an optimized weight to maximize\nthe crowd's classification performance. We evaluate system performance in both\nexact and asymptotic forms. Further, we consider the setting where there may be\na set of greedy workers that complete microtasks even when they are unable to\nperform it reliably.

In the developing world NS is often treated without an identified\nmicrobial pathogen. Amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene can be\nused to identify organisms that are difficult to detect by routine\nmicrobiological methods. However, contaminating bacteria are ubiquitous in both\nhospital settings and research reagents, and must be accounted for to make\neffective use of these data. In the present study, we sequenced the bacterial\n16S rRNA gene obtained from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 80 neonates\npresenting with NS to the Mbarara Regional Hospital in Uganda. Assuming that\npatterns of background contamination would be independent of pathogenic\nmicroorganism DNA, we applied a novel quantitative approach using principal\northogonal decomposition to separate background contamination from potential\npathogens in sequencing data. We designed our quantitative approach contrasting\nblood, CSF, and control specimens, and employed a variety of statistical random\nmatrix bootstrap hypotheses to estimate statistical significance.

However, we restrict our study to the case of commuting\n$X$'s. We focus in particular on the symmetries of the theory, and the minimal\nlength that emerge in some cases. We first show that, at the algebraic level,\nthere exists an unambiguous mapping between the GUP with a deformed quantum\nalgebra and a quadratic Hamiltonian into a standard, Heisenberg algebra of\noperators and an aquadratic Hamiltonian, provided the boost sector of the\nsymmetries is modified accordingly. The theory can also be mapped to a\ncompletely standard Quantum Mechanics with standard symmetries, but with\nmomentum dependent position operators. Next, we investigate the Hilbert space\nrepresentations of these algebraically equivalent models, and focus,\nspecifically on whether they exhibit a minimal length. We carry the functional\nanalysis of the various operators involved, and show that the appearance of a\nminimal length critically depends on the relationship between the generators of\ntranslations and the physical momenta. In particular, because this relationship\nis preserved by the algebraic mapping presented in this paper, when a minimal\nlength is present in the standard GUP, it is also present in the corresponding\nAquadratic Hamiltonian formulation, despite the perfectly standard algebra of\nthis model. In general, a minimal length requires bounded generators of\ntranslations, i.e. a specific kind of quantization of space, and this depends\non the precise shape of the function $f$ defined previously.

However, little is know about the effects of past\nevents like the Late Heavy Bombardment on this crust. We address this gap in\nour knowledge by simulating the LHB in the different dynamical scenarios\nproposed for the migration of the giant planets in the broad framework of the\nNice Model. The results of simulations generate information about produced\ncrater population, surface saturation, mass loss and mass gain of Vesta and\nnumber of energetic or catastrophic impacts during LHB. Our results reveal that\nplanet-planet scattering is a dynamically favourable migration mechanism for\nthe survival of Vesta and its crust. The number of impacts on Vesta estimated\nas due to the LHB is $31\\pm5$, i.e. about 5 times larger than the number of\nimpacts that would have occurred in an unperturbed main belt in the same time\ninterval. The contribution of a possible extended belt, instead, is quite\nlimited and can be quantified in $2\\pm1$ impacts. The chance of energetic and\ncatastrophic impacts is less than 10\\% and is compatible with the absence of\ngiant craters dated back to 4 Ga ago and with the survival of the asteroid\nduring the LHB. The mass loss translates in the erosion of $3-5$ meters of the\ncrust, consistently with the global survival of the basaltic crust of Vesta\nconfirmed by the Dawn mission. Our analysis revealed that the contribution of\nthe LHB to the cratering of Vesta' surface is not significant and is actually\nerased by the crater population produced by the following 4 Ga of collisional\nevolution of the asteroid, in agreement with the data provided by the Dawn\nmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2016 18:09:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 09:52:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2016 12:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

Since mobility is, to a large extent,\ndriven by the need for a continuous supply of food, a natural framework for\naddressing this question is provided by the metabolic theory of ecology. This\nprovides a powerful framework for formulating formal testable hypotheses\nconcerning evolutionary and ecological constraints on the scale and variation\nof hunter-gatherer residential mobility. We evaluate these predictions using\nextant data and show strong support for the hypotheses. We show that the\noverall scale of hunter-gatherer residential mobility is predicted by average\nhuman body size, and the limited capacity of mobile hunter-gatherers to store\nenergy internally. We then show that the majority of variation in residential\nmobility observed across cultures is predicted by energy availability in local\necosystems.

Even so, RMHD codes remain\nfragile. The reconstruction can sometimes yield superluminal velocities in\ncertain parts of the mesh. In this paper we present a reconstruction strategy\nthat overcomes this problem by making a single conservative to primitive\ntransformation per cell followed by higher order WENO reconstruction on a\ncarefully chosen set of primitives that guarantee subluminal reconstruction of\nthe flow variables. For temporal evolution via a predictor step we also present\nsecond, third and fourth order accurate ADER methods that keep the velocity\nsubluminal during the predictor step. The RMHD system also requires the\nmagnetic field to be evolved in a divergence-free fashion. In the treatment of\nclassical numerical MHD the analogous issue has seen much recent progress with\nthe advent of multidimensional Riemann solvers. By developing multidimensional\nRiemann solvers for RMHD, we show that similar advances extend to RMHD. As a\nresult, the face-centered magnetic fields can be evolved much more accurately\nusing the edge-centered electric fields in the corrector step. Those\nedge-centered electric fields come from a multidimensional Riemann solver for\nRMHD which we present in this paper. In this paper we also develop several new\ntest problems for RMHD. We show that RMHD vortices can be designed that\npropagate on the computational mesh as self-preserving structures. These RMHD\nvortex test problems provide a means to do truly multidimensional accuracy\ntesting for RMHD codes. Several other stringent test problems are presented. We\nshow the importance of resolution in certain test problems. Our tests include a\ndemonstration that RMHD vortices are stable when they interact with shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2016 18:43:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

This code provides a\ncomplementary and alternative method to existing traditional NLFFF codes. The\nchief advantages of the VCA-NLFFF code over traditional NLFFF codes are the\ncircumvention of the unrealistic assumption of a force-free photosphere in the\nmagnetic field extrapolation method, the capability to minimize the\nmisalignment angles between observed coronal loops (or chromospheric fibril\nstructures) and theoretical model field lines, as well as computational speed.\nIn performance tests of the VCA-NLFFF code, by comparing with the NLFFF code of\nWiegelmann (2004), we find agreement in the potential, nonpotential, and free\nenergy within a factor of about 1.3, but the Wiegelmann code yields in the\naverage a factor of 2 lower flare energies.

However, densifying the network with a viral\ndeployment of SBSs can significantly increase energy consumption. To reduce the\nreliance on unsustainable energy sources, one can adopt self-powered SBSs that\nrely solely on energy harvesting. Due to the uncertainty of energy arrival and\nthe finite capacity of energy storage systems, self-powered SBSs must smartly\noptimize their ON and OFF schedule. In this paper, the problem of ON/OFF\nscheduling of self-powered SBSs is studied, in the presence of energy\nharvesting uncertainty with the goal of minimizing the operational costs\nconsisted of energy consumption and transmission delay of a network. For the\noriginal problem, we show an algorithm can solve the problem in the\nillustrative case. To reduce the complexity of the original problem, an\napproximation is proposed. To solve the approximated problem, a novel approach\nbased on the ski rental framework, a powerful online optimization tool, is\nproposed. Using this approach, each SBS can effectively decide on its ON/OFF\nschedule autonomously, without any prior information on future energy arrivals.\nBy using competitive analysis, a deterministic online algorithm (DOA) and a\nrandomized online algorithm (ROA) are developed. ROA is shown to achieve the\noptimal competitive ratio in the approximation problem. Simulation results show\nthat, compared to a baseline approach, the ROA can yield performance gains\nreaching up to 15.6% in terms of reduced total energy consumption of SBSs and\nup to 20.6% in terms of per-SBS network delay reduction. The results shed light\non the fundamental aspects that impact the ON time of SBSs while demonstrating\nthat the proposed ROA can reduce up to 69.9% the total cost compared to a\nbaseline approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2016 18:55:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 21:02:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 11 Mar 2017 23:30:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-14"}

The IsoRank algorithm first computes a pairwise node\nsimilarity metric, and then generates a matching between the two node sets\nbased on this metric. The metric is a convex combination of a structural\nsimilarity score (with weight $ \\alpha $) and an extraneous amino-acid sequence\nsimilarity score for two proteins (with weight $ 1 - \\alpha $). In this short\npaper, we make two contributions. First, we show that when IsoRank similarity\ndepends only on network structure ($\\alpha = 1$), the similarity of two nodes\nis only a function of their degrees. In other words, IsoRank similarity is\ninvariant to any network rewiring that does not affect the node degrees. This\nresult suggests a reason for the poor performance of IsoRank in structure-only\n($ \\alpha = 1 $) alignment. Second, using ideas from [7, 8], we develop an\napproximation algorithm that outperforms IsoRank (including recent versions\nwith better scaling, e.g., [9]) by several orders of magnitude in time and\nmemory complexity, despite only a negligible loss in precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2016 20:28:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 10:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-22"}

Moreover, because the kinetic\nenergy of the electron is quenched by the strong magnetic field, the electron\nhas no energy to give to or take from the bath, and so the usual connection\nbetween frictional forces and dissipation no longer holds.

The key ingredients of the four dimensional\npicture of hadrons are the \"string endpoint mass\" and the \"baryonic string\nvertex\". We determine the classical trajectories of the HISH. We review the\ncurrent understanding of the quantization of the hadronic strings. We end with\na summary of the comparison of the outcome of the HISH models with the PDG data\nabout mesons and baryons. We extract the values of the tension, masses and\nintercepts from best fits, write down certain predictions for higher excited\nhadrons and present attempts to identify glueballs\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2016 21:06:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2016 09:37:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2016 08:50:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2016 12:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

Not all\nworkloads (or phases) can productively utilize this much cache space, however.\nUnfortunately, the unused (or under-used) cache continues to consume power due\nto leakage in the peripheral circuitry and periodic DRAM refresh. Dynamically\nadjusting the available DRAM cache capacity could largely eliminate this energy\noverhead. However, the current proposed DRAM cache organization introduces new\nchallenges for dynamic cache resizing. The organization differs from a\nconventional SRAM cache organization because it places entire cache sets and\ntheir tags within a single bank to reduce on-chip area and power overhead.\nHence, resizing a DRAM cache requires remapping sets from the powered-down\nbanks to active banks.\n  In this paper, we propose CRUNCH (Cache Resizing Using Native Consistent\nHashing), a hardware data remapping scheme inspired by consistent hashing, an\nalgorithm originally proposed to uniformly and dynamically distribute Internet\ntraffic across a changing population of web servers. CRUNCH provides a\nload-balanced remapping of data from the powered-down banks alone to the active\nbanks, without requiring sets from all banks to be remapped, unlike naive\nschemes to achieve load balancing. CRUNCH remaps only sets from the\npowered-down banks, so it achieves this load balancing with low bank\npower-up/down transition latencies.

Memory devices represent a key component of datacenter\ntotal cost of ownership (TCO), and techniques used to reduce errors that occur\non these devices increase this cost. Existing approaches to providing\nreliability for memory devices pessimistically treat all data as equally\nvulnerable to memory errors. Our key insight is that there exists a diverse\nspectrum of tolerance to memory errors in new data-intensive applications, and\nthat traditional one-size-fits-all memory reliability techniques are\ninefficient in terms of cost. This presents an opportunity to greatly reduce\nserver hardware cost by provisioning the right amount of memory reliability for\ndifferent applications.\n  Toward this end, in our DSN 2014 paper, we make three main contributions to\nenable highly-reliable servers at low datacenter cost. First, we develop a new\nmethodology to quantify the tolerance of applications to memory errors. Second,\nusing our methodology, we perform a case study of three new data-intensive\nworkloads (an interactive web search application, an in-memory key--value\nstore, and a graph mining framework) to identify new insights into the nature\nof application memory error vulnerability. Third, based on our insights, we\npropose several new hardware/software heterogeneous-reliability memory system\ndesigns to lower datacenter cost while achieving high reliability and discuss\ntheir trade-offs. We show that our new techniques can reduce server hardware\ncost by 4.7% while achieving 99.90% single server availability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2016 22:23:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 05:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-11"}

The stiffness\nin the former comes from the fact that particles (such as photons) travels at\nthe speed of light, while that in the latter is due to the strong scattering in\nthe diffusive regime. We study the fully implicit scheme for this equation to\naccount for the stiffness. The main challenge in the implicit treatment is the\ncoupling between the spacial and velocity coordinates that requires the large\nsize of the to-be-inverted matrix, which is also ill-conditioned and not\nnecessarily symmetric. Our main idea is to utilize the spectral structure of\nthe ill-conditioned matrix to construct a pre-conditioner, which, along with an\nexquisite split of the spatial and angular dependence, significantly improve\nthe condition number and allows matrix-free treatment. We also design a fast\nsolver to compute this pre-conditioner explicitly in advance. Meanwhile, we\nreformulate the system via an even-odd parity, which results in a symmetric and\npositive definite matrix that can be inverted using conjugate gradient method.\nThis idea can also be implemented to the original non-symmetric system whose\ninversion is solved by GMRES.

A special class of defining functions is identified for\nwhich the associated Schur-Agler class coincides with the\ncontractive-multiplier class on an associated noncommutative reproducing kernel\nHilbert space; in this case, solution of the Pick interpolation problem is in\nterms of the complete positivity of an associated Pick matrix which is\nexplicitly determined from the interpolation data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2016 01:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

In this study, the methodology for arbitrary linear\nschemes to achieve the property is investigated. First, derivations of grid\nmetric by Thomas, Lombard and Neier are reviewed, through which linear schemes\nfor the metric and unsplit flux could attain the property by the proof of\nVinokur and Yee firstly. In practical applications, flux splittings are usually\nat presence and therefore the direct use of upwind schemes seems difficult to\nfulfill free-stream preservation. To overcome the difficulty, two attempts are\nmade: firstly, a central-scheme-decomposition is worked out, through which a\ncentral difference scheme is derived to approximate the first-order partial\nderivative in metric evaluations; secondly, treatments are proposed for flux\nsplitting and a concrete example is presented. Through these two attempts, the\nlinear upwind node schemes can achieve the property. For half-node or mixed\ntype schemes, interpolations should be used to derive variables at half nodes.\nAs a result, a directionally consistent interpolation is proposed, which is\nshown to be necessary in order to avoid violation of the metric identity and\nfree-stream preservation. Two numerical problems are also tested, i.e., the\nfree-stream and vortex preservation on wavy, largely randomized and triangular\ngrids.

Our\nmechanistic simulation for Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrates that at least half\nof the total regulatory interactions must be present to express the circadian\nmolecular profiles observed in wild-type plants. A set of those essential\ninteractions is called herein a kernel of the circadian system. The kernel\nstructure unbiasedly reveals four interlocked negative feedback loops\ncontributing to circadian rhythms, and three feedback loops among them drive\nthe autonomous oscillation itself. Strikingly, the kernel structure, as well as\nthe whole clock circuitry, is overwhelmingly composed of inhibitory, rather\nthan activating, interactions between genes. We found that this tendency\nunderlies plant circadian molecular profiles which often exhibit\nsharply-shaped, cuspidate waveforms. Through the generation of these cuspidate\nprofiles, inhibitory interactions may facilitate the global coordination of\ntemporally-distant clock events that are markedly peaked at very specific times\nof day.

Algebraic relations among classical\nmutations are satisfied by the intertwiners up to complex constants. The\npresent paper shows that these constants are $1$. So the mapping class group\nrepresentations resulting from the Chekhov-Fock-Goncharov quantum Teichm\\\"uller\ntheory are genuine, not projective. During the course, the hexagon and the\noctagon operator identities for $\\Phi^\\hbar$ are derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2016 05:50:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 17:19:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 08:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

In addition,\nwe observed that the ferromagnetism in the Pd(100) disappeared with the\naccumulation of cracks due to the repetition of the temperature cycle through\nthe phase-transition temperature.

Therefore compressive\nsampling can be a very efficient tool for the rogue wave early warning systems.\nCompressed measurements can be acquired by remote sensing techniques such as\ncoherent SAR which measure the ocean surface envelope or by insitu techniques\nsuch as spectra measuring tools mounted on a ship hull or bottom mounted\npressure gauges. By employing a numerical approach we show that triangular\nFourier spectra can be sensed by compressive measurements at the early stages\nof the development of rogue waves such as those in the form of Peregrine and\nAkhmediev-Peregrine solitons.

To achieve a\nhigher Q and obtain the necessary anomalous dispersion, $Si_3N_4$\nmicroresonators made of multi-mode waveguides were previously implemented.\nHowever, coupling between different transverse mode families in the multi-mode\nwaveguides results in periodic disruption of dispersion and quality factor,\nintroducing perturbation to dissipative soliton formation and amplitude\nmodulation to the corresponding spectrum. Careful choice of pump wavelength to\navoid the mode crossing region is thus critical in conventional $Si_3N_4$\nmicroresonators. Here, we report a novel design of $Si_3N_4$ microresonator\nsuch that single mode operation, high quality factor, and anomalous dispersion\nare attained simultaneously. The microresonator is consisted of uniform single\nmode waveguides in the semi-circle region, to eliminate bending induced mode\ncoupling, and adiabatically tapered waveguides in the straight region, to avoid\nexcitation of higher order modes.

We aim to\ntest whether evolved stars with planets show any chemical peculiarity that\ncould be related to the planet formation process. We determine in a consistent\nway the metallicity and individual abundances of a large sample of evolved\n(subgiants and red giants) and MS stars with and without known planetary\ncompanions. No differences in the <[X/Fe]> vs. condensation temperature (Tc)\nslopes are found between the samples of planet and non-planet hosts when all\nelements are considered. However, if the analysis is restricted to only\nrefractory elements, differences in the Tc-slopes between stars with and\nwithout known planets are found. This result is found to be dependent on the\nstellar evolutionary stage, as it holds for MS and subgiant stars, while there\nseem to be no difference between planet and non-planet hosts among the sample\nof giants. A search for correlations between the Tc-slope and the stellar\nproperties reveals significant correlations with the stellar mass and the\nstellar age. The data also suggest that differences in terms of mass and age\nbetween MS planet and non-planet hosts may be present. Our results are well\nexplained by radial mixing in the Galaxy. The sample of giant contains stars\nmore massive and younger than their MS counterparts. This leads to a sample of\nstars possibly less contaminated by stars not born in the solar neighbourhood,\nleading to no chemical differences between planet and non planet hosts. The\nsample of MS stars may contain more stars from the outer disc (specially the\nnon-planet host sample) which might led to the differences observed in the\nchemical trends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2016 09:01:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 08:33:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

Most of the numerical simulations of GI have been carried\nout with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. Recently, however,\nit has been pointed out that standard formulation of SPH (SSPH) has\ndifficulties in the treatment of a contact discontinuity such as a core-mantle\nboundary and a free surface such as a planetary surface. This difficulty comes\nfrom the assumption of differentiability of density in SSPH. We have developed\nan alternative formulation of SPH, density independent SPH (DISPH), which is\nbased on differentiability of pressure instead of density to solve the problem\nof a contact discontinuity. In this paper, we report the results of the GI\nsimulations with DISPH and compare them with those obtained with SSPH. We found\nthat the disk properties, such as mass and angular momentum produced by DISPH\nis different from that of SSPH. In general, the disks formed by DISPH are more\ncompact: while formation of a smaller mass moon for low-oblique impacts is\nexpected with DISPH, inhibition of ejection would promote formation of a larger\nmass moon for high-oblique impacts. Since only the improvement of core-mantle\nboundary significantly affects the properties of circumplanetary disks\ngenerated by GI and DISPH has not been significantly improved from SSPH for a\nfree surface, we should be very careful when some conclusions are drawn from\nthe numerical simulations for GI. And it is necessary to develop the numerical\nhydrodynamical scheme for GI that can properly treat the free surface as well\nas the contact discontinuity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2016 09:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-22"}

A standard nonparametric\nestimator of the size distribution has already been suggested in the\nliterature, and has been shown to be asymptotically normal under suitable but\nrestrictive assumptions. When these assumptions are not satisfied, it is shown\nhere that the estimator can be attracted to a semi-stable law. The assumptions\nare discussed in the case of several concrete examples.

Below\n26~K and above 250~K, the majority phase ($> 80\\%$) is that of $\\Gamma_4$.\nBelow 10~K the high-temperature phase $\\Gamma_4$ remains stable till 2~K. At\n2~K, Tb develops a magnetic moment value of 0.6(2)~$\\mu_\\mathrm{B}/$f.u. and\norders long-range in $F_z$ compatible with the $\\Gamma_4$ representation. Our\nstudy confirms the magnetic phase transitions reported already in a single\ncrystal of TbFe$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$O$_3$ and, in addition, reveals the presence\nof mixed magnetic domains. The ratio of these magnetic domains as a function of\ntemperature is estimated from Rietveld refinement of neutron diffraction data.\nIndications of short-range magnetic correlations are present in the low-$Q$\nregion of the neutron diffraction patterns at $T < T^\\mathrm{Fe/Mn}_{SR}$.\nThese results should motivate further experimental work devoted to measure\nelectric polarization and magnetocapacitance of TbFe$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$O$_3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2016 14:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

One of the primary\nexperimental methods to reveal the mechanisms behind electronic transport\nthrough metal-molecule interfaces is the study of conductance as a function of\nmolecule length in molecular junctions. Previous studies focused on transport\ngoverned either by tunneling or hopping, both at low conductance. However, the\nupper limit of conductance across molecular junctions has not been explored,\ndespite the great potential for efficient information transfer, charge\ninjection and recombination processes. Here, we study the conductance\nproperties of highly transmitting metal-molecule-metal interfaces, using a\nseries of single-molecule junctions based on oligoacenes with increasing\nlength. We find that the conductance saturates at an upper limit where it is\nindependent of molecule length. Furthermore, we show that this upper limit can\nbe controlled by the character of the orbital hybridization at the\nmetal-molecule interface. Using two prototype systems, in which the molecules\nare contacted by either Ag or Pt electrodes, we reveal two different origins\nfor the saturation of conductance. In the case of Ag-based molecular junctions,\nthe conductance saturation is ascribed to a competition between energy level\nalignment and level broadening, while in the case of Pt-based junctions, the\nsaturation is attributed to a band-like transport. The results are explained by\nan intuitive model, backed by ab-initio transport calculations. Our findings\nshed light on the mechanisms that constrain the conductance at the high\ntransmission limit, providing guiding principles for the design of highly\nconductive metal-molecule interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2016 14:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

We review\nthe general theory associated to one of the most important statistics, the\nn-level density of zeros near the central point. According to the Katz-Sarnak\ndensity conjecture, to each family of L-functions there is a corresponding\nsymmetry group such that the behavior of zeros near the central point as the\nconductors tend to infinity agrees with the behavior of eigenvalues near 1 as\nthe matrix size tends to infinity.

However, on the other hand, the quasi-1D excitonic\nnature can limit the luminescence quantum yield significantly. Here, we report\nexciton brightening in monolayer phosphorene achieved via the dimensionality\nmodification of excitons from quasi-1D to zero-dimensional (0D), through the\ntransference of monolayer phosphorene samples onto defect-rich oxide substrate\ndeposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The resultant\ninterfacial luminescent local states lead to exciton localization and trigger\nefficient photon emissions at a new wavelength of ~920 nm. The luminescence\nquantum yield of 0D-like localized excitons is measured to be at least 33.6\ntimes larger than that of intrinsic quasi-1D free excitons in monolayer\nphosphorene. This is primarily due to the reduction of non-radiative decay rate\nand the possibly enhanced radiative recombination probability. Owing to the\nlarge trapping energy, this new photon emission from the localized excitons in\nmonolayer phosphorene can be observed at elevated temperature, which contrasts\nmarkedly with defect-induced photon emission from transition metal\ndichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductor monolayers that can only be observed at\ncryogenic temperatures. Our findings introduce new avenues for the development\nof novel photonic devices based on monolayer phosphorene, such as near-infrared\nlighting devices that are operable at elevated temperature. More importantly,\n2D phosphorene with quasi-1D free excitons and 0D-like localized excitons\nprovides a unique platform to investigate the fundamental phenomena in the\nideal 2D-1D-0D hybrid system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2016 15:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

The\nquench initiates collective oscillations with frequency $|U_f|/(2\\pi)$ in the\nmomentum occupation numbers and imprints an oscillating phase with the same\nfrequency on the BCS order parameter $\\Delta$. The oscillation frequency of\n$\\Delta$ is not reproduced by treating the time evolution in mean-field theory.\nIn our theory, the momentum noise (i.e. density-density) correlation functions\noscillate at frequency $|U_f|/2\\pi$ as well as at its second harmonic. For a\nvery deep lattice, with zero tunneling energy, the oscillations of momentum\noccupation numbers are undamped. Non-zero tunneling after the quench leads to\ndephasing of the different momentum modes and a subsequent damping of the\noscillations. The damping occurs even for a finite-temperature initial BCS\nstate, but not for a non-interacting Fermi gas. Furthermore, damping is\nstronger for larger order parameter and may therefore be used as a signature of\nthe BCS state.

We demonstrate that the Hubble flow\nis not inertial when rho+3p is not 0, so the comoving frame is generally not in\nfree fall, even though in FRW, the comoving and free-falling frames are\nsupposed to be identical at every spacetime point.

We consider what sequences\n{Ai,Bj,(1<=i,j<=10)} are needed to fulfill these conditions, and the number of\npossible combinations. We first find seven solutions through factorization of\nthe generating function used for Sicherman dice. We next find seven solutions\nthrough geometric means. We demonstrate a correspondence between the seven\nsolutions from factorization and the seven from geometry. Finally, we suggest\nthat the number of solutions N for an nxn=n^2-cell calculation table is\nN=(p-2)(p-1)+1, where p is the number of divisors of n.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2016 10:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-12"}

One can also study the\nreverse problem of expressing the vertices of a given graph as distinct sets in\nsuch a way that adjacency coincides with intersection of the corresponding\nsets. The sets are usually required to conform to some template, depending on\nthe problem, to be either a finite set, or some geometric set like intervals,\ncircles, discs, cubes etc. The problem of representing a graph as an\nintersection graph of sets was first introduced by Erdos and they looked at\nminimising the underlying universal set necessary to represent any given graph.\nIn that paper it was shown that the problem is NP complete. In this paper we\nstudy a natural variant of this problem which is to consider graphs where\nvertices represent distinct sets and adjacency coincides with disjointness.\nAlthough this is really the same problem on the complement graph, for specific\nfamilies of graphs this is a more natural way of viewing it. When taken across\nthe spectrum of all graphs the two problems are evidently identical. Our\nmotivation to look at disjointness instead of intersection is that several well\nknown graphs like the Petersen graph and Knesser graphs are expressed in the\nlatter method, and the complements of these families are not well studied. The\nparameters we take into account are the maximum size of an individual vertex\nlabel, minimum universe size possible (disregarding individual label sizes) and\nversions of these two where it is required that each vertex gets labels of the\nsame size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2016 18:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-15"}

These results improve over the work of Behzad, by using novel\nobservations on the properties of the local structure in the neighbourhood of\neach vertex. The earlier algorithm was based on bfs and distances. Our theorems\nresult in partitioning the vertex set of the total graph into the original\ngraph and the line graph efficiently.

The game is easy to understand but\nstill very hard to master. From a system point of view, the ball behaviour is\nin general easy to model but close to the obstacles there are severe\nnon-linearities. Additionally, the far from flat surface on which the ball\nrolls provides for changing dynamics depending on the ball position. The\ngeneral dynamics of the system can easliy be handled by traditional automatic\ncontrol methods. Taking the obstacles and uneaven surface into accout would\nrequire very detailed models of the system. A simple deterministic control\nalgorithm is combined with a learning control method. The simple control method\nprovides initial training data. As the learning method is trained, the system\ncan learn from the results of its own actions and the performance improves well\nbeyond the performance of the initial controller. A vision system and image\nanalysis is used to estimate the ball position while a combination of a PID\ncontroller and a learning controller based on LWPR is used to learn to navigate\nthe ball through the maze.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2016 20:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-05"}
