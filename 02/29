We present a general formalism for modeling coregulation\nrules in the framework of Random Boolean Networks (RBN), and develop specific\nmodels for transcription factor networks with modular structure (including\nmodule groups, and multi-input modules (MIM) with autoregulation) and\nmulti-gene complexes (including hierarchical differentiation between multi-gene\ncomplex members). We develop a mean-field approach to analyse the stability of\nlarge networks incorporating coregulation, and show that autoregulated MIM and\nhierarchical gene-complex models can achieve greater stability than networks\nwithout coregulation whose rules have matching activation frequency. We provide\nfurther analysis of the stability of small networks of both kinds through\nsimulations. We also characterize several general properties of the transients\nand attractors in the hierarchical coregulation model, and show using\nsimulations that the steady-state distribution factorizes hierarchically as a\nBayesian network in a Markov Jump Process analogue of the RBN model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2016 18:40:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2016 12:44:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

Although many statistical models of void\ndistributions are based on the counts in randomly placed cells, the log-normal\nVPF that we here obtain is independent of the shape of the voids due to the\nparameter-free void finder of the CVC. We use three void populations drawn from\nthe CVC generated by the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) Mocks which are\ntuned to three mock SDSS samples to investigate the void distribution\nstatistically and the effects of the environments on the size distribution. As\na result, it is shown that void size distributions obtained from the HOD Mock\nsamples are satisfied by the 3-parameter log-normal distribution. In addition,\nwe find that there may be a relation between hierarchical formation, skewness\nand kurtosis of the log-normal distribution for each catalog. We also show that\nthe shape of the 3-parameter distribution from the samples is strikingly\nsimilar to the galaxy log-normal mass distribution obtained from numerical\nstudies. This similarity of void size and galaxy mass distributions may\npossibly indicate evidence of nonlinear mechanisms affecting both voids and\ngalaxies, such as large scale accretion and tidal effects.

One implementation of\nnanomagnetic logic employs shape-anisotropic (e.g. elliptical) ferromagnets\n(with two stable magnetization orientations) as binary switches that rely on\ndipole-dipole interaction to communicate binary information. Normally, circular\nnanomagnets are incompatible with this approach since they lack distinct stable\nin-plane magnetization orientations to encode bits. However, circular\nmagnetoelastic nanomagnets can be made bi-stable with a voltage induced\nanisotropic strain, which provides two significant advantages for nanomagnetic\nlogic applications. First, the shape anisotropy energy barrier is eliminated\nwhich reduces the amount of energy to reorient the dipole. Second, the in-plane\nsize can be reduced (~20nm) which was previously impossible due to thermal\nstability issues. In circular magnetoelastic nanomagnets, a voltage induced\nstrain stabilizes the magnetization even at this size overcoming the thermal\nstability issue. In this paper, we analytically demonstrate a binary logic wire\nimplemented with an array of circular nanomagnets that are clocked with\nvoltage-induced strain applied by an underlying piezoelectric substrate. This\nleads to an energy-efficient logic paradigm orders of magnitude superior to\nexisting CMOS-based logic that is scalable to dimensions substantially smaller\nthan those for existing nanomagnetic logic approaches.

A recent advance of\nLandau et al. gave a polynomial time algorithm to actually compute a succinct\nclassical description for unique ground states of gapped 1D quantum systems.\nDespite this progress many questions remained unresolved, including whether\nthere exist rigorous efficient algorithms when the ground space is degenerate\n(and poly($n$) dimensional), or for the poly($n$) lowest energy states for 1D\nsystems, or even whether such states admit succinct classical descriptions or\narea laws.\n  In this paper we give a new algorithm for finding low energy states for 1D\nsystems, based on a rigorously justified RG type transformation. In the process\nwe resolve some of the aforementioned open questions, including giving a\npolynomial time algorithm for poly($n$) degenerate ground spaces and an\n$n^{O(\\log n)}$ algorithm for the poly($n$) lowest energy states for 1D systems\n(under a mild density condition). We note that for these classes of systems the\nexistence of a succinct classical description and area laws were not rigorously\nproved before this work. The algorithms are natural and efficient, and for the\ncase of finding unique ground states for frustration-free Hamiltonians the\nrunning time is $\\tilde{O}(nM(n))$, where $M(n)$ is the time required to\nmultiply two $n\\times n$ matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 05:38:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 05:14:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

We find that for the \"hot\" seed photon\nmodel the medium size is in the range of 0.3-2.0 kms and the size decreases\nwith increasing QPO frequency. On the other hand for the \"cold\" seed photon\nmodel the range for the sizes are much larger 0.5-20 kms and hence perhaps show\nno variation with QPO frequency. Our results emphasis the need for broad band\nspectral information combined with high frequency timing to lift this\ndegeneracy.

The main conceptual development builds\nfirmly on the notion of a private state, which is a powerful, uniquely quantum\nmethod for simplifying the tripartite picture of privacy involving local\noperations and public classical communication to a bipartite picture of quantum\nprivacy involving local operations and classical communication. This approach\nhas previously led to some of the strongest upper bounds on secret key rates,\nincluding the squashed entanglement and the relative entropy of entanglement.\nHere we use this approach along with a \"privacy test\" to establish a general\nmeta-converse bound for private communication, which has a number of\napplications. The meta-converse allows for proving that any quantum channel's\nrelative entropy of entanglement is a strong converse rate for private\ncommunication. For covariant channels, the meta-converse also leads to\nsecond-order expansions of relative entropy of entanglement bounds for private\ncommunication rates. For such channels, the bounds also apply to the private\ncommunication setting in which the sender and receiver are assisted by\nunlimited public classical communication, and as such, they are relevant for\nestablishing various converse bounds for quantum key distribution protocols\nconducted over these channels. We find precise characterizations for several\nchannels of interest and apply the methods to establish several converse bounds\non the private transmission capabilities of all phase-insensitive bosonic\nchannels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 10:43:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 03:19:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 16:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

We fix a large number of vertices and\nrandomly allocate edges according to the Configuration Model with a prescribed\ndegree distribution. Each vertex carries a spin that can point either up or\ndown. Each spin interacts with a positive magnetic field, while spins at\nvertices that are connected by edges also interact with each other via a\nferromagnetic pair potential. We start from the configuration where all spins\npoint down, and allow spins to flip up or down according to a Metropolis\ndynamics at positive temperature. We are interested in the time it takes the\nsystem to reach the configuration where all spins point up. In order to achieve\nthis transition, the system needs to create a sufficiently large droplet of\nup-spins, called critical droplet, which triggers the crossover.\n  In the limit as the temperature tends to zero, and subject to a certain\n\\emph{key hypothesis} implying metastable behaviour, the average crossover time\nfollows the classical \\emph{Arrhenius law}, with an exponent and a prefactor\nthat are controlled by the \\emph{energy} and the \\emph{entropy} of the critical\ndroplet.

In this case, the form-factors\ncorresponding to distinct states are dissimilar, and the increments in phases\nof X-rays scattered by different heads are different as well. Inasmuch as every\nquantum of radiation interacts with the heads residing in different states,\nthis results in additional interference and some peaks in the X-ray pattern\nshould slacken or even extinct as compared with the pattern from the heads with\nthe continuous-type conformation.

One can design an optimal estimator of\nthe kSZ effect of the CGM with a matched filter, and construct the cross\ncorrelation between the estimator and the peculiar velocity recovered from the\ngalaxy survey, which can be measured by stacking a number of galaxies. We\ninvestigate two compelling profiles for the CGM, the MB profile (Maller &\nBullock 2004) and the $\\beta$ profile, and estimate the detectability against\nthe synergy of a fiducial galaxy survey with number density $10^{-3}h^3\\,$\nMpc$^{-3}$ and an ACT-like SZ survey. We show that the shape of the filter does\nnot change much with redshift for the $\\beta$ profile, while there are\nsignificant side lobes at $z<0.1$ for the MB profile. By stacking $\\sim 10^4$\nMilky Way-size halos around z $\\sim 0.5$, one can get $\\gtrsim$ 1 $\\sigma$\nsignal to noise (S/N) for the both profiles.

Due to the large\nbeam size, a Planck-like CMB survey can marginally detect the kSZ signal by\nstacking the same number of galaxies at $z<0.1$. The search for the CGM in\nrealistic surveys will involve dividing the galaxies into subsamples with\nsimilar redshift and mass of host halos, and scaling the results presented here\nto obtain the S/N.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 12:23:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The magnitude of the\ninorganic-framework deformation depends sensitively on the orientation of the\norganic cation, and directly influences the stability of the hybrid\nperovskites.

The vdW-induced lattice-constant corrections are system dependent\nand lead to PBE+vdW lattice constants in good agreement with experiment.\nFurther insight is gained by analysing the vdW contributions. In all\niodide-based hybrid perovskites the interaction between the organic cation and\nthe iodide anions provides the largest lattice-constant change, followed by\niodine-iodine and the organic cation - heavy-metal cation interaction.

They can be used to simplify expressions, derive equalities, and do\ncomputations. Yet in order to replace conventional formalisms, rigour alone is\nnot sufficient: the new formalisms also need to have equivalent deductive\npower. This requirement is captured by the property of completeness, which\nmeans that any equality that can be derived using some standard formalism can\nalso be derived graphically.\n  In this thesis, I consider the ZX-calculus, a graphical language for pure\nstate qubit quantum mechanics. I show that it is complete for pure state\nstabilizer quantum mechanics, so any problem within this fragment of quantum\ntheory can be fully analysed using graphical methods. This includes questions\nof central importance in areas such as error-correcting codes or\nmeasurement-based quantum computation. Furthermore, I show that the ZX-calculus\nis complete for the single-qubit Clifford+T group, which is approximately\nuniversal: any single-qubit unitary can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy\nusing only Clifford gates and the T-gate. [...] Lastly, I extend the use of\nrigorous graphical languages outside quantum theory to Spekkens' toy theory, a\nlocal hidden variable model that nevertheless exhibits some features commonly\nassociated with quantum mechanics. [...] I develop a graphical calculus similar\nto the ZX-calculus that fully describes Spekkens' toy theory, and show that it\nis complete. Hence, stabilizer quantum mechanics and Spekkens' toy theory can\nbe fully analysed and compared using graphical formalisms.\n  Intuitive graphical languages can replace conventional formalisms for the\nanalysis of many questions in quantum computation and foundations without loss\nof mathematical rigour or deductive power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 13:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-01"}

This study presents the\nevaluation of such a model using a combined experimental-numerical approach.\nThe model geometry and tissue boundaries are derived from MRI.

The non-linear elastic behavior\nwas modeled using 2nd order Ogden hyperelastic formulations, and\nviscoelasticity was modeled using the quasi-linear theory of viscoelasticity.\nTo determine the material parameters for each tissue, an inverse FEA based\noptimization routine was used that minimizes the combined mean of the squared\nforce differences between the numerical and experimental force-time curves for\nindentations at 4 distinct anatomical regions on the residuum. The optimization\nprovided the following material parameters for the skin-adipose layer: c=5.22\nkPa, m=4.79, gamma=3.57 MPa, tau=0.32 s and for the muscle-soft tissue complex:\nc=5.20 kPa, m=4.78, gamma=3.47 MPa, tau=0.34 s.

The (1, 0) mode, considered to be the most favorable mode for\nTHz emission, can be stabilized by applying a small magnetic field along the\nlength of the stack. A strong field-induced enhancement of the emission power\nis also found in experiment, for an applied field around 5.9 mT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 14:11:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 16:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

Usually, lightcurves are represented as a vector\nof many statistical descriptors designed by astronomers called features. These\ndescriptors commonly demand significant computational power to calculate,\nrequire substantial research effort to develop and do not guarantee good\nperformance on the final classification task. Today, lightcurve representation\nis not entirely automatic; algorithms that extract lightcurve features are\ndesigned by humans and must be manually tuned up for every survey. The vast\namounts of data that will be generated in future surveys like LSST mean\nastronomers must develop analysis pipelines that are both scalable and\nautomated. Recently, substantial efforts have been made in the machine learning\ncommunity to develop methods that prescind from expert-designed and manually\ntuned features for features that are automatically learned from data. In this\nwork we present what is, to our knowledge, the first unsupervised feature\nlearning algorithm designed for variable stars. Our method first extracts a\nlarge number of lightcurve subsequences from a given set of photometric data,\nwhich are then clustered to find common local patterns in the time series.\nRepresentatives of these patterns, called exemplars, are then used to transform\nlightcurves of a labeled set into a new representation that can then be used to\ntrain an automatic classifier. The proposed algorithm learns the features from\nboth labeled and unlabeled lightcurves, overcoming the bias generated when the\nlearning process is done only with labeled data. We test our method on MACHO\nand OGLE datasets; the results show that the classification performance we\nachieve is as good and in some cases better than the performance achieved using\ntraditional features, while the computational cost is significantly lower.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 14:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

We measure the count-in-sphere, $N(<\\! r)$,\ni.e. the average number of objects around a given object, and its logarithmic\nderivative, the fractal correlation dimension, $D_2(r)$. For a homogeneous\ndistribution $N(<\\! r) \\propto r^3$ and $D_2(r)=3$. Due to the uncertainty on\ntracer density evolution, 3D surveys can only probe homogeneity up to a\nredshift dependence, i.e. they probe so-called \"spatial isotropy\". Our data\ndemonstrate spatial isotropy of the quasar distribution in the redshift range\n$2.2<z<2.8$ in a model-independent way, independent of any FLRW fiducial\ncosmology, resulting in $3-\\langle D_2 \\rangle < 1.7 \\times 10^{-3}$ (2\n$\\sigma$) over the range $250<r<1200 \\, h^{-1}$Mpc for the quasar distribution.\nIf we assume that quasars do not have a bias much less than unity, this implies\nspatial isotropy of the matter distribution on large scales. Then, combining\nwith the Copernican principle, we finally get homogeneity of the matter\ndistribution on large scales. Alternatively, using a flat $\\Lambda$CDM fiducial\ncosmology with CMB-derived parameters, and measuring the quasar bias relative\nto this $\\Lambda$CDM model, our data provide a consistency check of the model,\nin terms of how homogeneous the Universe is on different scales. $D_2(r)$ is\nfound to be compatible with our $\\Lambda$CDM model on the whole $10<r<1200 \\,\nh^{-1}$Mpc range.

In\nchemoradiotherapy, chemotherapeutic agents are administered along with\nradiation to increase damage to the primary tumor and control systemic disease\nsuch as metastasis. This work introduces a mathematical model to obtain optimal\ndrug and radiation protocols in a chemoradiotherapy scheduling problem with the\nobjective of minimizing metastatic cancer cell populations at multiple\npotential sites while maintaining a minimum level of damage to the primary\ntumor site. We derive closed-form expressions for an optimal chemotherapy\nfractionation regimen. A dynamic programming framework is used to determine the\noptimal radiotherapy fractionation regimen. Results show that chemotherapeutic\nagents do not change the optimal radiation fractionation regimens, and\nvice-versa. Interestingly, we observe that regardless of radio-sensitivity\nparameters, hypo-fractionated schedules are optimal solutions for the\nradiotherapy fractionation problem. Furthermore, it is optimal to immediately\nstart radiotherapy.

Universes and\nanti-universes live on M3-branes and M2 plays the role of wormhole between\nthem. By passing time, M2 dissolves in M3's and nonlinear massive gravities,\nlike Lovelock massive gravity, emerges and grows. By closing M3-branes, BIon\nevolves and wormhole between branes makes a transition to black hole. During\nthis stage, Brown-York energy increases and shrinks to large values at the\ncolliding points of branes. By approaching M3-branes towards each other, the\nsquare energy of their system becomes negative and some tachyonic states are\nproduced. To remove these states, M3-branes compact, the sign of compacted\ngravity changes, anti-gravity is created which leads to getting away of branes\nfrom each other. Also, the Lovelock gravity disappears and it's energy forms a\nnew M2 between M3-branes.

Indeed, a) the sensitivity of the gravitational wave detectors seems\nto be small for detecting gravitational waves and, b) while some experimental\ndata indicate a duration of order of hours, most theories assume that the\ncollapse develops in a few seconds. Since recent data of the X-ray NuSTAR\nsatellite show a clear evidence of an asymmetric collapse, we have revisited\nthe experimental data recorded by the underground and gravitational wave\ndetectors running during the SN1987A. New evidence is shown that con rms\nprevious results, namely that the data recorded by the gravitational wave\ndetectors running in Rome and in Maryland are strongly correlated with the data\nof both the Mont Blanc and the Kamiokande detectors, and that the correlation\nextends over a long period of time (one or two hours) centered at the Mont\nBlanc time. This result indicates that also Kamiokande detected neutrinos at\nthe Mont Blanc time, and these interactions were not identi ed because not\ngrouped in a burst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 09:53:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2016 17:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

We use the BeppoSAX, Suzaku and RXTE\n(Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer), Suzaku and BeppoSAX observations for this\ninvestigation. We argue that the X-ray broad-band spectra during all spectral\nstates can be adequately reproduced by a model, consisting of a low-temperature\nBlackbody component, two Comptonized components both due to the presence of a\nCompton cloud (CC) that up-scatters seed photons of $T_{s1}$~< 1.4 keV, and\n$T_{s2}<$1 keV, and an iron-line component. We find using this model that the\nphoton power-law index is almost constant, $\\Gamma_{1}\\sim 2$ for all spectral\nstates. However, $\\Gamma_{2}$ shows a behavior depending on the spectral state.\nNamely, $\\Gamma_{2}$ is quasi-constant at the level of $\\Gamma_{2}\\sim 2$ while\nthe CC plasma temperature $kT^{(2)}_e$ is less than 40 keV; on the other hand,\n$\\Gamma_{2}$ is in the range of $1.3<\\Gamma_{2}<2$, when $kT^{(2)}_e$ is\ngreater than 40 keV. We explain this quasi-stability of $\\Gamma$ during most of\nhard-soft transitions of 4U~1700-37 in a framework of the model in which the\nresulting spectrum is described by two Comptonized components. We find that\nthese Comptonized spectral components of the HMXB 4U~1700-37 are similar to\nthose previously found in NS sources. This index dependence versus both mass\naccretion rate and $kT_e$ revealed in 4U~1700-37 is a universal observational\nevidence for the presence of a NS in 4U 1700-37.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 09:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}
