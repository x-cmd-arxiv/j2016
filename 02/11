We simulated FCD using various truncation\nthresholds and ran a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) process on each\nnetwork.

The\n1-110 keV broad-band spectroscopy of both observations revealed that the\nbest-fit model comprised of a partially absorbed Negative and Positive power\nlaw with EXponential cutoff (NPEX) continuum model along with a blackbody\ncomponent for the soft X-ray excess and two Gaussian functions at 6.4 and 6.7\nkeV for emission lines. Both the lines were identified as emission from neutral\nand He-like iron atom. To fit the spectra, we included the previously reported\ncyclotron absorption line at 12.2 keV. From the spin-up rate, the magnetic\nfield of the pulsar was estimated to be $\\sim$1.2$\\times$10$^{12}$ G and found\nto be comparable to that obtained from the detection of the cyclotron\nabsorption feature. Pulse-phase resolved spectroscopy revealed the pulsating\nnature of the soft X-ray excess component in phase with the continuum flux.\nThis confirms that the accretion column and/or accretion stream are the most\nprobable regions of pulsar's soft X-ray excess emission. The presence of the\npulsating soft X-ray excess in phase with continuum emission may be the\npossible reason for not observing the dip at soft X-rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 17:27:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

It can be theoretically constructed from both the black\nhole quasinormal frequencies (which govern its oscillating behavior and its\ndecay) and the associated excitation factors (which determine intrinsically its\namplitude) by carefully taking into account the source of the distortion. In\nthe framework of massive gravity, the excitation factors of the Schwarzschild\nblack hole have an unexpected strong resonant behavior which, theoretically,\ncould lead to giant and slowly decaying ringings. If massive gravity is\nrelevant to physics, one can hope to observe these extraordinary ringings by\nusing the next generations of gravitational wave detectors. Indeed, they could\nbe generated by supermassive black holes if the graviton mass is not too small.\nIn fact, by focusing on the odd-parity $\\ell=1$ mode of the Fierz-Pauli field,\nwe shall show here that such ringings are neutralized in waveforms due to (i)\nthe excitation of the quasibound states of the black hole and (ii) the\nevanescent nature of the particular partial modes which could excite the\nconcerned quasinormal modes.

The chemistry of the diffuse interstellar medium rests upon three\npillars: exothermic ion-neutral reactions (\" cold chemistry \"), endothermic\nneutral-neutral reactions with significant activation barriers (\" warm\nchemistry \"), and reactions on the surfaces of dust grains. While warm\nchemistry becomes important in the shocks associated with turbulent dissipation\nregions, the main path for the formation of interstellar OH and H2O is that of\ncold chemistry. Aims. The aim of this study is to observationally confirm the\nassociation of atomic oxygen with both atomic and molecular gas phases, and to\nunderstand the measured abundances of OH and OH + as a function of the\navailable reservoir of H2. Methods. We obtained absorption spectra of the\nground states of OH, OH+ and OI with high-velocity resolution, with GREAT\non-board SOFIA, and with the THz receiver at the APEX. We analyzed them along\nwith ancillary spectra of HF and CH from HIFI. To deconvolve them from the\nhyperfine structure and to separate the blend that is due to various velocity\ncomponents on the sightline, we fit model spectra consisting of an appropriate\nnumber of Gaussian profiles using a method combining simulated annealing with\ndownhill simplex minimization. Together with HF and/or CH as a surrogate for\nH2, and HI $\\lambda$21 cm data, the molecular hydrogen fraction f^N\\_H2 = N(H\n2)/(N(H) + 2N(H 2)) can be determined. We then investigated abundance ratios as\na function of f^N\\_H2. Results. The column density of OI is correlated at a\nhigh significance with the amount of available molecular and atomic hydrogen,\nwith an atomic oxygen abundance of $3 \\times 10 ^{-4}$ relative to H nuclei.\nWhile the velocities of the absorption features of OH and OH+ are loosely\ncorrelated and reflect the spiral arm crossings on the sightline, upon closer\ninspection they display an anticorrespondence. The arm-to-interarm density\ncontrast is found to be higher in OH than in OH+. While both species can\ncoexist, with a higher abundance in OH than in OH+, the latter is found less\nfrequently in absence of OH than the other way around, which is a direct\nconsequence of the rapid destruction of OH+ by dissociative recombination when\nnot enough H2 is available. This conjecture has been substantiated by a\ncomparison between the OH/OH+ ratio with f^N\\_H2, showing a clear correlation.\nThe hydrogen abstraction reaction chain OH+ (H2,H) H2O+ (H2,H)H3O+ is confirmed\nas the pathway for the production of OH and H 2 O. Our estimate of the\nbranching ratio of the dissociative recombination of H3O+ to OH and H2O is\nconfined within the interval of 84 to 91%, which matches laboratory\nmeasurements (74 to 83%). -- A correlation between the linewidths and column\ndensities of OH+ features is found to be significant with a false-alarm\nprobability below 5%. Such a correlation is predicted by models of interstellar\nMHD turbulence. For OH the same correlation is found to be insignificant\nbecause there are more narrow absorption features. Conclusions. While it is\ndifficult to assess the contributions of warm neutral-neutral chemistry to the\nobserved abundances, it seems fair to conclude that the predictions of cold\nion-neutral chemistry match the abundance patterns we observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 18:18:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-11"}

Some of the consequences of this theorem\nare the following. $(i)$ If $L=\\operatorname{Lie}(G)$ is such a Lie algebra and\n$C$ is any Cartan subalgebra of $L$, then the $G$-orbit of $C^{\\perp}$ is all\nof $L$. $(ii)$ The consequence in part $(i)$ answers a question by L.

Such markets have emerged recently as popular venues\nfor collecting annotations that are crucial in training machine learning models\nin various applications. However, as jobs are tedious and payments are low,\nerrors are common in such crowdsourced labels. A common strategy to overcome\nsuch noise in the answers is to add redundancy by getting multiple answers for\neach task and aggregating them using some methods such as majority voting. For\nsuch a system, there is a fundamental question of interest: how can we maximize\nthe accuracy given a fixed budget on how many responses we can collect on the\ncrowdsourcing system. We characterize this fundamental trade-off between the\nbudget (how many answers the requester can collect in total) and the accuracy\nin the estimated labels. In particular, we ask whether adaptive task assignment\nschemes lead to a more efficient trade-off between the accuracy and the budget.\n  Adaptive schemes, where tasks are assigned adaptively based on the data\ncollected thus far, are widely used in practical crowdsourcing systems to\nefficiently use a given fixed budget. However, existing theoretical analyses of\ncrowdsourcing systems suggest that the gain of adaptive task assignments is\nminimal. To bridge this gap, we investigate this question under a strictly more\ngeneral probabilistic model, which has been recently introduced to model\npractical crowdsourced annotations. Under this generalized Dawid-Skene model,\nwe characterize the fundamental trade-off between budget and accuracy. We\nintroduce a novel adaptive scheme that matches this fundamental limit. We\nfurther quantify the fundamental gap between adaptive and non-adaptive schemes,\nby comparing the trade-off with the one for non-adaptive schemes.

The theory is implemented in the\nthree-state Zwanzig approximation, where only three mutually perpendicular\ndirections are allowed for the orientations of hard rods. The effect of varying\nshape anisotropy is examined at L/D=10, 15 and 20. In contact with a single\nhard wall, the density profiles show planar ordering, damped oscillatory\nbehavior, and wall induced surface ordering transition below the coexisting\nisotropic density of bulk isotropic-nematic (I-N) phase transition. Upon\napproaching the coexisting isotropic density, the thickness of nematic film\ndiverges logarithmically, i.e. the nematic wetting is complete for any shape\nanisotropy. In the case of confinement between two parallel hard walls, it is\nfound that the continuous surface ordering transition depends strongly on the\ndistance between confining walls (H) for H<L, while it depends weakly on H for\nH>L. The minimal density at which a surface ordering transition can be realized\nis located at around H~2D for all studied shape anisotropies due to the strong\ninterference effect between the two hard walls. The first order I-N phase\ntransition of the bulk system becomes surface ordered isotropic (IB)-capillary\nnematic (NB) phase transition in the slit pore. This first order IB-NB\ntransition weakens with decreasing pore width and terminates in a critical\npoint for all studied shape anisotropies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 19:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

For\nexample, humans often maximize their expected reward when gambling and this is\nconsidered as a \"rational\" decision.

If someone has experienced a\nlosing streak, they may \"feel\" that they are more likely to win on the next\nhand even though the odds of the game have not changed. That is, their\ndecisions are driven by their emotional state. In this paper, we investigate\nhow the human brain responds to wins and losses during gambling. Using a\ncombination of local field potential recordings in human subjects performing a\nfinancial decision-making task, spectral analyses, and non-parametric cluster\nstatistics, we investigated whether neural responses in different cognitive and\nlimbic brain areas differ between wins and losses after decisions are made. In\neleven subjects, the neural activity modulated significantly between win and\nloss trials in one brain region: the anterior insula ($p=0.01$). In particular,\ngamma activity (30-70 Hz) increased in the anterior insula when subjects just\nrealized that they won. Modulation of metabolic activity in the anterior insula\nhas been observed previously in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies\nduring decision making and when emotions are elicited. However, our study is\nable to characterize temporal dynamics of electrical activity in this brain\nregion at the millisecond resolution while decisions are made and after\noutcomes are revealed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 19:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-11"}

Their role in galaxy formation and evolution\nremains an active area of research in modern-day astrophysics. The extreme UV\nbackground remains mostly unexplored and will be a challenge to measure due to\nthe high Galactic background and absorption of extragalactic photons by the\nintergalactic medium at these EUV/soft X-ray energies. We also summarize our\nunderstanding of the spatial anisotropies and angular power spectra of\nintensity fluctuations. We motivate a precise direct measurement of the COB\nbetween 0.1 to 5 microns using a small aperture telescope observing either from\nthe outer Solar system, at distances of 5 AU or more, or out of the ecliptic\nplane. Other future applications include improving our understanding of the\nbackground at TeV energies and spectral distortions of CMB and CIB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 20:47:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-11"}

They are\nframed within the induced gravitational collapse (IGC) paradigm with progenitor\na CO$_{\\rm core}$-NS/BH binary. The supernova (SN) explosion of the CO$_{\\rm\ncore}$ triggers an accretion process onto the NS/BH. If the accretion does not\nlead the NS to its critical mass, an XRF occurs, while when the BH is present\nor formed by accretion, a BdHN occurs. When the binaries are not disrupted,\nXRFs lead to NS-NS and BdHNe lead to NS-BH. The short bursts, originating in\nNS-NS, are subclassified as (IV) short gamma-ray flashes (S-GRFs) and (V) short\nGRBs (S-GRBs), the latter when a BH is formed. There are (VI) ultra-short GRBs\n(U-GRBs) and (VII) gamma-ray flashes (GRFs), respectively formed in NS-BH and\nNS-WD. We use the occurrence rate and GW emission of these subclasses to assess\ntheir detectability by Advanced LIGO-Virgo, eLISA, and resonant bars. We\ndiscuss the consequences of our results in view of the announcement of the\nLIGO-Virgo Collaboration of the source GW 170817 as being originated by a\nNS-NS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 21:39:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 12:51:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 15:45:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2016 15:49:19 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 11:58:42 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 17:54:25 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 15:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

In this paper we apply\nworst-case optimal join algorithms to a standard RDF workload, the LUBM\nbenchmark, for the first time. We do so using two worst-case optimal engines:\n(1) LogicBlox, a commercial database engine, and (2) EmptyHeaded, our prototype\nresearch engine with enhanced worst-case optimal join algorithms. We show that\nwithout any added optimizations both LogicBlox and EmptyHeaded outperform two\nstate-of-the-art specialized RDF engines, RDF-3X and TripleBit, by up to 6x on\ncyclic join queries-the queries where traditional optimizers are suboptimal. On\nthe remaining, less complex queries in the LUBM benchmark, we show that three\nclassic query optimization techniques enable EmptyHeaded to compete with RDF\nengines, even when there is no asymptotic advantage to the worst-case optimal\napproach.

In particular, the algorithms accurately\nrecover the exact values of the measures in all cases in which these values are\nknown by geometrical arguments. Positive results, which confirm some\nconjectural values given in [13] and [14] for the measures, are also obtained\nfor an intermediate range of larger contraction ratios. We give an argument\nshowing that, for this range of contraction ratios, the problem is inherently\ncomputational in the sense that any theoretical proof, such as those mentioned\nabove, might be impossible, so that in these cases, our method is the only\navailable approach. For contraction ratios close to those of the connected case\nour computational method becomes intractably time consuming, so the computation\nof the exact values of the packing and centered Hausdorff measures in the\ngeneral case, with the open set condition, remains a challenging problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 23:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

While\nthree-dimensional topological insulators are becoming abundant, two-dimensional\ntopological insulators remain rare, particularly in natural materials. ZrTe5\nhas host a long-standing puzzle on its anomalous transport properties; its\nunderlying origin remains elusive. Lately, ZrTe5 has ignited renewed interest\nbecause it is predicted that single-layer ZrTe5 is a two-dimensional\ntopological insulator and there is possibly a topological phase transition in\nbulk ZrTe5. However, the topological nature of ZrTe5 is under debate as some\nexperiments point to its being a three-dimensional or quasi-two-dimensional\nDirac semimetal. Here we report high-resolution laser-based angle-resolved\nphotoemission measurements on ZrTe5. The electronic property of ZrTe5 is\ndominated by two branches of nearly-linear-dispersion bands at the Brillouin\nzone center. These two bands are separated by an energy gap that decreases with\ndecreasing temperature but persists down to the lowest temperature we measured\n(~2 K). The overall electronic structure exhibits a dramatic temperature\ndependence; it evolves from a p-type semimetal with a hole-like Fermi pocket at\nhigh temperature, to a semiconductor around ~135 K where its resistivity\nexhibits a peak, to an n-type semimetal with an electron-like Fermi pocket at\nlow temperature. These results indicate a clear electronic evidence of the\ntemperature-induced Lifshitz transition in ZrTe5. They provide a natural\nunderstanding on the underlying origin of the resistivity anomaly at ~135 K and\nits associated reversal of the charge carrier type.

We first identify the representative and\ndiverse exemplar clusters within each scale by using a diversity ranking\nalgorithm. Object proposals are obtained by selecting a subset from the\nmulti-scale segment pool via maximizing a submodular objective function, which\nconsists of a weighted coverage term, a single-scale diversity term and a\nmulti-scale reward term. The weighted coverage term forces the selected set of\nobject proposals to be representative and compact; the single-scale diversity\nterm encourages choosing segments from different exemplar clusters so that they\nwill cover as many object patterns as possible; the multi-scale reward term\nencourages the selected proposals to be discriminative and selected from\nmultiple layers generated by the hierarchical image segmentation. The\nexperimental results on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset and PASCAL VOC2012\nsegmentation dataset demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our object\nproposal model.

These MSPs are expected to eject energetic\nleptons. Therefore, GCs have been proposed to produce GeV-TeV gamma-rays as a\nresult of the comptonization process of the background radiation within a GC.\nWe develop this general scenario by taking into account not only the diffusion\nprocess of leptons within a GC but also their advection with the wind from the\nGC. Moreover, we consider distribution of MSP within a GC and the effects\nrelated to the non-central location of the dominating, energetic MSP.

Three such\n\"Pulsar Timing Arrays\" (PTAs) have been set up around the world over the past\ndecades and collectively form the \"International\" PTA (IPTA). In this paper, we\ndescribe the first joint analysis of the data from the three regional PTAs,\ni.e. of the first IPTA data set.

Particular attention is paid to subtle details (such as\nunderestimation of measurement uncertainty and long-period noise) that have\noften been ignored but which become important in this unprecedentedly large and\ninhomogeneous data set. We identify and describe in detail several factors that\ncomplicate IPTA research and provide recommendations for future pulsar timing\nefforts.

The question remains wide open regarding\nhow such a structure could have emerged. Furthermore a clear mathematical\nframework to quantify this phenomenon is still lacking. The aim of this paper\nis that of addressing these two aspects in a self-consistent way. First, we\nintroduce suitable measures to quantify the level of combinatoriality and\ncompositionality in a language, and present a framework to estimate these\nobservables in human natural languages.

This so called {\\it\nbig data era} we are currently living calls for devising online subspace\nlearning algorithms that can suitably handle incomplete data. Their envisaged\nobjective is to {\\it recursively} estimate the unknown subspace by processing\nstreaming data sequentially, thus reducing computational complexity, while\nobviating the need for storing the whole dataset in memory. In this paper, an\nonline variational Bayes subspace learning algorithm from partial observations\nis presented. To account for the unawareness of the true rank of the subspace,\ncommonly met in practice, low-rankness is explicitly imposed on the sought\nsubspace data matrix by exploiting sparse Bayesian learning principles.\nMoreover, sparsity, {\\it simultaneously} to low-rankness, is favored on the\nsubspace matrix by the sophisticated hierarchical Bayesian scheme that is\nadopted. In doing so, the proposed algorithm becomes adept in dealing with\napplications whereby the underlying subspace may be also sparse, as, e.g., in\nsparse dictionary learning problems. As shown, the new subspace tracking scheme\noutperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts in terms of estimation accuracy,\nin a variety of experiments conducted on simulated and real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2016 10:47:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 10:27:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-15"}

Materials and\nMethods: The clinically meaningful representations of medical concepts and\npatients are the key for health analytic applications. Most of existing\napproaches directly construct features mapped to raw data (e.g., ICD or CPT\ncodes), or utilize some ontology mapping such as SNOMED codes. However, none of\nthe existing approaches leverage EHR data directly for learning such concept\nrepresentation. We propose a new way to represent heterogeneous medical\nconcepts (e.g., diagnoses, medications and procedures) based on co-occurrence\npatterns in longitudinal electronic health records. The intuition behind the\nmethod is to map medical concepts that are co-occuring closely in time to\nsimilar concept vectors so that their distance will be small.

Very young PMS stars show, similarly to\nMS stars, intense magnetic activity. However they do not show clear\nactivity-rotation trends, and it still debated which stellar parameters\ndetermine their magnetic activity levels. To bridge the gap between MS and PMS\nstars, we studied the activity-rotation relation in the young cluster h Per, a\n~13 Myr old cluster, that contains both fast and slow rotators, whose members\nhave ended their accretion phase and have already developed a radiative core.\nIt offers us the opportunity to study the activity level of intermediate-age\nPMS stars with different rotational velocities, excluding any interactions with\nthe circumstellar environment. We constrained the magnetic activity levels of h\nPer members measuring their X-ray emission from a Chandra observation, while\nP_rot were obtained by Moraux et al. (2013). We collected a final catalog of\n414 h Per members with known P_rot, T_eff, M_star, with 169 of them having also\ndetected X-ray emission. We found that h Per members, with 1.0 M_sun < M_star <\n1.4 M_sun, display different activity regimes: fast rotators show\nsupersaturation, while slower rotators have activity levels compatible to the\nnon-saturated regime. At 13 Myr h Per is therefore the youngest cluster showing\nactivity-rotation regimes analogous to that of MS stars, indicating that, at\nthis age, magnetic field production is likely regulated by the alpha-Omega type\ndynamo. Moreover we observed that supersaturation is better described by P_rot\nthan Ro, and that the observed patterns are compatible with the hypothesis of\ncentrifugal stripping.

The most common form of LMMs\nutilize a normal distribution to model the random effects. Such assumptions can\noften lead to misspecification errors when the random effects are not normal.\nOne approach to remedy the misspecification errors is to utilize a point-mass\ndistribution to model the random effects; this is known as the nonparametric\nmaximum likelihood-fitted (NPML) model. The NPML model is flexible but requires\na large number of parameters to characterize the random-effects distribution.\nIt is often natural to assume that the random-effects distribution be at least\nmarginally symmetric. The marginally symmetric NPML (MSNPML) random-effects\nmodel is introduced, which assumes a marginally symmetric point-mass\ndistribution for the random effects. Under the symmetry assumption, the MSNPML\nmodel utilizes half the number of parameters to characterize the same number of\npoint masses as the NPML model; thus the model confers an advantage in economy\nand parsimony. An EM-type algorithm is presented for the maximum likelihood\n(ML) estimation of LMMs with MSNPML random effects; the algorithm is shown to\nmonotonically increase the log-likelihood and is proven to be convergent to a\nstationary point of the log-likelihood function in the case of convergence.\nFurthermore, it is shown that the ML estimator is consistent and asymptotically\nnormal under certain conditions, and the estimation of quantities such as the\nrandom-effects covariance matrix and individual a posteriori expectations is\ndemonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2016 12:20:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2016 23:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-16"}

We present a novel\nhigh-harmonic source driven by a 100 kHz fiber laser system, which delivers\n10$^{11}$ photons/s in a single 1.3 eV bandwidth harmonic at 68.6 eV. The\ncombination of record-high photon flux and high repetition rate paves the way\nfor time-resolved studies of the dissociation dynamics of inner-shell ionized\nmolecules in a coincidence detection scheme. First coincidence measurements on\nCH$_3$I are shown and it is outlined how the anticipated advancement of fiber\nlaser technology and improved sample delivery will, in the next step, allow\npump-probe studies of ultrafast molecular dynamics with table-top XUV-photon\nsources. These table-top sources can provide significantly higher repetition\nrates than the currently operating free-electron lasers and they offer very\nhigh temporal resolution due to the intrinsically small timing jitter between\npump and probe pulses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2016 12:36:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 07:07:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

Software-defined\nnetworking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that can solve aforementioned issues\nusing a logically centralized controller for network devices. In this paper, we\npropose a SDN-based solution called SDxVPN which considerably lowers the\ncomplexity of VPN service definition and management.

These difficulties include the violation of fundamental physical\nprinciples such as energy conservation, positivity conditions on the density,\nor unchanging natural orbital occupation numbers. We review some of the recent\nefforts to confront these problems, and explore a semiclassical approximation\nfor electron correlation coupled to time-dependent Hartree-Fock propagation. We\nfind that this approach captures changing occupation numbers, and excitations\nto doubly-excited states, improving over TDHF and adiabatic approximations in\ndensity-matrix propagation. However, it does not guarantee $N$-representability\nof the density-matrix, consequently resulting sometimes in violation of\npositivity conditions, even though a purely semiclassical treatment preserves\nthese conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2016 13:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-12"}

Conventional imaging modalities used to ensure exact\npositioning for treatment typically involve additional radiation exposure of\nthe patient. A different approach to patient alignment without additional\nexposure is provided by optical 3D surface scanning and registration systems.\n  We investigated two systems Catalyst and AlignRT, which allowed us to\ngenerate and validate surface images of 50 patients undergoing irradiation on a\nTomotherapy system. We compared the positions proposed by these two surface\nimaging systems (SIS) with the actual adjustments in patient positions made on\nthe basis of MVCT scans. With the two SIS, the surface of every single patient\nwas repeatedly recorded throughout treatment. In addition, we performed a\nsystematic analysis of both systems using a body phantom.\n  At least 10 surface images were available from each patient included in the\nanalysis. The large number of patients allowed us to subdivide the study\npopulation into three groups by body region treated: head & neck, chest, and\npelvic. The results for each of these three body regions were separately\nanalyzed. Thus, the focus of our investigation is on body regions registered\nwith the two systems rather than tumor entities.

To distinguish such models from genuine quantum physical\nmodels, they often called quantum-like (although often people simply speak\nabout, e.g., \"quantum cognition\"). These novel applications generate a number\nof foundational questions. Nowadays we can speak about a new science -\nfoundations of quantum-like modeling. At the first stage this science was\nmainly about comparison of classical and quantum models, mainly in the\nprobabilistic setting. It was found that statistical data from cognitive\npsychology violate some basic constraints posed on data by classical\nprobability theory (Kolmogorov, 1933); in particular, the constraints given by\nthe formula of total probability and Bell's type inequalities. Recently another\nquestion attracted some attention. In spite of real success in applications,\nthere are no reason to believe that the quantum probability would cover\ncompletely all problems of, e.g., cognition. May be more general probability\nmodels have to be explored. A similar problem attracted a lot of attention in\nfoundations of quantum physics culminating in a series of experiments to check\nSorkin's equality for the triple-slit experiment by Weihs' group. In this note\nwe present a similar test in the cognitive experimental setting. Performance of\nthis test would either give further confirmation of the adequacy of the quantum\nprobability model to cognitive applications or rejection of the conventional\nquantum model. Thus this note opens the door for a series of exciting\nexperimental tests for the quantum-like model of cognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2016 09:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}
