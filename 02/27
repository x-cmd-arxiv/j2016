The conventional\nenvironmental temperature in thermal systems is too weak to drive movements of\nparticles in granular powders and cannot function as a thermal energy\nindicator. For maintaining the same functionality as in thermal systems, the\ntemperature in granular powders is defined analogously and uniformly in this\narticle. The newly defined granular temperature is utilized to describe and\nexplain one of the most important phenomena observed in granular powders, the\njamming transition, by introducing jamming temperature and jamming volume\nfraction concepts. The predictions from the equations of the jamming volume\nfractions for several cases like granular powders under shear or vibration are\nin line with experimental observations and empirical solutions in powder\nhandlings. The goal of this article is to establish similar concepts in\ngranular powders, allowing granular powders to be described with common laws or\nprinciples we are familiar with in thermal systems.

Its role is almost as important as the choice of a coronagraph or a\nwavefront control system, and it is intertwined with the chosen observing\nstrategy. Among the data processing techniques for angular differential imaging\n(ADI), the most recent is the family of principal component analysis (PCA)\nbased algorithms. PCA serves, in this case, as a subspace projection technique\nfor constructing a reference point spread function (PSF) that can be subtracted\nfrom the science data for boosting the detectability of potential companions\npresent in the data. Unfortunately, when building this reference PSF from the\nscience data itself, PCA comes with certain limitations such as the sensitivity\nof the lower dimensional orthogonal subspace to non-Gaussian noise. Inspired by\nrecent advances in machine learning algorithms such as robust PCA, we aim to\npropose a localized subspace projection technique that surpasses current\nPCA-based post-processing algorithms in terms of the detectability of\ncompanions at near real-time speed, a quality that will be useful for future\ndirect imaging surveys. We used randomized low-rank approximation methods\nrecently proposed in the machine learning literature, coupled with entry-wise\nthresholding to decompose an ADI image sequence locally into low-rank, sparse,\nand Gaussian noise components (LLSG). This local three-term decomposition\nseparates the starlight and the associated speckle noise from the planetary\nsignal, which mostly remains in the sparse term. We tested the performance of\nour new algorithm on a long ADI sequence obtained on beta Pictoris with\nVLT/NACO.

However, it is unclear\nprecisely how well JWST will perform and which of its myriad instruments and\nobserving modes will be best suited for transiting exoplanet studies. In this\narticle, we describe a prefatory JWST Early Release Science (ERS) program that\nfocuses on testing specific observing modes to quickly give the community the\ndata and experience it needs to plan more efficient and successful future\ntransiting exoplanet characterization programs. We propose a multi-pronged\napproach wherein one aspect of the program focuses on observing transits of a\nsingle target with all of the recommended observing modes to identify and\nunderstand potential systematics, compare transmission spectra at overlapping\nand neighboring wavelength regions, confirm throughputs, and determine overall\nperformances. In our search for transiting exoplanets that are well suited to\nachieving these goals, we identify 12 objects (dubbed \"community targets\") that\nmeet our defined criteria. Currently, the most favorable target is WASP-62b\nbecause of its large predicted signal size, relatively bright host star, and\nlocation in JWST's continuous viewing zone. Since most of the community targets\ndo not have well-characterized atmospheres, we recommend initiating preparatory\nobserving programs to determine the presence of obscuring clouds/hazes within\ntheir atmospheres.

The fastest hashing algorithm is by\nIoffe \\cite{Proc:Ioffe_ICDM10}, which requires one pass over the entire data\nvector, $O(d)$ ($d$ is the number of non-zeros), for computing one hash.\nHowever, the requirement of multiple hashes demands hundreds or thousands\npasses over the data.

Moreover, our\nproposal only needs a few bits (5 - 9 bits) of storage per hash value compared\nto around $64$ bits required by the state-of-art-methodologies.

Assuming an\ninitial chiral asymmetry in the symmetric phase at temperatures higher than the\ntransition temperature, as well as the existence of magnetic fields, it is\ndemonstrated that the asymmetry typically grows with time, until it undergoes a\nfast decrease at the transition, and then eventually gets damped at lower\ntemperatures in the broken phase. We argue that it is unlikely to have any\nsignificant magnetic field amplification as a consequence of the electroweak\ntransition in the Standard model, even when the chiral anomaly is introduced.\nThe presence of a chiral asymmetry between left- and right-handed charge\ncarriers naturally leads to the creation of helical magnetic fields from\nnon-helical fields and this can have consequences on their subsequent\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 17:59:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 14:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-17"}

This\nopens perspectives for novel quantum simulators of finite-range interacting\nsystems, even though the light-induced interaction is global (i.e. infinitely\nlong range). This is achieved by spatial structuring of the global light-matter\ncoupling at a microscopic scale. Such simulators can directly benefit from the\ncollective enhancement of the global light-matter interaction and constitute an\nalternative to standard approaches using Rydberg atoms or polar molecules. The\nsystem in the steady state of light induces effective many-body interactions\nthat change the landscape of the phase diagram of the typical Bose-Hubbard\nmodel. Therefore, the system can support non-trivial superfluid states, bosonic\ndimer, trimers, etc. states and supersolid phases depending on the choice of\nthe wavelength and pattern of the light with respect to the classical optical\nlattice potential.

In such scenarios,\none usually has to deal with sparse data, which significantly aggravates the\nproblem of reconstruction. However, medical applications often provide\ncontextual information about the 3D point data that allow to incorporate prior\nknowledge about the shape that is to be reconstructed. To this end, we propose\nthe use of a statistical shape model (SSM) as a prior for surface\nreconstruction.

In particular, we study the creation\nof quantum coherence using unitary operations with limited thermodynamic\nresources. We first find the maximal coherence that can be created under\nunitary operations starting from a thermal state and find explicitly the\nunitary transformation that creates the maximal coherence. Since coherence is\ncreated by unitary operations starting from a thermal state, it requires some\namount of energy. This motivates us to explore the trade-off between the amount\nof coherence that can be created and the energy cost of the unitary process. We\nfind the maximal achievable coherence under the constraint on the available\nenergy. Additionally, we compare the maximal coherence and the maximal total\ncorrelation that can be created under unitary transformations with the same\navailable energy at our disposal. We find that when maximal coherence is\ncreated with limited energy, the total correlation created in the process is\nupper bounded by the maximal coherence and vice versa.

This paper proposes three simple and intuitive\nBayesian algorithms for adaptively allocating measurement effort, and\nformalizes a sense in which these seemingly naive rules are the best possible.\nOne proposal is top-two probability sampling, which computes the two designs\nwith the highest posterior probability of being optimal, and then randomizes to\nselect among these two.

It has been suggested that some such events are visible as\nlayers of nitrate in ice cores, yielding archives of energetic, high fluence\nsolar proton events (SPEs). There has been controversy, due to slowness of\ntransport for these species down from the upper stratosphere; past numerical\nsimulations based on an analytic calculation have shown very little ionization\nbelow the mid stratosphere. These simulations suffer from deficiencies: they\nconsider only soft SPEs and narrow energy ranges; spectral fits are poorly\nchosen; with few exceptions secondary particles in air showers are ignored.\nUsing improved simulations that follow development of the proton-induced air\nshower, we find consistency with recent experiments showing substantial excess\nionization down to 5 km. We compute nitrate available from the 23 February 1956\nSPE, which had a high fluence, hard spectrum, and well-resolved associated\nnitrate peak in a Greenland ice core. For the first time, we find this event\ncan account for ice core data with timely (~ 2 months) transport downward\nbetween 46 km and the surface, thus indicating an archive of high fluence, hard\nspectrum SPE covering the last several millennia. We discuss interpretations of\nthis result, as well as the lack of a clearly-defined nitrate spike associated\nwith the soft-spectrum 3-4 August 1972 SPE. We suggest that hard-spectrum SPEs,\nespecially in the 6 months of polar winter, are detectable in ice cores, and\nthat more work needs to be done to investigate this.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 20:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-28"}

Here monolayer VS$_2$ in both the trigonal\nprismatic and octahedral phases is investigated using density functional theory\nplus Hubbard $U$ (DFT+$U$) calculations. Trigonal prismatic VS$_2$ has an\nisolated low-energy band that emerges from a confluence of crystal field\nsplitting and direct V--V hopping. Within spin density functional theory,\nferromagnetism splits the isolated band of the trigonal prismatic structure,\nleading to a low-band-gap $S=1/2$ ferromagnetic Stoner insulator; the\noctahedral phase is higher in energy. Including the on-site interaction $U$\nincreases the band gap, leads to Mott insulating behavior, and for sufficiently\nhigh values stabilizes the ferromagnetic octahedral phase. The validity of DFT\nand DFT+$U$ for these two-dimensional materials with potential for strong\nelectronic correlations is discussed. A clear benchmark is given by examining\nthe experimentally observed charge density wave (CDW) in octahedral VS$_2$, for\nwhich DFT grossly overestimates the bond length differences compared to known\nexperiments; the presence of CDWs is also probed for the trigonal prismatic\nphase. Finally, we investigate why only the octahedral phase has been observed\nin experiments and discuss the possibility of realizing the trigonal prismatic\nphase. Our work suggests trigonal prismatic VS$_2$ is a promising candidate for\nstrongly correlated electron physics that, if realized, could be experimentally\nprobed in an unprecedented fashion due to its monolayer nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 20:59:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

The event, initially designated G184098 and later given\nthe name GW150914, is described in detail elsewhere. By prior arrangement,\npreliminary estimates of the time, significance, and sky location of the event\nwere shared with 63 teams of observers covering radio, optical, near-infrared,\nX-ray, and gamma-ray wavelengths with ground- and space-based facilities. In\nthis Letter we describe the low-latency analysis of the GW data and present the\nsky localization of the first observed compact binary merger. We summarize the\nfollow-up observations reported by 25 teams via private Gamma-ray Coordinates\nNetwork circulars, giving an overview of the participating facilities, the GW\nsky localization coverage, the timeline and depth of the observations. As this\nevent turned out to be a binary black hole merger, there is little expectation\nof a detectable electromagnetic (EM) signature. Nevertheless, this first\nbroadband campaign to search for a counterpart of an Advanced LIGO source\nrepresents a milestone and highlights the broad capabilities of the transient\nastronomy community and the observing strategies that have been developed to\npursue neutron star binary merger events. Detailed investigations of the EM\ndata and results of the EM follow-up campaign are being disseminated in papers\nby the individual teams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 21:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 02:43:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2016 20:24:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 14:43:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-22"}

We provide the first calculation of the coefficient\n$f_b(n)$ in interacting theories by relating it to the stress tensor one-point\nfunction in a deformed hyperboloid background. The latter is then determined by\na straightforward holographic calculation.

Recent observations hint at high levels of ionisation and at the\npresence of synchrotron emission in protostellar systems, which leads to an\napparent contradiction. We want to explain the origin of these CRs accelerated\nwithin young protostars as suggested by observations. Our modelling consists of\na set of conditions that has to be satisfied in order to have an efficient CR\nacceleration through diffusive shock acceleration. We analyse three main\nacceleration sites, then we follow the propagation of these particles through\nthe protostellar system up to the hot spot region. We find that jet shocks can\nbe strong accelerators of CR protons, which can be boosted up to relativistic\nenergies. Other promising acceleration sites are protostellar surfaces, where\nshocks caused by impacting material during the collapse phase are strong enough\nto accelerate CR protons. In contrast, accretion flow shocks are too weak to\nefficiently accelerate CRs. Though CR electrons are weakly accelerated, they\ncan gain a strong boost to relativistic energies through re-acceleration in\nsuccessive shocks. We suggest a mechanism able to accelerate both CR protons\nand electrons through the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism, which can be\nused to explain the high ionisation rate and the synchrotron emission observed\ntowards protostellar sources.

Analyzing\nspatially integrated spectra, we find that the contribution of stars to the\nobserved NaD-EWs is generally small (<35%), and therefore this feature is\ndominated by ISM absorption. After subtracting the stellar contribution, we\nfind that the pure-ISM integrated spectra generally show blueshifted NaD\nprofiles, indicating neutral gas outflow velocities V in the range 65-260 km/s.\nExcluding galaxies with AGNs, V shows a dependency with the SFR of the type V\n\\propto SFR^0.15 (in rather good agreement with previous results).

In this work we further study the\npatch-permutation concept, and harness it to propose a new simple yet effective\nregularization for image restoration problems. Our approach builds on the\nclassic Maximum A'posteriori probability (MAP), with a penalty function\nconsisting of a regular log-likelihood term and a novel permutation-based\nregularization term. Using a plain 1D Laplacian, the proposed regularization\nforces robust smoothness (L1) on the permuted pixels. Since the permutation\noriginates from patch-ordering, we propose to accumulate the smoothness terms\nover all the patches' pixels. Furthermore, we take into account the found\ndistances between adjacent patches in the ordering, by weighting the Laplacian\noutcome. We demonstrate the proposed scheme on a diverse set of problems: (i)\nsevere Poisson image denoising, (ii) Gaussian image denoising, (iii) image\ndeblurring, and (iv) single image super-resolution. In all these cases, we use\nrecent methods that handle these problems as initialization to our scheme. This\nis followed by an L-BFGS optimization of the above-described penalty function,\nleading to state-of-the-art results, and especially so for highly ill-posed\ncases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 21:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

It forms the basis\nfor the stochastic gravitational-wave background, anisotropic background, and\ncontinuous-wave limits recently presented by the EPTA elsewhere. The Bayesian\ntiming analysis performed with TempoNest yields the detection of several new\nparameters: seven parallaxes, nine proper motions and, in the case of six\nbinary pulsars, an apparent change of the semi-major axis. We find the NE2001\nGalactic electron density model to be a better match to our parallax distances\n(after correction from the Lutz-Kelker bias) than the M2 and M3 models by\nSchnitzeler (2012). However, we measure an average uncertainty of 80\\%\n(fractional) for NE2001, three times larger than what is typically assumed in\nthe literature. We revisit the transverse velocity distribution for a set of 19\nisolated and 57 binary MSPs and find no statistical difference between these\ntwo populations.

Such activity is unique among the\ncomet nuclei visited by spacecraft, and suggests that CO2 ice is very near the\nsurface, which is inconsistent with our expectations of an object that\nthermophysically evolved for ~45 million years prior to entering the Jupiter\nFamily of comets. Here we explain this pattern of activity by showing that a\nvery plausible recent episode of rapid rotation (rotation period of ~11 [10-13]\nhours) would have induced avalanches in Hartley 2's currently active regions\nthat excavated down to CO2-rich ices and activated the small lobe of the\nnucleus. At Hartley 2's current rate of spindown about its principal axis, the\nnucleus would have been spinning fast enough to induce avalanches ~3-4 orbits\nprior to the DIXI flyby (~1984-1991). This coincides with Hartley 2's discovery\nin 1986, and implies that the initiation of CO2 activity facilitated the\ncomet's discovery. During the avalanches, the sliding material would either be\nlofted off the surface by gas activity, or possibly gained enough momentum\nmoving downhill (toward the tip of the small lobe) to slide off the nucleus.\nMuch of this material would have failed to reach escape velocity, and would\nreimpact the nucleus, forming debris deposits. The similar size frequency\ndistribution of the mounds observed on the surface of Hartley 2 and chunks of\nmaterial in its inner coma suggest that the 20-40 meter mounds observed by the\nDIXI mission on the surface of Hartley 2 are potentially these fallback debris\ndeposits. As the nucleus spun down from a rotation period of ~11 hours to 18.34\nhours at the time of the DIXI flyby, the location of potential minima, where\nmaterials preferentially settle, migrated about the surface, allowing us to\nplace relative ages on most of the imaged terrains of the nucleus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 22:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-01"}

This overall\nbudget is crucial for the prediction of the morphological change of coastline\nin engineering applications. Since the sediment transport in oscillatory flows\nis dense particle-laden flow, appropriate modeling of the particle interaction\nis critical. Although traditional two-fluid approaches have been applied to the\nstudy of sediment transport in oscillatory flows, the approaches do not resolve\nthe interaction of the particles. Particle-resolved modeling of sediment\ntransport in oscillatory flows and the study of micromechanics of sediment\nparticles are still lacking. In this work, a parallel CFD-DEM solver that can\nresolve the inter-particle collision is applied to study the granular\nmicromechanics of sediment particles in oscillatory flows. The results obtained\nfrom the CFD-DEM solver are validated by using the experimental data of coarse\nand medium sands. The comparison with experimental results suggests that the\nflow velocity, the sediment flux and the net sediment transport rate predicted\nby are satisfactory. Moreover, the micromechanic quantities of the sediment bed\nare presented in detail, including Voronoi concentration, coordination number,\nand particle interaction force.

The northeastern rim of the SNR RCW 86 is thought to be a\nparticularly efficient CR acceleration site, owing to the recent result in\nwhich an extremely high shock velocity of ~6000 km/s was claimed (Helder et al.\n2009). Here we revisit the same SNR rim with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, 11\nyears after the first observation. This longer baseline than previously\navailable allows us to determine a more accurate proper motion of the\nnonthermal X-ray filament, revealing a much lower velocity of 3000 \\pm 340 km/s\n(and even slower at a brighter region). Although the value has dropped to a\nhalf of that from the previous X-ray measurement, it is still higher than the\nmean velocity of the H-alpha filaments in this region (~1200 km/s). This\ndiscrepancy implies that the filaments bright in nonthermal X-rays and H-alpha\nemission trace different velocity components, and thus a CR pressure\nconstrained by combining the X-ray kinematics and the H-alpha spectroscopy can\neasily be overestimated. We also measure the proper motion of the thermal X-ray\nfilament immediately to the south of the nonthermal one. The inferred velocity\n(720 \\pm 360 km/s) is significantly lower than that of the nonthermal filament,\nsuggesting the presence of denser ambient material, possibly a wall formed by a\nwind from the progenitor, which has drastically slowed down the shock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2016 04:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The scale and complexity of\nsuch networks together with the inadequacies of general purpose computing\nplatforms have led to a significant interest in the development of efficient\nhardware implementations. In this work, we focus on designing energy efficient\non-chip storage for the synaptic weights. In order to minimize the power\nconsumption of typical digital CMOS implementations of such large-scale\nnetworks, the digital neurons could be operated reliably at scaled voltages by\nreducing the clock frequency. On the contrary, the on-chip synaptic storage\ndesigned using a conventional 6T SRAM is susceptible to bitcell failures at\nreduced voltages. However, the intrinsic error resiliency of NNs to small\nsynaptic weight perturbations enables us to scale the operating voltage of the\n6TSRAM. Our analysis on a widely used digit recognition dataset indicates that\nthe voltage can be scaled by 200mV from the nominal operating voltage (950mV)\nfor practically no loss (less than 0.5%) in accuracy (22nm predictive\ntechnology). Scaling beyond that causes substantial performance degradation\nowing to increased probability of failures in the MSBs of the synaptic weights.\nWe, therefore propose a significance driven hybrid 8T-6T SRAM, wherein the\nsensitive MSBs are stored in 8T bitcells that are robust at scaled voltages due\nto decoupled read and write paths. In an effort to further minimize the area\npenalty, we present a synaptic-sensitivity driven hybrid memory architecture\nconsisting of multiple 8T-6T SRAM banks.

Establishing geometric ergodicity for this DA Markov chain is\nimportant as it provides theoretical guarantees for constructing standard\nerrors for Markov chain based estimates of posterior quantities. In this paper,\nwe first show that in case of proper normal priors, the DA Markov chain is\ngeometrically ergodic *for all* choices of the design matrix $X$, $n$ and $p$\n(unlike the improper prior case, where $n \\geq p$ and another condition on $X$\nare required for posterior propriety itself).

A ubiquitous feature of stochastic\nexpression is burst-like synthesis of gene products, which drives considerable\nintercellular variability in protein levels across an isogenic cell population.\nOne common mechanism by which cells control such stochasticity is negative\nfeedback regulation, where a protein inhibits its own synthesis. For a single\ngene that is expressed in bursts, negative feedback can affect the burst\nfrequency or the burst size. In order to compare these feedback types, we study\na piecewise deterministic model for gene expression of a self-regulating gene.\nMathematically tractable steady-state protein distributions are derived and\nused to compare the noise suppression abilities of the two feedbacks. Results\nshow that in the low noise regime, both feedbacks are similar in term of their\nnoise buffering abilities. Intriguingly, feedback in burst size outperforms the\nfeedback in burst frequency in the high noise regime. Finally, we discuss\nvarious regulatory strategies by which cells implement feedback to control\nburst sizes of expressed proteins at the level of single cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2016 08:16:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2016 14:35:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-13"}
