It\nprovides an elegant classification in which the majority of theorems of\nordinary mathematics fall into only five categories, based on the 'Big Five'\nlogical systems. Recently, a lot of effort has been directed towards finding\nexceptional theorems, i.e. which fall outside the Big Five. The so-called\nReverse Mathematics zoo is a collection of such exceptional theorems (and their\nrelations). It was shown in [17] that a number of uniform versions of the\nzoo-theorems, i.e. where a functional computes the objects stated to exist,\nfall in the third Big Five category arithmetical comprehension, inside\nKohlenbach's higher-order Reverse Mathematics. In this paper, we extend and\nrefine the results from [17]. In particular, we establish analogous results for\nrecent additions to the Reverse Mathematics zoo, thus establishing that the\nlatter disappear at the uniform level. Furthermore, we show that the\naforementioned equivalences can be proved using only intuitionistic logic.\nPerhaps most surprisingly, these explicit equivalences are extracted from\nnonstandard equivalences in Nelson's internal set theory, and we show that the\nnonstandard equivalence can be recovered from the explicit ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2016 16:16:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 14:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

Coherency and persistence of LAV may\nhave drastic effect on chemical and nuclear reaction rates due to time-periodic\nmodulation of reaction sites. One example is a strong acceleration of chemical\nreaction rates driven by thermally-activated \"jumps\" over the reaction barrier\ndue to the time-periodic modulation of the barrier height in the LAV vicinity.\nAt sufficiently low temperatures, the reaction rate is controlled by quantum\ntunneling through the barrier rather than by classical jumping over it. A giant\nincrease of sub-barrier transparency was demonstrated for a parabolic potential\nwell with the time-periodic eigenfrequency, when the modulation frequency\nexceeds the eigenfrequency by a factor of ~2 (parametric regime). Such regime\ncan be realized for a hydrogen or deuterium atom in metal hydrides/deuterides,\nsuch as NiH or PdD, in the vicinity of LAV.

We found that\nthe previously detected central line emission in this galaxy actually comes\nfrom a blob, located at a projected distance of 2.14\" +/- 0.08\" (70.1 +/- 2.6\npc) from the stellar nucleus. Only diffuse emission was detected in the rest of\nthe field of view, with a deficit of emission at the position of the stellar\nnucleus. Diagnostic diagram analysis reveals that the off-centered emitting\nblob has a Seyfert 2 spectrum. We propose that the line-emitting blob may be a\n\"fossil\" emission-line region or a light \"echo\" from an active galactic nucleus\n(AGN), which was significantly brighter in the past. Our estimates indicate\nthat the bolometric luminosity of the AGN must have decreased by a factor of\n~13 - 500 during the last ~230 years. A second scenario to explain the\nmorphology of the line-emitting areas in the nuclear region of NGC 3621\ninvolves no decrease of the AGN bolometric luminosity and establishes that the\nAGN is highly obscured toward the observer but not toward the line-emitting\nblob. The third scenario proposed here assumes that the off-centered\nline-emitting blob is a recoiling supermassive black hole, after the\ncoalescence of two black holes. Finally, an additional hypothesis is that the\ncentral X-ray source is not an AGN, but an X-ray binary. This idea is\nconsistent with all the scenarios we proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Feb 2016 18:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-09"}

I introduce observable currents in a\nmultisymplectic framework for Lagrangian field theory over discrete spacetime.\nOne family of examples is composed by Noether currents. A much larger family of\nexamples is composed by currents, spacetime local objects, that encode the\nsymplectic product between two arbitrary vectors tangent to the space of\nsolutions. A weak version of observable currents, which in general are\nnonlocal, is also introduced. Weak observable currents can be used to separate\npoints in the space of physically distinct solutions. It is shown that a large\nclass of weak observable currents can be \"improved\" to become local. A Poisson\nbracket gives the space of observable currents the structure of a Lie algebra.\nPeierls bracket for bulk observables gives an algebra homomorphism mapping\nequivalence classes of bulk observables to weak observable currents.

Thus, regulating translation in order to obtain a desired ribosomal\nprofile along the mRNA molecule is an important biological problem. We study\nthis problem using a model for mRNA translation, called the ribosome flow model\n(RFM). In the RFM, the mRNA molecule is modeled as chain of n sites. The n\nstate-variables describe the ribosomal density profile along the mRNA molecule,\nwhereas the transition rates from each site to the next are controlled by n+1\npositive constants. To study the problem of controlling the density profile, we\nconsider some or all of the transition rates as time-varying controls. We\nconsider the following problem: given an initial and a desired ribosomal\ndensity profile, determine the time-varying values of the transition rates that\nsteer the RFM to this density profile, if they exist. Specifically, we consider\ntwo control problems. In the first, all transition rates can be regulated and\nthe goal is to steer the ribosomal density profile and the protein production\nrate from a given initial value to a desired value. In the second, a single\ntransition rate is controlled and the goal is to steer the production rate to a\ndesired value. In the first case, we show that the system is controllable, i.e.\nthe control is powerful enough to steer the RFM to any desired value, and we\nprovide closed-form expressions for constant control functions (or transition\nrates) asymptotically steering the RFM to the desired value. For the second\nproblem, we show that the production rate can be steered to any desired value\nin a feasible region determined by the other, constant transition rates.

Much of this is in text\nform, insurmountable in scope for humans and incomprehensible in structure for\ncomputers. Text mining is an expanding field of research that seeks to utilize\nthe information contained in vast document collections. General data mining\nmethods based on machine learning face challenges with the scale of text data,\nposing a need for scalable text mining methods.\n  This thesis proposes a solution to scalable text mining: generative models\ncombined with sparse computation. A unifying formalization for generative text\nmodels is defined, bringing together research traditions that have used\nformally equivalent models, but ignored parallel developments. This framework\nallows the use of methods developed in different processing tasks such as\nretrieval and classification, yielding effective solutions across different\ntext mining tasks. Sparse computation using inverted indices is proposed for\ninference on probabilistic models. This reduces the computational complexity of\nthe common text mining operations according to sparsity, yielding probabilistic\nmodels with the scalability of modern search engines.\n  The proposed combination provides sparse generative models: a solution for\ntext mining that is general, effective, and scalable. Extensive experimentation\non text classification and ranked retrieval datasets are conducted, showing\nthat the proposed solution matches or outperforms the leading task-specific\nmethods in effectiveness, with a order of magnitude decrease in classification\ntimes for Wikipedia article categorization with a million classes. The\ndeveloped methods were further applied in two 2014 Kaggle data mining prize\ncompetitions with over a hundred competing teams, earning first and second\nplaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2016 02:49:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-09"}

Two limitations in the\ndissemination of pose-related therapies are scarce human resources and\nunreliable automated systems. This work addresses these issues by introducing a\nnew method and a new system for robust automated classification of sleep poses\nin an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) environment. The new method,\ncoupled-constrained Least-Squares (cc-LS), uses multimodal and multiview (MM)\ndata and finds the set of modality trust values that minimizes the difference\nbetween expected and estimated labels. The new system, Eye-CU, is an affordable\nmulti-sensor modular system for unobtrusive data collection and analysis in\nhealthcare. Experimental results indicate that the performance of cc-LS matches\nthe performance of existing methods in ideal scenarios. This method outperforms\nthe latest techniques in challenging scenarios by 13% for those with poor\nillumination and by 70% for those with both poor illumination and occlusions.\nResults also show that a reduced Eye-CU configuration can classify poses\nwithout pressure information with only a slight drop in its performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2016 06:33:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 06:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

In\nparticular, attention is focused on cases where the hypotheses are ordered as\n$H_1 , \\ldots, H_n$, so that $H_{i+1}$ is tested only if $H_1 , \\ldots, H_i$\nhave all been previously rejected. In this situation, one can control the usual\nfamilywise error rate under arbitrary dependence by the basic procedure which\ntests each hypothesis at level $\\alpha$, and no other multiplicity adjustment\nis needed. However, we show that this is far too liberal if one also accounts\nfor directional errors.

While the power spectrum is a useful tool to\nstatistically investigate the 21cm signal, the 21cm brightness temperature\nfield is highly non-Gaussian, and the power spectrum is inadequate to\ncharacterize the non-Gaussianity. The Minkowski Functionals (MFs) are promising\ntools to extract non-gaussian features of the 21cm signal and give topological\ninformation such as morphology of ionized bubbles. In this work, we study the\n21cm line signal in detail with MFs. To promote understanding of basic features\nof the 21cm signal, we calculate the MFs of not only the hydrogen neutral\nfraction but the matter density and spin temperature, which contribute to the\nbrightness temperature fluctuations. We find that the structure of the\nbrightness temperature depends mainly on the ionized fraction and the spin\ntemperature at late and early stages of the EoR, respectively. Further, we\ninvestigate the redshift evolution of the MFs at $7 < z < 20$. Then, we find\nthat, after the onset of reionization, the MFs reflect mainly the ionized\nbubble property.

As an application, we prove that the\ncontractible fixed points set (and consequently the fixed points set) of a\nnontrivial Hamiltonian homeomorphism is not connected. Furthermore, we obtain\nthat the growth of the action width of a Hamiltonian homeomorphism increases at\nleast linearly, and that the group of Hamiltonian homeomorphisms of\n$\\mathbb{T}^2$ and the group of area preserving homeomorphisms isotopic to the\nidentity of $\\Sigma_g$ ($g>1$) are torsion free, where $\\Sigma_g$ is a closed\norientated surface with genus $g$. Finally, we will show how the $C^1$-Zimmer's\nconjecture on surfaces deduces from $C^0$-Schwarz's theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2016 15:32:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 14:15:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 13:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2016 13:33:31 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 16:27:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-24"}

In this paper, I describe\nmethods for learning disentangled representations in the two domains of\ngraphics and computation. These methods allow neural methods to learn\nrepresentations which are easy to interpret and reuse, yet they incur little or\nno penalty to performance. In the Graphics section, I demonstrate the ability\nof these methods to infer the generating parameters of images and rerender\nthose images under novel conditions. In the Computation section, I describe a\nmodel which is able to factorize a multitask learning problem into subtasks and\nwhich experiences no catastrophic forgetting. Together these techniques provide\nthe tools to design a wide range of models that learn disentangled\nrepresentations and better model the factors of variation in the real world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2016 15:32:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-09"}

While the Many Worlds Interpretation of Everett, MWI,\navoids the issue of wave function collapse, it, too, is a casualty of the\nspecial theory of relativity. This requires all events in the universe, past,\npresent and future, to be unique, as in the block universe picture, which rules\nout Everett style branching. The benefits of MWI may be retained, however, by\npostulating a multiverse of discrete, parallel, block universes which are\nidentical to each other up to certain points in the MWI trunk before they\ndiverge according to the MWI branching. The quantum probability of an event\nthen emerges from the number of parallel universes in which the event happens\ndivided by the total number of universes. This means that the total number of\nsuch universes is finite. Such a picture is more easily envisaged by thinking\nof it as a purely mathematical structure, as in the Mathematical Universe\nHypothesis proposed by Tegmark.
