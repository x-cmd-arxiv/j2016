A drawback of traditional LSH schemes is that they may\nhave \\emph{false negatives}, i.e., the recall is less than 100\\%. This limits\nthe applicability of LSH in settings requiring precise performance guarantees.\nBuilding on the recent theoretical \"CoveringLSH\" construction that eliminates\nfalse negatives, we propose a fast and practical covering LSH scheme for\nHamming space called \\emph{Fast CoveringLSH (fcLSH)}. Inheriting the design\nbenefits of CoveringLSH our method avoids false negatives and always reports\nall near neighbors. Compared to CoveringLSH we achieve an asymptotic\nimprovement to the hash function computation time from $\\mathcal{O}(dL)$ to\n$\\mathcal{O}(d + L\\log{L})$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of data and $L$ is\nthe number of hash tables.

Part of\nthe energy gap is opened by the crystal field splitting induced by the\nX^-2-like atoms. We extract the hopping parameters for the Wannier functions\nand provide a perspective on tight-binding model. From the analysis of the\ntight binding model, we have found an inversion of the band character between\nthe Gamma and the K points of the Brillouin zone due to the M-M hybridization.\nThe consequence of this inversion is the closure of the gap. The M-X\nhybridization is the only one that tends to open the gap at every k-point, the\nchange in the M-X and M-M hybridization is the main responsible for the\ndifference in the gap between the different dichalcogenide materials. The\ninversion of the bands gives rise to different spin-orbit splitting at Gamma\nand K point in the valence band. The different character of the gap at Gamma\nand K point offers the chance to manipulate the semiconductive properties of\nthese compounds. For a bilayer system, the hybridizations between the out of\nplane orbitals and the hybridizations between the in plane orbitals split the\nvalence band respectively at the Gamma and K point. The splitting in the\nvalence band is opened also without spin-orbit coupling and comes from the M-M\nand X-X hybridization between the two monolayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 16:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

This procedure will generally be valid only for certain\nparameter ranges. We start by showing that the reduction is accurate if and\nonly if the corresponding parameter is what we call a QSS parameter value, and\nthat the reduction is approximately accurate if and only if the corresponding\nparameter is close to a QSS parameter value. These QSS parameter values can be\ncharacterized by polynomial equations and inequations, hence parameter ranges\nfor which QSS reduction is valid are accessible in an algorithmic manner. A\ncloser investigation of QSS parameter values and the associated systems shows\nthe existence of certain invariant sets; here singular perturbations enter the\npicture in a natural manner. We compare QSS reduction and singular perturbation\nreduction, and show that, while they do not agree in general, they do, up to\nlowest order in a small parameter, for a quite large and relevant class of\nexamples. This observation, in turn, allows the computation of QSS reductions\neven in cases where an explicit resolution of the polynomial equations is not\npossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 16:47:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 06:08:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 12:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-20"}

The first rigorous quaternionic formulation has been\nstarted only in 2007 with the definition of the spherical spectrum of a\nquaternionic operator based on a quadratic version of resolvent operator. The\nrelevance of this notion is proved by the existence of a quaternionic\ncontinuous functional calculus and a theory of quaternionic semigroups relying\nupon it. A problem of quaternionic formulation is the description of composite\nquantum systems in absence of a natural tensor product due to non-commutativity\nof quaternions. A promising tool towards a solution is a quaternionic\nprojection-valued measure (PVM), making possible a tensor product of\nquaternionic operators with physical relevance. A notion with this property,\ncalled intertwining quaternionic PVM, is presented here. This foundational\npaper aims to investigate the interplay of this new mathematical object and the\nspherical spectral features of quaternionic generally unbounded normal\noperators.

A separation result for two models with respect\nto an objective means a conditional lower bound for one model that is strictly\nhigher than the existing upper bound for the other model, and similarly for two\nobjectives with respect to a model.

Here we study an example of such co-existence in the\npresence of magnetic dipolar interactions, related to spin ice, where the order\nis long range and the fluctuations support a Coulomb gauge field. Topological\ndefects are effectively coupled via energetic and entropic Coulomb\ninteractions, the latter one being stronger than for the spin-ice ground state.\nDepending on whether these defects break the divergence-free condition of the\nCoulomb gauge field or the long-range order, they are respectively categorized\nas monopoles - as in spin ice - or monopole holes, in analogy with electron\nholes in semiconductors. The long-range order plays the role of a\nfully-occupied valence band, while the Coulomb spin liquid can be seen as an\nempty conducting band. These results are discussed in the context of other\nlattices and models which support a similar co-existence of Coulomb gauge field\nand long-range order.

The simultaneous transmission and\nreception of data in non-orthogonal channels makes FD radio a potential\nsolution for the currently limited spectrum. However, its implementation\ngenerates high levels of interference either in the form of loopback\ninterference (LI) from the output to the input antenna of a transceiver or in\nthe form of co-channel interference in large-scale multicell networks due to\nthe large number of active links.

We investigate how this accuracy can be estimated without ground\ntruth available and used to improve registration quality of mono- and\nmulti-modal pair of images. At the local scale of image fragments, the\nCramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on registration error is estimated for each local\ncorrespondence between coarsely registered pair of images. This CRLB is defined\nby local image texture and noise properties. Opposite to the standard approach,\nwhere registration accuracy is only evaluated at the output of the registration\nprocess, such valuable information is used by us as an additional input\nknowledge. It greatly helps detecting and discarding outliers and refining the\nestimation of geometrical transformation model parameters. Based on these\nideas, a new area-based registration method called RAE (Registration with\nAccuracy Estimation) is proposed. In addition to its ability to automatically\nregister very complex multimodal image pairs with high accuracy, the RAE method\nprovides registration accuracy at the global scale as covariance matrix of\nestimation error of geometrical transformation model parameters or as\npoint-wise registration Standard Deviation. This accuracy does not depend on\nany ground truth availability and characterizes each pair of registered images\nindividually. Thus, the RAE method can identify image areas for which a\npredefined registration accuracy is guaranteed. The RAE method is proved\nsuccessful with reaching subpixel accuracy while registering eight complex\nmono/multimodal and multitemporal image pairs including optical to optical,\noptical to radar, optical to Digital Elevation Model (DEM) images and DEM to\nradar cases. Other methods employed in comparisons fail to provide in a stable\nmanner accurate results on the same test cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 20:05:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 20:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

In\nthis study, we present conditions for the formation of RSDs through non-ideal\nMHD effects computed self-consistently from an equilibrium chemical network. We\nfind that removing from the standard MRN distribution the large population of\nvery small grains (VSGs) of ~10 $\\AA$ to few 100 $\\AA$ that dominate the\ncoupling of the bulk neutral matter to the magnetic field increases the\nambipolar diffusivity by ~1--2 orders of magnitude at densities below 10$^{10}$\ncm$^{-3}$. The enhanced ambipolar diffusion (AD) in the envelope reduces the\namount of magnetic flux dragged by the collapse into the circumstellar\ndisk-forming region. Therefore, magnetic braking is weakened and more angular\nmomentum can be retained. With continuous high angular momentum inflow, RSDs of\ntens of AU are able to form, survive, and even grow in size, depending on other\nparameters including cosmic-ray ionization rate, magnetic field strength, and\nrotation speed. Some disks become self-gravitating and evolve into rings in our\n2D (axisymmetric) simulations, which have the potential to fragment into\n(close) multiple systems in 3D. We conclude that disk formation in magnetized\ncores is highly sensitive to chemistry, especially to grain sizes. A moderate\ngrain coagulation/growth to remove the large population of VSGs, either in the\nprestellar phase or during free-fall collapse, can greatly promote AD and help\nformation of tens of AU RSDs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 20:29:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

For a long GRB, the induced gravitational collapse\n(IGC) paradigm proposes as progenitor, or \"in-state\", a tight binary system\ncomposed of a carbon-oxygen core (CO$_{core}$) undergoing a supernova (SN)\nexplosion which triggers hypercritical accretion onto a neutron star (NS)\ncompanion. For a short GRB, a NS-NS merger is traditionally adopted as the\nprogenitor. We divide long and short GRBs into two sub-classes, depending on\nwhether or not a black hole (BH) is formed in the merger or in the\nhypercritical accretion process exceeding the NS critical mass. For long\nbursts, when no BH is formed we have the sub-class of X-ray flashes (XRFs),\nwith isotropic energy $E_{iso}\\lesssim10^{52}$ erg and rest-frame spectral peak\nenergy $E_{p,i}\\lesssim200$ keV.

The Transient Impact Model\n(TIM) posits that the price at high frequency time scales is a linear\ncombination of the signs of the past executed market orders, weighted by a\nso-called propagator function. An alternative description -- the History\nDependent Impact Model (HDIM) -- assumes that the deviation between the\nrealised order sign and its expected level impacts the price linearly and\npermanently. The two models, however, should be extended since prices are a\npriori influenced not only by the past order flow, but also by the past\nrealisation of returns themselves. In this paper, we propose a two-event\nframework, where price-changing and non price-changing events are considered\nseparately. Two-event propagator models provide a remarkable improvement of the\ndescription of the market impact, especially for large tick stocks, where the\nevents of price changes are very rare and very informative. Specifically the\nextended approach captures the excess anti-correlation between past returns and\nsubsequent order flow which is missing in one-event models. Our results\ndocument the superior performances of the HDIMs even though only in minor\nrelative terms compared to TIMs. This is somewhat surprising, because HDIMs are\nwell grounded theoretically, while TIMs are, strictly speaking, inconsistent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 20:37:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-09"}

Knowledge of the net amount of dust\nproduced by CCSNe is crucial for understanding the origin and evolution of dust\nin the local and high-redshift universe. Our aim is to identify the dust\ndestruction mechanisms in the ejecta, and derive the net amount of dust that\nsurvives the passage of the reverse shock. We use analytical models for the\nevolution of a supernova blast wave and of the reverse shock, with special\napplication to the clumpy ejecta of the remnant of Cassiopeia A. We assume that\nthe dust resides in cool oxygen-rich clumps that are uniformly distributed\nwithin the remnant and surrounded by a hot X-ray emitting plasma, and that the\ndust consists of silicates (MgSiO3) and amorphous carbon grains. The passage of\nthe reverse shock through the clumps gives rise to a relative gas-grain motion\nand also destroys the clumps. Inside the ejecta clouds, dust is processed via\nkinetic sputtering, which is terminated either when the grains escape the\nclumps, or when the clumps are destroyed by the reverse shock. In either case,\ngrain destruction proceeds thereafter by thermal sputtering in the hot ambient\ngas. We find that 11.8% and 15.9% of, respectively, the silicate and carbon\ndust survives the passage of the reverse shock by the time the shock has\nreached the center of the remnant.

In context with previous\nresults, this is consistent with a relation between $\\dot{\\rm{M}}_s$ and black\nhole accretion rate ($\\dot{\\rm{M}}_{bh}$) existing in only parts of the\n$z-\\dot{\\rm{M}}_{s}-\\dot{\\rm{M}}_{bh}$ plane, dependent on the free gas\nfraction, the trigger for activity, and the processes that may quench star\nformation. The relations between $\\dot{\\rm{M}}_s$ and both AGN luminosity and\nCIV FWHM are consistent with star formation rates in quasars scaling with black\nhole mass, though we cannot rule out a separate relation with black hole\naccretion rate. Star formation rates are observed to decline with increasing\nCIV equivalent width. This decline can be partially explained via the Baldwin\neffect, but may have an additional contribution from one or more of three\nfactors; $M_i$ is not a linear tracer of L$_{2500}$, the Baldwin effect changes\nform at high AGN luminosities, and high CIV EW values signpost a change in the\nrelation between $\\dot{\\rm{M}}_s$ and $\\dot{\\rm{M}}_{bh}$. Finally, there is no\nstrong relation between $\\dot{\\rm{M}}_s$ and Eddington ratio, or the asymmetry\nof the CIV line. The former suggests that star formation rates do not scale\nwith how efficiently the black hole is accreting, while the latter is\nconsistent with CIV asymmetries arising from orientation effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Here we provide a theoretical\ncontext for the formation of super-Earth clouds by determining which\ncondensates are likely to form under the assumption of chemical equilibrium. We\nstudy super-Earth atmospheres of diverse bulk composition, which are assumed to\nform by outgassing from a solid core of chondritic material, following Schaefer\n& Fegley (2010). The super-Earth atmospheres that we study arise from planetary\ncores made up of individual types of chondritic meteorites. They range from\nhighly reducing to oxidizing and have carbon to oxygen (C:O) ratios that are\nboth subsolar and super-solar, thereby spanning a range of atmospheric\ncomposition that is appropriate for low-mass exoplanets. Given the atomic\nmakeup of these atmospheres, we minimize the global Gibbs free energy of\nformation for over 550 gases and condensates to obtain the molecular\ncomposition of the atmospheres over a temperature range of 350-3,000 K. Clouds\nshould form along the temperature-pressure boundaries where the condensed\nspecies appear in our calculation. We find that the composition of condensate\nclouds depends strongly on both the H:O and C:O ratios. For the super-Earth\narchetype GJ 1214b, KCl and ZnS are the primary cloud-forming condensates at\nsolar composition, in agreement with previous work (Morley et al. 2013;\nMiller-Ricci Kempton et al. 2012). However, for oxidizing atmospheres, K2SO4\nand ZnO condensates are favored instead, and for carbon-rich atmospheres with\nsuper-solar C:O ratios, graphite clouds appear.

By\nassuming the G1 and G2 clouds trace this trajectory, we fit for the drag force\nthey experience and thus extract information about the accretion flow at a\ndistance of thousands of Schwarzschild radii from the black hole. This range of\nradii is important for theories of black hole accretion, but is currently\nunconstrained by observations.\n  In this paper we extend our previous work by accounting for radial forces due\nto possible inflow or outflow of the background gas.

This precession delays the pericenter passage of G2 by 4-5 months\nrelative to estimates derived from a Keplerian orbital fit; if it proves\npossible to identify the pericenter time observationally, this enables an\nimmediate test of whether G1 and G2 are gas clouds part of a larger gas\nstreamer.

Recently, strategies were discovered that permit an\nunprecedented level of control over repeated interactions by enabling a player\nto unilaterally enforce linear constraints on payoffs. Here, we extend this\ntheory of \"zero-determinant\" (or, more generally, \"autocratic\") strategies to\nalternating games, which are often biologically more relevant than traditional\nsynchronous games. Alternating games naturally result in asymmetries between\nplayers because the first move matters or because players might not move with\nequal probabilities. In a strictly-alternating game with two players, $X$ and\n$Y$, we give conditions for the existence of autocratic strategies for player\n$X$ when (i) $X$ moves first and (ii) $Y$ moves first. Furthermore, we show\nthat autocratic strategies exist even for (iii) games with randomly-alternating\nmoves. Particularly important categories of autocratic strategies are\nextortionate and generous strategies, which enforce unfavorable and favorable\noutcomes for the opponent, respectively. We illustrate these strategies using\nthe continuous Donation Game, in which a player pays a cost to provide a\nbenefit to the opponent according to a continuous cooperative investment level.\nAsymmetries due to alternating moves could easily arise from dominance\nhierarchies, and we show that they can endow subordinate players with more\nautocratic strategies than dominant players.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 21:34:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 16:04:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}

The baryonic\neffect is significant for a wide range of merger parameters and especially more\nsignificant for nearly head-on mergers and high merging velocities. The\nbaryonic effect on the merger timescale of galaxy clusters is expected to have\nimpacts on the structure formation in the universe, such as the cluster mass\nfunction and massive substructures in galaxy clusters, and a bias of \"no-gas\"\nmay exist in the results obtained from the dark matter-only cosmological\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 22:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

This is done to test the limitations of seismic\nmodeling for this very difficult case. A simultaneous fit of visual and\nspectroscopic orbits is used to self-consistently derive the orbital\nparameters, and subsequently the masses, of the components. The derived masses\nare equal to 12.02 +/- 0.13 and 10.58 +/- 0.18 M_Sun. The parameters of the\nwider, A - B system, presently approaching periastron passage, are constrained.\nAnalysis of the combined blue- and red-filter BRITE-Constellation photometric\ndata of the system revealed the presence of 19 periodic terms, of which eight\nare likely g modes, nine are p modes, and the remaining two are combination\nterms. It cannot be excluded that one or two low-frequency terms are rotational\nfrequencies. It is possible that both components of Beta Cen are Beta Cep/SPB\nhybrids. An attempt to use the apparent changes of frequency to distinguish\nwhich modes originate in which component did not succeed, but there is\npotential for using this method when more BRITE data become available. Agena\nseems to be one of very few rapidly rotating massive objects with rich p- and\ng-mode spectra, and precisely known masses. It can therefore be used to gain a\nbetter understanding of the excitation of pulsations in relatively rapidly\nrotating stars and their seismic modeling. Finally, this case illustrates the\npotential of BRITE-Constellation data for the detection of rich-frequency\nspectra of small-amplitude modes in massive pulsating stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 22:29:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

Mass segregation,\ngravitational focusing, and multibody dynamical interactions naturally increase\nthe interaction rate between the most massive black holes in dense stellar\nsystems, eventually leading them to merge. We find that dynamical interactions,\nparticularly three-body binary formation, enhance the merger rate of black hole\nbinaries with total mass M_tot roughly as ~M_tot^beta, with beta >~ 4. We find\nthat this relation holds mostly independently of the initial mass function, but\nthe exact value depends on the degree of mass segregation. The detection rate\nof such massive black hole binaries is only further enhanced by LIGO's greater\nsensitivity to massive black hole binaries with M_tot <~ 80 solar masses. We\nfind that for power-law BH mass functions dN/dM ~ M^-alpha with alpha <~ 2,\nLIGO is most likely to detect black hole binaries with a mass twice that of the\nmaximum initial black hole mass and a mass ratio near one. Repeated mergers of\nblack holes inside the cluster result in about ~5% of mergers being observed\nbetween two and three times the maximum initial black hole mass. Using these\nrelations, one may be able to invert the observed distribution to the initial\nmass function with multiple detections of merging black hole binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 22:36:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2016 16:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-30"}

We address the open problem of structure learning\nand introduce a sparsity-inducing algorithm to automatically estimate the\ninteraction structures between users and between items. Item-item and user-user\ncorrelation networks are obtained as a by-product. Large-scale experiments on\nmovie recommendation and date matching datasets demonstrate the power of the\nproposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 02:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-10"}

Such a closed loop can be exploited by an adversary\nwhose objective is to destabilize the pricing system. Specifically, small\nmalicious modifications to the price signals can be iteratively amplified by\nthe closed loop, causing inefficiency and even severe failures such as\nblackouts. This paper adopts a control-theoretic approach to deriving the\nfundamental conditions of RTP stability under two broad classes of integrity\nattacks, namely, the scaling and delay attacks.

The results provide useful guidelines for system operators to analyze\nthe impact of various attack parameters on system stability, so that they may\ntake adequate measures to secure RTP systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 04:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-10"}

The reassembling\nprocess has a simple formulation (there are several equivalent formulations)\nrelative to a binary tree B (reassembling tree), with root node at the top and\n$n$ leaf nodes at the bottom, where every cross-section corresponds to a\npartition of V such that:\n  - the bottom (or first) cross-section (all the leaves) is the finest\npartition of V with n one-vertex blocks,\n  - the top (or last) cross-section (the root) is the coarsest partition with a\nsingle block, the entire set V,\n  - a node (or block) in an intermediate cross-section (or partition) is the\nresult of merging its two children nodes (or blocks) in the cross-section (or\npartition) below it.\n  The maximum edge-boundary degree encountered during the reassembling process\nis what we call the alpha-measure of the reassembling, and the sum of all\nedge-boundary degrees is its beta-measure. The alpha-optimization (resp.\nbeta-optimization) of the reassembling of G is to determine a reassembling tree\nB that minimizes its alpha-measure (resp. beta-measure).\n  There are different forms of reassembling. In an earlier report, we studied\nlinear reassembling, which is the case when the height of B is (n-1). In this\nreport, we study balanced reassembling, when B has height [log n].\n  The two main results in this report are the NP-hardness of alpha-optimization\nand beta-optimization of balanced reassembling. The first result is obtained by\na sequence of polynomial-time reductions from minimum bisection of graphs\n(known to be NP-hard), and the second by a sequence of polynomial-time\nreductions from clique cover of graphs (known to be NP-hard).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 05:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-10"}

An\nopacity image, which aims at enhancing important features while reducing\nspurious structures, is calculated from the CTA images and employed to guide\nthe deformation of the model. In addition, the active contour model is extended\nby a constraint force that prevents intersections of the inner and outer\nboundary and keeps the outer boundary at a distance, given by the thrombus\nthickness, to the inner boundary. Based upon the segmentation results, we can\nmeasure the aneurysm size at each centerline point on the centerline orthogonal\nmultiplanar reformatting (MPR) plane.

This separation of the 2 classes in multiple radial directions\nnaturally motivates the development of Radial DWD. While classical machine\nlearning methods such as the Support Vector Machine and linear Distance\nWeighted Discrimination can sometimes give reasonable answers for a given data\nset, their generalizability is severely compromised because of the linear\nseparating boundary. Radial DWD addresses this challenge by using a more\nappropriate (in this particular case) spherical separating boundary.\nSimulations show that for appropriate radial contexts, this gives much better\ngeneralizability than linear methods, and also much better than conventional\nkernel based (nonlinear) Support Vector Machines, because the latter methods\nessentially use much of the information in the data for determining the shape\nof the separating boundary. The effectiveness of Radial DWD is demonstrated for\nreal virus detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 08:39:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-10"}

Gamma-rays escaping the ejecta can be used as a diagnostic tool for\nstudying the characteristics of the explosion. In particular, it is expected\nthat the analysis of the early gamma emission, near the maximum of the optical\nlight curve, could provide information about the distribution of the\nradioactive elements in the debris. In this paper, the gamma data obtained from\nSN2014J in M82 by the instruments on board of INTEGRAL are analyzed taking\nspecial care of the impact that the detailed spectral response has on the\nmeasurements of the intensity of the lines. The 158 keV emission of 56Ni has\nbeen detected in SN2014J at ~5 sigma at low energy with both ISGRI and SPI\naround the maximum of the optical light curve. After correcting the spectral\nresponse of the detector, the fluxes in the lines suggest that, in addition to\nthe bulk of radioactive elements buried in the central layers of the debris,\nthere is a plume of 56Ni, with a significance of ~3 sigma, moving at high\nvelocity and receding from the observer. The mass of the plume is in the range\nof ~ 0.03-0.08 solar masses. No SNIa explosion model had predicted the mass and\ngeometrical distribution of 56Ni suggested here. According to its optical\nproperties, SN2014J looks as a normal SNIa. So it is extremely important to\ndiscern if it is also representative in the gamma-ray band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 10:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

Our data, starting from $\\sim16$ days before maximum\nlight and extending to $\\sim463$ days after maximum, provide an unprecedented\ntime series of spectra and photometry for a normal SN~Ia. Fitting the\nearly-time rising light curve, we find that the luminosity evolution of SN\n2011fe follows a $t^n$ law, with the index $n$ being close to 2.0 in the $VRI$\nbands but slightly larger in the $U$ and $B$ bands. Combining the published\nultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) photometry, we derive the contribution\nof UV/NIR emission relative to the optical. SN 2011fe is found to have stronger\nUV emission and reaches its UV peak a few days earlier than other SNe~Ia with\nsimilar $\\Delta m_{15}(B)$, suggestive of less trapping of high-energy photons\nin the ejecta. Moreover, the $U$-band light curve shows a notably faster\ndecline at late phases ($t\\approx 100$--300 days), which also suggests that the\nejecta may be relatively transparent to UV photons.

On the other hand, the early-phase spectra exhibit prominent\nhigh-velocity features (HVFs) of O~I $\\lambda$7773 and the Ca~II~NIR triplet,\nbut only barely detectable in Si~II~6355. This difference can be caused either\nby an ionization/temperature effect or an abundance enhancement scenario for\nthe formation of HVFs; it suggests that the photospheric temperature of SN\n2011fe is intrinsically low, perhaps owing to incomplete burning during the\nexplosion of the white dwarf.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 12:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

Both of them are defined in terms of\nthe Schreier graph $\\Gamma$ on the dyadic-rational orbit of the canonical\naction of $F$ on the unit interval (actually, we consider a natural embedding\nof $F$ into the group $PLF({\\mathbb R})$ of piecewise linear homeomorphisms of\nthe real line, and realize $\\Gamma$ on the dyadic-rational orbit in ${\\mathbb\nR}$). However, the behaviours at infinity described by these $\\mu$-boundaries\nare quite different (in perfect keeping with the ambivalence concerning\namenability of the group $F$). The first $\\mu$-boundary is similar to the\nboundaries of the lamplighter groups: it consists of ${\\mathbb Z}$-valued\nconfigurations on $\\Gamma$ arising from the stabilization of the logarithmic\nincrements of slopes along the sample paths of the random walk. The second\n$\\mu$-boundary is more similar to the boundaries of groups with hyperbolic\nproperties as it consists of the sections of the end bundle of the graph\n$\\Gamma$: these are the collections of the limit ends of the induced random\nwalk on $\\Gamma$ parameterized by all possible starting points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 13:14:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2016 17:52:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 13:40:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

We find that a standard\n~10Msun 10^51erg SN ejecta ramming into a 0.4Msun dense CSM is inadequate for\nSN1994W, as it leads to the appearance of broad lines at late times. This\nstructure, however, generates spectra that exhibit the key morphological\nchanges seen in SN1998S. For SN1994W, we consider a completely different\nconfiguration, which involves the interaction at a large radius of a low mass\ninner shell with a high mass outer shell. Such a structure may arise in an\n8-12Msun star from a nuclear flash (e.g., of Ne) followed within a few years by\ncore collapse. Our simulations show that the large mass of the outer shell\nleads to the complete braking of the inner shell material, the formation of a\nslow dense shell, and the powering of a luminous SN IIn, even for a low inner\nshell energy. Early on, our model line profiles are typical of SNe IIn,\nexhibiting narrow cores and broad electron-scattering wings. As observed in\nSN1994W, they also remain narrow at late times. Our SN1994W model invokes two\nlow energy ejections, both atypical of observed massive stars, and illustrates\nthe diversity of configurations leading to SNe IIn.

In traditional approaches, the\ncontroller, by its internal functionality, finds appropriate actions on the\nbasis of the history of sensor values, guided by the goals, intentions,\nobjectives, learning schemes, and so on planted into it. The idea is that the\ncontroller controls the world---the body plus its environment---as reliably as\npossible. However, in elastically actuated robots this approach faces severe\ndifficulties. This paper advocates for a new paradigm of self-organized\ncontrol. The paper presents a solution with a controller that is devoid of any\nfunctionalities of its own, given by a fixed, explicit and context-free\nfunction of the recent history of the sensor values. When applying this\ncontroller to a muscle-tendon driven arm-shoulder system from the Myorobotics\ntoolkit, we observe a vast variety of self-organized behavior patterns: when\nleft alone, the arm realizes pseudo-random sequences of different poses but one\ncan also manipulate the system into definite motion patterns. But most\ninterestingly, after attaching an object, the controller gets in a functional\nresonance with the object's internal dynamics: when given a half-filled bottle,\nthe system spontaneously starts shaking the bottle so that maximum response\nfrom the dynamics of the water is being generated.

In\n2013 and 2014, the Swift observatory monitored NGC 5548 on average every day or\ntwo, with archival observations reaching back to 2005, totalling about 670 ks\nof observing time. Both broadband spectral modelling and temporal rms\nvariability analysis are applied to the Swift data. We disentangle the\nvariability caused by absorption, due to an obscuring weakly-ionised outflow\nnear the disk, from variability of the intrinsic continuum components (the soft\nX-ray excess and the power-law) originating from the disk and its associated\ncoronae. The spectral model that we apply to this extensive Swift data is the\nglobal model that we derived for NGC 5548 from analysis of the stacked spectra\nfrom our multi-satellite campaign of summer 2013 (including XMM-Newton, NuSTAR\nand HST). The results of our Swift study show that changes in the covering\nfraction of the obscurer is the primary and dominant cause of variability in\nthe soft X-ray band on timescales of 10 days to ~ 5 months. The obscuring\ncovering fraction of the X-ray source is found to range between 0.7 and nearly\n1.0. The contribution of the soft excess component to the X-ray variability is\noften much less than that of the obscurer, but it becomes comparable when the\noptical-UV continuum flares up. We find that the soft excess is consistent with\nbeing the high-energy tail of the optical-UV continuum and can be explained by\nwarm Comptonisation: up-scattering of the disk seed photons in a warm,\noptically thick corona as part of the inner disk. To this date, the Swift\nmonitoring of NGC 5548 shows that the obscurer has been continuously present in\nour line of sight for at least 4 years (since at least February 2012).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 15:04:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

Conversely, inductive learning considers a training set of\n$m$ labeled samples drawn iid from $P(X,Y)$, with the goal of best labeling any\nfuture samples drawn iid from $P(X)$. This comparison suggests that\ntransduction is a much easier type of inference than induction, but is this\nreally the case? This paper provides a negative answer to this question, by\nproving the first known minimax lower bounds for transductive, realizable,\nbinary classification.

Applications to network information theory are given, including a\nshort self-contained proof of the rate region for the two-encoder quadratic\nGaussian source coding problem.\n  Our argument is based on weak convergence and a technique employed by Geng\nand Nair for establishing Gaussian optimality via rotational-invariance, which\ntraces its roots to a `doubling trick' that has been successfully used in the\nstudy of functional inequalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 15:29:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-10"}

Hydrodynamical studies show that small particles generally avoid\ncollisions with the planetesimals because they are entrained by the flow around\nthem. This occurs when $St$, the Stokes number, defined as the ratio of the\ndust stopping time to the planetesimal crossing time, becomes much smaller than\nunity. However, these studies have been limited to the laminar case, whereas\nthese disks are believed to be turbulent. We want to estimate the influence of\ngas turbulence on the dust-planetesimal collision rate and on the impact\nspeeds. We used three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of a fixed\nsphere (planetesimal) facing a laminar and turbulent flow seeded with small\ninertial particles (dust) subject to a Stokes drag. A no-slip boundary\ncondition on the planetesimal surface is modeled via a penalty method. We find\nthat turbulence can significantly increase the collision rate of dust particles\nwith planetesimals. For a high turbulence case (when the amplitude of turbulent\nfluctuations is similar to the headwind velocity), we find that the collision\nprobability remains equal to the geometrical rate or even higher for $St\\geq\n0.1$, i.e., for dust sizes an order of magnitude smaller than in the laminar\ncase. We derive expressions to calculate impact probabilities as a function of\ndust and planetesimal size and turbulent intensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 15:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

We use\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to study the interplay between electron and\nion-scale velocity-space instabilities and their effect on electron pressure\nanisotropy, viscous heating, and thermal conduction. The adiabatic invariance\nof the magnetic moment in low-collisionality plasmas leads to pressure\nanisotropy, $p_{\\perp,j} > p_{||,j}$, if the magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is\namplified ($p_{\\perp,j}$ and $p_{||,j}$ denote the pressure of species $j$\n[electron, ion] perpendicular and parallel to $\\vec{B}$).

In the regime $1 \\lesssim \\beta_j \\lesssim 20$ ($\\beta_j \\equiv 8\\pi\np_j/|\\vec{B}|^2$), the saturated electron pressure anisotropy, $\\Delta\np_e/p_{||,e}$, is determined mainly by the (electron-lengthscale) whistler\nmarginal stability condition, with a modest factor of $\\sim 1.5-2$ decrease due\nto the trapping of electrons by the mirrors.

A classical equipartition of wave trains cannot diverge\nsince they would be finite in number, whereas standing wave modes are by\ndefinition infinite, which had doomed Rayleigh's theory, and concern only the\ntotal radiation. Wave trains are the microscopic entities of radiation\ninteracting with matter, that correspond to molecules in kinetic theory. Their\nquantization came from matter transitions in Einstein's 1917 derivation of\nPlanck's law. The spectral scatter of wave trains by Doppler shifts, which\ncause the wavelength displacements in Wien's law used for the frequency\ndependence in Einstein's derivation, is shown to yield the shape of the Planck\nspectrum. A Lorentz transform property of Doppler shifts discovered by Einstein\nis further shown equivalently necessary and sufficient to have corrected\nRayleigh's theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 01:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-15"}
