Switching off\nunder-utilized BSs during off-peak traffic load conditions is a promising\napproach to reduce energy consumption in cellular networks. In practice, during\ninitial cell planning, the BS locations and RAN parameters are optimized to\nmeet the basic system design requirements like coverage, capacity, overlap, QoS\netc. As these metrics are tightly coupled with each other due to co-channel\ninterference, switching off certain BSs may affect the system requirements.\nTherefore, identifying a subset of large number of BSs which are to be put into\nsleep mode, is a challenging dynamic optimization problem. In this work, we\ndevelop a multiobjective framework for dynamic optimization framework for OFDMA\nbased cellular systems. The objective is to identify the appropriate set of\nactive sectors and RAN parameters that maximize coverage and area spectral\nefficiency while minimizing overlap and area power consumption without\nviolating the QoS requirements for a given traffic demand density. The\nobjective functions and constraints are obtained using appropriate analytical\nmodels which capture the traffic characteristics, propagation characteristics\n(pathloss, shadowing, and small scale fading) as well as load condition in\nneighbouring cells. A low complexity evolutionary algorithm is used for\nidentifying the global Pareto optimal solutions at a faster convergence rate.\nThe inter-relationships between the system objectives are studied and\nguidelines are provided to find an appropriate network configuration that\nprovides the best achievable trade-offs. The results show that using the\nproposed framework, significant amount of energy saving can be achieved and\nwith a low computational complexity while maintaining good trade-offs among the\nother objectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2016 16:26:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 19:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Statistical methods have been developed to determine\nwhether such a perturbation induces changes over time, e.g. comparing a\nperturbed and unperturbed time course dataset to uncover differences. However,\nexisting methods do not provide a principled statistical approach to identify\nthe specific time when the two time course datasets first begin to diverge\nafter a perturbation; we call this the perturbation time. Estimation of the\nperturbation time for different variables in a biological process allows us to\nidentify the sequence of events following a perturbation and therefore provides\nvaluable insights into likely causal relationships.\n  In this paper, we propose a Bayesian method to infer the perturbation time\ngiven time course data from a wild-type and perturbed system. We use a\nnon-parametric approach based on Gaussian Process regression. We derive a\nprobabilistic model of noise-corrupted and replicated time course data coming\nfrom the same profile before the perturbation time and diverging after the\nperturbation time. The likelihood function can be worked out exactly for this\nmodel and the posterior distribution of the perturbation time is obtained by a\nsimple histogram approach, without recourse to complex approximate inference\nalgorithms. We validate the method on simulated data and apply it to study the\ntranscriptional change occurring in Arabidopsis following inoculation with P.\nsyringae pv. tomato DC3000 versus the disarmed strain DC3000hrpA.\n  An R package, DEtime, implementing the method is available at\nhttps://github.com/ManchesterBioinference/DEtime along with the data and code\nrequired to reproduce all the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2016 16:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-05"}

Beyond encryption of data lies obfuscation, i.e., encryption of\nfunctionality. It is well-known that the most powerful means of obfuscating\nclassical programs, so-called ``black-box obfuscation',' is provably impossible\n[Barak et al '12]. However, several recent results have yielded candidate\nschemes that satisfy a definition weaker than black-box, and yet still have\nnumerous applications.\n  In this work, we initialize the rigorous study of obfuscating programs via\nquantum-mechanical means. We define notions of quantum obfuscation which\nencompass several natural variants. The input to the obfuscator can describe\nclassical or quantum functionality, and the output can be a circuit description\nor a quantum state. The obfuscator can also satisfy one of a number of\nobfuscation conditions: black-box, information-theoretic black-box,\nindistinguishability, and best possible; the last two conditions come in three\nvariants: perfect, statistical, and computational. We discuss many\napplications, including CPA-secure quantum encryption, quantum\nfully-homomorphic encryption, and public-key quantum money.\n  We then prove several impossibility results, extending a number of\nfoundational papers on classical obfuscation to the quantum setting. We prove\nthat quantum black-box obfuscation is impossible in a setting where adversaries\ncan possess more than one output of the obfuscator. In particular, generic\ntransformation of quantum circuits into black-box-obfuscated quantum circuits\nis impossible. We also show that statistical indistinguishability obfuscation\nis impossible, up to an unlikely complexity-theoretic collapse.

Since the resulting problem is not known to be\nsolvable in polynomial time, we introduce several heuristics that are simple\nenough to be implemented in practice. A key ingredient is a new practical\nlinear-time algorithm for minimum-link paths in simple polygons. Experiments in\na challenging realistic setting show excellent performance of our algorithms in\npractice, answering queries in a few milliseconds on average even for long\nranges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2016 18:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-05"}

We treat 1D and 2D tissues as\ncontinuous, deformable, growing geometries for sizes larger than 1mm. The\ndynamics of the growing tissue are described by a set of coupled tensor\nequations in non-Euclidean (curved) space. These coupled equations represent a\nnovel feedback mechanism between growth and curvature dynamics.\n  For 1D growth, numerical simulations are compared to two measures of root\ngrowth. First, modular growth along the simulated root shows an elongation zone\ncommon to many species of plant roots. Second, the relative elemental growth\nrate (REGR) calculated in silico exhibits temporal dynamics recently\ncharacterized in high-resolution root growth studies but which thus far lack a\nbiological hypothesis to explain them. Namely, the REGR can evolve from a\nsingle peak localized near the root tip to a double-peak structure. In our\nmodel, this is a direct consequence of considering growth as both a geometric\nreaction-diffusion process and expansion due to a distributed source of new\nmaterials.\n  In 2D, we study a circularly symmetric growing disk with emergent negative\ncurvatures. These results are compared against thin disk experiments, which are\na proxy model for plant leaves. These results also apply to the curvature\nevolution and the inhomogeneous growth pattern of the Acetabularia cap. Lastly,\nwe extend the model to anisotropic disks and predict the growth dynamics for a\n2D curved surface which develops an elongated shape with localized ruffling.\n  Our model also provides several measures of the dynamics of tissue growth.\nThese include the time evolution of the metric and velocity field, which are\ndynamical variables in the model, as well as expansion, shear and rotation\nwhich are deformation tensors characterizing the growth of the tissue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2016 18:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-05"}

The system is also interesting with respect to a new\ntype of geometrical frustration in elemental crystals, which was found in\nbeta-rhombohedral boron. Based on density functional theory calculations, the\npresent study has resolved the structural and thermodynamic characteristics of\npure alpha-tetragonal boron. Different from beta-rhombohedral boron, the\nconditions for stable covalent bonding (a band gap and completely filled\nvalence bands) are almost fulfilled at a composition B_52 with two 4c\ninterstitial sites occupied. This indicates that the ground state of pure\nalpha-tetragonal boron is stoichiometric. However, the covalent condition is\nnot perfectly fulfilled because non-bonding in-gap states exist that cannot be\neliminated. The half occupation of the 4c sites yields a macroscopic amount of\nresidual entropy, which is as large as that of beta-rhombohedral boron.\nTherefore, alpha-tetragonal boron can be classified as an elemental crystal\nwith geometrical frustration. Deviations from stoichiometry can occur only at\nfinite temperatures. Thermodynamic considerations show that deviations delta\nfrom the stoichiometric composition B_(52+delta) are small and positive. For\nreported high-pressure syntheses conditions delta is predicted to be about 0.1\nto 0.2. An important difference between pure and C- or N-containing\nalpha-tetragonal boron is found in the occupation of interstitial sites: the\npure form prefers to occupy the 4c sites, whereas in C- or N-containing forms a\nmixture of 2a, 8h, and 8i sites are occupied. The present article provides\nrelations of site occupation, delta values, and lattice parameters, which\nenable us to identify pure alpha-tetragonal and distinguish the pure form from\nother ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2016 19:15:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

In our new method, the probability distribution of\nvelocities for each cluster in the sample are summed to create a new statistic\ncalled the velocity distribution function (VDF), $dn(v)/dv$.

This is in stark contrast with the strong\ndownward evolution of $r_e$ with increasing redshift, down to sizes of $<1$ kpc\nat $z\\sim4.5$. We analyze the difference and find that parametric fitting of\ncomplex, asymmetric, multi-component galaxies is severely underestimating their\nsizes. By comparing $r_T^{100}$ with physical parameters obtained through SED\nfitting we find that the star-forming galaxies that are the largest at any\nredshift are, on average, more massive and more star-forming. We discover that\ngalaxies present more concentrated light profiles as we move towards higher\nredshifts. We interpret these results as the signature of several, possibly\ndifferent, evolutionary paths of galaxies in their early stages of assembly,\nincluding major and minor merging or star-formation in multiple bright regions.\n(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2016 21:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-21"}

This configuration arises on several\nastrophysical scenarios, which represent exciting laboratories to understand\nphysics in extreme regimes. We show that this system, when restricted to the\ncorrect constraint submanifold, is symmetric hyperbolic. In numerical\napplications is not feasible to keep the system in that submanifold, and so, it\nis necessary to analyze its structure first in the tangent space of that\nsubmanifold and then in a whole neighborhood of it. As already shown by\nPfeiffer, a direct (or naive) formulation of this system (in the whole tangent\nspace) results in a weakly hyperbolic system of evolution equations for which\nwell-possednes for the initial value formulation does not follows.\n  Using the generalized symmetric hyperbolic formalism due to Geroch, we\nintroduce here a covariant hyperbolization for the FFE system. In fact, in\nanalogy to the usual Maxwell case, a complete family of hyperbolizers is found,\nboth for the restricted system on the constraint submanifold as well as for a\nsuitably extended system defined in a whole neighborhood of it.

In this work we develop an axiomatic\nframework for the analysis of directional derivatives of a large class of\nLipschitz continuous extended Skorokhod maps in convex polyhedral domains with\noblique directions of reflection. We establish existence of directional\nderivatives at a path whose reflected version satisfies a certain boundary\njitter property, and also show that the right-continuous regularization of such\na directional derivative can be characterized as the unique solution to a\nSkorokhod-type problem, where both the domain and directions of reflection vary\n(discontinuously) with time.

However, significantly\nless attention has been dedicated to the predictability of performance: how\noften individual transactions exhibit execution latency far from the mean?\nPerformance predictability is vital when transaction processing lies on the\ncritical path of a complex enterprise software or an interactive web service,\nas well as in emerging database-as-a-service markets where customers contract\nfor guaranteed levels of performance. In this paper, we take several steps\ntowards achieving more predictable database systems. First, we propose a\nprofiling framework called VProfiler that, given the source code of a DBMS, is\nable to identify the dominant sources of variance in transaction latency.\nVProfiler automatically instruments the DBMS source code to deconstruct the\noverall variance of transaction latencies into variances and covariances of the\nexecution time of individual functions, which in turn provide insight into the\nroot causes of variance. Second, we use VProfiler to analyze MySQL and Postgres\n- two of the most popular and complex open-source database systems. Our case\nstudies reveal that the primary causes of variance in MySQL and Postgres are\nlock scheduling and centralized logging, respectively. Finally, based on\nVProfiler's findings, we further focus on remedying the performance variance of\nMySQL by (1) proposing a new lock scheduling algorithm, called Variance-Aware\nTransaction Scheduling (VATS), (2) enhancing the buffer pool replacement\npolicy, and (3) identifying tuning parameters that can reduce variance\nsignificantly.

The celebrated\nApproximate Personalized PageRank (APPR) algorithm in the seminal paper by\nAndersen et al. is one such method. APPR was introduced and motivated purely\nfrom an algorithmic perspective. In other words, there is no a priori notion of\nobjective function/optimality conditions that characterizes the steps taken by\nAPPR. Here, we derive a novel variational formulation which makes explicit the\nactual optimization problem solved by APPR. In doing so, we draw connections\nbetween the local spectral algorithm of and an iterative shrinkage-thresholding\nalgorithm (ISTA).

Although bare-metal stents can be traced back to 1994, long term\nefficacy of these stents has been shattered by ISR (In-Stent restenosis) and\nlate stent thrombosis. Research on finding a solution to these issues has led\nto the development of DESs (Drug eluting stents). However long term\neffectiveness of DESs and various drug delivery systems have raised concerns.\nAlso current DESs does not have the capability to adjust the drug dose or\nrelease kinetics that corresponds to the diseased status of the affected\nvessel. Through the use of a drug delivery system which employs controlled drug\nrelease, it may be possible to control the release rate of the pharmacological\ndrugs or substances of interest, and therefore one might be able to circumvent\nthe range of events that leads to ISR, thus preventing the need for further\ninvasive interventions. To overcome the limitations of drug delivery systems,\nthe administration of drugs using nanoparticle based microcapsules as carriers\nis being researched for their ability to facilitate a sustained, prolonged and\ncontrolled release of drugs. But still much research is needed to evaluate and\nfix issues relating toxicity, chemical and mechanical properties of the\nnanoparticles. This project combines a range of nanobiotechnological techniques\nto synthesise nano-components which are finally assembled together to get the\nmicrocapsules which could be used in drug delivery systems.

We recently proposed the NEO-K-Means (Non-Exhaustive,\nOverlapping K-Means) objective as a way to address both issues in an integrated\nfashion. Optimizing this discrete objective is NP-hard, and even though there\nis a convex relaxation of the objective, straightforward convex optimization\napproaches are too expensive for large datasets. A practical alternative is to\nuse a low-rank factorization of the solution matrix in the convex formulation.\nThe resulting optimization problem is non-convex, and we can locally optimize\nthe objective function using an augmented Lagrangian method.

The users are deemed as selfish\nand also benign, each of which maximizes his individual utility of the\nallocated resources minus his payment to the network operator. However, in many\napplications a user can use his payment to reduce the utilities of his\nopponents, thus playing a misbehaving role. It remains mysterious to what\nextent the misbehaving user can damage or influence the performance of benign\nusers and the network operator. In this work, we formulate a non-cooperative\ngame consisting of a finite amount of benign users and one misbehaving user.\nThe maliciousness of this misbehaving user is captured by his willingness to\npay to trade for unit degradation in the utilities of benign users. The network\noperator allocates resources to all the users via the price-anticipating Kelly\nmechanism. We present six important performance metrics with regard to the\ntotal utility and the total net utility of benign users, and the revenue of\nnetwork operator under three different scenarios: with and without the\nmisbehaving user, and the maximum. We quantify the robustness of PAKM against\nthe misbehaving actions by deriving the upper and lower bounds of these\nmetrics. With new approaches, all the theoretical bounds are applicable to an\narbitrary population of benign users. Our study reveals two important insights:\ni) the performance bounds are very sensitive to the misbehaving user's\nwillingness to pay at certain ranges; ii) the network operator acquires more\nrevenues in the presence of the misbehaving user which might disincentivize his\ncountermeasures against the misbehaving actions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 06:29:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Oct 2021 02:17:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 01:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-06"}

VARMA is then used for\nforecasting which results in reduced errors.\n  The daily prices of steel, aluminium, copper and zinc between 10.05.2010 and\n29.05.2014 are analyzed via wavelet analysis to highlight the interactions.\nResults uncover interesting dynamics between mentioned metals in the\ntime-frequency space. VARMA (1,1) model forecasting is carried out considering\nthe daily prices between 14.11.2011 and 16.11.2012 where the interactions are\nquite high and prediction errors are found quite limited with respect to\nARMA(1.1). It is shown that dynamic co-movement detection via four variables\nwavelet coherency analysis in the determination of VARMA time interval enables\nto improve forecasting power of ARMA by decreasing forecasting errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 09:22:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-08"}

We propose adding value to those\nmeasurements by combining them with ground-based observations of the dust tail\nto monitor the overall, time-dependent dust-production rate and size\ndistribution. To constrain the dust grain properties, we take Rosetta OSIRIS\nand GIADA results into account, and combine OSIRIS data during the approach\nphase (from late April to early June 2014) with a large data set of\nground-based images that were acquired with the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT)\nfrom February to November 2014. A Monte Carlo dust tail code has been applied\nto retrieve the dust parameters. Key properties of the grains (density,\nvelocity, and size distribution) were obtained from Rosetta observations: these\nparameters were used as input of the code to considerably reduce the number of\nfree parameters. In this way, the overall dust mass-loss rate and its\ndependence on the heliocentric distance could be obtained accurately. The dust\nparameters derived from the inner coma measurements by OSIRIS and GIADA and\nfrom distant imaging using VLT data are consistent, except for the power index\nof the size-distribution function, which is $\\alpha$=--3, instead of\n$\\alpha$=--2, for grains smaller than 1 mm. This is possibly linked to the\npresence of fluffy aggregates in the coma. The onset of cometary activity\noccurs at approximately 4.3 au, with a dust production rate of 0.5 kg/s,\nincreasing up to 15 kg/s at 2.9 au. This implies a dust-to-gas mass ratio\nvarying between 3.8 and 6.5 for the best-fit model when combined with\nwater-production rates from the MIRO experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 09:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

If such binaries are embedded in gas-rich and turbulent\nenvironments, as observed in remnants of galaxy mergers, the interaction with\ngas clumps (such as molecular clouds) may efficiently drive their orbital\nevolution. Using numerical simulations, we test this hypothesis by studying the\ndynamical evolution of an equal-mass, circular MBHB accreting infalling\nmolecular clouds. We investigate different orbital configurations, modelling a\ntotal of 13 systems to explore different possible impact parameters and\nrelative inclinations of the cloud-binary encounter. We focus our study on the\nprompt, transient phase during the first few orbits when the dynamical\nevolution of the binary is fastest, finding that this evolution is dominated by\nthe exchange of angular momentum through gas capture by the individual black\nholes and accretion. Building on these results, we construct a simple model for\nevolving a MBHB interacting with a sequence of clouds, which are randomly drawn\nfrom reasonable populations with different levels of anisotropy in their\nangular momenta distributions. We show that the binary efficiently evolves down\nto the GW emission regime within a few hundred million years, overcoming the\n'final parsec' problem regardless of the stellar distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 09:53:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2017 20:06:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-04"}

The chosen class of games are named\n\"threshold games\", and are defined by a threshold, $M > 0$, which describes the\nminimal number of cooperators in a given match required for all the\nparticipants to receive a benefit. The model was studied primarily through\nnumerical simulations of large populations of individuals, each with\ninteraction neighbourhoods described by various classes of networks.\n  Results: When comparing the level of cooperation in a structured population\nto the mean-field model, we find that most types of structure lead to a\ndecrease in cooperation. This is both interesting and novel, simply due to the\ngenerality and breadth of relevance of the model - it is likely that any model\nwith similar payoff structure exhibits related behaviour.\n  More importantly, we find that the details of the behaviour depends to a\nlarge extent on the size of the immediate neighbourhoods of the individuals, as\ndictated by the network structure. In effect, the players behave as if they are\npart of a much smaller, fully mixed, population, which we suggest an expression\nfor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 10:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-08"}

However, the physical process through which fast magnetic\nreconnection occurs in partially ionized plasma, like the solar chromosphere,\nis still poorly understood. It has been shown that for sufficiently high\nmagnetic Reynolds numbers, Sweet-Parker current sheets can become unstable\nleading to tearing mode instability and plasmoid formation, but when dealing\nwith a partially ionized plasma the strength of coupling between the ions and\nneutrals plays a fundamental role in determining the dynamics of the system.

Furthermore, much of the existing analysis\ndeals with the large ensemble limit, far from the regime in which the method is\ntypically used. The goal of this paper is to analyze the method when applied to\ninverse problems with fixed ensemble size. A continuous-time limit is derived\nand the long-time behavior of the resulting dynamical system is studied. Most\nof the rigorous analysis is confined to the linear forward problem, where we\ndemonstrate that the continuous time limit of the EnKF corresponds to a set of\ngradient flows for the data misfit in each ensemble member, coupled through a\ncommon pre-conditioner which is the empirical covariance matrix of the\nensemble.

While the\noptimal solution requires each user to have complete information about the\nnetwork, our proposed algorithm only requires users to have local information.\nThe fundamental of our algorithm is that the users will first self-organize\ninto a number of non-overlapping neighborhoods, and the user with the maximum\nnode degree in each neighborhood is elected as the local leader (LL).

As a consequence, a\nplethora of sparsity metrics has been presented in the literature. The\nappropriateness of these metrics is typically evaluated against a set of\nobjective criteria that has been proposed for assessing the credibility of any\nsparsity metric. In this paper, we propose a Generalised Differential Sparsity\n(GDS) framework for generating novel sparsity metrics whose functionality is\nbased on the concept that sparsity is encoded in the differences among the\nsignal coefficients. We rigorously prove that every metric generated using GDS\nsatisfies all the aforementioned criteria and we provide a computationally\nefficient formula that makes GDS suitable for high-dimensional signals. The\ngreat advantage of GDS is its flexibility to offer sparsity metrics that can be\nwell-tailored to certain requirements stemming from the nature of the data and\nthe problem to be solved. This is in contrast to current state-of-the-art\nsparsity metrics like Gini Index (GI), which is actually proven to be only a\nspecific instance of GDS, demonstrating the generalisation power of our\nframework. In verifying our claims, we have incorporated GDS in a stochastic\nsignal recovery algorithm and experimentally investigated its efficacy in\nreconstructing randomly projected sparse signals. As a result, it is proven\nthat GDS, in comparison to GI, both loosens the bounds of the assumed sparsity\nof the original signals and reduces the minimum number of projected dimensions,\nrequired to guarantee an almost perfect reconstruction of heavily compressed\nsignals. The superiority of GDS over GI in conjunction with the fact that the\nlatter is considered as a standard in numerous scientific domains, prove the\ngreat potential of GDS as a general purpose framework for measuring sparsity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 15:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-08"}

We propose a criterion to determine whether\nMBL is likely to occur in presence of interaction based only on the properties\nof the non-interacting models. The relevant quantity $\\epsilon$ is a measure of\nhow localized the localized states are relative to how delocalized the\ndelocalized states are in the non-interacting model. We also study various\nother features of the non-interacting models such as the divergence of the\nlocalization length at the mobility edge and the presence or absence of\n`ergodicity' and localization in their many-body eigenstates. However, we find\nthat these features cannot be used to predict the occurrence of MBL upon the\nintroduction of weak interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2016 19:37:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 19:22:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 18 Feb 2018 02:59:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-28"}

While this\ndescription has proved most successful for incompressible turbulence\n(beta=Delta=2/3, and D=1), its applicability in the highly compressible regime\nremains debated. For this regime, theoretical arguments suggest D=2 and\nDelta=2/3, or Delta=1.

Because of this characteristics, we\ninvestigated the structure and interactions of scalar fields under the\nconformal transformations.

Owing to the sparsity of these\ntensors, we propose an efficient approach to calculate products of these\ntensors and any vectors. Using the state-of-the-art L-BFGS approach, we develop\na first-order optimization algorithm for computing H- and Z-eigenvalues of\nthese large scale sparse tensors (CEST). With the aid of the\nKurdyka-{\\L}ojasiewicz property, we prove that the sequence of iterates\ngenerated by CEST converges to an eigenvector of the tensor.When CEST is\nstarted from multiple randomly initial points, the resulting best eigenvalue\ncould touch the extreme eigenvalue with a high probability. Finally, numerical\nexperiments on small hypergraphs show that CEST is efficient and promising.\nMoreover, CEST is capable of computing eigenvalues of tensors corresponding to\na hypergraph with millions of vertices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 05:19:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-25"}

Evaluating the coupled system\nresponse (solid displacement and acoustic pressure) and characterizing the\nacoustic radiation damping in conjunction with the media properties are the\nmain objectives of this research. In this work, acoustic damping is\ndemonstrated for two problems: the thin spherical shell and the solid sphere.\nThe mathematical approach followed in solving these coupled problems is based\non the Laplace transform method. The linear under-damped harmonic oscillator is\nthe reference model for damping estimation. The damping evaluation is performed\nin frequency as well as in time domains; both investigations lead to identical\ndamping factor expressions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2016 17:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-25"}

The model represents channel\ndynamics using a simple but flexible cellular approach, and is unique in that\nit explicitly includes backwater effects that are known to be important in\nlow-gradient channel networks. The patterns of channel deposits in the\nstratigraphic record vary spatially due to variation in avulsion statistics\nwith radial distance from the delta's source of water and sediment. We\nintroduce channel residence time as an important statistical measure of the\nsurface channel kinematics. The model suggests that the mean channel residence\ntime anywhere within the delta is nicely described by a power law distribution\nshowing a cutoff that depends on radial distance. Thicknesses of channel\ndeposits are not uniquely determined by the residence time of channelization.\nThe channel residence time distributions at given radial distances from the\nsource are found to be approximately lognormally distributed, a finding\nconsistent with the scale-dependent radial structure of channel deposits in the\nstratigraphic record.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2016 08:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-16"}
