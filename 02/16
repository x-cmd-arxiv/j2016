A prominent example is the biological cell where, within a\nhighly crowded molecular environment, a myriad of different molecular receptor\npairs recognize their binding partner with astonishing accuracy. In thermal\nequilibrium it is usually admitted that the affinity of recognizer pairs only\ndepends on the nature of the two binding molecules. Accordingly, Boltzmann\nfactors of binding energy differences relate the molecular affinities among\ndifferent target molecules that compete for the same probe. Here, we consider\nthe molecular recognition of short DNA oligonucleotide single strands. We show\nthat a better matching oligonucleotide strand can prevail against a\ndisproportionally more concentrated competitor that exhibits reduced affinity\ndue to a mismatch. The magnitude of deviation from the simple picture above may\nreach several orders of magnitude. In our experiments the effective molecular\naffinity of a given strand remains elevated only as long as the better matching\ncompetitor is not present. We interpret our observations based on an\nenergy-barrier of entropic origin that occurs if two competing oligonucleotide\nstrands occupy the same probe simultaneously. In this situation the relative\nbinding affinities are reduced asymmetrically, which leads to an expression of\nthe free energy landscape that represents a formal analogue of a Landau\ndescription of phase transitions. Our mean field description reproduces the\nobservations in quantitative agreement. The advantage of improved molecular\nrecognition comes at no energetic cost other than the design of the molecular\nensemble, and the introduction of the competitor. It will be interesting to see\nif mechanisms along similar lines as exposed here, contribute to the molecular\nsynergy that occurs in biological systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 16:15:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2020 10:03:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-07"}

An especially puzzling\nmatter is that local interstellar filaments appear to have the same thickness,\nindependent of their column density. This requires a theoretical understanding\nof their formation process and the physics that governs their evolution. In\nthis work we explore a scenario in which filaments are dissipative structures\nof the large-scale interstellar turbulence cascade and ion-neutral friction\n(also called ambipolar diffusion) is affecting their sizes by preventing\nsmall-scale compressions. We employ high-resolution, 3D MHD simulations,\nperformed with the grid code RAMSES, to investigate non-ideal MHD turbulence as\na filament formation mechanism. We focus the analysis on the mass and thickness\ndistributions of the resulting filamentary structures. Simulations of both\ndriven and decaying MHD turbulence show that the morphologies of the density\nand the magnetic field are different when ambipolar diffusion is included in\nthe models. In particular, the densest structures are broader and more massive\nas an effect of ion-neutral friction and the power spectra of both the velocity\nand the density steepen at a smaller wavenumber. The comparison between ideal\nand non-ideal MHD simulations shows that ambipolar diffusion causes a shift of\nthe filament thickness distribution towards higher values. However, none of the\ndistributions exhibit the pronounced peak found in the observed local\nfilaments. Limitations in dynamical range and the absence of self-gravity in\nthese numerical experiments do not allow us to conclude at this time whether\nthis is due to the different filament selection or due to the physics inherent\nof the filament formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 16:59:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

In principle, a system that implements QEC can actually pass a\n\"break-even\" point and preserve quantum information for longer than the\nlifetime of its constituent parts. Reaching the break-even point, however, has\nthus far remained an outstanding and challenging goal. Several previous works\nhave demonstrated elements of QEC in NMR, ions, nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers,\nphotons, and superconducting transmons. However, these works primarily\nillustrate the signatures or scaling properties of QEC codes rather than test\nthe capacity of the system to extend the lifetime of quantum information over\ntime. Here we demonstrate a QEC system that reaches the break-even point by\nsuppressing the natural errors due to energy loss for a qubit logically encoded\nin superpositions of coherent states, or cat states of a superconducting\nresonator. Moreover, the experiment implements a full QEC protocol by using\nreal-time feedback to encode, monitor naturally occurring errors, decode, and\ncorrect. As measured by full process tomography, the enhanced lifetime of the\nencoded information is 320 microseconds without any post-selection. This is 20\ntimes greater than that of the system's transmon, over twice as long as an\nuncorrected logical encoding, and 10% longer than the highest quality element\nof the system (the resonator's 0, 1 Fock states). Our results illustrate the\npower of novel, hardware efficient qubit encodings over traditional QEC\nschemes. Furthermore, they advance the field of experimental error correction\nfrom confirming the basic concepts to exploring the metrics that drive system\nperformance and the challenges in implementing a fault-tolerant system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 18:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-16"}

It is a\nfunction of gas metallicity, but the low metallicity regime of the KS diagram\nis poorly sampled. We have analyzed data for a representative set of extremely\nmetal-poor galaxies (XMPs), as well as auxiliary data, and compared these to\nempirical and theoretical predictions. The majority of the XMPs possess high\nspecific SFRs, similar to high redshift star-forming galaxies. On the KS plot,\nthe XMP HI data occupy the same region as dwarfs, and extend the relation for\nlow surface brightness galaxies. Considering the HI gas alone, a considerable\nfraction of the XMPs already fall off the KS law. Significant quantities of\n'dark' H$_2$ mass (i.e., not traced by CO) would imply that XMPs possess low\nstar formation efficiencies (SFE$_{\\rm gas}$). Low SFE$_{\\rm gas}$ in XMPs may\nbe the result of the metal-poor nature of the HI gas. Alternatively, the HI\nreservoir may be largely inert, the star formation being dominated by\ncosmological accretion. Time lags between gas accretion and star formation may\nalso reduce the apparent SFE$_{\\rm gas}$, as may galaxy winds, which can expel\nmost of the gas into the intergalactic medium.

One important question is how evolutionary mechanisms can select for\nthe optimised usage of energy in situations where it does not lead to immediate\nadvantage. For example, this problem is of great importance to improve our\nunderstanding about the major transition from unicellular to multicellular form\nof life. The immediate advantage of gathering efficient individuals in an\nenergetic context is not clear. Although this process increases relatedness\namong individuals, it also increases local competition. To address this\nquestion, we propose a model of two competing metabolic strategies that makes\nexplicit reference to the resource usage. We assume the existence of an\nefficient strain, which converts resource into energy at high efficiency but\ndisplays a low rate of resource consumption, and an inefficient strain, which\nconsumes resource at a high rate with a low efficiency in converting it to\nenergy. We explore the dynamics in both well-mixed and structured populations.\nThe selection for optimised energy usage is measured by the likelihood of that\nan efficient strain can invade a population only comprised by inefficient\nstrains. It is found that the region of the parameter space at which the\nefficient strain can thrive in structured populations is always larger than\nobserved in well-mixed populations. In fact, in well-mixed populations the\nefficient strain is only evolutionarily stable in the domain whereupon there is\nno evolutionary dilemma. We also observe that small group sizes enhance the\nchance of invasion by the efficient strain in spite of increasing the\ncompetition among relatives. This outcome corroborates the key role played by\nkin selection and shows that the group dynamics relied on group expansion,\noverlapping generations and group split can balance the negative effects of\nlocal competition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 19:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-21"}

This assumption however is not always\npractical (especially in large markets) and agents usually need to go through\nsome costly deliberation process in order to learn their preferences. In this\npaper we assume that such deliberations are carried out via interviews, where\nan interview involves a man and a woman, each of whom learns information about\nthe other as a consequence. If everybody interviews everyone else, then clearly\nagents can fully learn their preferences. But interviews are costly, and we may\nwish to minimize their use. It is often the case, especially in practical\nsettings, that due to correlation between agents' preferences, it is\nunnecessary for all potential interviews to be carried out in order to obtain a\nstable matching. Thus the problem is to find a good strategy for interviews to\nbe carried out in order to minimize their use, whilst leading to a stable\nmatching. One way to evaluate the performance of an interview strategy is to\ncompare it against a naive algorithm that conducts all interviews. We argue\nhowever that a more meaningful comparison would be against an optimal offline\nalgorithm that has access to agents' preference orderings under complete\ninformation. We show that, unless P=NP, no offline algorithm can compute the\noptimal interview strategy in polynomial time. If we are additionally aiming\nfor a particular stable matching (perhaps one with certain desirable\nproperties), we provide restricted settings under which efficient optimal\noffline algorithms exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 20:22:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 09:30:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2016 16:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-21"}

Although the choice of appropriate problem-specific\nsummary statistics crucially influences the quality of the likelihood\napproximation and hence also the quality of the posterior sample in ABC, there\nare only few principled general-purpose approaches to the selection or\nconstruction of such summary statistics.

In this context, we provide a\nbalanced discourse on the possibly positive signal from X-ray observations.\nAnother focus of the paper concerns the construction of particle physics\nmodels, aiming to explain how sterile neutrinos of keV-scale masses could arise\nin concrete settings beyond the Standard Model of elementary particle physics.\nThe paper ends with an extensive review of current and future astrophysical and\nlaboratory searches, highlighting new ideas and their experimental challenges,\nas well as future perspectives for the discovery of sterile neutrinos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 21:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2017 14:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-10"}

As such, it is used to constrain and\ntest galaxy formation and evolution models. Of particular interest, apart from\nthe slope of the relation, is its intrinsic scatter. In this paper, we use the\nEAGLE simulation to study the dependence of the BTFR on the size of the\nsimulated galaxy sample. The huge number of datapoint available in the\nsimulation is indeed not available with current observations. Observational\nstudies that computed the BTFR used various (small) size samples with the only\nobligation to have galaxies spanning over a large range of masses and rotation\nrates. Accordingly, to compare observational and theoretical results, we build\na large number of various size datasets using the same criterion and derive the\nBTFR for all of them. Unmistakably, their is an effect of the number of\ngalaxies used to derive the relation. The smaller the number, the larger the\nstandard deviation around the average slope and intrinsic scatter of a given\nsize sample of galaxies. This observation allows us to alleviate the tensions\nbetween observational measurements and LCDM predictions. Namely, the size of\nthe observational samples adds up to the complexity in comparing observed and\nsimulated relations to discredit or confirm LCDM. Similarly, samples, even\nlarge, that do not reflect the galaxy distribution give on average biased\nresults. Large size samples reproducing the underlying distribution of galaxies\nconstitute a supplementary necessity to compare efficiently observations and\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 21:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

To confirm a putative 21-cm detection, and check the\naccuracy of 21-cm data analysis pipelines, it would be very useful to\ncross-correlate against a genuine cosmological signal. The most promising\ncosmological signals are wide-field maps of Lyman alpha emitting galaxies\n(LAEs), expected from the Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) Ultra-Deep field. Here\nwe present estimates of the correlation between LAE maps at z~7 and the 21-cm\nsignal observed by both the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the planned Square\nKilometer Array Phase 1 (SKA1). We adopt a systematic approach, varying both:\n(i) the prescription of assigning LAEs to host halos; and (ii) the large-scale\nstructure of neutral and ionized regions (i.e. EoR morphology). We find that\nthe LAE-21cm cross-correlation is insensitive to (i), thus making it a robust\nprobe of the EoR.

This helps us refine the predicted states\nexploiting the error in estimating the states of agents. Three real-world\ndatasets are used to evaluate and validate the information diffusion process in\nthis novel layered network approach. Our results demonstrate a lower prediction\nerror when using the interconnected network rather than the single connectivity\nlayer between the agents. The prediction error is further improved by using the\nestimated diffusion connection and by applying the Kalman approach with partial\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 22:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-22"}

Despite their\nimportance, a detailed understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for\nthe driving of these winds is lacking. In an effort to gain more insight into\nthe nature of these flows, we perform global three-dimensional\nmagneto-hydrodynamical simulations of an isolated Milky Way-size starburst\ngalaxy. We focus on the dynamical role of cosmic rays injected by supernovae,\nand specifically on the impact of the streaming and anisotropic diffusion of\ncosmic rays along the magnetic fields. We find that these microphysical effects\ncan have a significant effect on the wind launching and mass loading factors\ndepending on the details of the plasma physics. Due to the cosmic ray streaming\ninstability, cosmic rays propagating in the interstellar medium scatter on\nself-excited Alfven waves and couple to the gas. When the wave growth due to\nthe streaming instability is inhibited by some damping process, such as the\nturbulent damping, the cosmic ray coupling to the gas is weaker and their\neffective propagation speed faster than the Alfven speed. Alternatively, cosmic\nrays could scatter from \"extrinsic turbulence\" that is driven by another\nmechanism. We demonstrate that the presence of moderately super-Alfvenic cosmic\nray streaming enhances the efficiency of galactic wind driving. Cosmic rays\nstream away from denser regions near the galactic disk along partially ordered\nmagnetic fields and, in the process, accelerate more tenuous gas away from the\ngalaxy. For cosmic ray acceleration efficiencies broadly consistent with the\nobservational constraints, cosmic rays reduce the galactic star formation rates\nand significantly aid in launching galactic winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 22:42:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

The main reason is the well-known boundary\nbias problems that it suffers from, but also its poor behaviour in the long\nright tail that such a density typically exhibits. A natural approach to this\nproblem is to first estimate the density of the logarithm of X, and obtaining\nan estimate of the density of X using standard results on functions of random\nvariables (`back-transformation'). Although intuitive, the basic application of\nthis idea yields very poor results, as was documented earlier in the\nliterature. In this paper, the main reason for this underachievement is\nidentified, and an easy fix is suggested. It is demonstrated that combining the\ntransformation with local likelihood density estimation methods produces very\ngood estimators of R+-supported densities, not only close to the boundary, but\nalso in the right tail. The asymptotic properties of the proposed `local\nlikelihood transformation kernel density estimators' are derived for a generic\ntransformation, not only for the logarithm, which allows one to consider other\ntransformations as well. One of them, called the `probex' transformation, is\ngiven more focus. Finally, the excellent behaviour of those estimators in\npractice is evidenced through a comprehensive simulation study and the analysis\nof several real data sets. A nice consequence of articulating the method around\nlocal-likelihood estimation is that the resulting density estimates are\ntypically smooth and visually pleasant, without oversmoothing important\nfeatures of the underlying density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 23:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Even in the case of EM waves in flowing media, the results\nare subtle. For a simple shear flow of constant n fluid, incident radiation is\nshown to be reflected and refracted in an analogous manner to Snell's law.\nHowever, the beam intensities differ and the system has an asymmetry in that an\ninternal reflection gap opens at steep incident angles nearly oriented with the\nshear. For EM waves these effects are generally negligible in real systems but\nthey introduce the topic at a reduced level of complexity of the more\ninteresting acoustic case. Acoustic streaming is suggested, both from theory\nand experimental data, to be associated with vorticity generation at the driver\nitself. Bounds on the vorticity in bulk and nonlinear effects demonstrate that\nthe bulk sources, even with attenuation, cannot drive such a strong flow. A\nreview of the velocity scales in the problem suggest that a variation of the\nScholte wave at the driver-fluid interface with local cavitation on the\ndecompression phase creates a lateral flow of fluid that generates the stream\nand imparts the vorticity from the driver plate. In the case of Darcy flow in\nsintered media, an analysis of data suggests that acoustically enhanced flow\nmay be the result of surface effects that narrow channels that are cleared by\nultrasonic cavitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 03:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

The long range Coulomb coupling between LSPs in\nperiodic metallic nanostructures may lead to interesting collective effects. In\nthis paper, we investigate the combination effects of the local field\nenhancement and collective plasmon resonances in one dimensional metallic\nnanoparticle dimer chains. It is found that the strong near field in the gap\nand the far field interactions among the metallic nanoparticles lead to\nanomalous collective hotspots with dual enhancement of the electromagnetic\nfield. In particular, the interference between the incident field and the\ninduced internal field leads to Fano-type effect with Wood anomaly related\ndestructive interference and the strong resonance with an extremely narrow\nwidth.

While elliptic and hyperbolic\npoints typically govern such behaviour in 3D systems, degenerate (parabolic)\npoints play a more important role than expected. These points represent a\nbifurcation in local stability and Lagrangian topology. In this study we\nconsider the ramifications of the two types of degenerate periodic points that\noccur in a model 3D fluid flow. (1) Period-tripling bifurcations occur when the\nlocal rotation angle associated with elliptic points is reversed, creating a\nreversal in the orientation of associated Lagrangian structures. Even though a\nsingle unstable point is created, the bifurcation in local stability has a\nlarge influence on local transport and the global arrangement of manifolds as\nthe unstable degenerate point has three stable and three unstable directions,\nsimilar to hyperbolic points, and occurs at the intersection of three\nhyperbolic periodic lines. The presence of period-tripling bifurcation points\nindicates regions of either chaos or confinement depending on the nature of the\nassociated manifold intersections. (2) The second type of bifurcation occurs\nwhen periodic lines become tangent to local or global invariant surfaces. This\nbifurcation creates both saddle-centre bifurcations which can create both\nchaotic and stable regions, and period-doubling bifurcations which are a common\nroute to chaos in 2D systems.

The ant system performs better than some published approaches,\nhowever results obtained are not as good as those obtained by the best\npublished approaches. This study may be used as a benchmark for ant based\nalgorithms that solve the curriculum based university course timetabling\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 08:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

The authors proceed to solve this\nlinear search problem in the case of countably many boxes and an adversary\nplaced treasure, and prove that the best speed-up possible by $k$\nnon-coordinating searchers is precisely $\\frac{k}{4}(1+1/k)^2$.

In an\nextension of our previous work Roy et al., [Phys. Lett. B 750, 45 (2015)], we\nconsider the fluid to have a non-zero magnetization. First, we assume a\nconstant magnetic susceptibility $\\chi_{m}$ and consider an ultrarelativistic\nideal gas equation of state. For a paramagnetic fluid (i.e., with\n$\\chi_{m}>0$), the decay of the energy density slows down since the fluid gains\nenergy from the magnetic field. For a diamagnetic fluid (i.e., with\n$\\chi_{m}<0$), the energy density decays faster because it feeds energy into\nthe magnetic field. Furthermore, when the magnetic field is taken to be\nexternal and to decay in proper time $\\tau$ with a power law $\\sim\\tau^{-a}$,\ntwo distinct solutions can be found depending on the values of $a$ and\n$\\chi_m$.

Assuming that the\nreference gene is read in frame +0, an overlapping gene can be encoded in two\nreading frames in the sense strand, denoted by +1 and +2, and in three reading\nframes in the opposite strand, denoted by -0, -1 and -2. This motivated\nnumerous researchers to study the constraints induced by the genetic code on\nthe various overlapping frames, mostly based on information theory. Our focus\nin this paper is on the constraints induced on two overlapping genes in terms\nof amino acids, as well as polypeptides. We show that simple linear constraints\nbind the amino acid composition of two proteins encoded by overlapping genes.\nNovel constraints are revealed when polypeptides are considered, and not just\nsingle amino acids. For example, in double-coding sequences with an overlapping\nreading frame -2, each Tyrosine (denoted as Tyr or Y) in the overlapping frame\noverlaps a Tyrosine in the reference frame +0 (and reciprocally), whereas\nspecific words (e.g. YY) never occur. We thus distinguish between null\nconstraints (YY = 0 in frame -2) and non-null constraints (Y in frame +0 <=> Y\nin frame -2). Our equivalence-based constraints are symmetrical and thus enable\nthe characterization of the joint composition of overlapping proteins. We\ndescribe several formal frameworks and a graph algorithm to characterize and\ncompute these constraints. These results yield support for understanding the\nmechanisms and evolution of overlapping genes, and for developing novel\noverlapping gene detection methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 10:18:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2016 15:33:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 08:45:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 09:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-20"}

The\nidea is to construct a deterministic coupling---i.e., a transport map---between\na complex \"target\" probability measure of interest and a simpler reference\nmeasure. Given a transport map, one can generate arbitrarily many independent\nand unweighted samples from the target simply by pushing forward reference\nsamples through the map. We consider two different and complementary scenarios:\nfirst, when only evaluations of the unnormalized target density are available,\nand second, when the target distribution is known only through a finite\ncollection of samples. We show that in both settings the desired transports can\nbe characterized as the solutions of variational problems. We then address\npractical issues associated with the optimization--based construction of\ntransports: choosing finite-dimensional parameterizations of the map, enforcing\nmonotonicity, quantifying the error of approximate transports, and refining\napproximate transports by enriching the corresponding approximation spaces.\nApproximate transports can also be used to \"Gaussianize\" complex distributions\nand thus precondition conventional asymptotically exact sampling schemes. We\nplace the measure transport approach in broader context, describing connections\nwith other optimization--based samplers, with inference and density estimation\nschemes using optimal transport, and with alternative transformation--based\napproaches to simulation.

A priori knowledge of the interference\nenvironment has been exploited in many previous works to enable accurate\nestimators even when training is not generous. Specifically, recent work has\nshown that employing practical constraints such as the rank of clutter subspace\nand the condition number of disturbance covariance leads to powerful estimators\nthat have closed form solutions. While rank and the condition number are very\neffective constraints, often practical non-idealities makes it difficult for\nthem to be known precisely using physical models. Therefore, we propose a\nrobust covariance estimation method for radar STAP via an expected likelihood\n(EL) approach. We analyze covariance estimation algorithms under three cases of\nimperfect constraints: 1) a rank constraint, 2) both rank and noise power\nconstraints, and 3) condition number constraint. In each case, we formulate\nprecise constraint determination as an optimization problem using the EL\ncriterion. For each of the three cases, we derive new analytical results which\nallow for computationally efficient, practical ways of setting these\nconstraints. In particular, we prove formally that both the rank and condition\nnumber as determined by the EL criterion are unique. Through experimental\nresults from a simulation model and the KASSPER data set, we show the estimator\nwith optimal constraints obtained by the EL approach outperforms state of the\nart alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 21:38:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-18"}

The motivations are\nmanifold: (i) growing NGS and single cell data from cancer patients, (ii) need\nfor novel Data Science and Machine Learning algorithms to infer models of\ncancer progression, and (iii) a desire to understand the temporal and\nheterogeneous structure of tumor to tame its progression by efficacious\ntherapeutic intervention. This thesis presents a multi-disciplinary effort to\nmodel tumor progression involving successive accumulation of genetic\nalterations, each resulting populations manifesting themselves in a cancer\nphenotype. The framework presented in this work along with algorithms derived\nfrom it, represents a novel approach for inferring cancer progression, whose\naccuracy and convergence rates surpass the existing techniques. The approach\nderives its power from several fields including algorithms in machine learning,\ntheory of causality and cancer biology. Furthermore, a modular pipeline to\nextract ensemble-level progression models from sequenced cancer genomes is\nproposed. The pipeline combines state-of-the-art techniques for sample\nstratification, driver selection, identification of fitness-equivalent\nexclusive alterations and progression model inference. Furthermore, the results\nare validated by synthetic data with realistic generative models, and\nempirically interpreted in the context of real cancer datasets; in the later\ncase, biologically significant conclusions are also highlighted. Specifically,\nit demonstrates the pipeline's ability to reproduce much of the knowledge on\ncolorectal cancer, as well as to suggest novel hypotheses.
