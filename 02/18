In their\nseminal work on optimal motion planning Karaman and Frazzoli (2011) conjectured\nthat a sampling-based planner has a certain property if the underlying RGG has\nthis property as well. In this paper we settle this conjecture and leverage it\nfor the development of a general framework for the analysis of sampling-based\nplanners. Our framework, which we call localization-tessellation, allows for\neasy transfer of arguments on RGGs from the free unit-hypercube to spaces\npunctured by obstacles, which are geometrically and topologically much more\ncomplex. We demonstrate its power by providing alternative and (arguably)\nsimple proofs for probabilistic completeness and asymptotic (near-)optimality\nof probabilistic roadmaps (PRMs). Furthermore, we introduce several variants of\nPRMs, analyze them using our framework, and discuss the implications of the\nanalysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 16:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-18"}

Based on the spectroscopy, we\nderive reliable values of log g, Teff and log(N(He)/N(H)) for 38 targets, as\nwell as estimates of the effective temperature for another nine targets. The\nsurvey uncovered a total of five rapid variables with multi-periodic\noscillations between 85 and 125 s. Spectroscopically, they form a homogeneous\ngroup of hydrogen-rich subdwarf O stars clustered between 48,000 and 54,000 K.\nFor each of the variables we are able to measure between two and three\nsignificant pulsations believed to constitute independent harmonic\noscillations. In addition to the rapid variables, we found an EHB star with an\napparently periodic luminosity variation of ~2700 s, which we tentatively\nsuggest may be caused by ellipsoidal variations in a close binary. Using the\noverlapping photometry and spectroscopy sample we are able to map an empirical\nomega Cen instability strip. This can be directly compared to the pulsation\ndriving predicted from the Montreal \"second-generation\" models. We find that\nthe region where p-mode excitation occurs is bifurcated, and the well-known\ninstability strip between 29,000-36,000 K where the rapid subdwarf B pulsators\nare found is complemented by a second one above 50,000 K.

We also quantify beam-driven\nlaunch to the outer solar system, interstellar precursors and ultimately\nstarships. We estimate the principal observable parameters of power beaming\nleakage. Extraterrestrial civilizations would know their power beams could be\nobserved, and so could put a message on the power beam and broadcast it for our\nreceipt at little additional energy or cost. By observing leakage from power\nbeams we may find a message embedded on the beam. Recent observations of the\nanomalous star KIC8462852 by the Allen Telescope Array set some limits on\nextraterrestrial power beaming in that system. We show that most power beaming\napplications commensurate with those suggested for our solar system would be\ndetectable if using the frequency range monitored by the ATA, and so the lack\nof detection is a meaningful, if modest, constraint on extraterrestrial power\nbeaming in that system. Until more extensive observations are made, the limited\nobservation time and frequency coverage are not sufficiently broad in frequency\nand duration to produce firm conclusions. Such beams would be visible over\nlarge interstellar distances. This implies a new approach to the SETI search:\nInstead of focusing on narrowband beacon transmissions generated by another\ncivilization, look for more powerful beams with much wider bandwidth. This\nrequires a new approach for their discovery by telescopes on Earth.

This article builds\non the structure developed in Paper I in order to rigorously express the\npolarimetric SC image in terms of the field impinging on the wavefront sensor\n(WFS), thereby providing a direct connection between the measurements made in\nboth subsystems. This formulation allows the SC image to be written as a\nfunction of the WFS measurements, including the following unknown quantities\nwhich can, in principle, be estimated via statistical inference: the non-common\npath aberration (NCPA), WFS gain errors, aberrations downstream of the\nbeamsplitter, and the planetary image. It is demonstrated that WFS bias error\nis mathematically equivalent to NCPA. Thus, with the ability to treat WFS bias\nand gains, the method should not be overly sensitive to WFS calibration\nproblems. Importantly, this formulation includes stochastic processes that\nrepresent noisy measurement of the SC image, noisy WFS measurements, and\nhigh-frequency components of the wavefront to which the WFS is insensitive. It\nis shown that wavefront error due to noise in the WFS measurements has a\nconvenient semi-analytical representation in terms of the WFS measurement\noperator's singular functions. Further, the first and second order statistics\nof these processes are specified, thereby setting the stage for the application\nof statistical inference methods to be describe in later papers in this series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 17:09:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-18"}

Key to our\napproach is the inclusion of the orbital character of the low-energy electronic\nstates into renormalization group analysis. Our results show that in systems\nwith large Fermi energies, such as BaFe2As2, LaFeAsO, and NaFeAs, orbital order\nis induced by stripe magnetism. However, in systems with small Fermi energies,\nsuch as FeSe, the system develops a spontaneous orbital order, while magnetic\norder does not develop. Our results provide a unifying description of different\niron-based materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 17:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

The multihead multitrack (MHMT) detector is proposed to better combat\nITI. Such a detector, however, has prohibitive implementation complexity. In\nthis paper we propose to use the reduced-state sequence estimation (RSSE)\nalgorithm to significantly reduce the complexity, and render MHMT practical. We\nfirst consider a commonly used symmetric two-head two-track (2H2T) channel\nmodel. The effective distance between two input symbols is redefined. It\nprovides a better distance measure and naturally leads to an unbalanced set\npartition tree. Different trellis configurations are obtained based on the\ndesired performance/complexity tradeoff. Simulation results show that the\nreduced MHMT detector can achieve near maximum-likelihood (ML) performance with\na small fraction of the original number of trellis states.

In this work, we reveal that stable and\natomically flat rutile TiO2(001) surfaces can be prepared with an atomically\nordered reconstructed surface already during a furnace annealing treatment in\nair.

Such Sample Space Reducing\nprocesses (SSRP) offer an alternative new mechanism to understand the emergence\nof scaling in countless processes. The corresponding power law exponents were\nshown to be related to noise levels in the process. Here we show that the\nemergence of scaling is not limited to the simplest SSRPs, but holds for a huge\ndomain of stochastic processes that are characterized by non-uniform prior\ndistributions. We demonstrate mathematically that in the absence of noise the\nscaling exponents converge to $-1$ (Zipf's law) for almost all prior\ndistributions. As a consequence it becomes possible to fully understand\ntargeted diffusion on weighted directed networks and its associated scaling\nlaws law in node visit distributions. The presence of cycles can be properly\ninterpreted as playing the same role as noise in SSRPs and, accordingly,\ndetermine the scaling exponents. The result that Zipf's law emerges as a\ngeneric feature of diffusion on networks, regardless of its details, and that\nthe exponent of visiting times is related to the amount of cycles in a network\ncould be relevant for a series of applications in traffic-, transport- and\nsupply chain management.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 19:07:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 17:00:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2016 09:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-02"}

Remarkably, we are able to consider cases where the gas contains on\nthe order of $N=100$ particles, comparable to that studied in experiments on\ncold atomic gases. We are able to do by exploiting the integrability of the gas\ntogether with the observation that the excitonic state can be constructed\nthrough a simple superposition of exact eigenstates of the gas. The number of\nstates in this superposition, rather than being exponentially large in the\nnumber of particles, scales linearly with $N$.\n  We study the evolution of such spatially localized states in both strongly\ninteracting Bose and Fermi gases. The behavior of the light cones when the\ninteraction strength and density of the gas is varied can be understood from\nexact results for the spin excitation spectrum in these systems.

Due to limited bandwidth available\nat both top-of-the-rack and aggregation switches and tenants in different\nservice classes need differentiated services, network bandwidth must be\napportioned among different intra- and inter-rack data flows for different\nservice classes in line with their traffic statistics. We formulate this\nproblem as weighted queuing and employ a class of probabilistic request\nscheduling policies to derive a closed-form upper-bound of service latency for\nerasure-coded storage with arbitrary file access patterns and service time\ndistributions. The result enables us to propose a joint weighted latency (over\ndifferent service classes) optimization over three entangled \"control knobs\":\nthe bandwidth allocation at top-of-the-rack and aggregation switches for\ndifferent service classes, dynamic scheduling of file requests, and the\nplacement of encoded file chunks (i.e., data locality).

First, we\npropose robust kernel covariance operator (robust kernel CO) and robust kernel\ncrosscovariance operator (robust kernel CCO) based on a generalized loss\nfunction instead of the quadratic loss function.

Finally, we propose a\nmethod based on robust kernel CO and robust kernel CCO, called robust kernel\nCCA, which is designed for contaminated data and less sensitive to noise than\nclassical kernel CCA. The principles we describe also apply to many kernel\nmethods which must deal with the issue of kernel CO or kernel CCO.

In between these\ntwo extremes lies the semi-resolved regime, which encompasses a rich and\nrelatively unexplored realm of observational phenomena. Here we develop the\nconcept of pixel color magnitude diagrams (pCMDs) as a powerful technique for\nanalyzing stellar populations in the semi-resolved regime. pCMDs show the\ndistribution of imaging data in the plane of pixel luminosity vs. pixel color.\nA key feature of pCMDs is that they are sensitive to all stars, including both\nthe evolved giants and the unevolved main sequence stars. An important variable\nin this regime is the mean number of stars per pixel, $N_{\\rm pix}$. Simulated\npCMDs demonstrate a strong sensitivity to the star formation history (SFH) and\nallow one to break degeneracies between age, metallicity and dust based on two\nfilter data for values of $N_{\\rm pix}$ up to at least $10^4$.

From analyzing a small\nregion of the disk we find a non-parametric SFH that is smooth and consistent\nwith an exponential decay timescale of 4 Gyr.

Detailed high resolution studies of AGN with mid-infrared (MIR)\ninterferometry have revealed parsec-sized dust emission elongated in the polar\ndirection in four sources.\n  Aims. Using a larger, coherently analyzed sample of AGN observed with MIR\ninterferometry, we aim to identify elongated mid-infrared emission in a\nstatistical sample of sources. More specifically we wish to determine if there\nis indeed a preferred direction of the elongation and whether this direction is\nconsistent with a torus-like structure or with a polar emission.\n  Methods. We investigate the significance of the detection of an elongated\nshape in the MIR emission by fitting elongated Gaussian models to the\ninterferometric data at 12 um. We pay special attention to 1) the uncertainties\ncaused by an inhomogeneous (u,v) coverage, 2) the typical errors in the\nmeasurements and 3) the spatial resolution achieved for each object.\n  Results. From our sample of 23 sources we are able to find elongated\nparsec-scale MIR emission in five sources: three type 2s, one type 1i and one\ntype 1. Elongated emission in four of these sources has been published before;\nNGC5506 is a new detection. The observed axis ratios are typically around 2 and\nthe position angle of the 12 um emission for all the elongated sources seems to\nbe always closer to the polar axis of the system than to the equatorial axis.\nTwo other objects, NGC4507 and MCG-5-23-16 with a reasonably well mapped (u,v)\ncoverage and good signal-to-noise ratios, appear to have a less elongated 12 um\nemission.\n  Conclusions. Our finding that sources showing elongated mid-infrared emission\nare preferentially extended in polar direction sets strong constraints on torus\nmodels or implies that both the torus and the NLR/outflow region have to be\nmodeled together.

This study significantly refines our\nunderstanding of urban scaling, making clear that some of what has been\npreviously ascribed to urban environments may simply be the high density\nportion of non-urban scaling. It also makes clear that some metrics undergo\nspecific transitions in urban environments and these transitions can include\nnegative scaling exponents indicative of collapse. This study gives promise of\nfar more sophisticated scale adjusted metrics and indicates that studies of\nurban scaling represent a high density subsection of overall scaling\nrelationships which continue into rural environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 21:08:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-19"}

We extend the study to colloids\nwith homeotropic anchoring but with an associated point defect instead of a\nSaturn ring and show that they find a different preferred location, i.e. we can\nplace otherwise identical particles at well defined sites according to their\ntopological defect structure. Finally, for deep enough wells, confinement\ndrives topological transitions of Saturn rings to dipoles. This ability to\ntailor wall geometry to guide colloids to well defined sites within nematic\nliquid crystals represents an important new tool in directed assembly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 00:55:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2016 15:59:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 03:19:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 3 May 2016 14:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-07"}

In both\nrespects, a mechanical resonator formed from superfluid liquid helium offers\nseveral appealing features: low electromagnetic absorption, high thermal\nconductivity, vanishing viscosity, well-understood mechanical loss, and in situ\nalignment with cryogenic cavities. In addition, it offers degrees of freedom\nthat differ qualitatively from those of a solid.

We analyze the search\nspaces of two current state-of-the-art systems, SPR and Prophet, with 16\ndifferent search space configurations. Our results are derived from an analysis\nof 1104 different search spaces and 768 patch generation executions. Together\nthese experiments consumed over 9000 hours of CPU time on Amazon EC2.\n  The analysis shows that 1) correct patches are sparse in the search spaces\n(typically at most one correct patch per search space per defect), 2) incorrect\npatches that nevertheless pass all of the test cases in the validation test\nsuite are typically orders of magnitude more abundant, and 3) leveraging\ninformation other than the test suite is therefore critical for enabling the\nsystem to successfully isolate correct patches.\n  We also characterize a key tradeoff in the structure of the search spaces.\nLarger and richer search spaces that contain correct patches for more defects\ncan actually cause systems to find fewer, not more, correct patches. We\nidentify two reasons for this phenomenon: 1) increased validation times because\nof the presence of more candidate patches and 2) more incorrect patches that\npass the test suite and block the discovery of correct patches. These\nfundamental properties, which are all characterized for the first time in this\npaper, help explain why past systems often fail to generate correct patches and\nhelp identify challenges, opportunities, and productive future directions for\nthe field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 01:09:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-19"}

A military strategy typically employs the threat or use of military force\nin opposition to an adversary, and is called upon where large scale force is\nviewed as the way to achieve such goals. Strategic thinking is traditionally\nfocused on which part or combination of land, air, and naval forces is most\neffective. This may be too narrow an approach to accomplishing the ultimate\nend, which is generally political influence or control--or preventing influence\nor control by others--and almost never consists of physical destruction itself.\nIn order to broaden the discussion of military strategy, we consider here three\ndistinct effects of inflicting stress on an opponent: a) A fragile system is\ndamaged--possibly catastrophically, b) A robust system is largely unaffected,\nretaining much or all of its prior strength, c) Some systems actually gain\nstrength, a property which has recently been termed antifragility. Traditional\nperspectives of military strategy implicitly assume fragility, limiting their\nvalidity and resulting in surprise, and assume a specific end state rather than\nan overall condition of the system as a goal. Robustness and antifragility are\nrelevant both to offense and defense. While robustness and antifragility are\ndesirable in friendly systems, an enemy possessing these characteristics\nundermines the premise that an attack will achieve a desired increase in\ncontrol. Historical and contemporary examples demonstrate the failure of\ntraditional strategies against antifragile enemies--even devastating damage\ninflicted upon nations or other organizations did not weaken and defeat them,\nbut rather strengthened them, resulting in their victory.

The formula was\nconjectured before by several researchers. The dimensions are expressed by\nspecial values of Shintani zeta functions for spaces of symmetric matrices at\nnon-positive integers. This formula was given by Shintani for only a small part\nof the geometric side of the trace formula. To be precise, it is the\ncontribution of unipotent elements corresponding to the partitions\n$(2^j,1^{2n-2j})$, where $n$ denotes the degree and $0\\leq j \\leq n$.

Despite large\nuncertainties, driven by those in the stellar mass function, and in the\nextrapolation of local relations, one can explain the current non-detection of\nmoderate-luminosity AGN in Lyman Break Galaxies if galaxies below 1e11 Msun are\ncharacterized by the low-normalization scaling, and, even more so, if their\nEddington ratio is also typical of moderate-luminosity AGN rather than luminous\nquasars. AGN being missed by X-ray searches due to obscuration or instrinsic\nX-ray weakness also remain a possibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 08:10:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

Modern, more realistic variants of this model also equip each vertex\nwith a random position in a specific underlying geometry.

This is done by, first, building\nup a dynamic model of population, postulating existence of Driving Force acting\nat subjects, while they move along their cohort lines, causing the changes of\ntheir substantial health indicators , State Variables, at rate proportional to\nthis Force. The correspondent rates , named Cohort Trends, or C-trends,\ndescribe health history in each birth cohort. Having initial value and C-trends\n, the model allows to calculate health level (the means of State Variables) in\neach birth cohort, and thus, in the whole population. The task for statistical\nmethod is to identify the dynamic model (evaluate C-trends and Initial values)\nusing data from a set of consecutive independent cross-sectional surveys. This\nis done by an iterative algorithm, running multiple regression procedure at\neach step, until the specified smoothing conditions are fulfilled. The\nalgorithm can operate with surveys having different age ranges. The\nillustrative example shows the results of analysis of Body Mass Index for men ,\nusing 7 surveys in period 1972-2002 with age ranges 25-64 and 25-74.

One of the simplest models of information propagation is the push\nprotocol in which at each round each agent independently pushes the current\nknowledge to a random neighbour.

The aim of COBRA is to\npropagate information fast but with a limited number of transmissions per\nvertex per step. In this paper we study the cover time of the COBRA process\ndefined as the minimum time until each vertex has received the information at\nleast once. Our main result says that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex $r$-regular graph\nwhose transition matrix has second eigenvalue $\\lambda$, then the COBRA cover\ntime of $G$ is $\\mathcal O(\\log n )$, if $1-\\lambda$ is greater than a positive\nconstant, and $\\mathcal O((\\log n)/(1-\\lambda)^3))$, if $1-\\lambda \\gg\n\\sqrt{\\log( n)/n}$.

We therefore consider the sedimentation of\nnon-spherical (spheroidal) isolated and particle pairs in a viscous fluid via\nnumerical simulations using the Immersed Boundary Method. The simulations\nperformed here show that the critical Galileo number for the onset of secondary\nmotions decreases as the spheroid aspect ratio departs from 1. Above this\ncritical threshold, oblate particles perform a zigzagging motion whereas\nprolate particles rotate around the vertical axis while having their broad side\nfacing the falling direction. Instabilities of the vortices in the wake follow\nwhen farther increasing the Galileo number. We also study the\ndrafting-kissing-tumbling associated with the settling of particle pairs. We\nfind that the interaction time increases significantly for non-spherical\nparticles and, more interestingly, spheroidal particles are attracted from\nlarger lateral displacements. This has important implications for the\nestimation of collision kernels and can result in increasing clustering in\nsuspensions of sedimenting spheroids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 11:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

The overall absolute flux uncertainty is dominated by the estimated 5%\nmodel uncertainty of the stellar models in the PACS wavelength range between 60\nand 210 micron.

Most importantly, the\nrobustness of the fourth-order GKS is as good as the second-order one. Perfect\nnumerical solutions can be obtained from the high Reynolds number boundary\nlayer solutions to the hypersonic viscous heat conducting flow computations.\nMany numerical tests, including many difficult ones for the Navier-Stokes\nsolvers, have been used to validate the current fourth-order method. Following\nthe two-stage time-stepping framework, the one-stage third-order GKS can be\neasily extended to a fifth-order method with the usage of both first-order and\nsecond-order time derivatives of the flux function. The use of time-accurate\nflux function may have great impact on the development of higher-order CFD\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 13:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

Here, we consider the relaxation of classical, thermostatted particle\nsystems to equilibrium as well as to nonequilibrium steady states, using\ndynamical notions including decay of correlations. We show that the condition\nknown as {\\Omega}T-mixing is necessary and sufficient to prove relaxation of\nensemble averages to steady state values.

The results also allow us to\ngive a microscopic derivation of Prigogine's principle of minimum entropy\nproduction in the linear response regime.

This paper investigates the joint employment of cognition and\ncooperation techniques invoked for improving the energy efficiency of cellular\nnetworks. To be specific, the cellular devices first have to identify the\nunused spectral bands (known as spectrum holes) using their spectrum sensing\nfunctionality. Then, they cooperate for exploiting the detected spectrum holes\nto support energy-efficient cellular communications. Considering the fact that\ncontemporary terminals (e.g., smart phones) support various wireless access\ninterfaces, we exploit either the Bluetooth or the Wi-Fi network operating\nwithin the spectrum holes for supporting cellular communications with the\nintention of achieving energy savings. This approach is termed as\n\\emph{cognitive network cooperation}, since different wireless access networks\ncognitively cooperate with cellular networks. In order to illustrate the energy\nefficiency benefits of using both cognition and cooperation, we study the\ncooperation between television stations (TVSs) and BSs in transmitting to UTs\nrelying on an opportunistic exploitation of the TV spectrum, where the unused\nTV spectral band is utilized in an opportunistic way, depending on whether it\nis detected to be idle (or not). It is shown that for a given number of\ninformation bits to be transmitted, the total energy consumed is significantly\nreduced, when both cognition and cooperation are supported in cellular\nnetworks, as compared to the conventional direct transmission, pure cognition\nand pure cooperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 15:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-19"}

The rapidly\nspinning NS and the strong magnetic fields attributed to magnetars require that\nthe accreted mass onto the newly born NS possesses high specific angular\nmomentum and strong magnetic fields. These ingredients are expected, as in many\nother astrophysical objects, to form collimated outflows/jets. I argue that the\nbipolar outflow in the pre-magnetar phase transfers a substantial amount of\nenergy to the supernova (SN) ejecta, and it cannot be ignored in models that\nattribute SESNe to magnetars.

Toward the solid surface, the liquid microdroplet is moving with an\nimpinging gas flow, simulating the situation of ink droplets being deposited\nonto substrate with a collimated mist jet in the Optomec Aerosol Jet printing\nprocess. The computed values of maximum spread factor, for the range of\nparameters of practical interest to Aerosol Jet printing, were found in very\ngood agreement with some of the correlation formulas proposed by previous\nauthors in the literature. Combining formulas selected from different authors\nwith appropriate modifications yields a maximum spread factor formula that can\nbe used for first-order evaluations of deposited in droplet size during the\nAerosol Jet technology development. The computational results also illustrate\ndroplet impact dynamics with lamella shape evolution throughout the spreading,\nreceding-relaxation, and wetting equilibrium phases, consistent with that\nobserved and described by many previous authors. This suggests a\nscale-invariant nature of the basic droplet impact behavior such that\nexperiments with larger droplets at the same nondimensional parameter values\nmay be considered for studying microdroplet impact dynamics. Significant free\nsurface oscillations can be observed when the droplet viscosity is relatively\nlow. The border line between periodic free surface oscillations and aperiodic\ncreeping to capillary equilibrium free surface shape appears at the value of\nOhnesorge number around 0.25. Droplet bouncing after receding is prompted with\nlarge contact angles at solid surface (as consistent with findings reported in\nthe literature), but can be suppressed by increasing the droplet viscosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 02:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-31"}
