We use a one-dimensional mean-field model, which combines the cubic\nnonlinearity and a double-well-potential (DWP) structure with an elevated\nfloor, which supports leaky modes (quasi-bound states) in the linear limit. The\nsetting can be implemented in nonlinear optics and BEC. The order in which the\nSSB and self-trapping transitions take place with the growth of the\nnonlinearity strength depends on the height of the central barrier of the DWP:\nthe SSB happens first if the barrier is relatively high, while self-trapping\ncomes first if the barrier is lower. The SSB of the leaky modes is\ncharacterized by specific asymmetry of their radiation tails, which, in\naddition, feature a resonant dependence on the relation between the total size\nof the system and radiation wavelength. As a result of the SSB, the instability\nof symmetric modes initiates spontaneous Josephson oscillations.

In spite of a recent\nprofusion of prediction studies that exploit online social and information\nnetwork data, this question remains unanswered, in part because it has not been\nadequately specified. In this paper we attempt to clarify the question by\npresenting a simple stylized model of success that attributes prediction error\nto one of two generic sources: insufficiency of available data and/or models on\nthe one hand; and inherent unpredictability of complex social systems on the\nother. We then use this model to motivate an illustrative empirical study of\ninformation cascade size prediction on Twitter. Despite an unprecedented volume\nof information about users, content, and past performance, our best performing\nmodels can explain less than half of the variance in cascade sizes. In turn,\nthis result suggests that even with unlimited data predictive performance would\nbe bounded well below deterministic accuracy. Finally, we explore this\npotential bound theoretically using simulations of a diffusion process on a\nrandom scale free network similar to Twitter. We show that although higher\npredictive power is possible in theory, such performance requires a homogeneous\nsystem and perfect ex-ante knowledge of it: even a small degree of uncertainty\nin estimating product quality or slight variation in quality across products\nleads to substantially more restrictive bounds on predictability. We conclude\nthat realistic bounds on predictive accuracy are not dissimilar from those we\nhave obtained empirically, and that such bounds for other complex social\nsystems for which data is more difficult to obtain are likely even lower.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2016 17:16:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

A valid instrumental variable is a variable that is independent of\nunmeasured confounders and affects the treatment but does not have a direct\neffect on the outcome beyond its effect on the treatment. Two commonly used\nestimators for using an instrumental variable to estimate a treatment effect\nare the two stage least squares estimator and the control function estimator.\nFor linear causal effect models, these two estimators are equivalent, but for\nnonlinear causal effect models, the estimators are different. We provide a\nsystematic comparison of these two estimators for nonlinear causal effect\nmodels and develop an approach to combing the two estimators that generally\nperforms better than either one alone. We show that the control function\nestimator is a two stage least squares estimator with an augmented set of\ninstrumental variables. If these augmented instrumental variables are valid,\nthen the control function estimator can be much more efficient than usual two\nstage least squares without the augmented instrumental variables while if the\naugmented instrumental variables are not valid, then the control function\nestimator may be inconsistent while the usual two stage least squares remains\nconsistent.

We center our discussion around adiabatic gauge\npotentials, which are the generators of unitary basis transformations in\nquantum systems and generators of special canonical transformations in\nclassical systems. In quantum systems, eigenstate expectation values of these\npotentials are the Berry connections and the covariance matrix of these gauge\npotentials is the geometric tensor, whose antisymmetric part defines the Berry\ncurvature and whose symmetric part is the Fubini-Study metric tensor. In\nclassical systems one simply replaces the eigenstate expectation value by an\naverage over the micro-canonical shell. For complicated interacting systems, we\nshow that a variational principle may be used to derive approximate gauge\npotentials. We then express the non-adiabatic response of the physical\nobservables of the system through these gauge potentials, specifically\ndemonstrating the close connection of the geometric tensor to the notions of\nLorentz force and renormalized mass. We highlight applications of this\nformalism to deriving counter-diabatic (dissipationless) driving protocols in\nvarious systems, as well as to finding equations of motion for slow macroscopic\nparameters coupled to fast microscopic degrees of freedom that go beyond\nmacroscopic Hamiltonian dynamics.

Three main techniques can be\nused to achieve this goal. The first involves waveform modelling. The flux we\nobserve from a hotspot on the neutron star surface offset from the rotational\npole will be modulated by the star's rotation, giving rise to a pulsation.\nInformation about mass and radius is encoded into the pulse profile via\nrelativistic effects, and tight constraints on mass and radius can be obtained.\nThe second technique involves characterising the spin distribution of accreting\nneutron stars. The most rapidly rotating stars provide a very clean constraint,\nsince the mass-shedding limit is a function of mass and radius. However the\noverall spin distribution also provides a guide to the torque mechanisms in\noperation and the moment of inertia, both of which can depend sensitively on\ndense matter physics. The third technique is to search for quasi-periodic\noscillations in X-ray flux associated with global seismic vibrations of\nmagnetars (the most highly magnetized neutron stars), triggered by magnetic\nexplosions. The vibrational frequencies depend on stellar parameters including\nthe dense matter equation of state. We illustrate how these complementary X-ray\ntiming techniques can be used to constrain the dense matter equation of state,\nand discuss the results that might be expected from a 10m$^2$ instrument.

Observations indicate that the\n$z=0$ stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relation has remarkably small scatter in\nstellar mass at fixed halo mass ($\\lesssim$ 0.2 dex) with little dependence on\nhalo mass. We investigate the origins of this scatter by combining N-body\nsimulations with observational constraints on the SMHM relation.

At lower masses, mass buildup since\n$z\\approx2$ is driven largely by in-situ growth.

The approximately constant scatter across a wide\nrange of halo masses at $z=0$ thus appears to be a coincidence as it is\ndetermined largely by in-situ growth at low masses and by hierarchical assembly\nat high masses. These results indicate that the scatter in the SMHM relation\ncan provide unique insight into the regularity of the galaxy formation process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2016 21:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2018 16:17:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-24"}

We\nsimulate a large number of Chandra spectra to explore the bias in the spectral\nfit and NH measurements obtained without including extinction from dust\nscattering. We find that without incorporating dust scattering, the measured NH\nwill be too large by a baseline level of 25%. This effect is modulated by the\nimaging resolution of the telescope, because some amount of unresolved\nscattered light will be captured within the aperture used to extract point\nsource information. In high resolution spectroscopy, dust scattering\nsignificantly enhances the total extinction optical depth and the shape of the\nphotoelectric absorption edges. We focus in particular on the Fe-L edge at 0.7\nkeV, showing that the total extinction template fits well to the high\nresolution spectrum of three X-ray binaries from the Chandra archive: GX 9+9,\nXTE J1817-330, and Cyg X-1.

A\ngeneralised version of this problem consists in implementing an index over the\ntext to support efficient on-line pattern queries. We study this problem in the\ncase where the text is weighted: for every position of the text and every\nletter of the alphabet a probability of occurrence of this letter at this\nposition is given. Sequences of this type, also called position weight\nmatrices, are commonly used to represent imprecise or uncertain data. A\nweighted sequence may represent many different strings, each with probability\nof occurrence equal to the product of probabilities of its letters at\nsubsequent positions. Given a probability threshold $1/z$, we say that a\npattern string $P$ matches a weighted text at position $i$ if the product of\nprobabilities of the letters of $P$ at positions $i,\\ldots,i+|P|-1$ in the text\nis at least $1/z$. In this article, we present an $O(nz)$-time construction of\nan $O(nz)$-sized index that can answer pattern matching queries in a weighted\ntext in optimal time improving upon the state of the art by a factor of $z \\log\nz$. Other applications of this data structure include an $O(nz)$-time\nconstruction of the weighted prefix table and an $O(nz)$-time computation of\nall covers of a weighted sequence, which improve upon the state of the art by\nthe same factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2016 21:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-04"}

To illustrate the impact of LLS opacity, possibly missed by previous\nsimulations, we add either a uniform or spatially-varying hydrogen bound-free\nopacity. This opacity, implemented as the mean free path (mfp) of the ionizing\nphotons, extrapolates the observed, post-reionization redshift dependence into\nthe epoch of reionization. In qualitative agreement with previous studies, we\nfind that at late times the presence of LLSs slows down the ionization fronts,\nand alters the size distribution of H II regions. We quantitatively\ncharacterize the size distribution and morphological evolution of H II regions\nand examine the effects of the LLSs on the redshifted 21-cm signal from the\npatchy reionization. The presence of LLSs extends the ionization history by\n$\\Delta z \\sim 0.8$. The LLS absorbers significantly impede the late-time\ngrowth of the H II regions.

The payoff of a primary depends on the availability of\nunused channels of its competitors. We consider a model were a primary can\nacquire its competitor's channel state information (C-CSI) at a cost. We\nformulate a game between two primaries where each primary decides whether to\nacquire C-CSI or not and then selects its price based on that. We first\ncharacterize the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of this game for a symmetric model where\nthe C-CSI is perfect. We show that the payoff of a primary is independent of\nthe C-CSI acquisition cost. We then generalize our analysis to allow for\nimperfect estimation and cases where the two primaries have different C-CSI\ncosts or different channel availabilities. Our results show interestingly that\nthe payoff of a primary increases when there is estimation error. We also show\nthat surprisingly, the expected payoff of a primary may decrease when the C-CSI\nacquisition cost decreases when primaries have different availabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2016 23:43:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 17:17:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2016 17:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}

This scheme benefits from a novel scheduler design which\ntakes into account the cooperation level of each node, reimburses the extra\nenergy consumptions of group representatives, and maximizes the network\nlifetime. As reusing cellular uplink resources for communications inside the\ngroups degrades the Quality of Service (QoS) of the primary users, analytical\nresults are provided which present a tradeoff between maximum allowable number\nof simultaneously active machine groups in a given cell and QoS of the primary\nusers.

The simulation results show that the\nproposed solutions significantly prolong the network lifetime.

Without addressing this issue conventional methods tend to be biased\ntoward the majority class with poor predictive accuracy for the minority class.\nThese methods further deteriorate on small, imbalanced data that has a large\ndegree of class overlap. In this study, we propose a novel discriminative\nsparse neighbor approximation (DSNA) method to ameliorate the effect of\nclass-imbalance during prediction. Specifically, given a test sample, we first\ntraverse it through a cost-sensitive decision forest to collect a good subset\nof training examples in its local neighborhood. Then we generate from this\nsubset several class-discriminating but overlapping clusters and model each as\nan affine subspace. From these subspaces, the proposed DSNA iteratively seeks\nan optimal approximation of the test sample and outputs an unbiased prediction.\nWe show that our method not only effectively mitigates the imbalance issue, but\nalso allows the prediction to extrapolate to unseen data. The latter capability\nis crucial for achieving accurate prediction on small dataset with limited\nsamples. The proposed imbalanced learning method can be applied to both\nclassification and regression tasks at a wide range of imbalance levels. It\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods that do not possess an\nimbalance handling mechanism, and is found to perform comparably or even better\nthan recent deep learning methods by using hand-crafted features only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2016 06:22:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-04"}

In particular,\nthese costs and factors are unknown for automated GUI-based testing.\n  Objective: This paper addresses this lack of knowledge through analysis of\nthe costs and factors associated with the maintenance of automated GUI-based\ntests in industrial practice.\n  Method: An empirical study at two companies, Siemens and Saab, is reported\nwhere interviews about, and empirical work with, Visual GUI Testing is\nperformed to acquire data about the technique's maintenance costs and\nfeasibility.\n  Results: 13 factors are observed that affect maintenance, e.g. tester\nknowledge/experience and test case complexity. Further, statistical analysis\nshows that developing new test scripts is costlier than maintenance but also\nthat frequent maintenance is less costly than infrequent, big bang maintenance.\nIn addition a cost model, based on previous work, is presented that estimates\nthe time to positive return on investment (ROI) of test automation compared to\nmanual testing.\n  Conclusions: It is concluded that test automation can lower overall software\ndevelopment costs of a project whilst also having positive effects on software\nquality. However, maintenance costs can still be considerable and the less time\na company currently spends on manual testing, the more time is required before\npositive, economic, ROI is reached after automation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2016 08:50:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-04"}

The control of the strength of the coherent coupling between the stable\nlevels allows the engineering of both the dissipation and of the memory\neffects, without modifying neither the system-reservoir interaction, nor\nenvironmental properties.

Firstly, we investigate the\nphase transition in canonical ensemble. We derive the explicit solutions\ncorresponding to the divergence of $C_Q$. The two solutions merge into one when\nthe condition $Q_c=\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{3R_0}}$ is satisfied. The curve of specific\nheat for $Q<Q_c$ has two divergent points and can be divided into three\nregions. Both the large radius region and the small radius region are\nthermodynamically stable with positive specific heat while the medium radius\nregion is unstable with negative specific heat. However, when $Q>Q_c$, the\nspecific heat is always positive, implying the black holes are locally stable\nand no phase transition will take place. Secondly, both the $T-r_+$ curve and\n$T-S$ curve $f(R)$ AdS black holes are investigated and they exhibit Van der\nVaals like behavior as the $P-v$ curve in the former research. Critical\nphysical quantities are obtained and they are consistent with those derived\nfrom the specific heat analysis. We carry out numerical check of Maxwell equal\narea law for the cases $Q=0.2Q_c, 0.4Q_c, 0.6Q_c, 0.8Q_c$. The relative errors\nare amazingly small and can be negligible. So the Maxwell equal area law holds\nfor $T-S$ curve of $f(R)$ black holes. Thirdly, we establish\ngeometrothermodynamics for $f(R)$ AdS black hole to examine the phase\nstructure. It is shown that the Legendre invariant scalar curvature\n$\\mathfrak{R}$ would diverge exactly where the specific heat diverges. To\nsummarize, the above three perspectives are consistent with each other, thus\nproviding a unified picture which deepens the understanding of critical\nphenomena of $f(R)$ AdS black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2016 10:26:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2016 07:42:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

Min- imising this cost function is\npossible using dynamic programming, but their algorithm had a computational\ncost that is cubic in the length of the data set. To speed up computation, Zou\net al. (2014) resorted to a screening procedure which means that the estimated\nsegmentation is no longer guaranteed to be the global minimum of the cost\nfunction. We show that the screening procedure adversely affects the accuracy\nof the changepoint detection method, and show how a faster dynamic programming\nalgorithm, Pruned Exact Linear Time, PELT (Killick et al., 2012), can be used\nto find the optimal segmentation with a computational cost that can be close to\nlinear in the amount of data. PELT requires a penalty to avoid\nunder/over-fitting the model which can have a detrimental effect on the quality\nof the detected changepoints. To overcome this issue we use a relatively new\nmethod, Changepoints Over a Range of PenaltieS (CROPS) (Haynes et al., 2015),\nwhich finds all of the optimal segmentations for multiple penalty values over a\ncontinuous range.

The behaviour when confined\nwithin a wedge is also considered. The system consists of particles interacting\nvia a soft purely repulsive pair potential. Density functional theory (DFT) is\nused to calculate density profiles and thermodynamic quantities. The external\npotential due to the confining walls is modelled via a hard-wall with an\nadditional repulsive Yukawa potential. The surface phase behaviour depends on\nthe range and strength of this repulsion: When the repulsion strength is weak,\nthe wall promotes freezing at the surface of the wall. The thickness of this\nfrozen layer grows logarithmically as the bulk liquid-solid phase coexistence\nis approached. Our mean-field DFT predicts that this crystalline layer at the\nwall must be nucleated (i.e. there is a free energy barrier) and its formation\nis necessarily a first-order transition, referred to as `prefreezing', by\nanalogy with the prewetting transition. However, in contrast to the latter,\nprefreezing cannot terminate in a critical point, since the phase transition\ninvolves a change in symmetry. If the wall-fluid interaction is sufficiently\nlong ranged and the repulsion is strong enough, surface melting can instead\noccur. Then the interface between the wall and the bulk crystalline solid\nbecomes wet by the liquid phase as the chemical potential is decreased towards\nthe value at liquid-solid coexistence.

The main goal\nof this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of neural networks for\nextracting the CMB signal from the Planck polarization data with high\nprecision. Both auto-correlation and cross-correlation power spectra within a\nmask covering about 63 percent of the sky have been used together with a 'high\npass filter' in order to minimize the influence of the remaining systematic\nerrors in the Planck Q and U maps. Using the Planck 2015 released polarization\nmaps, a BB power spectrum have been extracted by \\textit{Multilayer Perceptron}\nneural networks.

The idea is to redefine the system and\nenvironment such that the effective, redefined system is again coupled weakly\nto Markovian residual baths and thus, allows to derive a consistent\nthermodynamic framework for this new system-environment partition. To achieve\nthis goal we make use of the reaction coordinate mapping, which is a general\nmethod in the sense that it can be applied to an arbitrary (quantum or\nclassical and even time-dependent) system coupled linearly to an arbitrary\nnumber of harmonic oscillator reservoirs.

Unfortunately, different\nbottlenecks during execution and heterogeneous application requirements create\nimbalances in utilization of resources in the cores. For example, when a GPU is\nbottlenecked by the available off-chip memory bandwidth, its computational\nresources are often overwhelmingly idle, waiting for data from memory to\narrive.\n  This work describes the Core-Assisted Bottleneck Acceleration (CABA)\nframework that employs idle on-chip resources to alleviate different\nbottlenecks in GPU execution. CABA provides flexible mechanisms to\nautomatically generate \"assist warps\" that execute on GPU cores to perform\nspecific tasks that can improve GPU performance and efficiency.\n  CABA enables the use of idle computational units and pipelines to alleviate\nthe memory bandwidth bottleneck, e.g., by using assist warps to perform data\ncompression to transfer less data from memory. Conversely, the same framework\ncan be employed to handle cases where the GPU is bottlenecked by the available\ncomputational units, in which case the memory pipelines are idle and can be\nused by CABA to speed up computation, e.g., by performing memoization using\nassist warps.\n  We provide a comprehensive design and evaluation of CABA to perform effective\nand flexible data compression in the GPU memory hierarchy to alleviate the\nmemory bandwidth bottleneck. Our extensive evaluations show that CABA, when\nused to implement data compression, provides an average performance improvement\nof 41.7% (as high as 2.6X) across a variety of memory-bandwidth-sensitive GPGPU\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2016 15:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-04"}

If an estimation of the gas concentration at the source is\navailable, source proximity can be estimated from the time-averaged gas\nconcentration at the sensing site. However, in turbulent environments, where\nfast concentration fluctuations dominate, comparably long measurements are\nrequired to obtain a reliable estimate. A lesser known feature that can be\nexploited for distance estimation in a turbulent environment lies in the\nrelationship between source proximity and the temporal variance of the local\ngas concentration - the farther the source, the more intermittent are gas\nencounters. However, exploiting this feature requires measurement of changes in\ngas concentration on a comparably fast time scale, that have up to now only\nbeen achieved using photo-ionisation detectors.

In the WKB\napproximation, the characteristic determinant describes a sharp droplet of\neigenvalues that deforms and expands at large stochastic times. Beyond the WKB\nlimit, the edges of the droplet are fuzzy and described by universal edge\nfunctions. At the chiral point, the characteristic determinant in the\nmicroscopic limit is universal.

It\nhas three simple conclusions. The first is that spreadsheet errors are rare on\na per-cell basis, but in large programs, at least one incorrect bottom-line\nvalue is very likely to be present. The second is that errors are extremely\ndifficult to detect and correct. The third is that spreadsheet developers and\ncorporations are highly overconfident in the accuracy of their spreadsheets.\nThe disconnect between the first two conclusions and the third appears to be\ndue to the way human cognition works. Most importantly, we are aware of very\nfew of the errors we make. In addition, while we are proudly aware of errors\nthat we fix, we have no idea of how many remain, but like Little Jack Horner we\nare impressed with our ability to ferret out errors. This paper reviews human\ncognition processes and shows first that humans cannot be error free no matter\nhow hard they try, and second that our intuition about errors and how we can\nreduce them is based on appallingly bad knowledge. This paper argues that we\nshould reject any prescription for reducing errors that has not been rigorously\nproven safe and effective. This paper also argues that our biggest need, based\non empirical data, is to do massively more testing than we do now. It suggests\nthat the code inspection methodology developed in software development is\nlikely to apply very well to spreadsheet inspection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2016 22:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-22"}

Here, we are interested in developing a\nmulti-level modeling framework for the use of robots in studies about animal\ncollective decision-making. In this context, using robots can be useful for\nvalidating models in silico, inducing calibrated repetitive stimuli to trigger\nanimal responses or modulating and controlling animal collective behaviour.\nHowever, designing appropriate biomimetic robotic behaviour faces a major\nchallenge: how to go from the collective decision dynamics observed with\nanimals to an actual algorithmic implementation in robots. In previous work,\nthis was mainly done by hand, often by taking inspiration from human-designed\nmodels. Typically, models of behaviour are either macroscopic, differential\nequations of the population dynamics, or microscopic,explicit spatio-temporal\nstate of each individual. Only microscopic models can easily be implemented as\nrobot controllers. Here, we address the problem of automating the design of\nlower level description models that can be implemented in robots and exhibit\nthe same collective dynamics as a given higher level model. We apply\nevolutionary algorithms to simultaneously optimise the parameters of models\naccounting for different levels of description. This methodology is applied to\nan experimentally validated shelter-selection problem solved by gregarious\ninsects and robots. We successfully design and calibrate automatically both a\nmicroscopic and a hybrid model exhibiting the same dynamics as a macroscopic\none. Our framework can be used for multi-level modeling of collective behaviour\nin animal or robot populations and bio-hybrid systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2016 17:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}
