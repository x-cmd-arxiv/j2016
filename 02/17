We\ndeveloped an improved clean setup that uses the collision of two plasma slabs\nwith different density and velocity, leading to the development of two\ndistinctive shocks and a contact discontinuity. The shock formation is mediated\nby Weibel-type filamentation instabilities that generate magnetic turbulence.\nCyclic reformation is observed in both shocks with similar period, for which we\nnote global variations on account of shock rippling and local variations\narising from turbulent current filaments. The shock rippling occurs on spatial\nand temporal scales given by gyro-motions of shock-reflected ions. The drift\nmotion of electrons and ions is not a gradient drift, but commensurates with E\nx B drift. We observe a stable suprathermal tail in the ion spectra, but no\nelectron acceleration because the amplitude of Buneman modes in the shock foot\nis insufficient for trapping relativistic electrons. We see no evidence of\nturbulent reconnection. A comparison with other 2D simulation results suggests\nthat the plasma beta and the ion-to-electron mass ratio are not decisive for\nefficient electron acceleration, but pre-acceleration efficacy might be reduced\nwith respect to the 2D results once three-dimensional effects are fully\naccounted for. Other microphysical factors may also be at play to limit the\namplitude of Buneman waves or prevent return of electrons to the foot region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 16:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The disturbance\ncovariance matrix should be inferred from training sample observations in\npractice. Large number of homogeneous training samples are generally not\navailable because of difficulty of guaranteeing target free disturbance\nobservation, practical limitations imposed by the spatio-temporal\nnonstationarity, and system considerations. In this dissertation, we look to\naddress the aforementioned challenges by exploiting physically inspired\nconstraints into ML estimation. While adding constraints is beneficial to\nachieve satisfactory performance in the practical regime of limited training,\nit leads to a challenging problem. We focus on breaking this classical\ntrade-off between computational tractability and desirable performance\nmeasures, particularly in training starved regimes. In particular, we exploit\nboth the structure of the disturbance covariance and importantly the knowledge\nof the clutter rank to yield a new rank constrained maximum likelihood (RCML)\nestimator. In addition, we derive a new covariance estimator for STAP that\njointly considers a Toeplitz structure and a rank constraint on the clutter\ncomponent.\n  Finally, we address the problem of working with inexact physical radar\nparameters under a practical radar environment. We propose a robust covariance\nestimation method via an expected likelihood (EL) approach. We analyze\ncovariance estimation algorithms under three different cases of imperfect\nconstraints: 1) only rank constraint, 2) both rank and noise power constraint,\nand 3) condition number constraint. For each case, we formulate estimation of\nthe constraint as an optimization problem with the EL criterion and formally\nderive and prove a significant analytical result such as uniqueness of the\nsolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 16:09:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-22"}

At low doping, Li$_x$ZrNCl behaves as\na two-dimensional two-valley electron gas, with parabolic bands. In such a\nsystem, $\\chi_s$ increases with decreasing doping because of the\nelectron-electron interaction. We show that DFT with local functionals\n(LDA/GGA) is not capable of reproducing this behavior. The use of exact\nexchange in Hartree-Fock (HF) or in DFT hybrid functionals enhances $\\chi_s$.\nHF, B3LYP, and PBE0 approaches overestimate $\\chi_s$, whereas the\nrange-separated HSE06 functional leads to results similar to those obtained in\nthe random phase approximation (RPA) applied to a two-valley two-spin electron\ngas.

The intervalley phonons induce an imbalance in the valley occupation\nthat can be viewed as the effect of a pseudomagnetic field. Thus, similarly to\nwhat happens for $\\chi_s$, the electron-phonon coupling of intervalley phonons\nis enhanced by the electron-electron interaction.

While the inclusive jets are\nslightly too strong suppressed within BAMPS in comparison with data, both\nelastic+radiative and only elastic interactions lead to a realistic b-tagged\njet suppression. To further investigate light and heavy flavor energy loss we\npredict the R dependence of inclusive and b-tagged jet suppression.\nFurthermore, we propose the medium modification of b-tagged jet shapes as an\nobservable for discriminating between different heavy quark energy loss\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 16:42:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 08:33:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 14:22:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-21"}

The mass-loss mechanism of cool massive evolved stars is poorly\nunderstood. The proximity of Betelgeuse makes it an appealing target to study\nits atmosphere, map the shape of its envelope, and follow the structure of its\nwind from the photosphere out to the interstellar medium. Aims. A link is\nsuspected between the powerful convective motions in Betelgeuse and its mass\nloss. We aim to constrain the spatial structure and temporal evolution of the\nconvective pattern on the photosphere and to search for evidence of this link.\nMethods. We report new interferometric observations in the infrared H band\nusing the VLTI/PIONIER instrument. We monitored the photosphere of Betelgeuse\nbetween 2012 January and 2014 November to look for evolutions that may trigger\nthe outflow. Results. Our interferometric observations at low spatial\nfrequencies are compatible with the presence of a hot spot on the photosphere\nthat has a characteristic width of one stellar radius. It appears to be\nsuperposed on the smaller scale convective pattern. In the higher spatial\nfrequency domain, we observe a significant difference between the observations\nand the predictions of 3D hydrodynamical simulations. Conclusions. We bring new\nevidence for the presence of a convective pattern in the photosphere of red\nsupergiants. The inferred hot spot is probably the top of a giant convection\ncell although an asymmetric extension of the star cannot be excluded by these\ninterferometric observations alone. The properties of the observed surface\nfeatures show a stronger contrast and inhomogeneity as predicted by 3D\nradiative hydrodynamical simulations.

We show that these expansions\nwork well even when we approach the possible singularity of ${}_2F_1(a,b;c;z)$,\n$|z|=1$, where the current expansions typically fail. Using our results we\ndetermine asymptotically the partition function of a lattice gas in a field of\ntraps in the different possible physical limits of few/many particles and\nfew/many traps, illustrating the applicability of the derived asymptotic\nexpansions of the HGF in physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 19:32:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 11:43:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 11:09:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2017 10:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-04"}

A periodically changing allocation of the\nprotein budget between reactions or pathways may increase the overall metabolic\nefficiency. To study this hypothesis, I quantify the possible benefits of\nsmall-amplitude enzyme rhythms in kinetic models. Starting from an\nenzyme-optimised steady state, I score the effects of possible enzyme rhythms\non a metabolic objective and optimise their amplitudes and phase shifts.\nAssuming small-amplitude rhythms around an optimal reference state, optimal\nphases and amplitudes can be computed by solving a quadratic optimality\nproblem. In models without amplitude constraints, general periodic enzyme\nprofiles can be obtained by Fourier synthesis. The theory of optimal enzyme\nrhythms combines the dynamics and economics of metabolic systems and explains\nhow optimal small-amplitude enzyme profiles are shaped by network structure,\nkinetics, external rhythms, and the metabolic objective. The formulae show how\norchestrated enzyme rhythms can exploit synergy effects to improve metabolic\nperformance and that optimal enzyme profiles are not simply adapted to existing\nmetabolic rhythms, but that they actively shape these rhythms to improve their\nown (and other enzymes') efficiency. The resulting optimal enzyme profiles\n\"portray\" the enzymes' dynamic effects in the network: for example, enzymes\nthat act synergistically may be coexpressed, periodically and with some optimal\nphase shifts. The theory yields optimality conditions for enzyme rhythms in\nmetabolic cycles, with static enzyme adaptation as a special case, and predicts\nhow cells should combine transcriptional and posttranslational regulation to\nrealise enzyme rhythms at different frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 20:27:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2022 07:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-05"}

Previous global climate model\n(GCM) studies have shown that, for slowly-rotating planets, strong convection\nat the substellar point can create optically thick water clouds, increasing the\nplanetary albedo, and thus stabilizing the climate against a thermal runaway.\nHowever these studies did not use self-consistent orbital/rotational periods\nfor synchronously rotating planets placed at different distances from the host\nstar. Here we provide new estimates of the inner edge of the habitable zone for\nsynchronously rotating terrestrial planets around late-K and M-dwarf stars\nusing a 3-D Earth-analog GCM with self-consistent relationships between stellar\nmetallicity, stellar effective temperature, and the planetary\norbital/rotational period. We find that both atmospheric dynamics and the\nefficacy of the substellar cloud deck are sensitive to the precise rotation\nrate of the planet. Around mid-to-late M-dwarf stars with low metallicity,\nplanetary rotation rates at the inner edge of the HZ become faster, and the\ninner edge of the habitable zone is farther away from the host stars than in\nprevious GCM studies. For an Earth-sized planet, the dynamical regime of the\nsubstellar clouds begins to transition as the rotation rate approaches ~10\ndays. These faster rotation rates produce stronger zonal winds that encircle\nthe planet and smear the substellar clouds around it, lowering the planetary\nalbedo, and causing the onset of the water-vapor greenhouse climatic\ninstability to occur at up to ~25% lower incident stellar fluxes than found in\nprevious GCM studies. For mid-to-late M-dwarf stars with high metallicity and\nfor mid-K to early-M stars, we agree with previous studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 20:40:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

Remarkably, engineered dissipation enables the\npreparation of quantum states of atoms, ions or superconducting qubits as well\nas their stabilization. This is achieved by a suitably engineered coupling to a\ndissipative cold reservoir formed by electromagnetic modes. Similarly, in the\nfield of cavity electro- and optomechanics, the control over mechanical\noscillators utilizes the inherently cold, dissipative nature of the\nelectromagnetic degree of freedom. Breaking from this paradigm, recent\ntheoretical work has considered the opposite regime in which the dissipation of\nthe mechanical oscillator dominates and provides a cold, dissipative reservoir\nto an electromagnetic mode. Here we realize this reversed dissipation regime in\na microwave cavity optomechanical system and realize a quasi-instantaneous,\ncold reservoir for microwave light. Coupling to this reservoir enables to\nmanipulate the susceptibility of the microwave cavity, corresponding to\ndynamical backaction control of the microwave field. Additionally, we observe\nthe onset of parametric instability, i.e. the stimulated emission of microwaves\n(masing). Equally important, the reservoir can function as a useful quantum\nresource. We evidence this by employing the engineered cold reservoir to\nimplement a large gain (above 40 dB) phase preserving microwave amplifier that\noperates 0.87 quanta above the limit of added noise imposed by quantum\nmechanics. Such a dissipative cold reservoir forms the basis of microwave\nentanglement schemes, the study of dissipative quantum phase transitions,\namplifiers with unlimited gain-bandwidth product and non-reciprocal devices,\nthereby extending the available toolbox of quantum-limited microwave\nmanipulation techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 20:49:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 17:08:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 11:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-07"}

The complex structure of\nregions of massive star formation, and the involved short timescales provide a\nchallenge for our understanding of their birth and early evolution. As one of\nthe most massive and luminous star-forming region in our Galaxy, W49 is the\nideal place to study the formation of the most massive stars. By classifying\nthe massive young stars deeply embedded into the molecular cloud of W49, we aim\nto investigate and trace the star formation history of this region. We analyse\nnear-infrared $K$-band spectroscopic observations of W49 from LBT/LUCI combined\nwith $JHK$ images obtained with NTT/SOFI and LBT/LUCI. Based on $JHK$-band\nphotometry and K-band spectroscopy the massive stars are placed in a\nHertzsprung Russell diagram. By comparison with evolutionary models, their age\nand hence the star formation history of W49 can be investigated. Fourteen O\ntype stars as well as two young stellar objects (YSOs) are identified by our\nspectroscopic survey. Eleven O-stars are main sequence stars with subtypes\nranging from O3 to O9.5, with masses ranging from $\\sim 20$ $M_{\\odot}$ to\n$\\sim 120$ $M_{\\odot}$. Three of the O-stars show strong wind features, and are\nconsidered to be Of-type supergiants with masses beyond 100 $M_{\\odot}$ .

The age of the cluster is\nestimated as $\\sim1.5$ Myr, with star formation still ongoing in different\nparts of the region. The ionising photons from the central massive stars have\nnot yet cleared the molecular cocoon surrounding the cluster. W49 is comparable\nto extragalactic star-forming regions and provides us with an unique\npossibility to study a starburst in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

A fundamental facet of the theory is that nearly\nall the mode energy leaking into the core is trapped by the magnetic greenhouse\neffect. This results in clear predictions for how the mode visibility changes\nas a star evolves up the red giant branch, and how that depends on stellar\nmass, spherical degree, and mode lifetime.

We explicitly show how to perform\nfaster gate operations by going beyond the universally-used rotating wave\napproximation (RWA) regime, while using only two sinusoidal pulses. No\ncomplicated pulse shaping or optimal control sequences are required. We first\nshow for specific published experiments how much error is currently incurred by\nimplementing pulses designed using standard RWA. We then show that an even\nmodest increase in gate speed would cause problems in using RWA for gate design\nin the singlet-triplet (ST) and resonant-exchange (RX) qubits. We discuss the\nextent to which analytically keeping higher orders in the perturbation theory\nwould address the problem. More strikingly, we give a new prescription for\ngating with strong coupling far beyond the RWA regime. We perform numerical\ncalculations for the phases and the durations of two consecutive pulses to\nrealize the key Hadamard and $\\frac{\\pi}{8}$ gates with coupling strengths up\nto several times the qubit splitting.

In this paper we study an optical/IR transient\ndiscovered in the nearby galaxy NGC4490, which appeared similar to these merger\nevents (unobscured progenitor, irregular multi-peaked light curve, increasingly\nred color, similar optical spectrum, IR excess at late times), but which had a\nhigher peak luminosity and longer duration in outburst. NGC4490-OT has less in\ncommon with the class of SN~2008S-like transients. A progenitor detected in\npre-eruption HST images, combined with upper limits in the IR, requires a\nluminous and blue progenitor that has faded in late-time HST images. The same\nsource was detected by Spitzer and ground-based data as a luminous IR\ntransient, indicating a transition to a self-obscured state qualitatively\nsimilar to the evolution seen in other stellar mergers and in LBVs. The\npost-outburst dust-obscured source is too luminous and too warm at late times\nto be explained with an IR echo, suggesting that the object survived the event.\nThe luminosity of the enshrouded IR source is similar to that of the\nprogenitor. Compared to proposed merger events, the more massive progenitor of\nNGC4490-OT seems to extend a correlation between stellar mass and peak\nluminosity, and may suggest that both of these correlate with duration. We show\nthat spectra of NGC4490-OT and V838 Mon also resemble light-echo spectra of eta\nCar, prompting us to speculate that eta Car may be an extreme extension of this\nphenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 21:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

Their interaction with the surrounding gas results in\naccretion and exchange of angular momentum via tidal torques, facilitating\nbinary inspiral. Here we explore the non-trivial coupling between these two\nprocesses and analyze how the global properties of externally supplied\ncircumbinary disks depend on the binary accretion rate. By formulating our\nresults in terms of the angular momentum flux driven by internal stresses, we\ncome up with a very simple classification of the possible global disk\nstructures, which differ from the standard constant $\\dot M$ accretion disk\nsolution. Suppression of accretion by the binary tides, leading to a\nsignificant mass accumulation in the inner disk, accelerates binary inspiral.\nWe show that once the disk region strongly perturbed by the viscously\ntransmitted tidal torque exceeds the binary semi-major axis, the binary can\nmerge in less than its mass-doubling time due to accretion. Thus, unlike the\ninspirals driven by stellar scattering, the gas-assisted merger can occur even\nif the binary is embedded in a relatively low mass disk (lower than its own\nmass). This is important for resolving the \"last parsec\" problem for SMBH\nbinaries and understanding powerful gravitational wave sources in the Universe.\nWe argue that the enhancement of accretion by the binary found in some recent\nsimulations cannot persist for a long time and should not affect the long-term\norbital inspiral. We also review the existing simulations of the SMBH\nbinary-disk coupling and propose a numerical setup, which is particularly well\nsuited for verifying our theoretical predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 21:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

The flux reached a level more than 10 times higher than any\npreviously recorded flaring state of the source. We present the description of\nthe characteristics of the flare presenting the light curve and the spectral\nparameters of the night-wise spectra and the average spectrum of the whole\nperiod. From these data we aim at detecting the imprint of the Extragalactic\nBackground Light (EBL) in the VHE spectrum of the source, in order to constrain\nits intensity in the optical band. For this we implement the method developed\nby the H.E.S.S. collaboration in which the intrinsic energy spectrum of the\nsource is modeled with a simple function, and the EBL-induced optical depth is\ncalculated using a template EBL model. The likelihood of the observed spectrum\nis then maximized, including a normalization factor for the EBL opacity among\nthe free parameters. From the data collected differential energy spectra was\nproduced for all nights of the observed period. Evaluating the changes in the\nfit parameters we conclude that the spectral shape for most of the nights were\ncompatible, regardless of the flux level, which enabled us to produce an\naverage spectrum from which the EBL imprint could be constrained. The\nlikelihood ratio test shows that the model with an EBL density\n1.07(-0.20,+0.24)_{stat+sys}, relative to the one in the tested EBL template\n(Dominguez et al.2011), is preferred at the 4.6 sigma level to the no-EBL\nhypothesis, with the assumption that the intrinsic source spectrum can be\nmodeled as a log-parabola.

Recently, through the use of fluorescently-tagged\nlipids, it has become possible to make direct, quantitative comparisons between\nexperiments and models. These comparisons have revealed two important\ndiscrepancies between simulations and experiments: the spatial distribution of\nthe surfactant layer, and the timescale over which spreading occurs. In this\npaper, we present numerical simulations that demonstrate the impact of the\nparticular choice of the equation of state (EoS) relating the surfactant\nconcentration to the surface tension. Previous choices of the model EoS have\nbeen an ad-hoc decreasing function. Here, we instead propose an\nempirically-motivated equation of state; this provides a route to resolving\nsome discrepancies and raises new issues to be pursued in future experiments.\nIn addition, we test the influence of the choice of initial conditions and\nvalues for the non-dimensional groups. We demonstrate that the choice of EoS\nimproves the agreement in surfactant distribution morphology between\nsimulations and experiments, and impacts the dynamics of the simulations. The\nrelevant feature of the EoS, the gradient, has distinct regions for empirically\nmotivated choices, which suggests that future work will need to consider more\nthan one timescale. We observe that the non-dimensional number controlling the\nrelative importance of gravitational vs. capillary forces has a larger impact\non the dynamics than the other non-dimensional groups. Finally, we observe that\nthe experimental approach of using a ring to contain the surfactant could\naffect the surfactant and fluid dynamics if it disrupts the intended initial\nsurfactant distribution. However, the meniscus itself does not significantly\naffect the dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 01:29:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-18"}

Although the primarily discrete origin of the emission is now\nwell established, the responsible populations of these sources remain\nuncertain, especially at relatively low fluxes. To provide insights into this\nissue, we systematically characterize the Fe emission line properties of the\ncandidate types of the sources in the solar neighborhood and compare them with\nthose measured for the GRXE. Our source sample includes 6 symbiotic stars\n(SSs), 16 intermediate polars (IPs), 3 polars, 16 quiescent dwarf novae (DNe)\nand 4 active binaries (ABs).

Another fundamental and generic feature of\nturbulence, although sometimes overlooked, is the inhomogeneous dissipation of\nenergy in space and in time. This is a consequence of intermittency, the\nscale-dependent inhomogeneity of dynamics caused by fluctuations in the\nturbulent cascade. Intermittency causes turbulent plasmas to self-organize into\ncoherent dissipative structures, which may govern heating, diffusion, particle\nacceleration, and radiation emissions. In this paper, we present recent\nprogress on understanding intermittency in incompressible magnetohydrodynamic\nturbulence with a strong guide field.

In 1980\na theoretical conjecture by A.J. Leggett suggested a possible new and quite\ndifferent behavior for Josephson junctions at very low temperatures. A number\nof experiments seemed to confirm this prediction and soon it was taken as a\ngiven that junctions at tens of millikelvins should be regarded as macroscopic\nquantum entities. As such, they would possess discrete levels in their\neffective potential wells, and would escape from those wells (with the\nappearance of a finite junction voltage) via a macroscopic quantum tunneling\nprocess. A zeal to pursue this new physics led to a virtual abandonment of the\nRCSJ model in this low temperature regime. In this paper we consider a\nselection of essentially prototypical experiments that were carried out with\nthe intention of confirming aspects of anticipated macroscopic quantum behavior\nin Josephson junctions. We address two questions: (1) How successful is the\nnon-quantum theory (RCSJ model) in replicating those experiments? (2) How\nstrong is the evidence that data from these same experiments does indeed\nreflect macroscopic quantum behavior?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 06:36:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-18"}

We\ninvestigated the gas phase formation and the recondensation of the complex\norganic molecules (COMs) di-methyl ether and methyl formate, induced by sudden\nice evaporation processes occurring during luminosity outbursts of different\namplitudes in protostellar envelopes. For this purpose, we updated a gas phase\nchemical network forming complex organic molecules in which ammonia plays a key\nrole. The model calculations presented here demonstrate that ion-molecule\nreactions alone could account for the observed presence of di-methyl ether and\nmethyl formate in a large fraction of protostellar cores, without recourse to\ngrain-surface chemistry, although they depend on uncertain ice abundances and\ngas phase reaction branching ratios. In spite of the short outburst timescales\nof about one hundred years, abundance ratios of the considered species with\nrespect to methanol higher than 10 % are predicted during outbursts due to\ntheir low binding energies relative to water and methanol that delay their\nrecondensation during the cooling. Although the current luminosity of most\nembedded protostars would be too low to produce these complex species in hot\ncore regions that can be observable with current sub-millimetric\ninterferometers, previous luminosity outburst events would induce a formation\nof COMs in extended regions of protostellar envelopes with sizes increasing by\nup to one order of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 10:40:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

This Rydberg energetic region is where the transition from\nclassical to quantum correspondence takes place. We first realize that these\nentropies are closely connected to the entropic moments of the\nquantum-mechanical probability $\\rho_n(\\vec{r})$ density of the Rydberg\nwavefunctions $\\Psi_{n,l,\\{\\mu\\}}(\\vec{r})$; so, to the $\\mathcal{L}_{p}$-norms\nof the associated Laguerre polynomials. Then, we determine the asymptotics\n$n\\to\\infty$ of these norms by use of modern techniques of approximation theory\nbased on the strong Laguerre asymptotics. Finally, we determine the dominant\nterm of the R\\'enyi entropies of the Rydberg states explicitly in terms of the\nhyperquantum numbers ($n,l$), the parameter order $p$ and the universe\ndimensionality $D$ for all possible cases $D\\ge 1$.

The property of TMD\nflakes is a function of its thickness, or layer number (N). How to determine N\nof ultrathin TMDs materials is of primary importance for fundamental study and\npractical applications. Raman mode intensity from substrates has been used to\nidentify N of intrinsic and defective multilayer graphenes up to N=100.\nHowever, such analysis is not applicable for ultrathin TMD flakes due to the\nlack of a unified complex refractive index ($\\tilde{n}$) from monolayer to bulk\nTMDs. Here, we discuss the N identification of TMD flakes on the SiO$_2$/Si\nsubstrate by the intensity ratio between the Si peak from 100-nm (or 89-nm)\nSiO$_2$/Si substrates underneath TMD flakes and that from bare SiO$_2$/Si\nsubstrates. We assume the real part of $\\tilde{n}$ of TMD flakes as that of\nmonolayer TMD and treat the imaginary part of $\\tilde{n}$ as a fitting\nparameter to fit the experimental intensity ratio. An empirical $\\tilde{n}$,\nnamely, $\\tilde{n}_{eff}$, of ultrathin MoS$_{2}$, WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$\nflakes from monolayer to multilayer is obtained for typical laser excitations\n(2.54 eV, 2.34 eV, or 2.09 eV).

This technique by measuring Raman intensity from the\nsubstrate can be extended to identify N of ultrathin 2D flakes with N-dependent\n$\\tilde{n}$ .

The time-dependent Hartree-Fock\n(TDHF) theory, incorporating the couplings at the mean-field level, as well as\nthe coupled-channels (CC) method are standard approaches to describe low energy\nnuclear reactions.\n  Purpose: To investigate the effect of couplings to inelastic and transfer\nchannels on the fusion cross sections for the reactions $^{40}$Ca+$^{58}$Ni and\n$^{40}$Ca+$^{64}$Ni.\n  Methods: Fusion cross sections around and below the Coulomb barrier have been\nobtained from coupled-channels (CC) calculations, using the bare\nnucleus-nucleus potential calculated with the frozen Hartree-Fock method and\ncoupling parameters taken from known nuclear structure data. The fusion\nthresholds and neutron transfer probabilities have been calculated with the\nTDHF method.\n  Results: For $^{40}$Ca+$^{58}$Ni, the TDHF fusion threshold is in agreement\nwith the most probable barrier obtained in the CC calculations including the\ncouplings to the low-lying octupole $3_1^{-}$ state for $^{40}$Ca and to the\nlow-lying quadrupole $2_1^{+}$ state for $^{58}$Ni. This indicates that the\noctupole and quadrupole states are the dominant excitations while neutron\ntransfer is shown to be weak. For $^{40}$Ca+$^{64}$Ni, the TDHF barrier is\nlower than predicted by the CC calculations including the same inelastic\ncouplings as those for $^{40}$Ca+$^{58}$Ni. TDHF calculations show large\nneutron transfer probabilities in $^{40}$Ca+$^{64}$Ni which could result in a\nlowering of the fusion threshold.\n  Conclusions: Inelastic channels play an important role in $^{40}$Ca+$^{58}$Ni\nand $^{40}$Ca+$^{64}$Ni reactions. The role of neutron transfer channels has\nbeen highlighted in $^{40}$Ca+$^{64}$Ni.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 12:45:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

Besides the problem of moving massive data\nsets over the network, another critical point is that a great part of\nastronomical data is stored in private archives that are not fully accessible\non line. So, in order to evaluate photo-z it is needed a desktop application\nthat can be downloaded and used by everyone locally, i.e. on his own personal\ncomputer or more in general within the local intranet hosted by a data center.\nThe name chosen for the application is PhotoRApToR, i.e. Photometric Research\nApplication To Redshift (Cavuoti et al. 2015, 2014; Brescia 2014b). It embeds a\nmachine learning algorithm and special tools dedicated to preand\npost-processing data. The ML model is the MLPQNA (Multi Layer Perceptron\ntrained by the Quasi Newton Algorithm), which has been revealed particularly\npowerful for the photo-z calculation on the base of a spectroscopic sample\n(Cavuoti et al. 2012; Brescia et al. 2013, 2014a; Biviano et al. 2013).\n  The PhotoRApToR program package is available, for different platforms, at the\nofficial website (http://dame.dsf.unina.it/dame_photoz.html#photoraptor).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 13:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-18"}

The lower\nbounds are established through logical undefinability results. We show that the\nlinear programming relaxation of the problem, as well as the SDP corresponding\nto any fixed level of the Lasserre hierarchy is interpretable in a VCSP\ninstance by means of formulas of fixed-point logic with counting. We also show\nthat the solution of an SDP can be expressed in this logic. Together, these\nresults give a way of translating lower bounds on the number of variables\nrequired in counting logic to express a VCSP into lower bounds on the number of\nlevels required in the Lasserre hierarchy to eliminate the integrality gap. As\na special case, we obtain the same dichotomy for the class of MAXCSP problems,\ngeneralizing some earlier Lasserre lower bound results of Schoenebeck.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 13:45:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2016 17:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}

The Leonov method is based on the direct Lyapunov method with\nspecial Lyapunov-like functions. The advantage of this method is that it allows\none to estimate the Lyapunov dimension of invariant set without local- ization\nof the set in the phase space and in many cases get effectively exact Lyapunov\ndimension formula. In this survey the invariance of Lyapunov dimension with\nrespect to diffeomorphisms and its connection with the Leonov method are\ndiscussed. An analog of Leonov method for discrete time dynamical systems is\nsuggested. In a simple but rigorous way, here it is presented the connection\nbetween the Leonov method and the key related works in the area: by Kaplan and\nYorke (the concept of Lyapunov dimension, 1979), Douady and Oesterle (upper\nbounds of Hausdorff dimension via the Lyapunov dimension of maps, 1980),\nConstantin, Eden, Foias, and Temam (upper bounds of Hausdorff dimension via the\nLyapunov exponents and dimension of dynamical systems, 1985-90), and the\nnumerical calculation of the Lyapunov exponents and dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 13:47:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2016 09:48:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2016 16:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-29"}

The formation of the different populations requires episodes of\nstar formation in AGB gas diluted with different amounts of pristine gas. In\nthe nitrogen-rich, helium-normal population identified in NGC 2808 by the UV\nLegacy Survey of GCs, the nitrogen increase is due to the third dredge up in\nthe smallest mass AGB ejecta involved in the star formation of this population.\nThe possibly-iron-rich small population in NGC 2808 may be a result of\ncontamination by a single type Ia supernova.

In this thesis, flux vacua are studied by\nmaking use of two mathematical frameworks: SU(n)-structures and generalised\ncomplex geometry. Manifolds with SU(n)-structure are generalisations of\nCalabi-Yau manifolds. Generalised complex geometry is a geometrical framework\nthat simultaneously generalises complex and symplectic geometry. Classes of\nflux vacua of type II supergravity and M-theory are given on manifolds with\nSU(4)-structure. The N= (1,1) type IIA vacua uplift to N=1 M-theory vacua, with\nfour-flux that need not be (2,2) and primitive. Explicit vacua are given on\nStenzel space, a non-compact Calabi-Yau. These are then generalised by\nconstructing families of non-CY SU(4)-structures to find vacua on\nnon-symplectic SU(4)-deformed Stenzel spaces. It is shown that the\nsupersymmetry conditions for N = (2,0) type IIB can be rephrased in the\nlanguage of generalised complex geometry, partially in terms of integrability\nconditions of generalised almost complex structures. This rephrasing for d=2\ngoes beyond the calibration equations, in contrast to d=4,6 where the\ncalibration equations are equivalent to supersymmetry. Finally, Euclidean type\nII theory is examined on SU(5)-structure manifolds, where generalised equations\nare found which are necessary but not sufficient to satisfy the supersymmetry\nequations. Explicit classes of solutions are provided here as well.

The proposed methodology frames high-dimensional,\nnonlinear dynamics into low-dimensional, probabilistic, linear dynamics which\nconsiderably simplifies the optimal control problem while preserving nonlinear\nactuation mechanisms. The data-driven approach builds upon a state space\ndiscretization using a clustering algorithm which groups kinematically similar\nflow states into a low number of clusters. The temporal evolution of the\nprobability distribution on this set of clusters is then described by a Markov\nmodel. The Markov model can be used as predictor for the ergodic probability\ndistribution for a particular control law. This probability distribution\napproximates the long-term behavior of the original system on which basis the\noptimal control law is determined.

After showing that the DR hierarchy satisfies tau-symmetry we define\nits partition function as the (logarithm of the) tau-function of the string\nsolution and show that it satisfies various properties (string, dilaton and\ndivisor equations plus some important degree constraints). We then formulate a\nstronger version of the conjecture from [Bur15]: for any semisimple\ncohomological field theory, the Dubrovin-Zhang and double ramification\nhierarchies are related by a normal (i.e. preserving the tau-structure\n[DLYZ14]) Miura transformation which we completely identify in terms of the\npartition function of the CohFT.

The latter has however some\ndrawbacks. First and foremost it is unfeasible to determine the whole set of\nBell inequalities already for a few measurements and thus unfeasible to find\nthe experimental setup maximizing their violation. Second, the Bell violation\nsuffers from an ambiguity stemming from the choice of the normalization of the\nBell coefficients. An alternative measure of nonlocality with a direct\ninformation-theoretic interpretation is the minimal amount of classical\ncommunication required for simulating nonlocal correlations. In the case of\nmany instances simulated in parallel, the minimal communication cost per\ninstance is called nonlocal capacity, and its computation can be reduced to a\nconvex-optimization problem. This quantity can be computed for a higher number\nof measurements and turns out to be useful for finding the optimal experimental\nsetup. Focusing on the bipartite case, in this paper, we present a simple\nmethod for maximizing the nonlocal capacity over a given configuration space\nand, in particular, over a set of possible measurements, yielding the\ncorresponding optimal setup. Furthermore, we show that there is a functional\nrelationship between Bell violation and nonlocal capacity. The method is\nillustrated with numerical tests and compared with the maximization of the\nviolation of CGLMP-type Bell inequalities on the basis of entangled two-qubit\nas well as two-qutrit states. Remarkably, the anomaly of nonlocality displayed\nby qutrits turns out to be even stronger if the nonlocal capacity is employed\nas a measure of nonlocality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 15:18:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 21:16:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 09:33:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

In addition to spin-noise and\ndispersion-measure (DM) variations, these models can include timing noise\nunique to a single observing system, or frequency band. We show the improved\nradio-frequency coverage and presence of overlapping data from different\nobserving systems in the IPTA data set enables us to separate both system and\nband-dependent effects with much greater efficacy than in the individual PTA\ndata sets. For example, we show that PSR J1643$-$1224 has, in addition to DM\nvariations, significant band-dependent noise that is coherent between PTAs\nwhich we interpret as coming from time-variable scattering or refraction in the\nionised interstellar medium. Failing to model these different contributions\nappropriately can dramatically alter the astrophysical interpretation of the\nstochastic signals observed in the residuals. In some cases, the spectral\nexponent of the spin noise signal can vary from 1.6 to 4 depending upon the\nmodel, which has direct implications for the long-term sensitivity of the\npulsar to a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background. By using a more\nappropriate model, however, we can greatly improve a pulsar's sensitivity to\nGWs.

Because the mass\nof ejecta from these channels could be quite different, their light curves are\nalso expected to be diverse. We evaluate the dynamic evolution of optical\ntransients powered by millisecond magnetars. We find that the magnetar with\nshort spin-down timescale converts its rotational energy mostly into the\nkinetic energy of the transient, while the energy of a magnetar with long\nspin-down timescale goes into radiation of the transient. This leads us to\nspeculate that hypernovae could be powered by magnetars with short spin-down\ntimescales. At late times the optical transients will gradually evolve into a\nnebular phase because of the photospheric recession. We treat the photosphere\nand nebula separately because their radiation mechanisms are different. In some\ncases the ejecta could be light enough that the magnetar can accelerate it to a\nrelativistic speed. It is well known that the peak luminosity of a supernova\n(SN) occurs when the luminosity is equal to the instantaneous energy input\nrate, as shown by Arnett (1979). We show that photospheric recession and\nrelativistic motion can modify this law. The photospheric recession always\nleads to a delay of the peak time $t_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ relative to the time\n$t_{\\times }$ at which the SN luminosity equals the instantaneous energy input\nrate.

The conventional wisdom is that the pitch angle does\nnot change during the radiation process. The argument is based on Larmor's\nradiation formula, where in a synchrotron case the radiation power is along the\ninstantaneous direction of motion of the charge. Then the momentum loss will\nalso be parallel to that direction and therefore the pitch angle of the charge\nwould remain unaffected. The accordingly derived formulas for energy losses of\nsynchrotron electrons in radio galaxies are the standard text-book material for\nthe last 50 years. However, if we use the momentum transformation laws from\nspecial relativity, then we find that the pitch angle of a radiating charge\nvaries. While the velocity component parallel to the magnetic field remains\nunaffected, the perpendicular component does reduce in magnitude due to\nradiative losses, implying a change in the pitch angle. This apparent paradox\nis resolved when effects on the charge motion are calculated not from Larmor's\nformula but from Lorentz's radiation reaction formula. We derive the exact\nformulation by taking into account the change of the pitch angle due to\nradiative losses. From this we first time derive the characteristic decay time\nof synchrotron electrons over which they turn from highly relativistic into\nmildly relativistic ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 02:52:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-01"}
