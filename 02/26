In addition to several convincing\nempirical studies, some others provide analytical results, yet under some\nstrong assumptions such as Poisson arrivals, exponential service times, or\nindependent service times of the replicas themselves, which may lend themselves\nto some contrasting and perhaps contriving behavior. For instance, under the\nsecond assumption, an overloaded system can be stabilized by a replication\nfactor, but can be sent back in overload through further replication. In turn,\nunder the third assumption, strictly larger stability regions of replication\nsystems do not necessarily imply smaller delays.\n  Motivated by the need to dispense with such common and restricting\nassumptions, which may additionally cause unexpected behavior, we develop a\nunified and general theoretical framework to compute tight bounds on the\ndistribution of response times in general replication systems. These results\nimmediately lend themselves to the optimal number of replicas minimizing\nresponse time quantiles, depending on the parameters of the system (e.g., the\ndegree of correlation amongst replicas). As a concrete application of our\nframework, we design a novel replication policy which can improve the stability\nregion of classical fork-join queueing systems by $\\mathcal{O}(\\ln K)$, in the\nnumber of servers $K$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 16:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-26"}

The idea is to outsource the grading task to the students themselves\nas follows. After the end of an exam, each student is asked to rank -- in terms\nof quality -- a bundle of exam papers by fellow students. An aggregation rule\nthen combines the individual rankings into a global one that contains all\nstudents. We define a broad class of simple aggregation rules, which we call\ntype-ordering aggregation rules, and present a theoretical framework for\nassessing their effectiveness. When statistical information about the grading\nbehaviour of students is available (in terms of a noise matrix that\ncharacterizes the grading behaviour of the average student from a student\npopulation), the framework can be used to compute the optimal rule from this\nclass with respect to a series of performance objectives that compare the\nranking returned by the aggregation rule to the underlying ground truth\nranking.

However, in practice different task environments are\nbest handled by different learning models, rather than a single, universal,\napproach. Most non-trivial models thus require the adjustment of several to\nmany learning parameters, which is often done on a case-by-case basis by an\nexternal party. Meta-learning refers to the ability of an agent to autonomously\nand dynamically adjust its own learning parameters, or meta-parameters. In this\nwork we show how projective simulation, a recently developed model of\nartificial intelligence, can naturally be extended to account for meta-learning\nin reinforcement learning settings. The projective simulation approach is based\non a random walk process over a network of clips. The suggested meta-learning\nscheme builds upon the same design and employs clip networks to monitor the\nagent's performance and to adjust its meta-parameters \"on the fly\". We\ndistinguish between \"reflexive adaptation\" and \"adaptation through learning\",\nand show the utility of both approaches. In addition, a trade-off between\nflexibility and learning-time is addressed. The extended model is examined on\nthree different kinds of reinforcement learning tasks, in which the agent has\ndifferent optimal values of the meta-parameters, and is shown to perform well,\nreaching near-optimal to optimal success rates in all of them, without ever\nneeding to manually adjust any meta-parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 18:07:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-31"}

Inspired by developments in molecular\ncomputation, and in particular DNA computing, recent algorithmic work has\nfocused on the complexity of solving simple yet fundamental tasks in the\npopulation model, such as leader election (which requires stabilization to a\nsingle agent in a special \"leader\" state), and majority (in which agents must\nstabilize to a decision as to which of two possible initial states had higher\ninitial count). Known results point towards an inherent trade-off between the\ntime complexity of such algorithms, and the space complexity, i.e. size of the\nmemory available to each agent.\n  In this paper, we explore this trade-off and provide new upper and lower\nbounds for majority and leader election. First, we prove a unified lower bound,\nwhich relates the space available per node with the time complexity achievable\nby a protocol: for instance, our result implies that any protocol solving\neither of these tasks for $n$ agents using $O( \\log \\log n )$ states must take\n$\\Omega( n / \\rm{polylog} n )$ expected time. This is the first result to\ncharacterize time complexity for protocols which employ super-constant number\nof states per node, and proves that fast, poly-logarithmic running times\nrequire protocols to have relatively large space costs.\n  On the positive side, we give algorithms showing that fast, poly-logarithmic\nstabilization time can be achieved using $O( \\log^2 n )$ space per node, in the\ncase of both tasks.

We selected candidate young stellar objects from the\nSpitzer and WISE data bases using various published color criteria, and\nclassified them based on the slope of the spectral energy distribution. We\nidentified 170 Class II, 27 Flat SED, and Class 0/I sources. High angular\nresolution near-infrared observations of the RNO 7 cluster, embedded in L1340,\nrevealed eight new young stars of near-infrared excess. The surface density\ndistribution of young stellar objects shows three groups, associated with the\nthree major molecular clumps of L1340, each consisting of less than 100\nmembers, including both pre-main sequence stars and embedded protostars. New\nHerbig--Haro objects were identified in the Spitzer images. Our results\ndemonstrate that L1340 is a prolific star-forming region of our Galactic\nenvironment in which several specific properties of the intermediate-mass mode\nof star formation can be studied in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 19:32:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-09"}

First, we discuss the twist leading to the Hopf algebra\nstructure for the well-known beta-deformation as well as a unitarily equivalent\ntheory that we call the w-deformation. We then show how this Hopf twist can be\nused to define a star product between the three scalar superfields of these\ntheories which encodes the deformed global symmetry. Turning to the gravity\nside, we adapt this star product to deform the pure spinors of six-dimensional\nflat space in its generalised geometry description.

Our model favors attributing the two high-frequency\nQPOs, often occurring in a near 3:2 frequency ratio, to the breathing and\nvertical epicyclic frequency modes of the hot, thick flow, although we can not\nrule out the Keplerian and m=-1 radial epicyclic modes.

For most problems the best randomized algorithm is\nat least exponentially faster than the best deterministic algorithm. In this\npaper we prove that these exponential gaps are necessary and establish\nconnections between the deterministic and randomized complexities in the LOCAL\nmodel. Each result has a very compelling take-away message:\n  1. Fast $\\Delta$-coloring of trees requires random bits: Building on the\nrecent lower bounds of Brandt et al., we prove that the randomized complexity\nof $\\Delta$-coloring a tree with maximum degree $\\Delta\\ge 55$ is\n$\\Theta(\\log_\\Delta\\log n)$, whereas its deterministic complexity is\n$\\Theta(\\log_\\Delta n)$ for any $\\Delta\\ge 3$.

If the transformed algorithm violates a\nlower bound (even allowing randomization), then one can conclude that the\nproblem requires $\\Omega(\\log_\\Delta n)$ time deterministically.\n  3.

This\nshows that a deterministic $\\Omega(\\log_\\Delta n)$ lower bound for any problem\nimplies a randomized $\\Omega(\\log_\\Delta\\log n)$ lower bound.

Starting\nwith a reformulation of BCS theory with emphasis on gauge invariance, he\nrecognized the realization of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in particle\nphysics as is evidenced by the Goldberger-Treiman relation. A concrete model of\nNambu and Jona-Lasinio illustrated the essence of the Nambu-Goldstone theorem\nand the idea of soft pions. After the proposal of the quark model by Gell-Mann,\nhe together with Han constructed an alternative model of integrally charged\nquarks with possible non-Abelian gluons. All those remarkable works were\nperformed during the years 1960-1965. Here I briefly review those works\nfollowing the original papers of Nambu chronologically, together with a brief\nintroduction to a formulation of Neother's theorem and Ward-Takahashi\nidentities using path integrals.

The matrix\noperations, associated with both training and testing of deep networks, are\nvery expensive from a computational and energy standpoint. We present a novel\nhashing based technique to drastically reduce the amount of computation needed\nto train and test deep networks. Our approach combines recent ideas from\nadaptive dropouts and randomized hashing for maximum inner product search to\nselect the nodes with the highest activation efficiently. Our new algorithm for\ndeep learning reduces the overall computational cost of forward and\nback-propagation by operating on significantly fewer (sparse) nodes. As a\nconsequence, our algorithm uses only 5% of the total multiplications, while\nkeeping on average within 1% of the accuracy of the original model. A unique\nproperty of the proposed hashing based back-propagation is that the updates are\nalways sparse. Due to the sparse gradient updates, our algorithm is ideally\nsuited for asynchronous and parallel training leading to near linear speedup\nwith increasing number of cores. We demonstrate the scalability and\nsustainability (energy efficiency) of our proposed algorithm via rigorous\nexperimental evaluations on several real datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 05:07:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 04:52:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-06"}

For face-on disks, both emission and scattering tend to produce\npolarization in the radial direction, making them difficult to distinguish,\nalthough the scattering-induced polarization can switch to the azimuthal\ndirection if the incident radiation is beamed strongly enough in the radial\ndirection in the disk plane.

The full\ndistribution of these forces can thus give us insights into mechanochemistry\nbeyond the predictive capability of thermodynamics. In this paper, we study the\nforce exerted by an inextensible semiflexible polymer constrained in a looped\nstate. By using a novel simulation method termed \"phase-space sampling\", we\ngenerate the equilibrium distribution of chain conformations in both position\nand momentum space. We compute the constraint forces between the two ends of\nthe loop in this chain ensemble using Lagrangian mechanics, and show that the\nmean of these forces is equal to the thermodynamic force. By analyzing kinetic\nand potential contributions to the forces, we find that the mean force acts in\nthe direction of increasing extension not because of bending stress, but in\nspite of it. Furthermore, we obtain a distribution of constraint forces as a\nfunction of chain length, extension, and stiffness. Notably, increasing contour\nlength decreases the average force, but the additional freedom allows\nfluctuations in the constraint force to increase. The force distribution is\nasymmetric and falls off less sharply than a Gaussian distribution.

Especially, the structural origin of the\nexperimental band structure is clarified as the top Ag-Si mixed layer, unlike\nthe experimental interpretations as either a silicene layer or the Ag(111)\nsubstrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 06:10:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-29"}

This phenomenon is thought to arise from the combination of perfect\nn-p charge compensation with low carrier densities in WTe2 and presumably\ndetails of its band structure. Recently, \"spin texture\" induced by strong\nspin-orbital coupling (SOC) has been observed in WTe2 by angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This provides a mechanism for protecting\nbackscattering for the states involved and thus was proposed to play an\nimportant role in the XMR of WTe2. Here, based on our density functional\ncalculations for bulk WTe2, we found a strong Rashba spin-orbit effect in the\ncalculated band structure due to its non-centrosymmetric structure. This splits\nbands and two-fold spin degeneracy of bands is lifted. A prominent Umklapp\ninterference pattern (a spectroscopic feature with involving reciprocal lattice\nvectors) can be observed by scanning tunneling microscopic (STM) measurements\non WTe2 surface at 4.2 K. This differs distinctly from the surface atomic\nstructure demonstrated at 77 K. The energy dependence of Umklapp interference\nshows a strong correspondence with densities of states integrated from ARPES\nmeasurement, manifesting a fact that the bands are spin-split on the opposites\nside of Gamma point. Spectroscopic survey reveals the ratio of electron/hole\nasymmetry changes alternately with lateral locations along b axis, providing a\nmicroscopic picture for double-carrier transport of semimetallic WTe2. The\ncalculated band structure and Fermi surface is further supported by our ARPES\nresults and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 09:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

We apply the general approach to\nthe Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model of financial bubbles. This\nmodel is particularly relevant because one of its parameters, the critical time\n$t_c$ signalling the burst of the bubble, is arguably the target of choice for\ndynamical risk management. However, previous calibrations of the LPPLS model\nhave shown that the estimation of $t_c$ is in general quite unstable. Here, we\nprovide a rigorous likelihood inference approach to determine $t_c$, which\ntakes into account the impact of the other nonlinear (so-called \"nuisance\")\nparameters for the correct adjustment of the uncertainty on $t_c$. This\nprovides a rigorous interval estimation for the critical time, rather than a\npoint estimation in previous approaches. As a bonus, the interval estimations\ncan also be obtained for the nuisance parameters ($m,\\omega$, damping), which\ncan be used to improve filtering of the calibration results. We show that the\nuse of the modified profile likelihood method dramatically reduces the number\nof local extrema by constructing much simpler smoother log-likelihood\nlandscapes. The remaining distinct solutions can be interpreted as genuine\nscenarios that unfold as the time of the analysis flows, which can be compared\ndirectly via their likelihood ratio. Finally, we develop a multi-scale profile\nlikelihood analysis to visualize the structure of the financial data at\ndifferent scales (typically from 100 to 750 days).

The dictionary implies that the\nsymmetries of each (super) Yang-Mills factor generate the symmetries of the\ncorresponding (super)gravity theory: general covariance, $p$-form gauge\ninvariance, local Lorentz invariance, local supersymmetry, R-symmetry and\nU-duality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 10:19:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 07:29:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2016 09:49:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}

This `radio-mode AGN\nfeedback' phenomenon, which is thought to quench cooling flows, is widespread\nand is critical to understand the physics of the inner regions of galaxy\nclusters and the properties of the central BCG.

To demonstrate this architecture, we employed\nthe NVCs by means of their optical and spin interfaces as nanosensors of the\nmotion of the membrane under static pressure and in-resonance vibration, as\nwell as the residual stress of the membrane. Driving the membrane at its\nfundamental resonance mode, we observed coupling of this vibrational mode to\nthe spin of the NVCs by Hahn echo signal. Our realization of this architecture\nwill enable futuristic HQS-based applications in diamond piezometry and\nvibrometry, as well as spin-mechanical and mechanically mediated spin-spin\ncoupling in quantum information science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 13:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

In\nrecent times, there has been a renewed interest in modelling dynamic executions\nof weak memory programs using partial orders. However, such an approach\ntypically requires ad-hoc mechanisms to correctly capture the data and\ncontrol-flow choices/conflicts present in real-world programs.

At VHE, it was first\ndetected by VERITAS and later confirmed by MAGIC. Its spectral energy\ndistribution is highly attenuated at VHE gamma rays, which is coherent with\ndistant sources. Several estimations enabled the redshift to be constrained to\nthe range 0.6 < z < 1.3. These results place PKS 1424+240 in the very\ninteresting condition of being probably the most distant blazar that has been\ndetected at VHE. The ambiguity in the redshift is still large enough to prevent\nprecise studies of the EBL and the intrinsic blazar spectrum. Given the\ndifficulty of measuring spectroscopic redshifts for BL-Lac objects directly, we\naim to establish a reliable redshift value for this blazar by finding its host\ngroup of galaxies. Elliptical galaxies are associated with groups, and BL-Lac\nobjects are typically hosted by them, so we decided to search for the host\ngroup of the blazar. For this, we performed optical spectroscopic observations\nof thirty objects in the field of view of PKS 1424+240 using the Gemini MOS.\nAfter analysing the data for groups, we evaluated the probability of finding\ngroups of galaxies by chance around the position of PKS 1424+240, using a deep\ncatalogue of groups. We also used photometric data from the SDSS catalogue to\nanalyse the red sequence of the proposed blazar host group.

We point out that a D-type curve is a geodesic curve\nor an asymptotic curve in some special cases. Then, by using the Frenet vectors\nand parametric representation of a surface pencil as a linear combination of\nthe Frenet vectors, we investigate necessary and sufficient condition for a\ncurve to be a D-type curve on a surface pencil. Moreover, we introduce some\ncorollaries by considering D-type curve as a helix, a Salkowski curve or a\nplanar curve. Finally, we give some examples for obtained results and plot the\nsurfaces by using Mapple.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 14:35:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 12:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-20"}

In the absence of energetic\nevents the velocity distribution of electrons reveal a dual structure with a\nthermal (Maxwellian) core and a suprathermal (Kappa) halo. This paper presents\na detailed observational analysis of these two components, providing\nestimations of their temperatures and temperature anisotropies and decoding any\npotential interdependence that their properties may indicate. The data set used\nin this study includes more than 120$\\,$000 the events detected by three\nmissions in the ecliptic within an extended range of heliocentric distances\nfrom 0.3 to over 4~AU. The anti-correlation found for the core and halo\ntemperatures is consistent with the radial evolution of the Kappa model,\nclarifying an apparent contradiction in previous observational analysis and\nproviding valuable clues about the temperature of the Kappa-distributed\npopulations. However, these two components manifest a clear tendency to deviate\nfrom isotropy in the same direction, that seems to confirm the existence of\nmechanisms with similar effects on both components, e.g., the solar wind\nexpansion, or the particle heating by the fluctuations. On the other hand, the\nexistence of plasma states with anti-correlated anisotropies of the core and\nhalo populations suggests a dynamic interplay of these components, mediated,\nmost probably, by the anisotropy-driven instabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2016 15:01:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}
