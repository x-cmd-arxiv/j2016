Nonlin. Sci., 2013, 23:777-805.) predicted\nthe disappearance of the stretch-induced wrinkled pattern of thin, clamped,\nelastic sheets by numerical simulation of the F\\\"oppl-von K\\'arm\\'an equations\nextended to the finite in-plane strain regime. It has also been revealed that\nfor some aspect ratios of the rectangular domain wrinkles do not occur at all\nregardless of the applied extension. To verify these predictions we carried out\nexperiments on thin 20 micrometer thick adhesive covered), previously\nprestressed elastomer sheets with different aspect ratios under displacement\ncontrolled pull tests. On one hand the the adjustment of the material\nproperties during prestressing is highly advantageous as in targeted strain\nregime the film becomes substantially linearly elastic (which is far not the\ncase without prestress). On the other hand a significant, non-ignorable\northotropy develops during this first extension. To enable quantitative\ncomparisons we abandoned the assumption about material isotropy inherent in the\noriginal model and derived the governing equations for an orthotropic medium.\nIn this way we found good agreement between numerical simulations and\nexperimental data.\n  Analysis of the negativity of the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor\nrevealed that the critical stretch for a bifurcation point at which the\nwrinkles disappear must be finite for any aspect ratio. On the contrary there\nis no such a bound for the aspect ratio as a bifurcation parameter. Physically\nthis manifests as complicated wrinkled patterns with more than one highly\nwrinkled zones on the surface in case of elongated rectangles. These\narrangements have been found both numerically and experimentally. These\nfindings also support the new, finite strain model, since the F\\\"oppl-von\nK\\'arm\\'an equations based on infinitesimal strains do not exhibit such a\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2016 16:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}

This is not so surprising, as classical and quantum\nphysics are descriptive frameworks built on different assumptions that capture,\nemphasize, and express different properties and mechanisms. What is surprising\nis that, as we demonstrate, simplicity is ambiguous: the relative simplicity\nbetween two systems can change sign when moving between classical and quantum\ndescriptions. Thus, notions of absolute physical simplicity---minimal structure\nor memory---at best form a partial, not a total, order. This suggests that\nappeals to principles of physical simplicity, via Ockham's Razor or to the\n\"elegance\" of competing theories, may be fundamentally subjective, perhaps even\nbeyond the purview of physics itself. It also raises challenging questions in\nmodel selection between classical and quantum descriptions.

The problem is relevant to the dynamics of\ngeophysical and planetary core flows, for which, in the case of electrically\nconducting fluids, the possible operation of a dynamo is of considerable\ninterest. A comprehensive asymptotic study, in the limit E<<1, was undertaken\nby Stewartson (J. Fluid Mech. 1966, vol. 26, pp. 131-144). The mainstream flow,\nexterior to the E^{1/2} Ekman layers on the inner/outer boundaries and the\nshear layer on the inner sphere tangent cylinder C, is geostrophic. Stewartson\nidentified a complicated nested layer structure on C, which comprises\nrelatively thick quasi-geostrophic E^{2/7} (inside C) and E^{1/4} (outside C)\nlayers. They embed a thinner E^{1/3} ageostrophic shear layer (on C), which\nmerges with the inner sphere Ekman layer to form the E^{2/5} Equatorial Ekman\nlayer of axial length E^{1/5}. Under appropriate scaling, this $E^{2/5}$--layer\nproblem may be formulated, correct to leading order, independent of E.\nAccordingly, the Ekman boundary layer and ageostrophic shear layer become\nfeatures of the far-field (as identified by the large value of the scaled axial\nco-ordinate z) solution. We present a numerical solution, which uses a\nnon-local integral boundary condition at finite $z$ to account for the\nfar-field behaviour. Adopting z^{-1} as a small parameter we extend\nStewartson's similarity solution for the ageostrophic shear layer to higher\norders. This far-field solution agrees well with that obtained from our\nnumerical model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2016 23:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2016 11:06:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

Demographic stochasticity plays a key role in the slowdown, which is\nstreghtened when individuals can actively move towards resources. The reduction\nin the front propagation speed is verified in laboratory microcosm experiments\nwith the flagellated protist Euglena gracilis by comparing spread in habitats\ncharacterized by different resource heterogeneity. Our theoretical and\nexperimental findings highlight the need to account for the intrinsic\nstochasticity of population dynamics to describe spread in spatially extended\nlandscapes, which are inevitably characterized by heterogeneous spatial\ndistributions of resources controlling vital rates. Our work identifies the\nresource autocorrelation length as a key modulator and a simple measure of\nlandscape susceptibility to biological invasions, with implications for\npredicting the characters of biological invasions within naturally\nheterogeneous environmental corridors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2016 10:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-01"}

Recently,\nseveral approaches have been proposed for algorithms that are \"worst-case\noptimal\" wherein all relations are scanned simultaneously. An example is\nVeldhuizen's Leapfrog Trie Join (LFTJ). An important advantage of LFTJ is its\nsmall memory footprint, due to the fact that intermediate results are full\ntuples that can be dumped immediately. However, since the algorithm does not\nstore intermediate results, recurring joins must be reconstructed from the\nsource relations, resulting in excessive memory traffic. In this paper, we\naddress this problem by incorporating caches into LFTJ. We do so by adopting\nrecent developments on join optimization, tying variable ordering to tree\ndecomposition. While the traditional usage of tree decomposition computes the\nresult for each bag in advance, our proposed approach incorporates caching\ndirectly into LFTJ and can dynamically adjust the size of the cache.\nConsequently, our solution balances memory usage and repeated computation, as\nconfirmed by our experiments over SNAP datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Feb 2016 14:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-01"}

In order to\ndescribe the tool we start defining its basic building block, the voter. A\nvoter is defined as a software module connected to one user module and to a\nfarm of fellow voters arranged into a clique. By means of the functions in the\nclass the user module is able: to create a static \"picture\" of the voting farm,\nneeded for the set up of the clique; to instantiate the local voter; to send\ninput or control messages to that voter. No interlocutor is needed other than\nthe local voter. The other user modules are supposed to create coherent\npictures and instances of voters on other nodes of the machine and to manage\nconsistently the task of their local intermediary. All technicalities\nconcerning the set up of the clique and the exchange of messages between the\nvoters are completely transparent to the user module.
