Cloud\nformation modeling predicts considerable inhomogeneities of cloud cover,\nconsistent with optical phase curve observations. However, optical phase curves\ncannot resolve some existing degeneracies between cloud location and cloud\noptical properties.\n  We present a conceptually simple technique to detect inhomogeneous cloud\ncover on exoplanets. Such an inhomogeneous cloud cover produces an asymmetric\nprimary transit of the planet in front of the host star. Asymmetric transits\nproduce characteristic residuals compared to a standard symmetric model.\nFurthermore, bisector spans can be used to determine asymmetries in the transit\nlight curve.\n  We apply a model of asymmetric transits to the light curves of HAT-P-7b,\nKepler-7b and HD209458b and search for possible cloud signatures. The nearly\nuninterrupted Kepler photometry is particularly well-suited for this method\nsince it allows for a very high time resolution.\n  We do not find any statistically sound cloud signature in the data of the\nconsidered planets.

Since then, the statistical mechanics approach for jammed\nmatter has garnered an extraordinary amount of attention by both theorists and\nexperimentalists. Here, we review a systematic approach to jammed matter based\non the Edwards statistical mechanical ensemble. We discuss the construction of\nmicrocanonical and canonical ensembles based on the volume function, which\nreplaces the Hamiltonian in jammed systems. The importance of approximation\nschemes at various levels is emphasized leading to quantitative predictions for\nensemble averaged quantities such as packing fractions and contact force\ndistributions. An overview of the phenomenology of jammed states and\nexperiments, simulations, and theoretical models scrutinizing the strong\nassumptions underlying Edwards' approach is given including recent results\nsuggesting the validity of Edwards ergodic hypothesis for jammed states. A\ntheoretical framework for packings whose constitutive particles range from\nspherical to non-spherical shapes like dimers, polymers, ellipsoids,\nspherocylinders or tetrahedra, hard and soft, frictional, frictionless and\nadhesive, monodisperse and polydisperse particles in any dimensions is\ndiscussed providing insight into an unifying phase diagram for all jammed\nmatter. Furthermore, the connection between the Edwards' ensemble of metastable\njammed states and metastability in spin-glasses is established. This highlights\nthat the packing problem can be understood as a constraint satisfaction problem\nfor excluded volume and force and torque balance leading to a unifying\nframework between the Edwards ensemble of equiprobable jammed states and\nout-of-equilibrium spin-glasses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2016 19:52:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2016 12:04:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2016 15:50:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 13:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

These studies have not only deepened our understanding of\nlight-matter interactions but also introduced aspects of many-body correlations\ninherent in optical processes in condensed matter systems. This article is\nconcerned with superradiance (SR), a profound quantum optical process predicted\nby Dicke in 1954. The basic concept of SR applies to a general $N$-body system\nwhere constituent oscillating dipoles couple together through interaction with\na common light field and accelerate the radiative decay of the system. In the\nmost fascinating manifestation of SR, known as superfluorescence (SF), an\nincoherently prepared system of $N$ inverted atoms spontaneously develops\nmacroscopic coherence from vacuum fluctuations and produces a delayed pulse of\ncoherent light whose peak intensity $\\propto N^2$. Such SF pulses have been\nobserved in atomic and molecular gases, and their intriguing quantum nature has\nbeen unambiguously demonstrated. Here, we focus on the rapidly developing field\nof research on SR in solids, where not only photon-mediated coupling but also\nstrong Coulomb interactions and ultrafast scattering exist. We describe SR and\nSF in molecular centers in solids, molecular aggregates and crystals, quantum\ndots, and quantum wells. In particular, we will summarize a series of studies\nwe have recently performed on quantum wells in strong magnetic fields.

We propose an extension of the\nCurry-Howard paradigm of representation, from proofs to solutions: to represent\nsolutions by possibly infinite terms of a dedicated lambda-calculus. This new,\ncomprehensive approach to proof search is exemplified with the sequent calculus\nLJT for intuitionistic implication logic. A finitary representation is\nproposed, comprising lambda-terms extended with a formal greatest fixed point,\nand a type system that can be seen as a logic of coinductive proofs. In the\nfinitary system, fixed-point variables enjoy a relaxed form of binding that\nallows the detection of cycles through the type system. Formal sums are used to\nexpress alternatives in the search process. Moreover, formal sums are used in\nthe coinductive syntax to define \"decontraction\" (contraction bottom-up) - an\noperation whose theory we initiate in this paper. As a semantics, we assign a\ncoinductive lambda-term to each finitary term. The main result is the existence\nof an equivalent finitary representation for any full solution space expressed\ncoinductively. This result is the main ingredient in the proof that our logic\nof coinductive proofs is sound and complete with respect to the coinductive\nsemantics. These results are the foundation for an original approach to proof\nsearch, where the search builds the finitary representation of the full\nsolution space, and the a posteriori analysis typically consisting in applying\na syntax-directed procedure or function.

The dijet azimuthal decorrelation is caused by the\nradiation of additional jets and probes the dynamics of multijet production.\nThe results are compared to fixed-order predictions of perturbative quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD), and to simulations using Monte Carlo event generators\nthat include parton showers, hadronization, and multiparton interactions. Event\ngenerators with only two outgoing high transverse momentum partons fail to\ndescribe the measurement, even when supplemented with next-to-leading-order QCD\ncorrections and parton showers. Much better agreement is achieved when at least\nthree outgoing partons are complemented through either next-to-leading-order\npredictions or parton showers.

Many\nmethods have been proposed for detecting emerging events in text streams using\ntopic modeling. However, these methods have numerous shortcomings that make\nthem unsuitable for rapid detection of locally emerging events on massive text\nstreams. In this paper, we describe Semantic Scan (SS) that has been developed\nspecifically to overcome these shortcomings in detecting new spatially compact\nevents in text streams.\n  Semantic Scan integrates novel contrastive topic modeling with online\ndocument assignment and principled likelihood ratio-based spatial scanning to\nidentify emerging events with unexpected patterns of keywords hidden in text\nstreams. This enables more timely and accurate detection and characterization\nof anomalous, spatially localized emerging events. Semantic Scan does not\nrequire manual intervention or labeled training data, and is robust to noise in\nreal-world text data since it identifies anomalous text patterns that occur in\na cluster of new documents rather than an anomaly in a single new document.\n  We compare Semantic Scan to alternative state-of-the-art methods such as\nTopics over Time, Online LDA, and Labeled LDA on two real-world tasks: (i) a\ndisease surveillance task monitoring free-text Emergency Department chief\ncomplaints in Allegheny County, and (ii) an emerging business trend detection\ntask based on Yelp reviews.

Since the\nelectroluminescence mechanism has not yet been elucidated, it is not clear to\nwhat extent the emission rate can be increased. Here we develop a theoretical\nframework to study single-photon emission from color centers in diamond under\nelectrical pumping. The proposed model comprises electron and hole trapping and\nreleasing, transitions between the ground and excited states of the color\ncenter as well as structural transformations of the center due to carrier\ntrapping. It provides the possibility to predict both the photon emission rate\nand the wavelength of emitted photons. Self-consistent numerical simulations of\nthe single-photon emitting diode based on the proposed model show that the\nphoton emission rate can be as high as 100 kcounts s$^{-1}$ at standard\nconditions. In contrast to most optoelectronic devices, the emission rate\nsteadily increases with the device temperature achieving of more than 100\nMcount s$^{-1}$ at 500 K, which is highly advantageous for practical\napplications.

Ab initio approaches have been successfully applied to describe the\n$^3$H$(d,n)^4$He and $^3$He$(d,p)^4$He fusion processes.\n  Purpose: An ab initio treatment of transfer reactions would also be desirable\nfor heavier targets. In this work, we extend the ab initio description of\n$(d,p)$ reactions to processes with light $p$-shell nuclei. As a first\napplication, we study the elastic scattering of deuterium on $^7$Li and the\n${}^{7}$Li($d$,$p$)${}^{8}$Li transfer reaction based on a two-body\nHamiltonian.\n  Methods: We use the no-core shell model to compute the wave functions of the\nnuclei involved in the reaction, and describe the dynamics between targets and\nprojectiles with the help of microscopic-cluster states in the spirit of the\nresonating group method.\n  Results: The shape of the excitation functions for deuteron impinging on\n${}^{7}$Li are qualitatively reproduced up to the deuteron breakup energy. The\ninterplay between $d$-$^7$Li and $p$-$^8$Li particle-decay channels determines\nsome features of the ${}^{9}$Be spectrum above the $d$+${}^{7}$Li threshold.\nOur prediction for the parity of the 17.298 MeV resonance is at odds with the\nexperimental assignment\n  Conclusions: Deuteron stripping reactions with $p$-shell targets can now be\ncomputed ab initio, but calculations are very demanding. A quantitative\ndescription of the ${}^{7}$Li($d$,$p$)${}^{8}$Li reaction will require further\nwork to include the effect of three-nucleon forces and additional decay\nchannels, and improve the convergence rate of our calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2016 23:53:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

Since embedded\nsystems typically have fewer cooling options, rising temperature, and thus\ntemperature optimization, is an emergent concern. Most embedded systems only\ndissipate heat by passive convection, due to the absence of dedicated thermal\nmanagement hardware mechanisms. The embedded system`s temperature not only\naffects the system`s reliability, but could also affect the performance, power,\nand cost. Thus, embedded systems require efficient thermal management\ntechniques. However, thermal management can conflict with other optimization\nobjectives, such as execution time and energy consumption.

Both algorithms use data\nstructures of size polynomial in $n$, the number of points in the database.\n  For the lower bound, we prove an $\\Omega(\\frac{1}{k}(\\log d)^{1/k})$ lower\nbound for the total number of memory accesses required by any randomized\nalgorithm solving the approximate nearest neighbor search within\n$k\\le\\frac{\\log\\log d}{2\\log\\log\\log d}$ rounds of parallel memory accesses on\nany data structures of polynomial size. This lower bound shows that our first\nalgorithm is asymptotically optimal for any constant round $k$. And our second\nalgorithm approaches the asymptotically optimal tradeoff between rounds and\nmemory accesses, in a sense that the lower bound of memory accesses for any\n$k_1$ rounds can be matched by the algorithm within $k_2=O(k_1)$ rounds. In the\nextreme, for some large enough $k=\\Theta\\left(\\frac{\\log\\log d}{\\log\\log\\log\nd}\\right)$, our second algorithm matches the $\\Theta\\left(\\frac{\\log\\log\nd}{\\log\\log\\log d}\\right)$ tight bound for fully adaptive algorithms for\napproximate nearest neighbor search due to Chakrabarti and Regev.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2016 06:36:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-16"}

To address this problem, we propose a novel approach by\ninspecting the distribution of the detection scores at multiple image regions\nbased on the detector trained from the \"regular object\" and \"other objects\".\nThe key observation motivating our approach is that for \"regular object\" images\nas well as \"other objects\" images, the region-level scores follow their own\nessential patterns in terms of both the score values and the spatial\ndistributions while the detection scores obtained from an \"irregular object\"\nimage tend to break these patterns. To model this distribution, we propose to\nuse Gaussian Processes (GP) to construct two separate generative models for the\ncase of the \"regular object\" and the \"other objects\".

These potential gains in efficiencies are illustrated via a\nsimulation study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2016 11:04:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2016 09:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

We present in this paper a new scheme for maximizing heterogeneous WSN\nlifetime. The proposed scheme employs two types of sensor nodes that are named\n(consistent with IEEE 802.15.4 standard) Full Function Device (FFD) and Reduced\nFunction Device (RFD). The FFDs are the expensive sensor nodes with high power\nand computational capabilities compared to the RFDs which are cheap sensors\nwith a limited power supply. The scheme divides the network into smaller\nsub-networks (regions) that are built from sectors and tracks. The objective of\nthis research is to balance and reduce the communication load on RFDs, reduce\nthe delay, and increase the connectivity and lifetime, by using a limited\nnumber of FFDs. We investigate the performance of our scheme via numerical\nsimulation and compare it to other related schemes that are presented for\nhomogeneous WSNs with chain topology, such as Pegasis, Epegasis and Chiron. In\naddition to extending the lifetime, our scheme also results in reducing the\ndata transmission delay compared to the related schemes. Furthermore, the\nscheme increases the network security and reduces the RFDs power consumption by\npreventing the direct communication with the base station (BS). The FFD is the\ncommunication bridge between RFDs and BS. The FFD communicate with the BS using\nthe one-hop approach or multi-hop approach through other FFDs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2016 11:10:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-16"}

We investigate how the\nsolar brightness variability as well as its facular and spot contributions\ndepend on the wavelength, timescale of variability, and position of the\nobserver relative to the ecliptic plane.\n  We perform calculations with the SATIRE model, which returns solar brightness\nwith daily cadence from solar disc area coverages of various magnetic features.\n  Moving the observer away from the ecliptic plane increases the amplitude of\n11-year variability as it would be seen in Str\\\"omgren $(b+y)/2$ photometry,\nbut decreases the amplitude of the rotational brightness variations as it would\nappear in Kepler and CoRoT passbands.

While an initial guess for\nthe parameters may be obtained from dynamic models of the robot, parameters are\nusually tuned manually on the real system to achieve the best performance.\nOptimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization, have been used to\nautomate this process. However, these methods may evaluate unsafe parameters\nduring the optimization process that lead to safety-critical system failures.\nRecently, a safe Bayesian optimization algorithm, called SafeOpt, has been\ndeveloped, which guarantees that the performance of the system never falls\nbelow a critical value; that is, safety is defined based on the performance\nfunction. However, coupling performance and safety is often not desirable in\nrobotics. For example, high-gain controllers might achieve low average tracking\nerror (performance), but can overshoot and violate input constraints. In this\npaper, we present a generalized algorithm that allows for multiple safety\nconstraints separate from the objective. Given an initial set of safe\nparameters, the algorithm maximizes performance but only evaluates parameters\nthat satisfy safety for all constraints with high probability. To this end, it\ncarefully explores the parameter space by exploiting regularity assumptions in\nterms of a Gaussian process prior. Moreover, we show how context variables can\nbe used to safely transfer knowledge to new situations and tasks.

We elucidate the\nrelation of the four-parametric system to the expression proposed recently by\nButcher et al. \"on physical grounds\" in harmonic gauge, and we show that the\nresults coincide in the case of high-frequency waves in vacuum after a suitable\naveraging. In the massive gravity we show how one can arrive at the expression\nwhich coincides with the \"generalized linear symmetric Landau-Lifshitz\" tensor.\nHowever, there exists another uniquely given simpler symmetric tensor which can\nbe obtained by adding the divergence of a suitable superpotential to the\ncanonical energy-momentum tensor following from the Fierz-Pauli action. In\ncontrast to the symmetric tensor derived by the Belinfante procedure which\ninvolves the second derivatives of the field variables, this expression\ncontains only the field and its first derivatives. It is simpler than the\ngeneralized Landau-Lifshitz tensor but both yield the same total quantities\nsince they differ by the divergence of a superpotential. We also discuss the\nrole of the gauge conditions in the proofs of the uniqueness. In the Appendix,\nthe use of the symbolic tensor manipulation software Cadabra is briefly\ndescribed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2016 14:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-16"}
