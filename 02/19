Fermion mass generation is possible through\npartial compositeness accompanied by the appearance of new heavy fermionic\nresonances. The Higgs couplings to the Standard Model (SM) particles and\nbetween the Higgs bosons themselves are modified with respect to the SM. Higgs\npair production is sensitive to the trilinear Higgs self-coupling but also to\nanomalous couplings like the novel 2-Higgs-2-fermion coupling emerging in\ncomposite Higgs models. The QCD corrections to SM Higgs boson pair production\nare known to be large. In this paper we compute, in the limit of heavy loop\nparticle masses, the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections to Higgs pair\nproduction in composite Higgs models without and with new heavy fermions. The\nrelative QCD corrections are found to be almost insensitive both to the\ncompositeness of the Higgs boson and to the details of the heavy fermion\nspectrum, since the leading order cross section dominantly factorizes. With the\nobtained results we investigate the question if, taking into account Higgs\ncoupling constraints, new physics could first be seen in Higgs pair production.\nWe find this to be the case in the high-luminosity option of the LHC for\ncomposite Higgs models with heavy fermions. We also investigate the invariant\nmass distributions at NLO QCD. While they are sensitive to the Higgs\nnon-linearities and hence anomalous couplings, the influence of the heavy\nfermions is much less pronounced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 16:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

Bloom-filter based source-routed multicast remedies\nthis problem by moving the state from the routers to the packets. However, a\nfixed sized Bloom-filter can only store a limited number of items before the\nfalse positive ratio grows too high implying scalability issues. Several\nproposals have tried to address these scalability issues in Bloom-filter\nforwarding. These proposals, however, unnecessarily increase the forwarding\ncomplexity.\n  In this paper, we present Extensible-Bloom-filter (XBF), a new framing and\nforwarding solution which effectively circumvents the aforementioned drawbacks.\nXBF partitions a network into sub-networks that reflect the network topology\nand traffic patterns, and uses a separate fixed-length Bloom-filter in each of\nthese. We formulate this partition assignment problem into a balanced edge\npartitioning problem, and evaluate it with simulations on realistic topologies.\nOur results show that XBF scales to very large networks with minimal overhead\nand completely eliminates the false-positives that have plagued the traditional\nBloom-filter-based forwarding protocols.

The proof is based on the interpretation of the thresholding scheme\nas a minimizing movement scheme by Esedoglu et. al.. This interpretation means\nthat the thresholding scheme preserves the structure of (multi-phase) mean\ncurvature flow as a gradient flow w. r. t. the total interfacial energy. More\nprecisely, the thresholding scheme is a minimizing movement scheme for an\nenergy functional that $\\Gamma$-converges to the total interfacial energy. In\nthis sense, our proof is similar to the convergence results of Almgren, Taylor\nand Wang and Luckhaus and Sturzenhecker, which establish convergence of a more\nacademic minimizing movement scheme.

Here, we investigate\nthe qualitative behaviour of theoretical stellar wind mass-loss as a function\nof Teff across two bi-stability jumps in blue supergiant regime and also in\nproximity to the Eddington limit, relevant for LBVs. To investigate the\nphysical ingredients that play a role in the radiative acceleration we\ncalculate blue supergiant wind models with the CMFGEN non-LTE model atmosphere\ncode over an effective temperature range between 30000 and 8800 K. Although our\naim is not to provide new mass-loss rates for BA supergiants, we study and\nconfirm the existence of two bi-stability jumps in mass-loss rates predicted by\nVink, de Koter, & Lamers (1999). However, they are found to occur at somewhat\nlower Teff (20000 and 9000 K, respectively) than found previously, which would\nimply that stars may evolve towards lower Teff before strong mass-loss is\ninduced by the bi-stability jumps. When the combined effects of the second\nbi-stability jump and the proximity to Eddington limit are accounted for, we\nfind a dramatic increase in the mass-loss rate by up to a factor of 30. Further\ninvestigation of both bi-stability jumps is expected to lead to a better\nunderstanding of discrepancies between empirical modelling and theoretical\nmass-loss rates reported in the literature, and to provide key inputs for the\nevolution of both normal AB supergiants and LBVs, as well as their subsequent\nsupernova type II explosions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 16:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

To elucidate the microscopic mechanism, we develop a\ntwo-dimensional molecular model in which the trans and cis isomers are\nrepresented by straight and bent needles, respectively. As in the experimental\nsystem, the needles are allowed to rotate and to form overlaps but they cannot\ntranslate. The out-of-equilibrium rotational dynamics of the needles is\ngenerated using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate that, in a\nregime of high density and low temperature, the power-law relaxation can be\ntraced to the formation of spatio-temporal correlations in the rotational dy-\nnamics, i.e., dynamic heterogeneity.

Despite the fact that appropriately\nrepresenting activity changes is essential for accurately capturing time course\ndata from ion channels, systematic approaches for modelling modal gating are\ncurrently not available. In this paper, we develop a modular approach for\nbuilding such a model in an iterative process. First, stochastic switching\nbetween modes and stochastic opening and closing within modes are represented\nin separate aggregated Markov models. Second, the continuous-time hierarchical\nMarkov model, a new modelling framework proposed here, then enables us to\ncombine these components so that in the integrated model both mode switching as\nwell as the kinetics within modes are appropriately represented. A mathematical\nanalysis reveals that the behaviour of the hierarchical Markov model naturally\ndepends on the properties of its components. We also demonstrate how a\nhierarchical Markov model can be parameterised using experimental data and show\nthat it provides a better representation than a previous model of the same data\nset. Because evidence is increasing that modal gating reflects underlying\nmolecular properties of the channel protein, it is likely that biophysical\nprocesses are better captured by our new approach than in earlier models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 16:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-14"}

One of the main peculiar properties of PCs is that\nthey have photonic band gap in the transmission spectrum similar to electronic\nband gap and hence, they are able to prevent the light to propagate in certain\nfrequency regions irrespective of the propagation direction in space. Inside\nthe band gaps, neither optical modes nor spontaneous emissions exist. Breaking\nthe rotational and mirror symmetries of PC unit cells provides rich dispersive\nfeatures such as tilted self-collimation, and wavelength de-multiplexing\neffects. Another important issue in PC designs is that it is feasible to design\ngraded index medium if the parameters of the two dimensional PCs is\nintentionally rearranged.

A natural rapid approach would be finding a hash value for $S$ and\ncompare it with a prepared database of hash values for each of length $|S|$\nsubsequences of $R$. The problem with such approach is that it would only spot\na perfect match, while in reality there are lots of small changes:\nsubstitutions, deletions and insertions.\n  This issue could be repaired if having a hash function designed to tolerate\nsome small distortion accordingly to an alignment metric (like\nNeedleman-Wunch): designed to make that two similar sequences should most\nlikely give the same hash value. This paper discusses construction of\nDistortion-Resistant Hashing (DRH) to generate such fingerprints for rapid\nsearch of similar subsequences. The proposed approach is based on the rate\ndistortion theory: in a nearly uniform subset of length $|S|$ sequences, the\nhash value represents the closest sequence to $S$.

It also exploits CMB polarization to reduce\ncosmic variance. The performance of the method has been thoroughly tested with\nsimulations taking into account the impact of non-ideal conditions such as\nincomplete sky coverage or the presence of noise. In particular, three galaxy\nsurveys are simulated, whose redshift distributions peak at low ($z \\simeq\n0.3$), intermediate ($z \\simeq 0.6$) and high redshift ($z \\simeq 0.9$). The\ncontribution of each of the considered data sets as well as the effect of a\nmask and noise in the reconstructed ISW map is studied in detail. When\ncombining all the considered data sets (CMB temperature and polarization, the\nthree galaxy surveys and the lensing map), the proposed filter successfully\nreconstructs a map of the weak ISW signal, finding a perfect correlation with\nthe input signal for the ideal case and around 80 per cent, on average, in the\npresence of noise and incomplete sky coverage. We find that including CMB\npolarization improves the correlation between input and reconstruction although\nonly at a small level. Nonetheless, given the weakness of the ISW signal, even\nmodest improvements can be of importance. In particular, in realistic\nsituations, in which less information is available from the LSS tracers, the\neffect of including polarisation is larger. For instance, for the case in which\nthe ISW signal is recovered from CMB plus only one survey, and taking into\naccount the presence of noise and incomplete sky coverage, the improvement in\nthe correlation coefficient can be as large as 10 per cent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 17:46:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

However, previous studies\nhave shown that using inadequate markers or making inappropriate assumptions\nabout the relationship between the primary outcome and surrogate marker can\nlead to inaccurate conclusions regarding the treatment effect. Currently\navailable methods for identifying and validating surrogate markers tend to rely\non restrictive model assumptions and/or focus on uncensored outcomes. The\nability to use such methods in practice when the primary outcome of interest is\na time-to-event outcome is difficult due to censoring and missing surrogate\ninformation among those who experience the primary outcome before surrogate\nmarker measurement. In this paper, we propose a novel definition of the\nproportion of treatment effect explained by surrogate information collected up\nto a specified time in the setting of a time-to-event primary outcome. Our\nproposed approach accommodates a setting where individuals may experience the\nprimary outcome before the surrogate marker is measured.

In this paper we use higher order\nderivatives to escape these saddle points: we design the first efficient\nalgorithm guaranteed to converge to a third order local optimum (while existing\ntechniques are at most second order). We also show that it is NP-hard to extend\nthis further to finding fourth order local optima.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 18:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-19"}

In wide contrast to the maximum weight matching problem, for\nwhich many efficient algorithms are known, we prove that GreedyMatching is\nstrongly NP-hard and APX-complete, and thus it does not admit a PTAS unless\nP=NP, even on graphs with maximum degree at most 3 and with at most three\ndifferent integer edge weights. Furthermore we prove that GreedyMatching is\nstrongly NP-hard if the input graph is in addition bipartite. Moreover we\nconsider two natural parameters of the problem, for which we establish a sharp\nthreshold behavior between NP-hardness and tractability. On the positive side,\nwe present a randomized approximation algorithm (RGMA) for GreedyMatching on a\nspecial class of weighted graphs, called bush graphs. We highlight an\nunexpected connection between RGMA and the approximation of maximum cardinality\nmatching in unweighted graphs via randomized greedy algorithms. We show that,\nif the approximation ratio of RGMA is $\\rho$, then for every $\\epsilon>0$ the\nrandomized MRG algorithm of [Aronson et al., Rand. Struct.

The approach is based on sum-of-squares and semi-definite\nprogramming techniques. It is applicable to dynamical systems whose right-hand\nside is a polynomial function in the state variables and the controls. The key\nidea, first described but not implemented in (Chernyshenko et al., Phil. Trans.\nR. Soc. A, 372, 2014), is that the difficult problem of optimizing a cost\nfunction involving long-time averages is replaced by an optimization of the\nupper bound of the same average. As such, controller design requires the\nsimultaneous optimization of both the control law and a tunable function,\nsimilar to a Lyapunov function. The present paper introduces a method resolving\nthe well-known inherent non-convexity of this kind of optimization. The method\nis based on the formal assumption that the control is expensive, from which it\nfollows that the optimal control is small. The resulting asymptotic\noptimization problems are convex. The derivation of all the polynomial\ncoefficients in the controller is given in terms of the solvability conditions\nof state-dependent linear and bilinear inequalities. The proposed approach is\napplied to the problem of designing a full-information feedback controller that\nmitigates vortex shedding in the wake of a circular cylinder in the laminar\nregime via rotary oscillations. Control results on a reduced-order model of the\nactuated wake and in direct numerical simulation are reported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 19:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-19"}

These\nquantum correlations are observed in the experiment both as squeezing of the\nmeter field fluctuations below the vacuum level in a homodyne measurement, and\nas sideband asymmetry in a heterodyne measurement, demonstrating the common\norigin of both phenomena. We show that quantum feedback, i.e. feedback that\nsuppresses measurement back-action, can be used to increase the visibility of\nthe sideband asymmetry ratio. In contrast, by operating the feedback loop in\nthe regime of noise squashing, where the in-loop photocurrent variance is\nreduced below the vacuum level, the visibility of the sideband asymmetry is\nreduced. This is due to feedback back-action arising from vacuum noise in the\nhomodyne detector. These experiments demonstrate the possibility, as well as\nthe fundamental limits of measurement-based feedback as a tool to manipulate\nquantum correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 20:51:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 21:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-10"}

The agents responsible for mediating the MONDian force law are\nsuperfluid phonons that couple to ordinary (baryonic) matter. In this paper we\npropose an alternative way for the MOND phenomenon to emerge from DM\nsuperfluidity. The central idea is to use higher-gradient corrections in the\nsuperfluid effective theory. These next-to-leading order terms involve\ngradients of the gravitational potential, and therefore effectively modify the\ngravitational force law. In the process we discover a novel mechanism for\ngenerating the non-relativistic MOND action, starting from a theory that is\nfully analytic in all field variables. The idea, inspired by the symmetron\nmechanism, uses the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry. For large\nacceleration, the symmetry is unbroken and the action reduces to Einstein\ngravity. For small acceleration, the symmetry is spontaneously broken and the\naction reduces to MONDian gravity. Cosmologically, however, the universe is\nalways in the Einstein-gravity, symmetry-restoring phase.

Their FWHMs are less than 150\nkm/s, which is significantly below the stellar velocity dispersion. Although\nthe molecular mass of each filament is comparable to a rich spiral galaxy, such\nlow velocities show that the filaments are transient and the clouds would\ndisperse on <10^7 yr timescales unless supported, likely by the indirect effect\nof magnetic fields.

Via\nthe Cartan-Dieudonn\\'e theorem all the transformations of interest can be\nwritten as products of reflections and thus via `sandwiching' with Clifford\nalgebra multivectors. These multivector groups can be used to perform concrete\ncalculations in different groups, e.g. the various types of polyhedral groups,\nand we treat the example of the tetrahedral group $A_3$ in detail. As an aside,\nthis gives a constructive result that induces from every 3D root system a root\nsystem in dimension four, which hinges on the facts that the group of spinors\nprovides a double cover of the rotations, the space of 3D spinors has a 4D\neuclidean inner product, and with respect to this inner product the group of\nspinors can be shown to be closed under reflections. In particular the 4D root\nsystems/Coxeter groups induced in this way are precisely the exceptional ones,\nwith the 3D spinorial point of view also explaining their unusual automorphism\ngroups. This construction simplifies Arnold's trinities and puts the McKay\ncorrespondence into a wider framework.

Our goal in this paper is to design a new hierarchical ring\ninterconnect that can maintain most of the simplicity of traditional ring\ndesigns (no in-ring buffering or buffered flow control) while achieving high\nscalability as more complex buffered hierarchical ring designs. Our design,\ncalled HiRD (Hierarchical Rings with Deflection), includes features that allow\nus to mostly maintain the simplicity of traditional simple ring topologies\nwhile providing higher energy efficiency and scalability. First, HiRD does not\nhave any buffering or buffered flow control within individual rings, and\nrequires only a small amount of buffering between the ring hierarchy levels.\nWhen inter-ring buffers are full, our design simply deflects flits so that they\ncircle the ring and try again, which eliminates the need for in-ring buffering.\nSecond, we introduce two simple mechanisms that provides an end-to-end delivery\nguarantee within the entire network without impacting the critical path or\nlatency of the vast majority of network traffic. HiRD attains equal or better\nperformance at better energy efficiency than multiple versions of both a\nprevious hierarchical ring design and a traditional single ring design. We also\nanalyze our design's characteristics and injection and delivery guarantees. We\nconclude that HiRD can be a compelling design point that allows higher energy\nefficiency and scalability while retaining the simplicity and appeal of\nconventional ring-based designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 23:37:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-22"}

After ionization, part of the electron wave packet may directly\ngo to the detector (the reference wave), while another part may be driven back\nto the ion where it scatters off (the signal wave). The interference hologram\nof the two waves may be used to retrieve the target information. However,\nunlike conventional optical holography, the propagations of electron wave\npackets are affected by the Coulomb potential as well as by the laser field.

This paper\ninvestigates the possibility of applying spectral methods to recover the\nparameters of supervised LDA (sLDA).

This ordered phase is shown to be related\nto the recently discovered fluctuating-moment induced spin-triplet\nsuperconducting state in the orbitally degenerate model with shifted chemical\npotential. In the three-orbital case, we consider the effect of a crystal field\nsplitting on the spin-triplet superconducting state in the model with positive\nHund coupling, and the spin-singlet superconducting state in the case of\nnegative Hund coupling. It is demonstrated that for certain crystal field\nsplittings the higher energy orbitals instead of the lower ones are relevant\nfor superconductivity, and that $T_c$ can be enhanced by the crystal field\neffect. We comment on the implications of our results for the superconductivity\nin strontium ruthenates, and for the recently reported light-enhanced\nsuperconducting state in alkali-doped fullerides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2016 06:58:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

Caching popular videos in the\nstorage of small-cell base stations (SBS), namely, small-cell caching, is an\nefficient technology for reducing the transmission latency whilst mitigating\nthe redundant transmissions of popular videos over back-haul channels. In this\npaper, we consider a commercialized small-cell caching system consisting of a\nnetwork service provider (NSP), several video retailers (VR), and mobile users\n(MU). The NSP leases its SBSs to the VRs for the purpose of making profits, and\nthe VRs, after storing popular videos in the rented SBSs, can provide faster\nlocal video transmissions to the MUs, thereby gaining more profits. We conceive\nthis system within the framework of Stackelberg game by treating the SBSs as a\nspecific type of resources. We first model the MUs and SBSs as two independent\nPoisson point processes, and develop, via stochastic geometry theory, the\nprobability of the specific event that an MU obtains the video of its choice\ndirectly from the memory of an SBS. Then, based on the probability derived, we\nformulate a Stackelberg game to jointly maximize the average profit of both the\nNSP and the VRs. Also, we investigate the Stackelberg equilibrium by solving a\nnon-convex optimization problem. With the aid of this game theoretic framework,\nwe shed light on the relationship between four important factors: the optimal\npricing of leasing an SBS, the SBSs allocation among the VRs, the storage size\nof the SBSs, and the popularity distribution of the VRs. Monte-Carlo\nsimulations show that our stochastic geometry-based analytical results closely\nmatch the empirical ones. Numerical results are also provided for quantifying\nthe proposed game-theoretic framework by showing its efficiency on pricing and\nresource allocation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2016 07:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

For infinite number of states, several\nnatural classes of distinguishability can be defined. We give a necessary and\nsufficient condition for a system of pure states to be distinguishable.

Kesari and\ncoworkers have later shown some very elegant convenient asymptotic expansion of\nGuduru's solution. This enhancement is very high and indeed, using Kesari's\nsolution, it is here shown to depend uniquely on a Johnson parameter for\nadhesion of a sinusoidal contact. However, counterintuitively, it leads to\nunbounded enhancement for conditions of large roughness for which Johnson\nparameter is very low. Guduru postulated that this enhancement should occur\nafter sufficiently large pressure has been applied to any spherical contact.\nAlso, that although the enhancement is limited to the JKR regime of large soft\nmaterials with high adhesion, the DMT limit for the smooth sphere is found\notherwise. However, for hard materials, even the DMT limit for the smooth\nsolids is very hard to observe, which suggest that also adhesion reduction is\nyet not well understood.\n  The limitations of the assumption of simply connected area is here further\ndiscussed, and a well known model for hard particles in contact with rough\nplanes due to Rumpf is used to show that in the range where unbounded increase\nis predicted, orders of magnitude reduction is instead expected for rigid\nsolids.

What is more seldom is\nfor disorder to reappear at lower temperature, which is known as reentrant\nbehavior. Such resurgence of disorder has been observed in a variety of\nsystems, ranging from Rochelle salts to nematic phases in liquid crystals.\nFrustration is often a key ingredient for reentrance mechanisms. Here we shall\nstudy a frustrated model, namely the anisotropic shuriken lattice, which offers\na natural setting to explore an extension of the notion of reentrance between\nmagnetic disordered phases. By tuning the anisotropy of the lattice, we open a\nwindow in the phase diagram where magnetic disorder prevails down to zero\ntemperature. In this region, the competition between multiple disordered ground\nstates gives rise to a double crossover where both the low- and\nhigh-temperature regimes are less correlated than the intervening classical\nspin liquid. This reentrance of disorder is characterized by an entropy\nplateau, a multi-step Curie law crossover and a rather complex diffuse\nscattering in the static structure factor. Those results are confirmed by\ncomplementary numerical and analytical methods: Monte Carlo simulations,\nHusimi-tree calculations and an exact decoration-iteration transformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2016 11:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

When considering the task it is taken into account\nthat double-stranded DNA is a polymorphic macromolecule with a set of\nmetastable states. Accordingly to proposed mechanism, DNA threshold elongation\ncan take place as a cooperative structural transition of macromolecule to\nmetastable form, which is stabilized by the external force. For the description\nof DNA overstretching, the model included external (stretching) and internal\n(conformation) displacement components is constructed. As assumed, both\ncomponents are coupled on the pathway of double helix transformations. It is\nshown, that under force action DNA deformation proceeds in two stages. First\none is the restructuring of the double helix, which leads to formation of\nconformational bistability in DNA macromolecule. On the second stage, the\nconformational transition and the deformation induced by it consistently cover\nthe macromolecule as a threshold process. The comparison of calculated\ncharacteristics of DNA overstretching process with experimental data shows good\nagreement. Analysis of the results obtained, together with the available\nliterature data allow to conclude, that overstretching transition in the double\nhelix is dynamical process and can spread in DNA chain. In the same time, in\nDNA with A$\\cdot$T-rich content due to large dissipation the overstretching\nprocess leads to force induced melting transition, and should have nearly\nstatic character.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2016 12:58:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-22"}

In this paper we endeavor to study\ncharge-changing transitions for 24 isotopes of chromium ($^{42-65}$Cr). These\ninclude neutron-rich and neutron-deficient isotopes of chromium. Three\ndifferent models from the QRPA genre, namely the pn-QRPA, the Pyatov method\n(PM) and the Schematic model (SM), were selected to calculate and study the\nGamow-Teller (GT) transitions in chromium isotopes. The SM was employed\nseparately in the particle-particle ($pp$) and $pp$ + particle-hole ($ph$)\nchannels. To study the effect of deformation, the SM was first used assuming\nthe nuclei to be spherical and later to be deformed. The PM was used both in\n$pp$ and $pp$ + $ph$ channels but only for the case of spherical nuclei. The\npn-QRPA calculation was done by considering both $pp$ and $ph$ forces and\ntaking deformation of nucleus into consideration. A recent study proved this\nversion of pn-QRPA to be the best for calculation of GT strength distributions\namongst the QRPA models. The pn-QRPA model calculated GT distributions had\nlow-lying centroids and small widths as compared to other QRPA models.

Such network attractors can display a\nhigh degree of sensitivity to noise both in terms of the regions of phase space\nvisited and in terms of the sequence of transitions around the network. The two\ntypes of network are intimately related---one can directly bifurcate to the\nother.\n  In this paper we attempt to quantify the effect of additive noise on such\nnetwork attractors. Noise increases the average rate at which the networks are\nexplored, and can result in \"macroscopic\" random motion around the network. We\nperform an asymptotic analysis of local behaviour of an escape model near\nheteroclinic/excitable nodes in the limit of noise $\\eta\\rightarrow 0^+$ as a\nmodel for the mean residence time $T$ near equilibria.\n  We also explore transition probabilities between nodes of the network in the\npresence of anisotropic noise. For low levels of noise, numerical results\nsuggest that a (heteroclinic or excitable) network can approximately realise\nany set of transition probabilities and any sufficiently large mean residence\ntimes at the given nodes. We show that this can be well modelled in our example\nnetwork by multiple independent escape processes, where the direction of first\nescape determines the transition. This suggests that it is feasible to design\nnoisy network attractors with arbitrary Markov transition probabilities and\nresidence times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2016 13:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-24"}

A solution for this\nproblem is a schedule that delivers (some of the) packets to their destinations\nwithout violating the capacity constraints of the network (buffers or edges).\nOur goal is to design an efficient algorithm that computes a schedule that\nmaximizes the number of packets that arrive to their respective destinations.\n  We give a randomized approximation algorithm with constant approximation\nratio for the case where $B=\\Theta(c)$.

The W3 giant molecular\ncloud complex at the western border of the W4 super bubble is thought to be\ninfluenced by the stellar winds of the massive stars in W4. AFGL333 is a ~10^4\nMsun cloud within W3. This paper presents a study of the star formation\nactivity within AFGL333 using deep JHKs photometry obtained from the NOAO\nExtremely Wide-Field Infrared Imager combined with Spitzer-IRAC-MIPS\nphotometry. Based on the infrared excess, we identify 812 candidate young\nstellar objects in the complex, of which 99 are classified as Class I and 713\nare classified as Class II sources. The stellar density analysis of young\nstellar objects reveals three major stellar aggregates within AFGL333, named\nhere AFGL333-main, AFGL333-NW1 and AFGL333-NW2. The disk fraction within\nAFGL333 is estimated to be ~50-60%. We use the extinction map made from the\nH-Ks colors of the background stars to understand the cloud structure and to\nestimate the cloud mass. The CO-derived extinction map corroborates the cloud\nstructure and mass estimates from NIR color method. From the stellar mass and\ncloud mass associated with AFGL333, we infer that the region is currently\nforming stars with an efficiency of ~4.5% and at a rate of ~2 - 3 Msun\nMyr-1pc-2. In general, the star formation activity within AFGL333 is comparable\nto that of nearby low mass star-forming regions.

Firstly, in earlier work, I had shown how to\nconstruct the four-dimensional exceptional root systems from the 3D root\nsystems using Clifford techniques, by constructing them in the 4D even\nsubalgebra of the 3D Clifford algebra; for instance the icosahedral root system\n$H_3$ gives rise to the largest (and therefore exceptional)\nnon-crystallographic root system $H_4$. Arnold's trinities and the McKay\ncorrespondence then hint that there might be an indirect connection between the\nicosahedron and $E_8$. Secondly, in a related construction, I have now made\nthis connection explicit for the first time: in the 8D Clifford algebra of 3D\nspace the $120$ elements of the icosahedral group $H_3$ are doubly covered by\n$240$ 8-component objects, which endowed with a `reduced inner product' are\nexactly the $E_8$ root system. It was previously known that $E_8$ splits into\n$H_4$-invariant subspaces, and we discuss the folding construction relating the\ntwo pictures. This folding is a partial version of the one used for the\nconstruction of the Coxeter plane, so thirdly we discuss the geometry of the\nCoxeter plane in a Clifford algebra framework. We advocate the complete\nfactorisation of the Coxeter versor in the Clifford algebra into exponentials\nof bivectors describing rotations in orthogonal planes with the rotation angle\ngiving the correct exponents, which gives much more geometric insight than the\nusual approach of complexification and search for complex eigenvalues. In\nparticular, we explicitly find these factorisations for the 2D, 3D and 4D root\nsystems, $D_6$ as well as $E_8$, whose Coxeter versor factorises as\n$W=\\exp(\\frac{\\pi}{30}B_C)\\exp(\\frac{11\\pi}{30}B_2)\\exp(\\frac{7\\pi}{30}B_3)\\exp(\\frac{13\\pi}{30}B_4)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 23:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

The\nanalytic solutions for all these distributions predict the network evolution\nfor systems as small as 100 nodes. The analytic method we developed is\napplicable for other classes of networks, representing a powerful tool to\ninvestigate the evolution of natural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 16:43:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}
