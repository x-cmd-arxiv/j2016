We use 13CO(1-0)\nand C18O(1-0) emission to correct for the 12CO(1-0) optical depth to accurately\nestimate the outflow mass, momentum and kinetic energy. This correction\nincreases the estimates of the mass, momentum and kinetic energy by factors of\nabout 9, 5 and 2, respectively, with respect to estimates assuming optically\nthin emission.

Adding with the slower material traced only by\n13CO and C18O, there is another factor of 3 increase in the mass estimate and\n50% increase in the momentum estimate. The estimated outflow properties\nindicate that the outflow is capable of dispersing the parent core within the\ntypical lifetime of the embedded phase of a low-mass protostar, and that it is\nresponsible for a core-to-star efficiency of 1/4 to 1/3.

Because of its optimal properties, one of the\nmost popular and widely-used detection technique is the matched filter (MF).\nThis is a linear filter designed to maximise the detectability of a signal of\nknown structure that is buried in additive Gaussian random noise. In this work\nwe show that in the very common situation where the number and position of the\nsearched signals within a data sequence (e.g. an emission line in a spectrum)\nor an image (e.g. a point-source in an interferometric map) are unknown, this\ntechnique, when applied in its standard form, may severely underestimate the\nprobability of false detection. This is because the correct use of the MF\nrelies upon a-priori knowledge of the position of the signal of interest. In\nthe absence of this information, the statistical significance of features that\nare actually noise is overestimated and detections claimed that are actually\nspurious. For this reason, we present an alternative method of computing the\nprobability of false detection that is based on the probability density\nfunction (PDF) of the peaks of a random field. It is able to provide a correct\nestimate of the probability of false detection for the one-, two- and\nthree-dimensional case.

A more\nexotic arena for testing general relativity is in systems that contain one or\nmore black holes. Black holes are the most compact objects in the universe,\nproviding probes of the strongest-possible gravitational fields. We are\nmotivated to study strong-field gravity since many theories give large\ndeviations from general relativity only at large field strengths, while\nrecovering the weak-field behavior. In this article, we review how one can\nprobe general relativity and various alternative theories of gravity by using\nelectromagnetic waves from a black hole with an accretion disk, and\ngravitational waves from black hole binaries. We first review model-independent\nways of testing gravity with electromagnetic/gravitational waves from a black\nhole system. We then focus on selected examples of theories that extend general\nrelativity in rather simple ways. Some important characteristics of general\nrelativity include (but are not limited to) (i) only tensor gravitational\ndegrees of freedom, (ii) the graviton is massless, (iii) no quadratic or higher\ncurvatures in the action, and (iv) the theory is 4 dimensional. Altering a\ncharacteristic leads to a different extension of general relativity: (i)\nscalar-tensor theories, (ii) massive gravity theories, (iii) quadratic gravity,\nand (iv) theories with large extra dimensions. Within each theory, we describe\nblack hole solutions, their properties, and current and projected constraints\non each theory using black hole-based tests of gravity.

Indeed, they may consistently be excluded from the asymptotic\nobservable states of the theory making use of the Lee-Wick and Cutkoski,\nLandshoff, Olive and Polkinghorne prescription for the construction of a\nunitary S-matrix. Therefore, the spectrum consists on the graviton and short\nlived elementary unstable particles that we named \"anti-gravitons\" because of\ntheir repulsive contribution to the gravitational potential at short distance.\nHowever, another interpretation of the complex conjugate pairs is proposed\nbased on the Calmet's suggestion, i.e. they could be understood as black hole\nprecursors long established in the classical theory.

We study the effect of catch bonding on unidirectional\ntransport properties of cellular cargo carried by multiple dynein motors within\nthe framework of this model.

Expanding upon our previous work (Rodriguez et al., 2015), we\nstudy merging binary black holes formed in globular clusters using our Monte\nCarlo approach to stellar dynamics. We have created a new set of 52 cluster\nmodels with different masses, metallicities, and radii to fully characterize\nthe binary black hole merger rate. These models include all the relevant\ndynamical processes (such as two-body relaxation, strong encounters, and\nthree-body binary formation) and agree well with detailed direct N-body\nsimulations. In addition, we have enhanced our stellar evolution algorithms\nwith updated metallicity-dependent stellar wind and supernova prescriptions,\nallowing us to compare our results directly to the most recent population\nsynthesis predictions for merger rates from isolated binary evolution. We\nexplore the relationship between a cluster's global properties and the\npopulation of binary black holes that it produces. In particular, we derive a\nnumerically calibrated relationship between the merger times of ejected black\nhole binaries and a cluster's mass and radius.

The conjugacy problem (the question whether two given words\nrepresent conjugate group elements) is more complicated; still decidability has\nbeen established by Anshel and Stebe for ordinary Baumslag-Solitar groups and\nfor generalized Baumslag-Solitar groups independently by Lockhart and Beeker.\nHowever, up to now no precise complexity estimates have been given.\n  In this work, we give a LOGSPACE algorithm for both problems.

Using these estimates of the initial\nparameters of the binary, the mass and spin of the final black hole can be\nuniquely predicted making use of general-relativistic numerical simulations.

The presence of such irregularities makes the modeling\nand prediction of polar field reversals extremely hard if possible. In a\nclassical model of solar activity cycle, the unipolar magnetic regions (UMRs)\nof predominantly following polarity fields are transported polewards due to\nmeridional flows and diffusion. The UMRs gradually cancel out the polar\nmagnetic field of the previous cycle, and re-build the polar field of opposite\npolarity setting the stage for the next cycle. We show, however, that this\ndeterministic picture can be easily altered by the developing of a strong\ncenter of activity, or by the emergence of an extremely large active region, or\nby a \"strategically placed\" coronal hole. We demonstrate that the activity\noccurring during the current cycle 24 may be the result of this randomness in\nthe evolution of the solar surface magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 04:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-09"}

The dark sector interacts with\nordinary matter via gravity and photon-dark photon kinetic mixing. Mirror dark\nmatter is a theoretically constrained special case where all parameters are\nfixed except for the kinetic mixing strength, $\\epsilon$. In these models, the\ndark matter halo around spiral and irregular galaxies takes the form of a\ndissipative plasma which evolves in response to various heating and cooling\nprocesses. It has been argued previously that such dynamics can account for the\ninferred cored density profiles of galaxies and other related structural\nfeatures. Here we focus on the apparent deficit of nearby small galaxies\n(\"missing satellite problem\"), which these dissipative models have the\npotential to address through small-scale power suppression by acoustic and\ndiffusion damping. Using a variant of the extended Press-Schechter formalism,\nwe evaluate the halo mass function for the special case of mirror dark matter.\nConsidering a simplified model where $M_{\\text{baryons}} \\propto\nM_{\\text{halo}}$, we relate the halo mass function to more directly observable\nquantities, and find that for $\\epsilon/10^{-10} \\approx 2$ such a simplified\ndescription is compatible with the measured galaxy luminosity and velocity\nfunctions. On scales $M_{\\text{halo}} \\lesssim 10^8 \\ M_\\odot$, diffusion\ndamping exponentially suppresses the halo mass function, suggesting a\nnonprimordial origin for dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies, which we\nspeculate were formed via a top-down fragmentation process as the result of\nnonlinear dissipative collapse of larger density perturbation.

While essential\nprogress has been achieved in both measurements and modeling of the cosmogenic\nproxy, uncertainties still remain in the determination of the geomagnetic\ndipole moment evolution. Here we improve the reconstruction of solar activity\nover the past nine millennia using a multi-proxy approach. We used records of\nthe 14C and 10Be cosmogenic isotopes, current numerical models of the isotope\nproduction and transport in Earth's atmosphere, and available geomagnetic field\nreconstructions, including a new reconstruction relying on an updated\narcheo-/paleointensity database. The obtained series were analyzed using the\nsingular spectrum analysis (SSA) method to study the millennial-scale trends. A\nnew reconstruction of the geomagnetic dipole field moment, GMAG.9k, is built\nfor the last nine millennia. New reconstructions of solar activity covering the\nlast nine millennia, quantified in sunspot numbers, are presented and analyzed.\nA conservative list of grand minima and maxima is provided. The primary\ncomponents of the reconstructed solar activity, as determined using the SSA\nmethod, are different for the series based on 14C and 10Be. These primary\ncomponents can only be ascribed to long-term changes in the terrestrial system\nand not to the Sun. They have been removed from the reconstructed series. In\ncontrast, the secondary SSA components of the reconstructed solar activity are\nfound to be dominated by a common ~2400-yr quasi-periodicity, the so-called\nHallstatt cycle, in both the 14C and 10Be based series. This Hallstatt cycle\nthus appears to be related to solar activity. Finally, we show that the grand\nminima and maxima occurred intermittently over the studied period, with\nclustering near highs and lows of the Hallstatt cycle, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 07:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-07"}

The large scale dust\nemission of both hubs consists of a single peaked clump elongated in the\ndirection of the associated filament. At small scales, the SMA images reveal\nthat both hubs fragment into several dust condensations. The fragmentation\nlevel was assessed under the same conditions and we found that hub-N presents 4\nfragments while hub-S is more fragmented, with 13 fragments identified. We\nstudied the density structure by means of a simultaneous fit of the radial\nintensity profile at 870 and 350 microns and the spectral energy distribution\nadopting a Plummer-like function to describe the density structure. The\nparameters inferred from the model are remarkably similar in both hubs,\nsuggesting that density structure could not be responsible in determining the\nfragmentation level. We estimated several physical parameters such as the level\nof turbulence and the magnetic field strength, and we found no significant\ndifferences between these hubs. The Jeans analysis indicates that the observed\nfragmentation is more consistent with thermal Jeans fragmentation compared with\na scenario that turbulent support is included. The lower fragmentation level\nobserved in hub-N could be explained in terms of stronger UV radiation effects\nfrom a nearby HII region, evolutionary effects, and/or stronger magnetic fields\nat small scales, a scenario that should be further investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 09:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The other coupling is locally\nof the pure-dephasing type and requires to go beyond the standard weak-coupling\nlimit by employing a Bogoliubov mapping in the corresponding reservoir. After\nthe mapping, the large spin is coupled to a collective mode with the original\npure-dephasing interaction, but the collective mode is dissipatively coupled to\nthe residual oscillators. Treating the large spin and the collective mode as\nthe system, a standard master equation approach is now able to capture the\nenergy transfer between the two reservoirs. Assuming fast relaxation of the\ncollective mode, we derive a coarse-grained rate equation for the large spin\nonly and discuss how the original Dicke superradiance is affected by the\npresence of the additional reservoir.

This\nbehaviour was experimentally evidenced through a quasi-1D tightly trapping\nultracold ${}^{173}$Yb atoms in the recent paper [Nature Physics 10, 198\n(2014)]. However, understanding of low temperature behaviour of the Fermi gases\nwith a repulsive interaction acquires spin-charge separated conformal field\ntheories of an effective Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid and an antiferromagnetic\n$SU(w)$ Heisenberg spin chain. Here we analytically derive universal\nthermodynamics of 1D strongly repulsive fermionic gases with $SU(w)$ symmetry\nvia the Yang-Yang thermodynamic Bethe ansatz method. The analytical free energy\nand magnetic properties of the systems at low temperatures in a weak magnetic\nfield are obtained through the Wiener-Hopf method. In particular, the free\nenergy essentially manifests the spin-charge separated conformal field theories\nfor the high symmetry systems with arbitrary repulsive interaction strength. We\nalso find that the sound velocity of the Fermi gases in the large $w$ limit\ncoincides with that for the spinless Bose gas, whereas the spin velocity\nvanishes quickly as $w$ becomes large. This indicates a strong suppression of\nthe Fermi exclusion statistics by the commutativity feature among the\n$w$-component fermions with different spin states in the Tomonaga-Luttinger\nliquid phase. Moreover, the equations of state and critical behaviour of\nphysical quantities at finite temperatures are analytically derived in terms of\nthe polylogarithm functions in the quantum critical region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 09:40:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2016 03:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-29"}

Conversely, the understanding of their time evolution is\nmore complex, since it requires analysis of stellar populations with different\nages, or systematic studies of galaxies at different redshifts. In the Local\nUniverse, Hii regions and planetary nebulae (PNe) are important tools to\ninvestigate it. We present an in-depth study of all nearby spiral galaxies\n(M33, M31, NGC300, and M81) with direct-method nebular abundances of both\npopulations. For the first time, we also evaluate the radial migration of PN\npopulations. We analyse Hii region and PN properties to: determine whether\noxygen in PNe is a reliable tracer for past interstellar medium (ISM)\ncomposition; homogenise the published datasets; estimate the migration of the\noldest stellar populations; determine the overall chemical enrichment and slope\nevolution. We confirm that oxygen in PNe is a reliable tracer for the past ISM\nmetallicity. We find that PN gradients are flatter than or equal to those of\nHii regions. When radial motions are negligible, this result provides a direct\nmeasurement of the time evolution of the gradient. For galaxies with dominant\nradial motions, we provide upper limits on the gradient evolution. Finally, the\ntotal metal content increases with time in all target galaxies, with early\nmorphological type having a larger increment Delta(O/H) than late-type\ngalaxies. Our findings provide important constraints to discriminate among\ndifferent galactic evolutionary scenarios, favouring cosmological models with\nenhanced feedback from supernovae.

In 3D, helicity, the integral of the\nscalar product of velocity and vorticity, is also an inviscid flow invariant\nalong with kinetic energy. Unlike enstrophy, however, helicity does not block\nthe cascade of energy to small scales. Energy and helicity are not only\nglobally conserved but also conserved within each non-linear triadic\ninteraction between three plane waves in the spectral form of the\nNavier--Stokes equation (NSE). By decomposing each plane wave into two helical\nmodes of opposite helicities each triadic interaction is split into a set of\neight triadic interactions between helical modes (Waleffe 1992).

An attractive approach for\ndown-scaling the problem size is to first partition the dataset into subsets\nand then fit using distributed algorithms. The dataset can be partitioned\neither horizontally (in the sample space) or vertically (in the feature space).\nWhile the majority of the literature focuses on sample space partitioning,\nfeature space partitioning is more effective when $p\\gg n$. Existing methods\nfor partitioning features, however, are either vulnerable to high correlations\nor inefficient in reducing the model dimension. In this paper, we solve these\nproblems through a new embarrassingly parallel framework named DECO for\ndistributed variable selection and parameter estimation. In DECO, variables are\nfirst partitioned and allocated to $m$ distributed workers. The decorrelated\nsubset data within each worker are then fitted via any algorithm designed for\nhigh-dimensional problems. We show that by incorporating the decorrelation\nstep, DECO can achieve consistent variable selection and parameter estimation\non each subset with (almost) no assumptions. In addition, the convergence rate\nis nearly minimax optimal for both sparse and weakly sparse models and does NOT\ndepend on the partition number $m$. Extensive numerical experiments are\nprovided to illustrate the performance of the new framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 14:17:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 13:18:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-15"}

We measure\na significant correlation (>5\\sigma) between the host-galaxy stellar-mass and\nthe SN~Ia Hubble Residuals (HR). We find a weak correlation (1.4\\sigma) between\nthe host-galaxy metallicity as measured from emission lines in the spectra, and\nthe SN~Ia HR.

Later on,\nthe author extended the theory for maps from $K$ to $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The main\ngoal of this paper is to generalize the relevant results for topological and\npacking dimensions.\n  Let $K$ be a compact metric space and let us denote by $C(K,\\mathbb{R}^n)$\nthe set of continuous maps from $K$ to $\\mathbb{R}^n$ endowed with the maximum\nnorm. Let $\\dim_{*}$ be one of the topological dimension $\\dim_T$, the\nHausdorff dimension $\\dim_H$, or the packing dimension $\\dim_P$. Define\n$$d_{*}^n(K)=\\inf\\{\\dim_{*}(K\\setminus F): F\\subset K \\textrm{ is\n$\\sigma$-compact with } \\dim_T F<n\\}.$$ We prove that $d^n_{*}(K)$ is the right\nnotion to describe the dimensions of the fibers of a generic continuous map\n$f\\in C(K,\\mathbb{R}^n)$.

For each user, the packet consists of the user's signature,\nas well as the data that the user wants to communicate. As long as no more than\nK users collide, their identities can be recovered from the sum of their\nsignatures.

Robust switching of perpendicular CoFeB nanopillars in a\ndipole-coupled composite stack is experimentally demonstrated in the absence of\nany external magnetic field, in consistent with the results of micromagnetic\nsimulation.

Compared with other proposed methods for\nexternal-field-free spin Hall switching of perpendicular magnetization, the\ndipole-coupled composite structure is compatible with a wide range of spin Hall\nsystems and perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions, paving the way towards\npractical SHE-based MRAM and logic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 15:26:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 03:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

It lies at the root of all modern digital\ntechnologies and offers unparalleled correspondence between prediction and\nexperiments. Remarkably, however, after more than 100 years it is still unclear\nwhat quantum mechanics means in terms of basic philosophical questions about\nthe nature of reality. While there are many interpretations of the mathematical\nmachinery of quantum physics, there remains no experimental means to\ndistinguish between most of them.\n  In this contribution, (based on a discussion at the NYAS), I wish to consider\nthe ways in which the enduring lack of an agreed upon interpretation of quantum\nphysics influences a number of critical philosophical debates about physics and\nreality. I briefly review two problems effected by quantum interpretations: the\nmeaning of the term 'Universe' and the nature of consciousness. In what follows\nI am explicitly not advocating for any particular quantum interpretation.\nInstead, I am interested in how the explicit inability of modern physics to\nexperimentally distinguish between interpretations with wildly divergent\nontological/epistemological implications plays into discussions of physics and\nits description of the world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2016 20:37:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-25"}

The Received Signal Strength Indicator\n(RSSI) values of the anchor node beacons are used. The number of anchor nodes\nand their configurations has an impact on the accuracy of the localization\nsystem, which is also addressed in this paper. Five different training\nalgorithms are evaluated to find the training algorithm that gives the best\nresult. The multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network model was trained using\nMatlab. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in real\ntime, the model obtained was then implemented on the Arduino microcontroller.\nWith four anchor nodes, an average 2D localization error of 0.2953 m has been\nachieved with a 12-12-2 neural network structure. The proposed method can also\nbe implemented on any other embedded microcontroller system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2016 19:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-17"}
