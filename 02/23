We have previously\ncalculated the steady state distributions resulting from uniform absorption of\nmonochromatic sub gap and above gap frequency radiation by thin films. In this\nwork, we use the same methods to calculate the effect of illumination by\nbroadband sources, such as thermal radiation from astrophysical phenomena or\nfrom the readout system. Absorption of photons at multiple above gap\nfrequencies is shown to not change the structure of the quasiparticle energy\ndistribution close to the superconducting gap. Hence for typical absorbed\npowers, we find the effects of absorption of broadband pair breaking radiation\ncan simply be considered as the sum of the effects of absorption of many\nmonochromatic sources. Distribution averaged quantities, like quasiparticle\ngeneration effciency $\\eta$, match exactly a weighted average over the\nbandwidth of the source of calculations assuming a monochromatic source. For\nsub gap frequencies, however, distributing the absorbed power across multiple\nfrequencies does change the low energy quasiparticle distribution. For moderate\nand high absorbed powers, this results in a significantly larger $\\eta$ - a\nhigher number of excess quasiparticles for a broadband source compared to a\nmonochromatic source of equal total absorbed power. Typically in KIDs the\nmicrowave power absorbed has a very narrow bandwidth, but in devices with broad\nresonance characteristics (low quality factors), this increase in $\\eta$ may be\nmeasurable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 17:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The standard phenomenological formula for the\ndissipation rate significantly overestimates the rate derived from our RMHD\nsimulations, and a revised formula is proposed. In the second model we\nintroduce additional density variations along the flux tube with a correlation\nlength of 0.04 $R_\\odot$ and with relative amplitude of $10 \\%$. These density\nvariations simulate the effects of compressive MHD waves on the Alfv\\'{e}n\nwaves.

Typically, the\nmain signature of the Coulomb dominated regime is the lack of interference of\nthe outer most edge channel as the magnetic field is varied. This seemingly\nsurprising behavior is explained by the shrinkage of the interference area with\nincreasing magnetic field, thus keeping the number of electrons and the\nenclosed flux constant. The model further stipulates, but with no experimental\nevidence thus far, that once the area shrinks by a size corresponding to an\nentire flux-quantum, it abruptly inflates to its original size leading to an\nunobservable 2{\\pi} phase jump. Here we report on the observation of such area\nbreathing by performing a partial screening of the Coulomb interactions. The\nnovelty is that the variation of the phase induced by the external knobs is not\nfully cancelled by the area response.

However, the number of synthetic spectra\nneeded for a rectilinear grid grows exponentially with the label space\ndimensions, precluding the simultaneous and self-consistent fitting of more\nthan a few elemental abundances. Shortcuts such as fitting subsets of labels\nseparately can introduce unknown systematics and do not produce correct error\ncovariances in the derived labels. In this paper we present a new approach --\nCHAT (Convex Hull Adaptive Tessellation) -- which includes several new ideas\nfor inexpensively generating a sufficient stellar synthetic library, using\nlinear algebra and the concept of an adaptive, data-driven grid. A convex hull\napproximates the region where the data lie in the label space. A variety of\ntests with mock datasets demonstrate that CHAT can reduce the number of\nrequired synthetic model calculations by three orders of magnitude in an 8D\nlabel space. The reduction will be even larger for higher-dimensional label\nspaces. In CHAT the computational effort increases only linearly with the\nnumber of labels that are fit simultaneously. Around each of these grid points\nin label space an approximate synthetic spectrum can be generated through\nlinear expansion using a set of \"gradient spectra\" that represent flux\nderivatives at every wavelength point with respect to all labels. These\ntechniques provide new opportunities to fit the full stellar spectra from large\nsurveys with 15-30 labels simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 21:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 May 2016 20:32:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-26"}

We found that in the case of type 1 AGNs the torus\nanisotropy makes $L_{\\text{torus}}/L_{\\text{AGN}}$ underestimate low covering\nfactors and overestimate high covering factors. In type 2 AGNs\n$L_{\\text{torus}}/L_{\\text{AGN}}$ always underestimates covering factors. Our\nresults provide a novel easy-to-use method to account for anisotropy and obtain\ncorrect covering factors. Using two samples from the literature, we\ndemonstrated the importance of our result for inferring the obscured AGN\nfraction. We found that after the anisotropy is properly accounted for, the\ndust covering factors show very weak dependence on $L_{\\text{AGN}}$, with\nvalues in the range of $\\approx0.6-0.7$. Our results also suggest a higher\nfraction of obscured AGNs at high luminosities than those found by X-ray\nsurveys, in part owing to the presence of a Compton-thick AGN population\npredicted by population synthesis models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 21:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 00:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-13"}

An outstanding problem\nwith the existing migration models is that they invariably predict excessively\nlarge resonant populations, while observations show that the non-resonant\norbits are in fact common (e.g., the main belt population is 2-4 times larger\nthan Plutinos in the 3:2 resonance). Here we show that this problem can\nresolved if it is assumed that Neptune's migration was grainy, as expected from\nscattering encounters of Neptune with massive planetesimals. The grainy\nmigration acts to destabilize resonant bodies with large libration amplitudes,\na fraction of which ends up on stable non-resonant orbits. Thus, the\nnon-resonant--to--resonant ratio obtained with the grainy migration is higher,\nup to ~10 times higher for the range of parameters investigated here, than in a\nmodel with smooth migration. The grainy migration leads to a narrower\ndistribution of the libration amplitudes in the 3:2 resonance. The best fit to\nobservations is obtained when it is assumed that the outer planetesimal disk\nbelow 30 AU contained 1000-4000 Plutos, or ~1000 bodies twice as massive as\nPluto. We find that the probability for an outer disk object to end up on a\nstable orbit in the Kuiper belt is ~10^{-3}. Together, these results are\nconsistent with having only two (known) Pluto-mass bodies in the Kuiper belt\ntoday (Pluto and Eris).

Recent\nexperimental investigations of small model boats propelled by propagating\nflexural waves carried out by the present author and his co-workers\ndemonstrated viability of this type of propulsion as an alternative to a\nwell-known screw propeller. In the attempts of theoretical explanation of the\nobtained experimental results using the theory of Lighthill for fish\nlocomotion, it was found that this theory predicts zero thrust for such model\nboats, which is in contradiction with the results of the experiments. One\nshould note in this connection that the theory developed by Lighthill assumes\nthat the amplitudes of propulsive waves created by fish body motion grow from\nzero on the front (at fish heads) to their maximum values at the tails. This is\nconsistent with fish body motion in nature, but is not compatible with the\nbehaviour of localised flexural waves used for propulsion in the experimental\nmodel vessels. To overcome the problem of predicting zero thrust for the above\nvessels, it is suggested in the present work that nonlinear distortion of\nlocalised flexural waves may be responsible for generation of thrust. This\nhypothesis is explored in the present work by adding nonlinear harmonics of\npropulsive flexural waves to the formula derived by Lighthill for generated\nthrust. For simplicity, only the lowest (third) harmonic growing linearly with\nthe distance of propagation was used. The resulting formula for the averaged\nthrust shows that, due to the effect of the third harmonic, the thrust is no\nlonger zero, thereby demonstrating that nonlinear distortion of the propulsive\nflexural waves may be paramount for the existence of wave-like aquatic\npropulsion of small marine craft using freely propagating flexural waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 00:18:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

In order to estimate the frequency of these\nvaluable systems, it is essential to account for the unique geometric\nprobabilities of detecting multiple transiting extrasolar planets around the\nsame parent star. In order to improve on previous studies that used numerical\nmethods, we have constructed an efficient, semi-analytical algorithm called\nCORBITS which, given a collection of conjectured exoplanets orbiting a star,\ncomputes the probability that any particular group of exoplanets can be\nobserved to transit. The algorithm applies theorems of elementary differential\ngeometry to compute the areas bounded by circular curves on the surface of a\nsphere (see Ragozzine & Holman 2010). The implemented algorithm is more\naccurate and orders of magnitude faster than previous algorithms, based on\ncomparisons with Monte Carlo simulations. We use CORBITS to show that the\npresent solar system would only show a maximum of 3 transiting planets, but\nthat this varies over time due to dynamical evolution. We also used CORBITS to\ngeometrically debias the period ratio and mutual Hill sphere distributions of\nKepler's multi-transiting planet candidates, which results in shifting these\ndistributions towards slightly larger values. In an Appendix, we present\nadditional semi-analytical methods for determining the frequency of exoplanet\nmutual events, i.e., the geometric probability that two planets will transit\neach other (Planet-Planet Occultation, relevant to transiting circumbinary\nplanets) and the probability that this transit occurs simultaneously as they\ntransit their star.

The taxonomy of sparse representation\nmethods can be studied from various viewpoints. For example, in terms of\ndifferent norm minimizations used in sparsity constraints, the methods can be\nroughly categorized into five groups: sparse representation with $l_0$-norm\nminimization, sparse representation with $l_p$-norm (0$<$p$<$1) minimization,\nsparse representation with $l_1$-norm minimization and sparse representation\nwith $l_{2,1}$-norm minimization. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of\nsparse representation is provided. The available sparse representation\nalgorithms can also be empirically categorized into four groups: greedy\nstrategy approximation, constrained optimization, proximity algorithm-based\noptimization, and homotopy algorithm-based sparse representation. The\nrationales of different algorithms in each category are analyzed and a wide\nrange of sparse representation applications are summarized, which could\nsufficiently reveal the potential nature of the sparse representation theory.\nSpecifically, an experimentally comparative study of these sparse\nrepresentation algorithms was presented.

In this paper, we study these kinds of decays in the\nframework of QCD factorization, by adopting two different schemes: scheme I is\nsimilar to the method usually adopted in the QCD factorization approach, while\nscheme II is based on the infrared behavior of gluon propagator and running\ncoupling. For comparison, in our calculation, we adopt three kinds of wave\nfunctions for $B_{c}$ meson.

(b) In scheme II, by assigning a dynamical\ngluon mass to the gluon propagator, we can avoid enhancements of the\ncontribution from soft endpoint region. The strength of annihilation\ncontributions predicted in scheme II is enhanced compared to that obtained in\nscheme I. However, the predicted branching ratios are still smaller than the\ncorresponding ones obtained in the perturbative QCD approach. The large\ndiscrepancies among these theoretical predictions indicate that more detailed\nstudies of these decays are urgently needed and will be tested by the future\nmeasurements performed at the LHCb experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 03:58:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

In the present paper, we develop a numerical framework for\ncomputing approximations to stationary solutions of general evolution\nequations, which can also be used to produce existence and stability regions\nfor steady states. In particular, we use the Trotter-Kato Theorem to\napproximate the infinitesimal generator of an evolution equation on a finite\ndimensional space, which in turn reduces the evolution equation into a system\nof ordinary differential equations. Consequently, we approximate and study the\nasymptotic behavior of stationary solutions.

Also revealed is an\nability to maintain perfect two-photon anti-coalescence while tuning the\ninterference visibility, which has no equivalent in bulk-optics. The outcome of\nthis work adds to a suite of state engineering and characterization tools that\nbenefit from the advantages of integration.

There is a relative paucity of brown dwarfs companions around FGKM\nstars compared to exoplanets for orbital periods less than a few years, but\nmost of the short-period brown dwarf companions fully characterised by transits\nand radial velocities are found around F-type stars. We examine the hypothesis\nthat brown dwarf companions could not survive on close orbit around stars with\nimportant convective envelopes because the tides and angular momentum loss\nthrough magnetic breaking should lead to a rapid orbital decay and quick\nengulfment of the companion. We use a classical Skumanich-type braking law, and\nconstant time-lag tidal theory to assess the characteristic timescale for\norbital decay for the brown dwarf mass range as a function of the host\nproperties. We find that F-type stars may host massive companions for a\nsignificantly longer time than G-type stars for a given orbital period, which\nmay explain the paucity of G-type hosts for brown dwarfs with orbital period\nless than 5 days. On the other hand, we show that the small radius of early\nM-type stars contributes to orbital decay timescales that are only half those\nof F-type stars, despite their more efficient tidal dissipation and magnetic\nbraking. For fully convective later type M-dwarfs, orbital decay timescales\ncould be orders of magnitude greater than for F-type stars. For orbital periods\ngreater than 10 days, brown dwarf occurrence should largely be unaffected by\ntidal decay, whatever the mass of the host. On closer orbital periods, the\nrapid engulfment of massive companions could explain the lack of G and K-type\nhosts in the sample of known systems with transiting brown dwarfs. However, the\npaucity of M-type hosts can not be an effect of tidal decay alone, but may be\nthe result of a selection effect in the sample and/or the formation mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 09:28:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

We catalogue their availability\n(web-based or standalone), the main principles they employ in summarizing large\nlists of GO terms, and the visualization styles they support. These brief\ncommentaries on each software are intended as a helpful inventory, rather than\ncomprehensive descriptions of the underlying algorithms. Instead, we show\nexamples of their use and suggest that the choice of an appropriate\nvisualization tool may be crucial to the utility of GO in biological discovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 09:48:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

The latter implies that the star formation\nrate increases systematically during the early stages of evolution, and occurs\nvia filamentary flows onto \"hubs\" of higher density, mass, and velocity\ndispersion, and culminates a few Myr after than the small-scale collapses have\nstarted to form stars. In turn, the small-scale collapses occur in clumps\nembedded in the filaments, and are themselves falling into the larger potential\nwell of the still-ongoing large-scale collapse. The stars formed in the early,\nsmall-scale collapses share the infall motion of their parent clumps towards\nthe larger potential trough, so that the filaments feed both gaseous and\nstellar material to the hubs. This leads to the presence of older stars in a\nregion where new protostars are still forming, to a scale-free or fractal\nstructure of the clusters, in which each unit is composed of smaller-scale\nones, and to the eventual merging of the subunits, explaining the observed\nstructural features of open clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 14:54:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

Inspired by proteins that generate membrane\ncurvature, sense the underlying membrane geometry, and migrate to high\ncurvature sites, we explore the question: Can colloids, adhered to lipid\nbilayers, also sense and respond to membrane geometry? We report the curvature\nmigration of Janus microparticles adhered to giant unilamellar vesicles\nelongated to present well defined curvature fields. However, unlike proteins,\nwhich migrate to minimize membrane bending energy, colloids migrate by an\nentirely different mechanism. By determining the energy dissipated along a\ntrajectory, the energy field mediating these interactions is inferred to be\nlinear in the local deviatoric curvature, as reported previously for colloids\ntrapped at curved interfaces between immiscible fluids. In this latter system,\nhowever, the energy gradients are far larger, so particles move\ndeterministically, whereas the colloids on vesicles move with significant\nfluctuations in regions of weak curvature gradient. By addressing the role of\nBrownian motion, we show that the observed curvature migration of colloids on\nbilayers is indeed a case of curvature capillary migration, with membrane\ntension playing the role of interfacial tension. Furthermore, since this motion\nis mediated by membrane tension and shape, it can be modulated, or even turned\n\"on\" and \"off\", by simply varying these parameters. While particle-particle\ninteractions on lipid membranes have been considered in many contributions, we\nreport here an exciting and previously unexplored modality to actively direct\nthe migration of colloids to desired locations on lipid bilayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 14:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

Motivated by this, a\nmultiple cache variant of the classical single cache paging problem is studied,\nwhich is referred to as the Multiple Cache Paging (MCP) problem. In each\ntime-slot, a batch of content requests arrive that have to be served by a bank\nof caches, and each cache can serve exactly one request. If a content is not\nfound in the bank, it is fetched from the back-end server, and one currently\nstored content is ejected, and counted as fault.

The competitive\nratio of any online algorithm for the MCP problem is shown to be unbounded for\narbitrary input, thus concluding that the MCP problem is fundamentally\ndifferent from the classical paging problem. Consequently, stochastic arrivals\nsetting is considered, where requests arrive according to a known/unknown\nstochastic process.

This problem is a\nnatural restriction of the maximum common subgraph problem, which is ${\\sf\nNP}$-hard in general graphs. Confining to trees renders polynomial time\nalgorithms possible and is of fundamental importance for approaches on more\ngeneral graph classes. Various variants of this problem in trees have been\nintensively studied. We consider the general case, where trees are neither\nrooted nor ordered and the isomorphism is maximum w.r.t. a weight function on\nthe mapped vertices and edges. For trees of order $n$ and maximum degree\n$\\Delta$ our algorithm achieves a running time of $\\mathcal{O}(n^2\\Delta)$ by\nexploiting the structure of the matching instances arising as subproblems. Thus\nour algorithm outperforms the best previously known approaches.

Whenever two such modes coalesce both in\ntheir resonant frequency and their rate of decay or growth, a so-called\n\"exceptional point\" occurs, around which many fascinating phenomena have\nrecently been reported to arise. Particularly intriguing behavior is predicted\nto appear when encircling an exceptional point sufficiently slowly, like a\nstate-flip or the accumulation of a geometric phase. Experiments dedicated to\nthis issue could already successfully explore the topological structure of\nexceptional points, but a full dynamical encircling and the breakdown of\nadiabaticity inevitably associated with it remained out of reach of any\nmeasurement so far. Here we demonstrate that a dynamical encircling of an\nexceptional point can be mapped onto the problem of scattering through a\ntwo-mode waveguide, which allows us for the first time to access the elusive\neffects occurring in this context. Specifically, we present experimental\nresults from a waveguide structure that steers incoming waves around an\nexceptional point during the transmission process. In this way mode transitions\nare induced that make this device perfectly suited as a robust and asymmetric\nswitch between different waveguide modes. Our work opens up new and exciting\navenues to explore exceptional point physics at the crossroads between\nfundamental research and practical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-05"}
