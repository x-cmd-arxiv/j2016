A popular\nstrategy to alleviate this curse of dimensionality has been to use additive\nmodels of \\emph{first order}, which model the regression function as a sum of\nindependent functions on each dimension. Though useful in controlling the\nvariance of the estimate, such models are often too restrictive in practical\nsettings. Between non-additive models which often have large variance and first\norder additive models which have large bias, there has been little work to\nexploit the trade-off in the middle via additive models of intermediate order.\nIn this work, we propose SALSA, which bridges this gap by allowing interactions\nbetween variables, but controls model capacity by limiting the order of\ninteractions. SALSA minimises the residual sum of squares with squared RKHS\nnorm penalties. Algorithmically, it can be viewed as Kernel Ridge Regression\nwith an additive kernel. When the regression function is additive, the excess\nrisk is only polynomial in dimension.

The CMLs thus constructed are termed real-valued deterministic\ncellular automata (RDCA) and encompass all deterministic CAs in rule space in\nthe asymptotic limit $\\kappa \\to 0$ of a continuous parameter $\\kappa$. Thus,\nRDCAs generalize CAs in such a way that they constitute CMLs when $\\kappa$ is\nfinite and nonvanishing. In the limit $\\kappa \\to \\infty$ all RDCAs are shown\nto exhibit a global homogeneous fixed-point that attracts all initial\nconditions. A new bifurcation is discovered for RDCAs and its location is\nexactly determined from the linear stability analysis of the global quiescent\nstate. In this bifurcation, fuzziness gradually begins to intrude in a purely\ndeterministic CA-like dynamics. The mathematical method presented allows to get\ninsight in some highly nontrivial behavior found after the bifurcation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2016 17:39:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 12:44:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-09"}

Here, we demonstrate that this can be\nachieved by a data-driven approach to spectral modeling. With The Cannon, we\ntransfer information from the APOGEE survey to determine precise Teff, log g,\n[Fe/H], and [$\\alpha$/M] from the spectra of 450,000 LAMOST giants. The Cannon\nfits a predictive model for LAMOST spectra using 9952 stars observed in common\nbetween the two surveys, taking five labels from APOGEE DR12 as ground truth:\nTeff, log g, [Fe/H], [\\alpha/M], and K-band extinction $A_k$. The model is then\nused to infer Teff, log g, [Fe/H], and [$\\alpha$/M] for 454,180 giants, 20% of\nthe LAMOST DR2 stellar sample. These are the first [$\\alpha$/M] values for the\nfull set of LAMOST giants, and the largest catalog of [$\\alpha$/M] for giant\nstars to date. Furthermore, these labels are by construction on the APOGEE\nlabel scale; for spectra with S/N > 50, cross-validation of the model yields\ntypical uncertainties of 70K in Teff, 0.1 in log g, 0.1 in [Fe/H], and 0.04 in\n[$\\alpha$/M], values comparable to the broadly stated, conservative APOGEE DR12\nuncertainties. Thus, by using \"label transfer\" to tie low-resolution (LAMOST R\n$\\sim$ 1800) spectra to the label scale of a much higher-resolution (APOGEE R\n$\\sim$ 22,500) survey, we substantially reduce the inconsistencies between\nlabels measured by the individual survey pipelines.

These measurements will provide valuable input to theoretical\nmodels of cold matter beyond nuclear density. Here we propose that PSR\nJ1614$-$2230, despite its low count rate, is a promising source to observe with\nNICER. The reason is that XMM-Newton observations suggest that the fractional\noscillation amplitude from PSR J1614$-$2230 could be high enough that this star\ncannot be very compact.

Since the LOS velocities depend, in part, on the stellar rotation, the\nRM waveform is sensitive to the star-planet alignment (which provides\ninformation on the system's dynamical history). We present a new RM modelling\ntechnique that directly measures the spatially-resolved stellar spectrum behind\nthe planet. This is done by scaling the continuum flux of the (HARPS) spectra\nby the transit light curve, and then subtracting the in- from the\nout-of-transit spectra to isolate the starlight behind the planet. This\ntechnique does not assume any shape for the intrinsic local profiles. In it, we\nalso allow for differential stellar rotation and centre-to-limb variations in\nthe convective blueshift. We apply this technique to HD189733 and compare to 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations.

Given a single image depicting an object, novel-view\nsynthesis is the task of generating new images that render the object from a\ndifferent viewpoint than the one given. The main difficulty is to synthesize\nthe parts that are disoccluded; disocclusion occurs when parts of an object are\nhidden by the object itself under a specific viewpoint. In this work, we show\nhow to improve novel-view synthesis by making use of the correlations observed\nin 3D models and applying them to new image instances.

Faced with this dichotomy, we propose a Mixed Integer\nProgramming (MIP) model that can optimally schedule fuel treatments to reduce\nfuel hazards by fragmenting high fuel load regions while considering critical\necological requirements over time and space. The model takes into account both\nthe frequency of fire that vegetation can tolerate and the frequency of fire\nnecessary for fire-dependent species. Our approach also ensures that suitable\nalternate habitat is available and accessible to fauna affected by a treated\narea. More importantly, to conserve fauna the model sets a minimum acceptable\ntarget for the connectivity of habitat at any time . These factors are all\nincluded in the formulation of a model that yields a multi-period\nspatially-explicit schedule for treatment planning.

Our experiments show that it is possible to reduce\nthe risk of wildfires while ensuring sufficient connectivity of habitat over\nboth space and time. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the habitat\nconnectivity constraint is more effective than neighbourhood habitat\nconstraints.

The charging requests of PHEVs usually have deadline constraints, and\nthe electricity cost associated with PHEV charging is usually random due to the\nuncertainty in both system load and renewable generation. We seek to properly\nschedule the battery charging of multiple PHEVs so as to minimize the overall\ncost, which is derived from the total charging cost and the penalty for not\ncompleting charging before requested deadlines. Through a dynamic programming\nformulation, we establish the Less Laxity and Longer remaining Processing time\n(LLLP) principle that improves any charging policy on a sample-path basis, when\nthe non-completion penalty is a convex function of the additional time needed\nto fulfill the uncompleted request.

Various clinical decisions are\nneeded to manage the screening process; those include: selecting the screening\ntests for a woman to take, interpreting the test outcomes, and deciding whether\nor not a woman should be referred to a diagnostic test. Such decisions are\ncurrently guided by clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), which represent a\none-size-fits-all approach that are designed to work well on average for a\npopulation, without guaranteeing that it will work well uniformly over that\npopulation. Since the risks and benefits of screening are functions of each\npatients features, personalized screening policies that are tailored to the\nfeatures of individuals are needed in order to ensure that the right tests are\nrecommended to the right woman. In order to address this issue, we present\nConfidentCare: a computer-aided clinical decision support system that learns a\npersonalized screening policy from the electronic health record (EHR) data.\nConfidentCare operates by recognizing clusters of similar patients, and\nlearning the best screening policy to adopt for each cluster. A cluster of\npatients is a set of patients with similar features (e.g. age, breast density,\nfamily history, etc.), and the screening policy is a set of guidelines on what\nactions to recommend for a woman given her features and screening test scores.\nConfidentCare algorithm ensures that the policy adopted for every cluster of\npatients satisfies a predefined accuracy requirement with a high level of\nconfidence.

As a result, both cell averaged and cell interface flow\nvariables can be used for the initial data reconstruction at the beginning of\nnext time step. A weighted least-square reconstruction has been used for the\nconstruction of a third-order initial condition. Therefore, a compact\nthird-order gas-kinetic scheme with the involvement of neighboring cells only\ncan be developed on unstructured meshes.

The third-order compact scheme is numerically stable\nunder CFL condition above 0.5.

Recently, Compressed Sensing (CS) theory has successfully demonstrated\nits potential in neural recording application. The main limitation of CS,\nhowever, is that the neural signals have no good sparse representation with\ncommonly used dictionaries and learning a reliable dictionary is often data\ndependent and computationally demanding. In this paper, a novel CS approach for\nimplantable neural recording is proposed. The main contributions are: 1) The\nco-sparse analysis model is adopted to enforce co-sparsity of the neural\nsignals, therefore overcoming the drawbacks of conventional synthesis model and\nenhancing the reconstruction performance. 2) A multi-fractional-order\ndifference matrix is constructed as the analysis dictionary, thus avoiding the\ndictionary learning procedure and reducing the need for previously acquired\ndata and computational resources. 3) By exploiting the statistical priors of\nthe analysis coefficients, a weighted analysis $\\ell_1$-minimization (WALM)\nalgorithm is proposed to reconstruct the neural signals.

However, we also observe for some\nspecific parameter cases, that (i) ferromagnetism appears at already very small\n$U_c$, (ii) ferromagnetism does not show up at all, (iii) the critical on-site\nrepulsion $U_c$ is a nonmonotonic function of the bandwidth, or that (iv) a\ncritical bandwidth is needed to open the window for ground-state\nferromagnetism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2016 09:26:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-03"}

For such instruments,\ntherefore, it is important to understand and characterize the response to\nensure good linearity and calibration over wide dynamic range. We propose to\nuse the MKID readout frequency response to determine the MKID responsivity to\nan input optical source power. A signal can be measured in a KID as a change in\nthe phase of the readout signal with respect to the KID resonant circle.\nFundamentally, this phase change is due to a shift in the KID resonance\nfrequency, in turn due to a radiation induced change in the quasiparticle\nnumber in the superconducting resonator. We show that shift in resonant\nfrequency can be determined from the phase shift by using KID phase versus\nfrequency dependence using a previously measured resonant frequency. Working in\nthis calculated resonant frequency, we gain near linearity and constant\ncalibration to a constant optical signal applied in a wide range of operating\npoints on the resonance and readout powers. This calibration method has three\nparticular advantages: first, it is fast enough to be used to calibrate large\narrays, with pixel counts in the thousand of pixels; second, it is based on\ndata that are already necessary to determine KID positions; third, it can be\ndone without applying any optical source in front of the array.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2016 09:33:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-15"}

We reveal three\nmolecular clouds, the 15 km/s cloud, the 27 km/s cloud, and the 50 km/s cloud,\nin the surveyed region. The 50 km/s cloud is resolved with an angular\nresolution of around 1' for the first time. Investigating their morphology and\nvelocity structures, we find that the 27 km/s cloud is likely affected by\nfeedback from the stellar association Mon OB3 and the 50 km/s cloud is\ncharacterised by three large expanding molecular shells. The region is mapped\nin C18O (1-0) for the first time. We discover seven C18O clumps, which are\nlikely to form massive stars, and 15 dust clumps based on the BGPS archival\ndata.

According to the distribution of YSO\ncandidates, an overdensity is found around the HII region S287 and the\nintersection of two shells, indicative of triggering. The star formation\nefficiency and rate of the 27~km/s cloud are discussed. Comparing the observed\nvalues of the filament S287-main with the models of fragmentation, we suggest\nthat turbulence controls the large scale of fragmentation in the filament while\ngravitational fragmentation plays an important role in the formation of YSOs on\nthe small scale. We find that star-forming gas tends to have higher excitation\ntemperature, higher 13CO opacity, and higher column density than\nnon-star-forming gas, which is consistent with the point that star formation\nhappens in denser gas and star-forming gas is heated by YSOs.

It\ncomprises the majority of the models used in population genetics, and we show\nthat many well-known results valid for M and WF processes are still valid in\nthis class. In all Kimura processes, a mutant gene will either fixate or become\nextinct, and we present a necessary and sufficient condition for such processes\nto have the probability of fixation strictly increasing in the initial\nfrequency of mutants. This condition implies that there are WF processes with\ndecreasing fixation probability --- in contradistinction to M processes which\nalways have strictly increasing fixation probability. As a by-product, we show\nthat an increasing fixation probability defines uniquely an M or WF process\nwhich realises it, and that any fixation probability with no state having\ntrivial fixation can be realised by at least some WF process. These results are\nextended to a subclass of processes that are suitable for describing\ntime-inhomogeneous dynamics.

The intelligent systems extract these patterns from\nan email corpus of single or all users and are limited to statistical analysis.\nHowever, the email information revealed in those methods is either constricted\nor widespread, i.e. single or all users respectively, which limits the\nusability of the resultant communities. In contrast to extreme views of the\nemail information, we relax the aforementioned restrictions by considering a\nsubset of all users as multi-user information in an incremental way to extend\nthe personalization concept.

After careful data\nanalysis, we find that the previously reported asymmetry is not present in\neither of two transits, observed in July 2014 and July 2015 with high\nphotometric precisions of 300ppm over 5 minutes.

More specifically, we develop the theory of short and\nlong confocal annular Josephson tunnel junctions in the presence of an in-plane\nmagnetic field of arbitrary orientations. The behavior of a circular annular\nJosephson tunnel junction is then seen to be simply a special case of the above\nresult. For junctions having a normalized perimeter less than one the threshold\ncurves are derived and computed even in the case with trapped Josephson\nvortices. For longer junctions a numerical analysis is carried out after the\nderivation of the appropriate motion equation for the Josephson phase. We found\nthat the system is modeled by a modified and perturbed sine-Gordon equation\nwith a space dependent effective Josephson penetration length inversely\nproportional to the local junction width. Both the fluxon statics and dynamics\nare deeply affected by the non-uniform annulus width. Static zero-field\nmultiple-fluxon solutions exist even in presence of a large bias current. The\ntangential velocity of a traveling fluxon is not determined by the balance\nbetween the driving and drag forces due to the dissipative losses. Furthermore,\nthe fluxon motion is characterized by a strong radial inward acceleration which\ncauses electromagnetic radiation concentrated at the ellipse equatorial points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2016 13:16:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-09"}

We use a detailed radiative transfer analysis\nbased on the accelerated lambda iteration method to model circumstellar SO and\nSO$_2$ line emission and molecular data files for both SO and SO$_2$ that are\nmore extensive than those previously available. Using 17 SO lines and 98 SO2\nlines to constrain our models for R Dor, we find an SO abundance of\n6.7x10$^{-6}$ and an SO$_2$ abundance of 5x10$^{-6}$ with both species having\nhigh abundances close to the star. We also modelled $^{34}$SO and found an\nabundance of 3.1x10$^{-7}$, giving an $^{32}$SO/$^{34}$SO ratio of 21.6. We\nderive similar results for the circumstellar SO and SO$_2$ abundances and their\ndistributions for the low mass-loss rate object W Hya. For these stars, the\ncircumstellar SO and SO$_2$ abundances are much higher than predicted by\nchemical models and these two species may account for all available sulphur.\nFor the higher mass-loss rate stars, we find shell-like SO distributions with\npeak abundances that decrease and peak abundance radii that increase with\nincreasing mass-loss rate. The positions of the peak SO abundance agree very\nwell with the photodissociation radii of H$_2$O. We find evidence that SO is\nmost likely through the photodissociation of H$_2$O and the subsequent reaction\nbetween S and OH. The S-bearing parent molecule appears not to be H$_2$S.

We want to\ndemonstrate the ability of our new core/mantle evolutionary dust model THEMIS\n(The Heterogeneous dust Evolution Model at the IaS), which has been shown to be\nvalid in the far-IR and submm, to reproduce the C-shine observations. Our\nstarting point is a physically motivated core/mantle dust model. It consists of\n3 dust populations: small aromatic-rich carbon grains; bigger core/mantle\ngrains with mantles of aromatic-rich carbon and cores either made of amorphous\naliphatic-rich carbon or amorphous silicate. We assume an evolutionary path\nwhere these grains, when entering denser regions, may first form a second\naliphatic-rich carbon mantle (coagulation of small grains, accretion of carbon\nfrom the gas phase), second coagulate together to form large aggregates, and\nthird accrete gas phase molecules coating them with an ice mantle. To compute\nthe corresponding dust emission and scattering, we use a 3D Monte-Carlo\nradiative transfer code. We show that our global evolutionary dust modelling\napproach THEMIS allows us to reproduce C-shine observations towards dense\nstarless clouds. Dust scattering and emission is most sensitive to the cloud\ncentral density and to the steepness of the cloud density profile. Varying\nthese two parameters leads to changes, which are stronger in the near-IR, in\nboth the C-shine intensity and profile.

These observations imply that, perhaps, our\nunderstanding of diffusion processes at work in magnetic stars is incomplete\nand a more detailed analysis of these processes is required. In the present\npaper, we consider diffusion caused by a combined influence of the electric\ncurrent and the Hall effect.Such diffusion has a number of very particular\nproperties and, generally, can change the surface chemistry of stars in\ncombination with other diffusion processes. For instance, current-driven\ndiffusion is accompanied by a propagation of the special type of waves in which\nonly the impurity number density oscillates.

However, despite their wide use, target fds' evaluation is still a\nbottleneck in the state-of-the-art DE engines.

In this paper, we investigate, using\nnumerical simulations, the role of collisional coupling between a\nproton-electron charge-neutral fluid and a neutral hydrogen fluid for the 1D\nRiemann problem initiated in a constant pressure and density background state\nby a discontinuity in the magnetic field. This system, in the MHD limit, is\ncharacterised by two waves: a fast-mode rarefaction wave that drives a flow\ntowards a slow-mode MHD shock. The system evolves through four stage:\ninitiation, weak coupling, intermediate coupling and a quasi steady state. The\ninitial stages are characterised by an over-pressured neutral region that\nexpands with characteristics of a blast wave. In the later stages, the system\ntends towards a self-similar solution where the main drift velocity is\nconcentrated in the thin region of the shock front. Due to the nature of the\nsystem, the neutral fluid is overpressured by the shock when compared to a\npurely hydrodynamic shock which results in the neutral fluid expanding to form\nthe shock precursor. The thickness of the shockfront once it has formed\nproportional to the ionisation fraction to the power -1.2, which is a smaller\nexponent than would be naively expected from simple scaling arguments. One\ninteresting result is that the shock front is a continuous transition of the\nphysical variables for sub-sonic velocity upstream of the shock front (a\nc-shock) to a sharp jump in the physical variables followed by a relaxation to\nthe downstream values for supersonic upstream velocity (a j-shock). The\nfrictional heating that results from the velocity drift across the shock front\ncan amount to approximately two per cent of the reference magnetic energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2016 22:09:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 13:52:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-27"}
