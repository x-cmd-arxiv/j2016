We find that for high\nimpact velocities and negligible surface friction at the solid surface (i.e.\nfree-slip), about one half of the initial kinetic energy is transformed into\nsurface energy, independent of the impact parameters and the detailed energy\nloss mechanism(s). We argue that this seemingly universal rule is related to\nthe deformation mode of the droplet and is reminiscent of pipe flow undergoing\na sudden expansion, for which the head loss can be calculated by multiplying\nthe kinetic energy of the incoming flow by a geometrical factor. For impacts on\na no-slip surface also dissipation in the shear boundary layer at the solid\nsurface is important. In this case the geometric head loss acts as a lower\nbound on the total dissipation (i.e. the spreading on a no-slip surface\napproaches that on a free-slip surface when the droplet viscosity is send to\nzero).\n  This new view on the impact problem allows for simple analytical estimates of\nthe maximum spreading diameter of impacting drops as a function of the impact\nparameters and the properties of the solid surface.

The previous relation is usually refereed as the Siegert's\ntheorem. The form of the electric amplitude, defined in terms of the transverse\namplitudes $A_{1/2}$ and $A_{3/2}$, and the explicit coefficients of the\nrelation, depend on the angular momentum and parity ($J^P$) of the resonance\n$R$. The Siegert's theorem is the consequence of the structure of the\nelectromagnetic transition current, which induces constraints between the\nelectromagnetic form factors in the pseudo-threshold limit.

The data around\nthe time of the event were analyzed coherently across the LIGO network using a\nsuite of accurate waveform models that describe gravitational waves from a\ncompact binary system in general relativity. GW150914 was produced by a nearly\nequal mass binary black hole of $36^{+5}_{-4} M_\\odot$ and $29^{+4}_{-4}\nM_\\odot$; for each parameter we report the median value and the range of the\n90% credible interval. The dimensionless spin magnitude of the more massive\nblack hole is bound to be $<0.7$ (at 90% probability). The luminosity distance\nto the source is $410^{+160}_{-180}$ Mpc, corresponding to a redshift\n$0.09^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ assuming standard cosmology. The source location is\nconstrained to an annulus section of $610$ deg$^2$, primarily in the southern\nhemisphere. The binary merges into a black hole of $62^{+4}_{-4} M_\\odot$ and\nspin $0.67^{+0.05}_{-0.07}$. This black hole is significantly more massive than\nany other inferred from electromagnetic observations in the stellar-mass\nregime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2016 19:26:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 11:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-21"}

We carry\nout several investigations to determine whether GW150914 is consistent with a\nbinary black-hole merger in general relativity. We find that the final\nremnant's mass and spin, as determined from the low-frequency (inspiral) and\nhigh-frequency (post-inspiral) phases of the signal, are mutually consistent\nwith the binary black-hole solution in general relativity. Furthermore, the\ndata following the peak of GW150914 are consistent with the least-damped\nquasi-normal mode inferred from the mass and spin of the remnant black hole. By\nusing waveform models that allow for parameterized general-relativity\nviolations during the inspiral and merger phases, we perform quantitative tests\non the gravitational-wave phase in the dynamical regime and we determine the\nfirst empirical bounds on several high-order post-Newtonian coefficients. We\nconstrain the graviton Compton wavelength, assuming that gravitons are\ndispersed in vacuum in the same way as particles with mass, obtaining a\n$90\\%$-confidence lower bound of $10^{13}$ km. In conclusion, within our\nstatistical uncertainties, we find no evidence for violations of general\nrelativity in the genuinely strong-field regime of gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2016 19:26:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 08:16:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 15:08:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

Such black-hole mergers have been predicted in two main types of\nformation models, involving isolated binaries in galactic fields or dynamical\ninteractions in young and old dense stellar environments. The measured masses\nrobustly demonstrate that relatively \"heavy\" black holes ($\\gtrsim 25\\,\nM_\\odot$) can form in nature. This discovery implies relatively weak\nmassive-star winds and thus the formation of GW150914 in an environment with\nmetallicity lower than $\\sim 1/2$ of the solar value. The rate of binary\nblack-hole mergers inferred from the observation of GW150914 is consistent with\nthe higher end of rate predictions ($\\gtrsim 1 \\, \\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \\,\n\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) from both types of formation models. The low measured\nredshift ($z \\sim 0.1$) of GW150914 and the low inferred metallicity of the\nstellar progenitor imply either binary black-hole formation in a low-mass\ngalaxy in the local Universe and a prompt merger, or formation at high redshift\nwith a time delay between formation and merger of several Gyr.

In this paper, we propose a method to study the\nFE reversal path of materials in the corundum derivative family.

In a combined approach of PIC/MCC simulations and a\ntheoretical model based on an equivalent circuit, we investigate the\nself-excitation of PSR oscillations and their effect on the electron heating in\ngeometrically symmetric CCRF plasmas driven by multiple consecutive harmonics.\nThe discharge symmetry is controlled via the Electrical Asymmetry Effect, i.e.\nby varying the total number of harmonics and tuning the phase shifts between\nthem. It is demonstrated that PSR oscillations will be self-excited under both\nsymmetric and asymmetric conditions, if (i) the charge-voltage relation of the\nplasma sheaths deviates from a simple quadratic behavior and if (ii) the\ninductance of the plasma bulk exhibits a temporal modulation. These two effects\nhave been neglected up to now, but we show that they must be included in the\nmodel in order to properly describe the nonlinear series resonance circuit and\nreproduce the self-excitation of PSR oscillations, which are observed in the\nelectron current density resulting from simulations of geometrically symmetric\nCCRF plasmas. Furthermore, the effect of the PSR self-excitation on the\ndischarge current and the plasma properties, such as the potential profile, is\nillustrated by applying Fourier analysis. High frequency oscillations in the\nentire spectrum between the applied frequencies and the local electron plasma\nfrequency are observed. As a consequence, the electron heating is strongly\nenhanced by the presence of PSR oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2016 19:41:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-12"}

Mathematical models can provide an alternative method to study the\ndynamics of this network from a quantitative and a qualitative perspective.\nHere, we employ such approaches to unravel the main properties of the galactose\nnetwork, including equilibrium binary and temporal responses, as a way to\ndecipher its adaptation to actively-changing inputs.

In\npractice, the $\\Delta$-stepping algorithm of Meyer and Sanders (J. Algorithms,\n2003) often works efficiently but has no known theoretical bounds on general\ngraphs. The algorithm takes a sequence of steps, each increasing the radius by\na user-specified value $\\Delta$. Each step settles the vertices in its annulus\nbut can take $\\Theta(n)$ substeps, each requiring $\\Theta(m)$ work ($n$\nvertices and $m$ edges).\n  In this paper, we describe Radius-Stepping, an algorithm with the best-known\ntradeoff between work and depth bounds for SSSP with nearly-linear\n($\\otilde(m)$) work. The algorithm is a $\\Delta$-stepping-like algorithm but\nuses a variable instead of fixed-size increase in radii, allowing us to prove a\nbound on the number of steps. In particular, by using what we define as a\nvertex $k$-radius, each step takes at most $k+2$ substeps.

Thus, whilst we confirm that relaxion models could solve the\nhierarchy problem, we find that their unconventional cosmology demolishes their\nplausibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2016 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-15"}

Due to the special orbital configuration of the HAT-P-13 system, the\nmagnitude of HAT-P-13b's eccentricity ($e_b$) is in part dictated by its Love\nnumber ($k_{2_b}$), which is in turn a proxy for the degree of central mass\nconcentration in its interior. Thus, the measurement of $e_b$ constrains\n$k_{2_b}$ and allows us to place otherwise elusive constraints on the mass of\nHAT-P-13b's core ($M_{\\rm{core,b}}$). In this study we derive new constraints\non the value of $e_b$ by observing two secondary eclipses of HAT-P-13b with the\nInfrared Array Camera on board the $\\textit{Spitzer Space Telescope}$. We fit\nthe measured secondary eclipse times simultaneously with radial velocity\nmeasurements and find that $e_b = 0.00700 \\pm 0.00100$.

For an unbounded\nclosed operator, it is defined, as in the classical case, using an appropriate\ntransformation and the $S$-functional calculus for bounded operators. This is\nhowever only possible if the $S$-resolvent set of the operator contains a real\npoint.\n  In this paper, we define the $S$-functional calculus directly via a Cauchy\nintegral, which allows us to consider also operators whose resolvent sets do\nnot contain real points. We show that the product rule and the spectral mapping\ntheorem also hold true with this definition and that the $S$-functional\ncalculus is compatible with polynomials, although polynomials are not included\nin the set of admissible functions if the operator is unbounded.\n  We also prove that the $S$-functional calculus is able to create spectral\nprojections. In order to do this, we remove another assumption usually made: we\ndo not assume that admissible functions are defined on slice domains. Instead,\nwe also consider functions that are defined on not necessarily connected sets.\nThis leads to an unexpected phenomenon: the $S$-functional calculi for left and\nright slice hyperholomorphic functions become inconsistent and give different\noperators for functions that are both left and right slice hyperholomorphic.

This circular dependence makes rational coordination\ndifficult in uncertain environments if communication between actors is\nunreliable and no prior agreements have been made. An important normative\nquestion with regard to coordination in these ad hoc settings is therefore how\none can come to believe that other actors will coordinate, and with regard to\nsystems involving humans, an important empirical question is how humans arrive\nat these expectations. We introduce an exact algorithm for computing the\ninfinitely recursive hierarchy of graded beliefs required for rational\ncoordination in uncertain environments, and we introduce a novel mechanism for\nmultiagent coordination that uses it.

The inhomogeneity of each wall is modeled by a magnetic field acting on\nsurface spins. It is equal to $+h_1$ except for a group of $N_1$ sites where it\nis equal to $-h_1$. The inhomogeneities of the upper and lower wall are shifted\nwith respect to each other by a lateral distance $L$. Using exact\ndiagonalization of the transfer matrix, we study both the lateral and normal\ncritical Casimir forces as well as magnetization profiles for a wide range of\ntemperatures and system parameters. The lateral critical Casimir force tends to\nreduce the shift between the inhomogeneities, and the excess normal force is\nattractive. Upon increasing the shift $L$ we observe, depending on the\ntemperature, three different scenarios of breaking of the capillary bridge of\nnegative magnetization connecting the inhomogeneities of the walls across the\nstrip. As long as there exists a capillary bridge in the system, the magnitude\nof the excess total critical Casimir force is almost constant, with its\ndirection depending on $L$. By investigating the bridge morphologies we have\nfound a relation between the point at which the bridge breaks and the\ninflection point of the force. We provide a simple argument that some of the\nproperties reported here should also hold for a whole range of different models\nof the strip with the same type of inhomogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2016 23:23:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-15"}

The observed range of\ninfrared-to-X-ray (IRX) flux ratios of SNRs are also wide. For a sample of 20\nGalactic SNRs, we obtain their IR and X-ray properties and investigate the\nphysical causes for such large differences. We find that the observed IRX flux\nratios ($R_{IRX.obs}$) are related to the IRX morphology, with SNRs with the\nlargest $R_{IRX,obs}$ showing anticorrelated IRX morphology. By analyzing the\nrelation of $R_{IRX,obs}$ to X-ray and IR parameters, we show that the\n$R_{IRX,obs}$ of some SNRs agree with theoretical ratios of SNR shocks in which\ndust grains are heated and destroyed by collisions with plasma particles. For\nthe majority of SNRs, however, $R_{IRX,obs}$ values are either significantly\nsmaller or significantly larger than the theoretical ratios. The latter SNRs\nhave relatively low dust temperatures. We discuss how the natural and/or\nenvironmental properties of SNRs could have affected the IRX flux ratios and\nthe IRX morphology of these SNRs. We conclude that the SNRs with largest\n$R_{IRX,obs}$ are probably located in dense environment and that their IR\nemission is from dust heated by shock radiation rather than by collisions.

During the impulsive phase, it is believed that\nthe electrons and other particles are accelerated after the stored energy in\nthe magnetic field is released by reconnection. The impulsivity of a solar\nflare is a quantifiable property that shows how quickly this initial energy\nrelease occurs. It is measured via the impulsivity parameter, which we define\nas the inverse of the overall duration of the impulsive phase. We take the\nlatter as the raw width of the most prominent nonthermal emission of the flare.\nWe computed this observable over a work sample of 48 M-class events that\noccurred during the current Solar Cycle 24 by using three different methods.\nThe first method takes into account all of the nonthermal flare emission and\ngives very accurate results, while the other two just cover fixed energy\nintervals (30-40 keV and 25-50 keV) and are useful for fast calculations. We\npropose an alternative way to classify solar flares according to their\nimpulsivity parameter values, defining three different types of impulsivity,\nnamely, high, medium, and low.

In the case of bacteria, distances\ncan be estimated using a range of different evolutionary models, from single\nnucleotide polymorphisms to large-scale genome rearrangements. In the case of\nsequence evolution models (such as the Jukes-Cantor model and associated\nmetric) have been used to correct pairwise distances. Similar correction\nmethods for genome rearrangement processes are required to improve inference.\nCurrent attempts at correction fall into 3 categories: Empirical computational\nstudies, Bayesian/MCMC approaches, and combinatorial approaches. Here we\nintroduce a maximum likelihood estimator for the inversion distance between a\npair of genomes, using the group-theoretic approach to modelling inversions\nintroduced recently. This MLE functions as a corrected distance: in particular,\nwe show that because of the way sequences of inversions interact with each\nother, it is quite possible for minimal distance and MLE distance to\ndifferently order the distances of two genomes from a third. This has obvious\nimplications for the use of minimal distance in phylogeny reconstruction.

From a sequential decision perspective, ODRs are also\nmixtures of one-sided and truncated sequential detection rules. Several results\nregarding ODRs are established in this paper. In the finite regime, the maximum\nsample size is modeled either as a fixed finite number, or a geometric random\nvariable with a fixed finite mean. For both cases, the corresponding Bayesian\nformulations are investigated. The former case is a slight variation of the\nwell-known finite-length sequential hypothesis testing procedure in the\nliterature, whereas the latter case is new, for which the Bayesian optimal ODR\nis shown to be a sequence of likelihood ratio threshold tests with two\ndifferent thresholds: a running threshold, which is determined by solving a\nstationary state equation, is used when future samples are still available, and\na terminal threshold (simply the ratio between the priors scaled by costs) is\nused when the statistician reaches the final sample and thus has to make a\ndecision immediately. In the asymptotic regime, the tradeoff among the\nexponents of the (false alarm and miss) error probabilities and the normalized\nexpected stopping time under the alternative hypothesis is completely\ncharacterized and proved to be tight, via an information-theoretic argument.\nWithin the tradeoff region, one noteworthy fact is that the performance of the\nStein-Chernoff Lemma is attainable by ODRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 07:34:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-15"}

This family is further specified by the request that,\nin regime of high temperature, far from the critical region, the extended model\nreproduces asymptotically the standard van der Waals equation of state. We\nprovide a detailed comparison of our extended model with two notable empirical\nmodels such as Peng-Robinson and Soave's modification of the Redlich-Kwong\nequations of state. We show that our extended van der Waals equation of state\nis compatible with both empirical models for a suitable choice of the free\nparameters and can be viewed as a master interpolating equation. The present\napproach also suggests that further generalisations can be obtained by\nincluding the class of dispersive and viscous-dispersive nonlinear conservation\nlaws and could lead to a new type of thermodynamic phase transitions associated\nto nonclassical and dispersive shock waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 08:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

Otherwise, if H is an irreflexive bipartite permutation graph\nor a reflexive proper interval graph then approximately counting list\nH-colourings is equivalent to #BIS, the problem of approximately counting\nindependent sets in a bipartite graph. This is a well-studied problem which is\nbelieved to be of intermediate complexity -- it is believed that it does not\nhave an FPRAS, but that it is not as difficult as approximating the most\ndifficult counting problems in #P.

We show that the photon output is fed from saturable quantum\nemitters rather than a non-saturable background despite being rather\ninsensitive to the spectral position of the mode. Although the exciton\ntransitions of each quantum dot are detuned by up to $160$ cavity linewidths,\nwe observe that strong excitation populates a multitude of closely spaced\nmulti-exciton states, which partly overlap spectrally with the mode. The\nlimited number of emitters is confirmed by a complete saturation of the mode\nintensity at strong pumping, providing sufficient gain to reach stimulated\nemission, whilst being accompanied by a distinct lasing threshold. Detailed\nsecond-order photon-correlation measurements unambiguously identify the\ntransition to lasing for strong pumping and, most remarkably, reveal\nsuper-thermal photon bunching with $g^{(2)}(0)>2$ below lasing threshold. Based\non our microscopic theory, a pump-rate dependent $\\beta$-factor $\\beta(P)$ is\nneeded to describe the nanolaser and account for the interplay of multi-exciton\ntransitions in the few-emitter gain medium.

QCD is characterised by two emergent\nphenomena: confinement & dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB). They are\nexpressed with great force in the character of the pion. In turn, pion\nproperties suggest that confinement & DCSB are closely connected. As both a\nNambu-Goldstone boson and a quark-antiquark bound-state, the pion is unique in\nNature. Developing an understanding of its properties is thus critical to\nrevealing basic features of the Standard Model. We describe experimental\nprogress in this direction, made using electromagnetic probes, highlighting\nboth improvements in the precision of charged-pion form factor data, achieved\nin the past decade, and new results on the neutral-pion transition form factor.\nBoth challenge existing notions of pion structure. We also provide a\ntheoretical context for these empirical advances, first explaining how DCSB\nworks to guarantee that the pion is unnaturally light; but also, nevertheless,\nensures the pion is key to revealing the mechanisms that generate nearly all\nthe mass of hadrons. Our discussion unifies the charged-pion elastic and\nneutral-pion transition form factors, and the pion's twist-2 parton\ndistribution amplitude. It also indicates how studies of the charged-kaon form\nfactor can provide significant contributions. Importantly, recent predictions\nfor the large-$Q^2$ behaviour of the pion form factor can be tested by\nexperiments planned at JLab 12. Those experiments will extend precise\ncharged-pion form factor data to momenta that can potentially serve in\nvalidating factorisation theorems in QCD, exposing the transition between the\nnonperturbative and perturbative domains, and thereby reaching a goal that has\nlong driven hadro-particle physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 11:22:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

To this end we select subsets of\ntagged particles in the halos of the Aquarius simulations to represent mock GC\nsystems, and analyse their kinematics. We find that GC systems can exhibit a\nnon-negligible rotation signal provided the associated stellar halo also has a\nnet angular momentum. The ability to detect this rotation signal is highly\ndependent on the viewing perspective, and the probability of seeing a signal\nlarger than that measured in M31 ranges from 10% to 90% for the different halos\nin the Aquarius suite. High values are found from a perspective such that the\nprojected angular momentum of the GC system is within 40 deg of the rotation\naxis determined via the projected positions and line-of-sight velocities of the\nGCs. Furthermore, the true 3D angular momentum of the outer stellar halo is\nrelatively well aligned, within 35 deg, with that of the mock GC systems. We\nargue that the net angular momentum in the mock GC systems arises naturally\nwhen the majority of the material is accreted from a preferred direction,\nnamely along the dominant dark matter filament of the large-scale structure\nthat the halos are embedded in.

They follow in this framework from the experimental values of\n$\\Delta M_{d}/\\Delta M_s$ and of the CP-asymmetry $S_{\\psi K_S}$. As in CMFV\nmodels the new contributions to meson mixings can be described by a single\nflavour-universal variable $S(v)$, we next determine the CKM matrix elements\n$|V_{ts}|$, $|V_{td}|$, $|V_{cb}|$ and $|V_{ub}|$ as functions of $S(v)$ using\nthe experimental value of $\\Delta M_s$ as input.

During these observations, the X-ray flux was suppressed by a factor of >10\nin the soft X-ray band when compared to other epochs. We investigated the\nbroadband continuum by constructing a spectral energy distribution, making use\nof the optical/UV photometry and hard X-ray spectra from the later\nXMM-Newton/NuSTAR campaign in 2014. The high energy part of this low flux state\ncannot be accounted for by self-consistent accretion disc and corona models\nwithout attenuation by absorbing gas, which partially covers a substantial\nfraction of the line of sight towards the X-ray source. Two absorption layers\nare required, of column density $\\log (N_{\\rm{H,low}}/{\\rm\ncm^{-2}})=22.3\\pm0.1$ and $\\log (N_{\\rm{H,high}}/{\\rm cm^{-2}})=23.2\\pm0.1$,\nwith average covering factors of ~80% (with typical 5% variations) and 60%\n($\\pm$10-15%), respectively. In these observations PDS 456 displays significant\nshort term X-ray spectral variability, on timescales of ~100 ks, which can be\naccounted for by variable covering of the absorbing gas. The partial covering\nabsorber prefers an outflow velocity of $v_{\\rm pc} = 0.25^{+0.01}_{-0.05}c$ at\nthe >99.9% confidence level over the case where $v_{\\rm pc}=0$. This is\nconsistent with the velocity of the highly ionised outflow responsible for the\nblueshifted iron K absorption profile. We therefore suggest that the partial\ncovering clouds could be the denser, or clumpy part of an inhomogeneous\naccretion disc wind. Finally we estimate the size-scale of the X-ray source\nfrom its variability. The radial extent of the X-ray emitter is found to be of\nthe order ~15-20 $R_{\\rm g}$, although the hard X-ray (>2 keV) emission may\noriginate from a more compact or patchy corona of hot electrons, which is ~6-8\n$R_{\\rm g}$ in size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 12:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

So far, they have been\ninherently bound to these spaces since they make use of the inner product\nstructure. In more general Banach spaces one of the most prominent iterative\nsolvers are Landweber-type methods that essentially resemble the Steepest\nDescent method applied to the normal equation. More advanced are subspace\nmethods that take up the idea of a Krylov-type search space, wherein an optimal\nsolution is sought. However, they do not share the conjugacy property with CG\nmethods. In this article we propose that the Sequential Subspace Optimization\n(SESOP) method can be considered as an extension of CG methods to Banach\nspaces. We employ metric projections to orthogonalize the current search\ndirection with respect to the search space from the last iteration. For the\nl2-space our method then exactly coincides with the Polak-Ribi\\`ere type of the\nCG method when applied to the normal equation. We show that such an\northogonalized search space still leads to weak convergence of the subspace\nmethod. Moreover, numerical experiments on a random matrix toy problem and 2D\ncomputerized tomography on lp-spaces show superior convergence properties over\nall p compared to non-orthogonalized search spaces. This especially holds for\nlp-spaces with small p.

Therefore, the force estimation is carried out simply\nby observing the Ramsey-type oscillations of the ion spin states. Three quantum\nprobes are considered, which are represented by systems obeying the\nJaynes-Cummings, quantum Rabi (in 1D) and Jahn-Teller (in 2D) models. By using\ndynamical decoupling schemes in the Jaynes-Cummings and Jahn-Teller models, our\nforce sensing protocols can be made robust to the spin dephasing caused by the\nthermal and magnetic field fluctuations. In the quantum-Rabi probe, the\nresidual spin-phonon coupling vanishes, which makes this sensing protocol\nnaturally robust to thermally-induced spin dephasing.

A non-negligible fraction of\ncosmic ray electrons can escape from NGC 7090, so that this galaxy is not an\nelectron calorimeter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 15:45:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

We extend this study to the system composed of an excitatory population\nand an inhibitory one. We prove that this system can also blow-up in finite\ntime and analyse its steady states and long time behaviour. Besides, we\nillustrate our analytical description with some numerical results. The main\ntools used to reach our aims are: the control of an exponential moment for the\nblow-up results, a more complicate strategy than that considered in C\\'aceres,\nCarrillo and Perthame (2011), for studying the number of steady states, entropy\nmethods combined with Poincar\\'e inequalities for the long time behaviour and,\nfinally, high order numerical schemes together with parallel computation\ntechniques in order to obtain our numerical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 12:50:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 08:18:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

A path integral has a well-known statistical\nmechanical interpretation in connection with a canonical ensemble. In this\nsense, a path integral describes the thermodynamic equilibrium of a local\nsystem in a thermal bath. This interpretation is in contrast to solutions of\nEinstein's Equations which depart from local thermodynamical equilibrium (one\nexample is shown explicitly). For this reason, we examine an extension of the\npath integral model to a (locally) non-equilibrium description. As a\nnon-equilibrium description, we propose to use a global microcanonical ensemble\nwith constraints. The constraints reduce the set of admissible microscopic\nstates to be consistent with the macroscopic geometry. We also analyse the\nrelation between the microcanonical description and a statistical approach not\nbased on dynamical assumptions which has been proposed recently. This analysis\nis of interest for the test of consistency of the non-equilibrium description\nwith general relativity and quantum field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 07:17:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

This is a notoriously difficult problem (Frijda, 1986, Fehr\n\\& Russell, 1984). This paper firstly shows why this is a difficult problem by\naligning it with the conceptualization of a few other so called semantic\nprimitives such as \"EXIST\", \"FORCE\", \"BIG\" (plus \"LIMIT\"). The definitions of\nthese thought-to-be-indefinable concepts, given in this paper, show what formal\ndefinitions of concepts look like and how concepts are constructed. As a\nby-product, owing to the explicit account of the meaning of \"exist\", the famous\ndispute between Einstein and Bohr is naturally resolved from linguistic point\nof view. Secondly, defending Frijda's view that emotion is action tendency (or\nRyle's behavioral disposition (propensity)), we give a list of emotions defined\nin terms of action tendency. In particular, the definitions of pleasure and the\nfeeling of beauty are presented.\n  Further, we give a formal definition of \"action tendency\", from which the\nconcept of \"intensity\" of emotions (including pleasure) is naturally derived in\na formal fashion. The meanings of \"wish\", \"wait\", \"good\", \"hot\" are analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2016 22:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-28"}
