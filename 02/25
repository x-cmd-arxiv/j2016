It is commonly assumed that\n$\\Theta>\\Theta_c({\\rm{Re}}_*)$ occurs when the ${\\rm Re}_*$-dependent fluid\nforces are too large to maintain static equilibrium for a typical surface\ngrain. A complimentary approach, which remains relatively unexplored, is to\nidentify $\\Theta_c({\\rm{Re}}_*)$ as the applied shear stress at which grains\ncannot stop moving. With respect to grain dynamics, ${\\rm{Re}}_*$ can be viewed\nas the viscous time scale for a grain to equilibrate to the fluid flow divided\nby the typical time for the fluid force to accelerate a grain over the\ncharacteristic bed roughness. We performed simulations of granular beds sheared\nby a model fluid, varying only these two time scales. We find that the critical\nShields number $\\Theta_c({\\rm Re}_*)$ obtained from the model mimics the\nShields curve and is insensitive to the grain properties, the model fluid flow,\nand the form of the drag law. Quantitative discrepancies between the model\nresults and the Shields curve are consistent with previous calculations of lift\nforces at varying ${\\rm Re}_*$. Grains at low ${\\rm Re}_*$ find more stable\nconfigurations than those at high ${\\rm{Re}}_*$ due to differences in the grain\nreorganization dynamics. Thus, instead of focusing on mechanical equilibrium of\na typical grain at the bed surface, $\\Theta_c({\\rm{Re}}_*)$ may be better\ndescribed by the stress at which mobile grains cannot find a stable\nconfiguration and stop moving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 16:04:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 14:15:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 21:11:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 17:15:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-04"}

There is a need in the\nfields of high-energy astronomy and solar physics for new medium-energy\ngamma-ray (~0.4 - 10 MeV) detectors capable of making sensitive observations. A\nfast scintillator- based Compton telescope with SiPM readouts is a promising\nsolution to this instrumentation challenge, since the fast response of the\nscintillators permits the rejection of background via time-of-flight (ToF)\ndiscrimination. The Solar Compton Telescope (SolCompT) prototype was designed\nto demonstrate stable performance of this technology under balloon-flight\nconditions. The SolCompT instrument was a simple two-element Compton telescope,\nconsisting of an approximately one-inch cylindrical stilbene crystal for a\nscattering detector and a one-inch cubic LaBr3:Ce crystal for a calorimeter\ndetector. Both scintillator detectors were read out by 2 x 2 arrays of\nHamamatsu S11828-3344 MPPC devices. Custom front-end electronics provided\noptimum signal rise time and linearity, and custom power supplies automatically\nadjusted the SiPM bias voltage to compensate for temperature-induced gain\nvariations. A tagged calibration source, consisting of ~240 nCi of Co-60\nembedded in plastic scintillator, was placed in the field of view and provided\na known source of gamma rays to measure in flight. The SolCompT balloon payload\nwas launched on 24 August 2014 from Fort Sumner, NM, and spent ~3.75 hours at a\nfloat altitude of ~123,000 feet. The instrument performed well throughout the\nflight.

We consider an\nobjective function that involves the mean and variance of the control\nobjective, leading to a risk-averse optimal control problem. To make the\nproblem tractable, we invoke a quadratic Taylor series approximation of the\ncontrol objective with respect to the uncertain parameter. This enables\nderiving explicit expressions for the mean and variance of the control\nobjective in terms of its gradients and Hessians with respect to the uncertain\nparameter. The risk-averse optimal control problem is then formulated as a\nPDE-constrained optimization problem with constraints given by the forward and\nadjoint PDEs defining these gradients and Hessians. The expressions for the\nmean and variance of the control objective under the quadratic approximation\ninvolve the trace of the (preconditioned) Hessian and are thus prohibitive to\nevaluate. To address this, we employ trace estimators that only require a\nmodest number of Hessian-vector products. We illustrate our approach with two\nproblems: the control of a semilinear elliptic PDE with an uncertain boundary\nsource term, and the control of a linear elliptic PDE with an uncertain\ncoefficient field. For the latter problem, we derive adjoint-based expressions\nfor efficient computation of the gradient of the risk-averse objective with\nrespect to the controls. Our method ensures that the cost of computing the\nrisk-averse objective and its gradient with respect to the control, measured in\nthe number of PDE solves, is independent of the (discretized) parameter and\ncontrol dimensions, and depends only on the number of random vectors employed\nin the trace estimation.

One state-of-practice approach to structure\ninformation is to establish trace links between artifacts, a practice that is\nalso enforced by several development standards. Unfortunately, manually\nmaintaining trace links in an evolving system is a tedious task. To tackle this\nissue, several researchers have proposed treating the capture and recovery of\ntrace links as an Information Retrieval (IR) problem. The work contains a\nSystematic Literature Review (SLR) of previous evaluations of IR-based trace\nrecovery. We show that a majority of previous evaluations have been\ntechnology-oriented, conducted in \"the cave of IR evaluation\", using small\ndatasets as experimental input. Also, software artifacts originating from\nstudent projects have frequently been used in evaluations. We conducted a\nsurvey among traceability researchers, and found that a majority consider\nstudent artifacts to be only partly representative to industrial counterparts.\nOur findings call for additional case studies to evaluate IR-based trace\nrecovery within the full complexity of an industrial setting. Also, this thesis\ncontributes to the body of empirical evidence of IR-based trace recovery in two\nexperiments with industrial software artifacts. The technology-oriented\nexperiment highlights the clear dependence between datasets and the accuracy of\nIR-based trace recovery, in line with findings from the SLR. The human-oriented\nexperiment investigates how different quality levels of tool output affect the\ntracing accuracy of engineers. Finally, we present how tools and methods are\nevaluated in the general field of IR research, and propose a taxonomy of\nevaluation contexts tailored for IR-based trace recovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 18:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-25"}

Results of calculations from\nthe MFT and TL approximations are compared for conditions of density,\ntemperature, and proton fraction encountered in astrophysics applications\ninvolving compact objects. The TL results for the equation of state (EOS) of\ncold pure neutron matter at sub- and near-nuclear densities agree well with\nthose of modern quantum Monte Carlo and effective field-theoretical approaches.\nAlthough the high-density EOS in the TL approximation for neutron-star matter\nis substantially softer than its MFT counterpart, it is able to support a\n$2M_\\odot$ neutron star required by recent precise determinations.

For certain\nproblems the lowest depth version of the QAOA has provable performance\nguarantees although there exist classical algorithms that have better\nguarantees. Here we argue that beyond its possible computational value the QAOA\ncan exhibit a form of Quantum Supremacy in that, based on reasonable complexity\ntheoretic assumptions, the output distribution of even the lowest depth version\ncannot be efficiently simulated on any classical device.

We investigate here the relation between the\ndynamical, stellar and gaseous disk center and the bar. In all our simulations\nthe bar center always coincides with the dynamical center, while the stellar\ndisk becomes highly asymmetric during the encounter causing the photometric\ncenter of the Magellanic galaxy disk to become mismatched with both the bar and\nthe dynamical center. The disk asymmetries persist for almost 2 Gyrs, the time\nthat it takes for the disk to be re-centered with the bar, and well after the\ncompanion has passed.

We look\nfor simple modifications to the nonlinear evolution of the gravitational\npotential $\\psi$ that lead on large scales to the correct, fully relativistic\ndescription of density perturbations in the Newtonian gauge. We note that the\nrelativistic constraint equation for $\\psi$ can be cast as a diffusion\nequation, with a diffusion length scale determined by the expansion of the\nUniverse. Exploiting the weak time evolution of $\\psi$ in all regimes of\ninterest, this equation can be further accurately approximated as a Helmholtz\nequation, with an effective relativistic 'screening' scale $\\ell$ related to\nthe Hubble radius. We demonstrate that it is thus possible to carry out N-body\nsimulations in the Newtonian gauge by replacing Poisson's equation with this\nHelmholtz equation, involving a trivial change in the Green's function kernel.\nOur results also motivate a simple, approximate (but very accurate) gauge\ntransformation - $\\delta_{\\rm N}(\\mathbf{k}) \\approx \\delta_{\\rm\nsim}(\\mathbf{k})\\times (k^2+\\ell^{-2})/k^2$ - to convert the density field\n$\\delta_{\\rm sim}$ of standard collisionless N-body simulations (initialised in\nthe comoving synchronous gauge) into the Newtonian gauge density $\\delta_{\\rm\nN}$ at arbitrary times. A similar conversion can also be written in terms of\nparticle positions. Our results can be interpreted in terms of a Jeans\nstability criterion induced by the expansion of the Universe. The appearance of\nthe screening scale $\\ell$ in the evolution of $\\psi$, in particular, leads to\na natural resolution of the 'Jeans swindle' in the presence of super-horizon\nmodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 21:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 10:16:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-17"}

BH superradiance is a very interdisciplinary topic, and\nits study allows us to obtain important results in the area of particle\nphysics. The scattering of a scalar field by a rotating BH leads to the\nformation of quasi-boundstates. In rotational systems, these states can give\nrise to superradiant instabilities.

The trade-off between robustness to winds and\nsensitivity to faults is challenging due to simultaneous influence of winds and\nlatent faults on monitored sensors. Different from conventional residual\ngenerators that do not consider any constraints, we propose a constrained\nresidual generator using moving horizon estimation. The main contribution is\nimproved fault sensitivity by exploiting known bounds on winds in residual\ngeneration. By analyzing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the formulated\nmoving horizon estimation problem, it is shown that this improvement is\nattributed to active inequality constraints caused by faults. When the\nweighting matrices in the moving horizon estimation problem are tuned to\nincrease robustness to winds, its fault sensitivity does not simply decrease as\none would expect in conventional unconstrained residual generators. Instead,\nits fault sensitivity increases when the fault is large enough to activate some\ninequality constraints. This fault sensitivity improvement is not restricted to\nthis particular application, but can be achieved by any general moving horizon\nestimation based residual generator. A high-fidelity Airbus simulator is used\nto illustrate the advantage of our proposed approach in terms of fault\nsensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 22:27:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-26"}

It is shown\nthat the random time of arrival can be represented as an additive noise\nchannel, and for the diffusion-based MT (DBMT) channel this noise is\ndistributed according to the L\\'evy distribution. Lower and upper bounds on the\ncapacity of the DBMT channel are derived for the case where the delay\nassociated with the propagation of the information particles in the channel is\nfinite, namely, when the information particles dissipate after a finite time\ninterval. For the case where a single particle is released per channel use,\nthese bounds are shown to be tight. When the transmitter simultaneously\nreleases a large number of particles, the detector at the receiver may not be\nable to precisely detect the arrival time of all the particles. Therefore, two\nalternative models are considered: detection based on the particle that arrives\nfirst, or detection based on the average arrival times. Tight lower and upper\nbounds are derived for these two models. It is shown that by controlling the\nmaximal delay of the information particles, the capacity can increase\npoly-logarithmically with the number of released particles. As each particle\ntakes a random independent path, this diversity of paths is analogous to\nreceiver diversity and can be used to considerably increase the achievable data\nrates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 00:16:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2017 22:01:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Apr 2018 23:49:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-05"}

As a result, the\nviewer generally needs a comprehensive summary of the previous season plot\nbefore the new one starts. The generation of such summaries requires first to\nidentify and characterize the dynamics of the series subplots. One way of doing\nso is to study the underlying social network of interactions between the\ncharacters involved in the narrative. The standard tools used in the Social\nNetworks Analysis field to extract such a network rely on an integration of\ntime, either over the whole considered period, or as a sequence of several\ntime-slices. However, they turn out to be inappropriate in the case of TV\nseries, due to the fact the scenes showed onscreen alternatively focus on\nparallel storylines, and do not necessarily respect a traditional chronology.\nThis makes existing extraction methods inefficient to describe the dynamics of\nrelationships between characters, or to get a relevant instantaneous view of\nthe current social state in the plot. This is especially true for characters\nshown as interacting with each other at some previous point in the plot but\ntemporarily neglected by the narrative. In this article, we introduce narrative\nsmoothing, a novel, still exploratory, network extraction method. It smooths\nthe relationship dynamics based on the plot properties, aiming at solving some\nof the limitations present in the standard approaches. In order to assess our\nmethod, we apply it to a new corpus of 3 popular TV series, and compare it to\nboth standard approaches. Our results are promising, showing narrative\nsmoothing leads to more relevant observations when it comes to the\ncharacterization of the protagonists and their relationships.

Bend and layer complexities\nare two important aesthetics of such a drawing. The bend complexity of $\\Gamma$\nis the maximum number of bends per edge in $\\Gamma$, and the layer complexity\nof $\\Gamma$ is the minimum integer $r$ such that the set of polygonal chains in\n$\\Gamma$ can be partitioned into $r$ disjoint sets, where each set corresponds\nto a planar polyline drawing. Let $G$ be a graph of thickness $t$. By\nF\\'{a}ry's theorem, if $t=1$, then $G$ can be drawn on a single layer with bend\ncomplexity $0$. A few extensions to higher thickness are known, e.g., if $t=2$\n(resp., $t>2$), then $G$ can be drawn on $t$ layers with bend complexity 2\n(resp., $3n+O(1)$).

In both of these problems, the cost function meets an\nadditional constraint: the cost of using a specific colour is the same for\nevery vertex of the input graph. We study minimum cost homomorphism problems\nwith cost functions constrained to have this property. Clearly, when the\nstandard minimum cost homomorphism problem is polynomial, then the problem with\nconstrained costs is also polynomial. We expect that the same may hold for the\ncases when the standard minimum cost homomorphism problem is NP-complete. We\nprove that this is the case for trees $H$: we obtain a dichotomy of minimum\nconstrained cost homomorphism problems which coincides with the dichotomy of\nstandard minimum cost homomorphism problems. For general graphs $H$, we prove a\npartial dichotomy: the problem is polynomial if $H$ is a proper interval graph\nand NP-complete when $H$ is not chordal bipartite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 07:34:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 08:54:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 06:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-23"}

This cannot be explained\nby observational biases because many Neptunian planets with longer orbital\nperiods have been detected. The existence of this desert is similar to the\nappearance of the so-called brown-dwarf desert that suggests different\nformation mechanisms of planets and stellar companions with short orbital\nperiods. Similarly, the Neptunian desert might indicate different mechanisms of\nformation and evolution for hot Jupiters and short-period super-Earths. We here\nfollow a previous study and examine the location and shape of the desert in\nboth the period-mass and period-radius planes, using the currently available\nlarge samples of planets. The desert in the period-mass plane has a relatively\nsharp upper edge, with a planetary mass that is inversely proportional to the\nplanetary orbital period, while the lower, somewhat blurred, boundary is\nlocated along masses that are apparently linearly proportional to the period.\nThe desert in the period-radius plane of the transiting planets is less clear.\nIt seems as if the radius along the upper boundary is inversely proportional to\nthe period to the power of one-third, while the lower boundary shows a radius\nthat is proportional to the period to the power of two-thirds. The combination\nof the two upper bounds of the desert, in the period-mass and period-radius\nplanes, yields a planetary mass-radius relation of $R_{\\rm p}/R_{\\rm Jup}\\simeq\n(1.2\\pm0.3)(M_{\\rm p}/M_{\\rm Jup})^{0.27\\pm0.11}\\,$ for $ 0.1\\lesssim M_{\\rm\np}/M_{\\rm Jup}\\lesssim 1$.

(2004)\nas an exotic quasar at $z_{\\rm em}=3.020$. In contrast to prominent broad\nmetal--line emissions with FWHM~9000 km/s, only a narrow Ly \\alpha emission\nline is present with FWHM~1000 km/s. The absence of broad Ly alpha emission\nline has been a mystery for more than a decade. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat this is due to dark Proximate Damped Ly alpha Absorption (PDLA) at $z_{\\rm\nabs}=3.010$ by identifying associated Lyman absorption line series from the\ndamped Ly beta up to Ly9, as well as the Lyman limit absorption edge. The PDLA\ncloud has a column density of $\\log N_{\\rm H\\,I}({\\rm cm}^{-2})=21.8\\pm0.2$, a\nmetallicity of [Zn/H]$>-1.0$, and a spatial extent exceeding the Narrow\nEmission Line Region (NELR) of the quasar. With a luminosity of $L_{{\\rm\nLy}\\alpha}\\sim10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the residual Ly alpha emission superposed\non the PDLA trough is of two orders of magnitude stronger than previous\nreports. This is best explained as re-radiated photons arising from the quasar\noutflowing gas at a scale larger than the NELR. The PDLA here, acting like a\nnatural coronagraph, provides us with a good insight into the illuminated gas\nin the vicinity of the quasar, which are usually hard to resolve due to their\nsmall size and \"seeing fuzz\" of bright quasars. Notably, SDSS J0952+0114\nanalogs might be easily omitted in the spectroscopic surveys of DLAs and PDLAs,\nas their damped Ly alpha troughs can be fully filled by additional strong Ly\nalpha emissions. Our preliminary survey shows that such systems are not very\nrare. They are potentially a unique sample for probing strong quasar feedback\nphenomena in the early universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 10:53:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 16:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

In\nthis paper, we report a long laser pulse induced dual photoacoustic (LDPA)\nnonlinear effect, which originates from unsatisfied stress and thermal\nconfinements. Being different from conventional short laser pulse illumination,\nthe proposed method utilizes a long square-profile laser pulse to induce dual\nphotoacoustic signals. Without satisfying the stress confinement, the dual\nphotoacoustic signals are generated following the positive and negative edges\nof the long laser pulse. More interestingly, the first expansion-induced\nphotoacoustic signal exhibits positive waveform due to the initial sharp rising\nof temperature. On the contrary, the second contraction-induced photoacoustic\nsignal exhibits exactly negative waveform due to the falling of temperature, as\nwell as pulse-width-dependent signal amplitude which is caused by the\nconcurrent heat accumulation and thermal diffusion during the long laser\nillumination.

In\nthis work we apply the FH formulation to the study of Ne$_N$-coronene clusters\n($N=$ 1-4, 14) in the 2-14 K temperature range. Quadratic (FH2) and quartic\n(FH4) contributions to the effective potentials are built upon Ne-Ne and\nNe-coronene analytical potentials. In particular, a new corrected expression\nfor the FH4 effective potential is reported. FH2 and FH4 cluster energies and\nstructures -obtained from energy optimization through a basin-hoping algorithm\nas well as classical Monte Carlo simulations- are reported and compared with\nreference path integral Monte Carlo calculations. For temperatures $T> 4$ K,\nboth FH2 and FH4 potentials are able to correct the purely classical\ncalculations in a consistent way. However, the FH approach fails at lower\ntemperatures, especially the quartic correction. It is thus crucial to assess\nthe range of applicability of this formulation and, in particular, to apply the\nFH4 potentials with great caution. A simple model of $N$ isotropic harmonic\noscillators allows us to propose a means of estimating the cut-off temperature\nfor the validity of the method, which is found to increase with the number of\natoms adsorbed on the coronene molecule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 12:14:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2016 09:27:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

We investigate the environmental dependence of the stellar mass\nfundamental plane (FP$_*$) using the early-type galaxy sample from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7).\n  Methods. The FP$_*$ is calculated by replacing the luminosity in the\nfundamental plane (FP) with stellar mass. Based on the SDSS group catalog, we\ncharacterize the galaxy environment according to the mass of the host dark\nmatter halo and the position in the halo. In halos with the same mass bin, the\ncolor distributions of central and satellite galaxies are different. Therefore,\nwe calculate FP$_*$ coefficients of galaxies in different environments and\ncompare them with those of the FP to study the contribution of the stellar\npopulation.\n  Results. We find that coefficient $a$ of the FP$_*$ is systematically larger\nthan that of the FP, but coefficient $b$ of the FP$_*$ is similar to the FP.\nMoreover, the environmental dependence of the FP$_*$ is similar to that of the\nFP. For central galaxies, FP$_*$ coefficients are significantly dependent on\nthe halo mass.

The presentations and\ndiscussion of key issues for instrumentation and data analysis and the workshop\nrecommendations for achieving this precision are summarized here.\n  Beginning with the HARPS spectrograph, technological advances for precision\nradial velocity measurements have focused on building extremely stable\ninstruments. To reach still higher precision, future spectrometers will need to\nproduce even higher fidelity spectra. This should be possible with improved\nenvironmental control, greater stability in the illumination of the\nspectrometer optics, better detectors, more precise wavelength calibration, and\nbroader bandwidth spectra. Key data analysis challenges for the precision\nradial velocity community include distinguishing center of mass Keplerian\nmotion from photospheric velocities, and the proper treatment of telluric\ncontamination. Success here is coupled to the instrument design, but also\nrequires the implementation of robust statistical and modeling techniques.\nCenter of mass velocities produce Doppler shifts that affect every line\nidentically, while photospheric velocities produce line profile asymmetries\nwith wavelength and temporal dependencies that are different from Keplerian\nsignals.\n  Exoplanets are an important subfield of astronomy and there has been an\nimpressive rate of discovery over the past two decades. Higher precision radial\nvelocity measurements are required to serve as a discovery technique for\npotentially habitable worlds and to characterize detections from transit\nmissions.

Indeed, icosahedral symmetry\nobserved in virus capsids corresponds to potential energy minima that occur for\nmagic numbers of, e.g., 12, 32 and 72 identical Lennard-Jones particles, for\nwhich the packing has exactly the minimum number of twelve five-fold defects.\nIt is unclear, however, how stable these structures are against thermal\nagitation. We investigate this property by means of basin-hopping global\noptimisation and Langevin dynamics for particle numbers between ten and one\nhundred. An important measure is the number and type of point defects, that is,\nparticles that do not have six nearest neighbours. We find that small\nicosahedral structures are the most robust against thermal fluctuations,\nexhibiting fewer excess defects and rearrangements for a wide temperature\nrange. Furthermore, we provide evidence that excess defects appearing at low\nnon-zero temperatures lower the potential energy at the expense of entropy. At\nhigher temperatures defects are, as expected, thermally excited and thus\nentropically stabilised. If we replace the Lennard-Jones potential by a very\nshort-ranged (Morse) potential, which is arguably more appropriate for colloids\nand virus capsid proteins, we find that the same particle numbers give a\nminimum in the potential energy, although for larger particle numbers these\nminima correspond to different packings. Furthermore, defects are more\ndifficult to excite thermally for the short-ranged potential, suggesting that\nthe short-ranged interaction further stabilises equilibrium structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 14:30:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 21:59:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-03"}

Binary systems of supermassive black holes are expected to be strong\nsources of long gravitational waves prior to merging. These systems are good\ncandidates to be observed with forthcoming space-borne detectors. Only a few of\nthese systems, however, have been firmly identified to date.\n  Aims. We aim at providing a criterion for the identification of some\nsupermassive black hole binaries based on the characteristics of the\nhigh-energy emission of a putative relativistic jet launched from the most\nmassive of the two black holes.\n  Methods. We study supermassive black hole binaries where the less massive\nblack hole has carved an annular gap in the circumbinary disk, but nevertheless\nthere is a steady mass flow across its orbit. Such a perturbed disk is hotter\nand more luminous than a standard thin disk in some regions. Assuming that the\njet contains relativistic electrons, we calculate its broadband spectral energy\ndistribution focusing on the inverse Compton up-scattering of the disk photons.\nWe also compute the opacity to the gamma rays produced in the jet by photon\nannihilation with the disk radiation and take into account the effects of the\nanisotropy of the target photon field as seen from the jet.\n  Results. We find that the excess of low-energy photons radiated by the\nperturbed disk causes an increment in the external Compton emission from the\njet in the X-ray band, and a deep absorption feature at energies of tens of\nTeVs for some sets of parameters. According to our results, observations with\nCherenkov telescopes might help in the identification of supermassive black\nhole binaries, especially those black hole binaries that host primaries from\ntens to hundreds of million of solar masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 14:50:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

These cryptic\nrelationships violate the GWAS assumption regarding the independence of the\nsubjects' genomes, and failure to account for these relationships results in\nboth false positives and false negatives.\n  This paper presents a method to correct for these cryptic relationships. We\naccurately detect distant relationships using an expectation maximization (EM)\nalgorithm for finding the identity coefficients from genotype data with know\nprior knowledge of relationships. From the identity coefficients we compute the\nkinship coefficients and employ a kinship-corrected association test.\n  We assess the accuracy of our EM kinship estimation algorithm. We show that\non genomes simulated from a Wright-Fisher pedigree, our method converges\nquickly and requires only a relatively small number of sites to be accurate. We\nalso demonstrate that our kinship coefficient estimates outperform\nstate-of-the-art covariance-based approaches and PLINK's kinship estimate.\n  To assess the kinship-corrected association test, we simulated individuals\nfrom deep pedigrees and drew one site to recessively determine the disease\nstatus. We applied our EM algorithm to estimate the kinship coefficients and\nran a kinship-adjusted association test. Our approach compares favorably with\nthe state-of-the-art and far out-performs a na\\\"ive association test.\n  We advocate use of our method to detect cryptic relationships and for\ncorrecting association tests. Not only is our model easy to interpret due to\nthe use of identity states as latent variables, but also inference provides\nstate-of-the-art accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 14:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-26"}

They are less luminous than\nother supernova (SN) types and they evolve more rapidly to reveal nebular\nspectra dominated by strong calcium lines with weak or absent signatures of\nother intermediate- and iron-group elements, which are seen in other SNe.\nStrikingly, their explosion sites also mark them out as distinct from other SN\ntypes. Their galactocentric offset distribution is strongly skewed to very\nlarge offsets (around one third are offset greater than 20 kpc), meaning they\ndo not trace the stellar light of their hosts. Many of the suggestions to\nexplain this extreme offset distribution have invoked the necessity for unusual\nformation sites such as globular clusters or dwarf satellite galaxies, which\nare therefore difficult to detect. Building on previous work attempting to\ndetect host systems of nearby Ca-rich SNe, we here present Hubble Space\nTelescope imaging of 5 members of the class - 3 exhibiting large offsets and 2\ncoincident with the disk of their hosts. We find no underlying sources at the\nexplosion sites of any of our sample. Combining with previous work, the lack of\na host system now appears to be a ubiquitous feature amongst Ca-rich SNe. In\nthis case the offset distribution is most readily explained as a signature of\nhigh-velocity progenitor systems that have travelled significant distances\nbefore exploding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 13:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

Especially when we are dealing in microscopic to mesoscopic level of\nsystems. Meaning if we denote x the point in space and t as point in time; then\nthe differentials dx (and dt) cannot be taken to limit zero, rather it has\nspread. A way to take this into account is to use infinitesimal quantities as\n(\\Deltax)^\\alpha (and (\\Deltat)^\\alpha) with 0<\\alpha<1, which for very-very\nsmall \\Deltax (and \\Deltat); that is trending towards zero, these 'fractional'\ndifferentials are greater that \\Deltax (and \\Deltat).

To cope with the long channel delay spread and the low signal-to-noise\nratio, hydroacoustic signals are constructed with a large time-bandwidth\nproduct, $N$. A promising detector for hydroacoustic signals is the normalized\nmatched filter (NMF). For the NMF, the detection threshold depends only on $N$,\nthereby obviating the need to estimate the characteristics of the sea ambient\nnoise which are time-varying and hard to estimate.
