In this paper, local codes with cooperative repair,\nin which the local codes are constructed based on minimum storage regeneration\n(MSR) codes, is proposed to achieve repairing the failed groups. Specifically,\nthe proposed local codes with cooperative repair construct a kind of mutual\ninterleaving structure among the parity symbols, that the parity symbols of\neach local code, named as distributed local parity, can be generated by the\nparity symbols of the MSR codes in its two adjacent local codes. Taking\nadvantage of the structure given, the failed local groups can be repaired\ncooperatively by their adjacent local groups with lower repair locality, and\nmeanwhile the minimum distance of local codes with cooperative repair is\nderived.

The dependence of species richness on the\nstrength of environmental stochasticity changes sign when the correlation time\nof the environmental variations increases.

In this paper, we consider a new and complementary problem of how to\nfurther increase the influence spread of given seeders. Our study is motivated\nby the observation that direct incentives could \"boost\" users so that they are\nmore likely to be influenced by friends. We study the $k$-boosting problem\nwhich aims to find $k$ users to boost so that the final \"boosted\" influence\nspread is maximized. The $k$-boosting problem is different from the IM problem\nbecause boosted users behave differently from seeders: boosted users are\ninitially uninfluenced and we only increase their probability to be influenced.\nOur work also complements the IM studies because we focus on triggering larger\ninfluence spread on the basis of given seeders. Both the NP-hardness of the\nproblem and the non-submodularity of the objective function pose challenges to\nthe $k$-boosting problem. To tackle the problem on general graphs, we devise\ntwo efficient algorithms with the data-dependent approximation ratio. For the\n$k$-boosting problem on bidirected trees, we present an efficient greedy\nalgorithm and a rounded dynamic programming that is a fully polynomial-time\napproximation scheme. We conduct extensive experiments using real social\nnetworks and synthetic bidirected trees.

Their unique optical, electronic and\nmechanical properties hold great potential for harnessing them as key\ncomponents in novel applications for electronics and optoelectronics. However,\nthe charge transport behavior in 2D semiconductors is more susceptible to\nexternal surroundings (e.g. gaseous adsorbates from air and trapped charges in\nsubstrates) and their electronic performance is generally lower than\ncorresponding bulk materials due to the fact that surface and bulk coincide. In\nthis article, we review recent progress on the charge transport properties and\ncarrier mobility engineering of 2D transition metal chalcogenides, with a\nparticular focus on the markedly high dependence of carrier mobility on\nthickness. We unveil the origin of this unique thickness dependence and\nelaborate the devised strategies to master it for carrier mobility\noptimization.

In this context, a new way to\nselect the factor axes (eigenvectors) according to their spatial information is\nintroduced. Then, a spectral classification produces a spectral\npre-segmentation of the image. Subsequently, a probability density function\n(pdf) of contours containing spatial and spectral information is estimated by\nsimulation using a stochastic WS approach driven by the spectral\nclassification. The pdf of the contours is finally segmented by a WS controlled\nby markers from a regularization of the initial classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 20:02:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-10"}

In this paper we\nfocus on superintegrable systems in two dimensions, $n = 2$, where there are 44\nHelmholtz systems, corresponding to 12 Laplace systems.

For this purpose we built a numerical model of the cloud\nassuming QUMOND, a modified gravity theory of MD. In the modified gravity\nversions of MD, the internal dynamics of a system is influenced by the external\ngravitational field in which the system is embedded, even when this external\nfield is constant and uniform, a phenomenon dubbed the external field effect\n(EFE). Adopting the popular pair $\\nu(x)=[1-\\exp(-x^{1/2})]^{-1}$ for the MD\ninterpolating function and $a_{0}=1.2\\times10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$ for the MD\nacceleration scale, we found that the observationally inferred Milgromian cloud\nof comets is much more radially compact than its Newtonian counterpart. The\ncomets of the Milgromian cloud stay away from the zone where the Galactic tide\ncan torque their orbits significantly. However, this does not need to be an\nobstacle for the injection of the comets into the inner solar system as the EFE\ncan induce significant change in perihelion distance during one revolution of a\ncomet around the Sun. Adopting constraints on different interpolating function\nfamilies and a revised value of $a_{0}$ (provided recently by the Cassini\nspacecraft), the aforementioned qualitative results no longer hold, and, in\nconclusion, the Milgromian cloud is very similar to the Newtonian in its\noverall size, binding energies of comets and hence the operation of the\nJupiter-Saturn barrier. However, EFE torquing of perihelia still play a\nsignificant role in the inner parts of the cloud. Consequently Sedna-like\norbits and orbits of large semi-major axis Centaurs are easily comprehensible\nin MD.

While the mechanisms of worm infection and their\npropagation models are well understood, defense against worms remains an open\nproblem. One branch of defense research investigates the behavioral difference\nbetween worm-infected hosts and normal hosts to set them apart. One particular\nobservation is that a worm-infected host, which scans the Internet with\nrandomly selected addresses, has a much higher connection-failure rate than a\nnormal host.

The weakling in this structure though is the presence of aperiodic\nsecular variation in the solution that does not agree with the known periodic\npropagation of surface waves. This has historically necessitated increasingly\nhigher ordered (perturbative) approximations in the representation of the\nvelocity profile. The present article ameliorates this long standing\ntheoretical insufficiency by invoking a compact exact $n$-ordered solution in\nthe asymptotic infinite depth limit, primarily based on a representation\nstructured around the third ordered perturbative solution, that leads to a\nseamless extension to higher order (e.g. fifth order) forms existing in the\nliterature. The result from this study is expected to improve phenomenological\nengineering estimates, now that any desired higher ordered expansion may be\ncompacted within the same representation, but without any aperiodicity in the\nspectral pattern of the wave guides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 20:44:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-10"}

They, therefore, have particular\nrelevance in answering the basic question as to whether the laws of physics are\ninvariant with time. The dimesionless fundamental constants, such as the proton\nto electron mass ratio and the fine structure constant are key elements in the\ninvestigation. If they vary with time then the answer is clearly that the laws\nof physics are not invariant with time and significant new physics must be\ndeveloped to describe the universe. Limits on their variance, on the other\nhand, constrains the parameter space available to new physics that requires a\nvariation with time of basic physical law. There are now observational\nconstraints on the time variation of the proton to electron mass ratio mu at\nthe 1.E-7 level. Constraints on the variation of the fine structure constant\nalpha are less rigorous, 1E-5, but are imposed at higher redshift. The\nimplications of these limits on new cosmologies that require rolling scalar\nfields has already had its first investigations. Here we address the\nimplications on basic particle physics. The proton to electron mass ratio is\nobviously dependent on the particle physics parameters that set the mass of the\nproton and the electron. To first order the ratio is dependent on a combination\nof the Quantum Chromodynamic scale, the Yukawa couplings, and the Higgs Vacuum\nExpectation Value. Here that relationship is quantitative defined for the first\ntime. When coupled with previous determinations of the relation of the fine\nstructure constant to the same parameters two constraints exist on the\nfractional variation of these parameters with time. A third independent\nconstraint involving only the three parameters could set the stage for\nconstraints on their individual fractional variation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 21:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-11"}

As a result of a WIMP elastic scattering on a\nCNT, a carbon ion might be injected in the body of the array and propagate\nthrough multiple collisions within the lattice. The ion may eventually emerge\nfrom the surface with open end CNTs, provided that its longitudinal momentum is\nlarge enough to compensate energy losses and its transverse momentum approaches\nthe channeling conditions in a single CNT. Therefore, the angle formed between\nthe WIMP wind apparent orientation and the direction of parallel carbon\nnanotube axes must be properly chosen. We focus on very low ion recoil kinetic\nenergies, related to low mass WIMPs (~ 10 GeV) where most of the existing\nexperiments have low sensitivity. Relying on some exact results on\ntwo-dimensional lattices of circular obstacles, we study the low energy ion\nmotion in the transverse plane with respect to CNT directions.

We constructed H_2 column density maps at ~18\"\nresolution using the 160micron and 250micron data from the Herschel Galactic\nplane survey Hi-GAL. We also developed an automated detection scheme that\nconfirms the existence of a SDC through its association with a peak on these\nHerschel column density maps.

We argue that this\nentails a notion of nonintegrability: a generic general relativistic model, at\nleast when coupled to cosmologically interesting matter, likely possesses\nneither differentiable Dirac observables nor a reduced phase space. It follows\nthat the standard notion of observable has to be extended to include\nnon-differentiable or even discontinuous generalized observables.

We show that basing the quantization on\nstandard topology precludes a semiclassical limit and can even prohibit any\nsolutions to the quantum constraints. Our proposed solution to this problem is\nto refine topology such that a complete set of Dirac observables becomes\ncontinuous. In the toy model, it turns out that a refinement to a polymer-type\ntopology, as e.g. used in loop gravity, is sufficient. Basing quantization of\nthe toy model on this finer topology, we find a complete set of quantum Dirac\nobservables and a suitable semiclassical limit. This strategy is applicable to\nrealistic candidate theories of quantum gravity and thereby suggests a solution\nto a long-standing problem which implies ramifications for the very concept of\nquantization.

Such an intrinsic (as opposed to being\ndriven externally by, e.g., changes in the accretion rate) variability of the\nelectromagnetic field can produce the recorded linear correlation between\nmicrovariability amplitudes and mean fluxes, help create magnetic randomness\nand seed sheared magnetic loops in jets, and lead to a better theoretical fit\nto the X-ray microvariability power spectral density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 02:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

The protecting Hamiltonian is chosen such that its degenerate\nground subspace is an error detecting code for the errors caused by the\ninteraction with the environment. We consider environments with arbitrary\nnumber of local sites, e.g. spins, whose interactions among themselves are\nlocal and bounded. Then, assuming the system is interacting with a finite\nnumber of sites in the environment, we prove that, up to second order with\nrespect to the coupling constant, decoherence and relaxation are suppressed by\na factor which grows exponentially fast with the ratio of energy penalty to the\nnorm of local interactions in the environment. The state may, however, still\nevolve unitarily inside the code subspace due to the Lamb shift effect. In the\ncontext of adiabatic quantum computation, this means that the evolution inside\nthe code subspace is effectively governed by a renormalized Hamiltonian.

For more massive\ngiants, the Na overabundance increases with stellar mass. This trend agrees\nwell with predictions of stellar evolutionary models. Chemical evolution models\nthat are able to fit well the observed [Na/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] trend in solar\nneighborhood dwarfs can not simultaneously explain the run of [Al/Fe] with\n[Fe/H], and viceversa. The comparison with stellar ages is hampered by severe\nuncertainties. Indeed, reliable age estimates are available for only a half of\nthe stars of the sample. We conclude that Al is underproduced by the models,\nexcept for stellar ages younger than about 7 Gyr. In addition, some significant\nsource of late Na production seems to be missing in the models. Either current\nNa and Al yields are affected by large uncertainties, and/or some important\nGalactic source(s) of these elements has not been taken into account up to now.\n[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 07:37:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 11:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

Particularly, the first model unifies the late and early-time\nacceleration with the matter domination era, and the second model unifies all\nthe evolution eras of our Universe. The two models are described in the same\nway at early and late times, and only the intermediate stages of the evolution\nhave some differences. Each cosmological model contains two Type IV\nsingularities which are chosen to occur one at the end of the inflationary era\nand one at the end of the matter domination era. The cosmological models at\nearly times are approximately identical to the $R^2$ inflation model, so these\ndescribe a slow-roll inflationary era which ends when the slow-roll parameters\nbecome of order one. The inflationary era is followed by the radiation era and\nafter that the matter domination era follows, which lasts until the second Type\nIV singularity, and then the late-time acceleration era follows. The models\nproduce a nearly scale invariant power spectrum of primordial curvature\nperturbations and a scalar-to-tensor ratio which are compatible with the most\nrecent observational data and it seems that the deceleration acceleration\ntransition is crucially affected by the presence of the second Type IV\nsingularity which occurs at the end of the matter domination era.

One major motivation is to analyse\nthe validity of accretion treatment used in previous 1D stellar evolution\nstudies. We analyse the effect of accretion on the structure of a realistic\nstellar model of the young Sun. Our work is inspired by the numerical work of\nKley \\& Lin (1996, ApJ, 461, 933) devoted to the structure of the boundary\nlayer in accretion disks. We analyse the redistribution of accreted material\nwith a range of values of specific entropy relative to the bulk specific\nentropy of the material in the accreting object's convective envelope. A\nprimary goal is to understand whether and how accreted energy deposited onto a\nstellar surface is redistributed in the interior. This study focusses on the\nhigh accretion rates characteristic of FU Ori systems. We find that the highest\nentropy cases produce a distinctive behaviour in the mass redistribution, rms\nvelocities, and enthalpy flux in the convective envelope. This change in\nbehaviour is characterised by the formation of a hot layer on the surface of\nthe accreting object, which tends to suppress convection in the envelope. We\nanalyse the long-term effect of such a hot buffer zone on the structure and\nevolution of the accreting object with 1D stellar evolution calculations. We\nstudy the relevance of the assumption of redistribution of accreted energy into\nthe stellar interior used in the literature. One conclusion is that, for a\ngiven amount of accreted energy transferred to the accreting object, a\ntreatment assuming accretion energy redistribution throughout the stellar\ninterior could significantly overestimate the effects on the stellar structure,\nin particular, on the resulting expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 10:47:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

In this case\nevery receiver is equipped with one reconfigurable antenna which tries to place\nits desired signal in a subspace which is linearly independent from\ninterference signals.

Plants thus allocate\nbiomass for self-support in order to maintain their leaves horizontal.

Since\nthen, research on digital technology use has focused on the middle and high\nschool levels. Given the increasing diversity of digital technologies, and\ntheir varied underlying pedagogical goals and design choices, Clements' (2002)\nclaim that there is no single effect of the computer on mathematics achievement\nis as true now as it was a decade ago. However, many advances have been made in\nbetter articulating the range of design choices that are possible, their\npotential effect on the cognitive and affective dimensions on mathematics\nlearning, and their varying demands on the teacher. The aim of this chapter is\nto summarise the research literature on the use of digital technologies in the\nteaching and learning of mathematics at the k-2 level. In particular, we focus\non literature that contributes to our understanding of how the use of digital\ntechnologies affects and changes the teaching and learning of mathematics -\nthat is, how different affordances and design choices impact on the way\nteachers and learners interact and express themselves mathematically. By\ndigital technologies we refer to a range of tools including multi-purpose\ncomputer-based software programs, web-based applets, virtual manipulatives,\nprogramming languages, CD-ROMs, games, calculators, touchscreen applications\nand interactive whiteboards. The distinction between these various types is not\nalways evident and, indeed, one goal of this chapter is to provide useful\ndistinguishing features of these various technologies in order to help\neducators better evaluate and choose amongst them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 13:14:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-11"}

The CaIIH brightness is\nmaximum at locations where the phase shift between temperature and velocity\noscillations lies within 0-100 degrees. There is an indirect influence of\nconvective motions on the CaIIH brightness.

Second-order perturbations are required to capture the stabilizing\neffect of spanwise waviness, which is ignored by standard adjoint-based\nsensitivity analyses. Here, previous methods are extended so that (i) 2nd-order\nsensitivity is formulated for base flow changes satisfying linearised\nNavier-Stokes, and (ii) the resulting method is applicable to a 2D global\ninstability problem. This makes it possible to formulate 2nd-order sensitivity\nto shape modifications. Using this formulation, we find the optimal shape to\nsuppress the a cylinder wake instability. The optimal shape is then perturbed\nby random distributions in full 3D stability analysis to confirm that it is a\nlocal optimal at the given amplitude and wavelength. Furthermore, it is shown\nthat none of the 10 random wavy shapes alone stabilize the wake flow at Re=50,\nwhile the optimal shape does. At Re=100, surface waviness of maximum height 1%\nof the cylinder diameter is sufficient to stabilize the flow. The optimal\nsurface creates streaks by passively extracting energy from the base flow\nderivatives and effectively altering the tangential velocity component at the\nwall, as opposed to spanwise-wavy suction which inputs energy to the normal\nvelocity component at the wall.

However, obtaining datasets as\ncomprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a\nchallenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ\nCNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using\noff-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN\npre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer\nlearning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset\nto medical image tasks. In this paper, we exploit three important, but\npreviously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks\nto computer-aided detection problems. We first explore and evaluate different\nCNN architectures. The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million\nparameters, and vary in numbers of layers. We then evaluate the influence of\ndataset scale and spatial image context on performance. Finally, we examine\nwhen and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) can\nbe useful.

Even if there is no definitive answer to this issue, the most\ncommon procedure to express this randomness is the use of stochastic models. In\naccordance with the origin of variability, the sources of randomness are\nclassified as intrinsic or extrinsic and give rise to distinct mathematical\nframeworks to track down the dynamics of the cell. While the external\nvariability is generally treated by the use of a Wiener process in models such\nas the Integrate-and-Fire model, the internal variability is mostly expressed\nvia a random firing process. In this paper, we investigate how those distinct\nexpressions of variability can be related. To do so, we examine the probability\ndensity functions to the corresponding stochastic models and investigate in\nwhat way they can be mapped one to another via integral transforms. Our\ntheoretical findings offer a new insight view into the particular categories of\nvariability and it confirms that, despite their contrasting nature, the\nmathematical formalization of internal and external variability are strikingly\nsimilar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2016 15:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-12"}

Moreover, the other effects of\nlong-term arsenic exposure include induction of non-insulin dependent diabetes\nby mechanisms yet to be understood.

The\nkey question addressed here is the following: how does a synapse bond remain\nstabilized in the presence of high frequency thermal noise that potentially\nequates to a strong detaching force? Focusing on the average time persistence\nof an immature synapse, we show that the high frequency nodes accompanying\nlarge fluctuations are counterbalanced by low frequency nodes that evolve over\nlonger time periods. Our analysis shows that such a behavior could be easily\nexplained from the fact that the survival probability distribution is governed\nby two distinct phases, for the two different time regimes. The relatively\nshorter time scales correspond to the cohesion:adhesion induced immature bond\nformation whereas the larger time reciprocates the association:dissociation\nregime leading to TCR:pMHC signaling. From an estimation of the bond survival\nprobability, we show that at shorter time scales, this probability\n$P_{\\Delta}(\\tau)$ scales with time $\\tau$ as an universal function of a\nrescaled noise amplitude $\\frac{D}{\\Delta^2}$, such that $P_{\\Delta}(\\tau)\\sim\n\\tau^{-(\\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{D}}+\\frac{1}{2})}$, $\\Delta$ being the distance\nfrom the mean inter-membrane (T cell:Antigen Presenting Cell) separation\ndistance. The crossover from this shorter to a longer time regime leads to an\nuniversality in the dynamics, at which point the survival probability shows a\ndifferent power-law scaling compared to the one at shorter time scales. In\nbiological terms, such a crossover indicates that the TCR:pMHC bond has a\nsurvival probability with a slower decay rate than the longer LFA-1:ICAM-1 bond\njustifying its stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 21:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}
