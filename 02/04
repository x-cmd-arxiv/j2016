Examples of complex specifications of interest include\nproperties expressed as formulae in linear temporal logic (LTL) or as automata\non infinite strings. A general methodology to synthesize controllers for such\nproperties resorts to symbolic abstractions of the given stochastic systems.\nSymbolic models are discrete abstractions of the given concrete systems with\nthe property that a controller designed on the abstraction can be refined (or\nimplemented) into a controller on the original system. Although the recent\ndevelopment of techniques for the construction of symbolic models has been\nquite encouraging, the general goal of formal synthesis over stochastic control\nsystems is by no means solved. A fundamental issue with the existing techniques\nis the known \"curse of dimensionality,\" which is due to the need to discretize\nstate and input sets and that results in an exponential complexity over the\nnumber of state and input variables in the concrete system. In this work we\npropose a novel abstraction technique for incrementally stable stochastic\ncontrol systems, which does not require state-space discretization but only\ninput set discretization, and that can be potentially more efficient (and thus\nscalable) than existing approaches. We elucidate the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach by synthesizing a schedule for the coordination of two\ntraffic lights under some safety and fairness requirements for a road traffic\nmodel. Further we argue that this 5-dimensional linear stochastic control\nsystem cannot be studied with existing approaches based on state-space\ndiscretization due to the very large number of generated discrete states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2016 16:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-04"}

Semantic acyclicity has been studied in the constraint-free case,\nand deciding whether a query enjoys this property is NP-complete. However, in\ncase the database is subject to constraints such as tuple-generating\ndependencies (tgds) that can express, e.g., inclusion dependencies, or\nequality-generating dependencies (egds) that capture, e.g., functional\ndependencies, a CQ may turn out to be semantically acyclic under the\nconstraints while not semantically acyclic in general. This opens avenues to\nnew query optimization techniques. In this paper we initiate and develop the\ntheory of semantic acyclicity under constraints. More precisely, we study the\nfollowing natural problem: Given a CQ and a set of constraints, is the query\nsemantically acyclic under the constraints, or, in other words, is the query\nequivalent to an acyclic one over all those databases that satisfy the set of\nconstraints? We show that, contrary to what one might expect, decidability of\nCQ containment is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the decidability\nof semantic acyclicity. In particular, we show that semantic acyclicity is\nundecidable in the presence of full tgds (i.e., Datalog rules). In view of this\nfact, we focus on the main classes of tgds for which CQ containment is\ndecidable, and do not capture the class of full tgds, namely guarded,\nnon-recursive and sticky tgds. For these classes we show that semantic\nacyclicity is decidable, and its complexity coincides with the complexity of CQ\ncontainment. In the case of egds, we show that for keys over unary and binary\npredicates semantic acyclicity is decidable (NP-complete). We finally consider\nthe problem of evaluating a semantically acyclic query over a database that\nsatisfies a set of constraints; for guarded tgds and functional dependencies\nthis problem is tractable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2016 17:01:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2016 16:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-06"}

For these\nartificial atoms, in contrast to real atoms, variations in their parameters\ncannot be avoided. In this paper, we examine the influence of disorder on such\na multi-atom lasing setup. We find that the lasing process evolves into a\nself-organized stationary state that is quite robust against disorder. The\nreason is that photons created by those atoms which are in or close to\nresonance with the resonator stimulate the emission also of more detuned atoms.\nNot only the number of photons grows with the number of atoms, but also the\nwidth of the resonance as function of the detuning. Similar properties are\nfound for other types of disorder such as variations in the individual\ncoupling. We present relations how the allowed disorder scales with the number\nof atoms and confirm it by a numerical analysis. We also provide estimates for\nthe sample-to-sample variations to be expected for setups with moderate numbers\nof atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2016 17:03:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

We then use Monte-Carlo radiative transfer to generate\nsynthetic ALMA images of these self-gravitating discs to determine the subset\nof this parameter space in which they generate non-axisymmetric structure that\nis potentially detectable by ALMA. Recently, several transition discs have been\nobserved to have non-axisymmetric structure that extends out to large radii. It\nhas been suggested that one possible origin of these asymmetries could be\nspiral density waves induced by disc self-gravity. We use our simple model to\nsee if these discs exist in the region of parameter space where self-gravity\ncould feasibly explain these spiral features. We find that for self-gravity to\nplay a role in these systems typically requires a disc mass around an order of\nmagnitude higher than the observed disc masses for the systems. The spiral\namplitudes produced by self-gravity in the local approximation are relatively\nweak when compared to amplitudes produced by tidal interactions, or spirals\nlaunched at Lindblad resonances due to embedded planets in the disc. As such,\nwe ultimately caution against diagnosing spiral features as being due to\nself-gravity, unless the disc exists in the very narrow region of parameter\nspace where the spiral wave amplitudes are large enough to produce detectable\nfeatures, but not so large as to cause the disc to fragment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2016 17:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Meltwater tends to stabilize the ocean column, inducing amplifying\nfeedbacks that increase subsurface ocean warming and ice shelf melting. Cold\nmeltwater and induced dynamical effects cause ocean surface cooling in the\nSouthern Ocean and North Atlantic, thus increasing Earth's energy imbalance and\nheat flux into most of the global ocean's surface. Southern Ocean surface\ncooling, while lower latitudes are warming, increases precipitation on the\nSouthern Ocean, increasing ocean stratification, slowing deepwater formation,\nand increasing ice sheet mass loss. These feedbacks make ice sheets in contact\nwith the ocean vulnerable to accelerating disintegration. We hypothesize that\nice mass loss from the most vulnerable ice, sufficient to raise sea level\nseveral meters, is better approximated as exponential than by a more linear\nresponse. Doubling times of 10, 20 or 40 years yield multi-meter sea level rise\nin about 50, 100 or 200 years. Recent ice melt doubling times are near the\nlower end of the 10-40 year range, but the record is too short to confirm the\nnature of the response. The feedbacks, including subsurface ocean warming, help\nexplain paleoclimate data and point to a dominant Southern Ocean role in\ncontrolling atmospheric CO2, which in turn exercised tight control on global\ntemperature and sea level. The millennial (500-2000 year) time scale of deep\nocean ventilation affects the time scale for natural CO2 change and thus the\ntime scale for paleo global climate, ice sheet, and sea level changes, but this\npaleo millennial time scale should not be misinterpreted as the time scale for\nice sheet response to a rapid large human-made climate forcing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2016 18:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

These problems have severely limited use of\naluminum-rich nitride films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. A way around these\nproblems is through use of a liquid-metal-enabled approach to molecular beam\nepitaxy. Although the presence of a liquid metal layer at the growth front is\nreminiscent of conventional liquid phase epitaxy, this approach is different in\nits details. Conventional liquid epitaxy is a near-thermodynamic equilibrium\nprocess which liquid-metal assisted molecular beam epitaxy is not.

We point out that the chaotic\nnature of the system combined with the flat directions of its potential\nnaturally leads to the emission of D0-branes from the black brane, which is\nsuppressed in the large $N$ limit. Simple arguments show that the black\nzero-brane, like the Schwarzschild black hole, has negative specific heat, in\nthe sense that the temperature goes up when it evaporates by emitting\nD0-branes. While the largest Lyapunov exponent grows during the evaporation,\nthe Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy decreases. These are consequences of the generic\nproperties of matrix models and gauge theory. Based on these results, we give a\npossible geometric interpretation of the eigenvalue distribution of matrices in\nterms of gravity.\n  Applying the same argument in the M-theory parameter region, we provide a\nscenario to derive the Hawking radiation of massless particles from the\nSchwarzschild black hole.

We constrain the total activity level of\nthe comet by photometry and spectroscopy to place Rosetta results in context\nand to understand the large-scale structure of the comet's coma pre-perihelion.\nWe performed observations using a number of telescopes, but concentrate on\nresults from the 8m VLT and Gemini South telescopes in Chile. We use R-band\nimaging to measure the dust coma contribution to the comet's brightness and\nUV-visible spectroscopy to search for gas emissions, primarily using VLT/FORS.\nIn addition we imaged the comet in near-infrared wavelengths (JHK) in late 2014\nwith Gemini-S/Flamingos 2. We find that the comet was already active in early\n2014 at heliocentric distances beyond 4 au. The evolution of the total activity\n(measured by dust) followed previous predictions. No gas emissions were\ndetected despite sensitive searches. The comet maintains a similar level of\nactivity from orbit to orbit, and is in that sense predictable, meaning that\nRosetta results correspond to typical behaviour for this comet. The gas\nproduction (for CN at least) is highly asymmetric with respect to perihelion,\nas our upper limits are below the measured production rates for similar\ndistances post-perihelion in previous orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2016 21:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

While custom hardware helps the computation, fetching weights\nfrom DRAM is two orders of magnitude more expensive than ALU operations, and\ndominates the required power.\n  Previously proposed 'Deep Compression' makes it possible to fit large DNNs\n(AlexNet and VGGNet) fully in on-chip SRAM. This compression is achieved by\npruning the redundant connections and having multiple connections share the\nsame weight. We propose an energy efficient inference engine (EIE) that\nperforms inference on this compressed network model and accelerates the\nresulting sparse matrix-vector multiplication with weight sharing. Going from\nDRAM to SRAM gives EIE 120x energy saving; Exploiting sparsity saves 10x;\nWeight sharing gives 8x; Skipping zero activations from ReLU saves another 3x.\nEvaluated on nine DNN benchmarks, EIE is 189x and 13x faster when compared to\nCPU and GPU implementations of the same DNN without compression.

In particular,\nit is not clear whether randomness extractors with good parameters can be\ncomputed in several interesting complexity classes that are much weaker than P.\n  In this paper we study randomness extractors in the following two models of\ncomputation: (1) constant-depth circuits (AC0), and (2) the local computation\nmodel.

To this end, the optimal\nlocations of UAVs as well as the cell boundaries of their coverage areas are\ndetermined. To find those optimal parameters, the problem is divided into two\nsub-problems that are solved iteratively. In the first sub-problem, given the\ncell boundaries corresponding to each UAV, the optimal locations of the UAVs\nare derived using the facility location framework.

Reaping the\nbenefits of a dual-mode operation requires scheduling mechanisms that can\nallocate resources efficiently and jointly at both frequency bands. In this\npaper, a novel resource allocation framework is proposed that exploits users'\ncontext, in terms of user application (UA) delay requirements, to maximize the\nquality-of-service (QoS) of a dual-mode base station. In particular, such a\ncontext-aware approach enables the network to dynamically schedule UAs, instead\nof users, thus providing more precise delay guarantees and a more efficient\nexploitation of the mmW resources. The scheduling of UAs is formulated as a\none-to-many matching problem between UAs and resources and a novel algorithm is\nproposed to solve it. The proposed algorithm is shown to converge to a\ntwo-sided stable matching between UAs and network resources. Simulation results\nshow that the proposed approach outperforms classical CSI-based scheduling in\nterms of the per UA QoS, yielding up to 36% improvement. The results also show\nthat exploiting mmW resources provides significant traffic offloads reaching up\nto 43% from \\muW band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2016 06:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

This robust problem deals with a\ngeneral-rank transmit covariance design, and it follows a safe rate-constrained\nformulation under spherically bounded CSI uncertainties. Curiously, simulation\nresults in previous works suggested that the robust problem admits rank-one\noptimal transmit covariances in most cases. Such a numerical finding is\nappealing because transmission with rank-one covariances can be easily realized\nby single-stream transmit beamforming. This gives rise to a fundamentally\nimportant question, namely, whether we can theoretically identify conditions\nunder which the robust problem admits a rank-one solution. In this paper, we\nidentify one such condition. Simply speaking, we show that the robust problem\nis guaranteed to admit a rank-one solution if the CSI uncertainties are not too\nlarge and the multiuser channel is not too poorly conditioned. To establish the\naforementioned condition, we develop a novel duality framework, through which\nan intimate relationship between the robust problem and a related maximin\nproblem is revealed. Our condition involves only a simple expression with\nrespect to the multiuser channel and other system parameters.

Provided a\nconsiderable large isospin asymmetry or isospin chemical potential, isospin\nsplittings of constituent mass, chiral phase transition boundary, and critical\npoint for $u$ and $d$ quarks can be observed for positive isovector coupling\nconstants but are suppressed for negative ones. The quark matter symmetry\nenergy decreases with the increasing isovector coupling constant, and is mostly\nenhanced in the pNJL model than in the NJL model. A positive scalar-isovector\ncoupling constant is more likely to lead to an unstable isospin asymmetric\nquark matter.

For example, when a car tries to merge in a\nroundabout it should decide on an immediate acceleration/braking command, while\nthe long term effect of the command is the success/failure of the merge. Such\nproblems are characterized by continuous state and action spaces, and by\ninteraction with multiple agents, whose behavior can be adversarial. We argue\nthat dual versions of the MDP framework (that depend on the value function and\nthe $Q$ function) are problematic for autonomous driving applications due to\nthe non Markovian of the natural state space representation, and due to the\ncontinuous state and action spaces. We propose to tackle the planning task by\ndecomposing the problem into two phases: First, we apply supervised learning\nfor predicting the near future based on the present. We require that the\npredictor will be differentiable with respect to the representation of the\npresent. Second, we model a full trajectory of the agent using a recurrent\nneural network, where unexplained factors are modeled as (additive) input\nnodes. This allows us to solve the long-term planning problem using supervised\nlearning techniques and direct optimization over the recurrent neural network.\nOur approach enables us to learn robust policies by incorporating adversarial\nelements to the environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2016 08:06:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-05"}

Especially in object localization,\ndeep convolutional neural networks outperform traditional approaches based on\nextraction of data/task-driven features instead of hand-crafted features.\nAlthough location information of region-of-interests (ROIs) gives good prior\nfor object localization, it requires heavy annotation efforts from human\nresources. Thus a weakly supervised framework for object localization is\nintroduced. The term \"weakly\" means that this framework only uses image-level\nlabeled datasets to train a network. With the help of transfer learning which\nadopts weight parameters of a pre-trained network, the weakly supervised\nlearning framework for object localization performs well because the\npre-trained network already has well-trained class-specific features. However,\nthose approaches cannot be used for some applications which do not have\npre-trained networks or well-localized large scale images. Medical image\nanalysis is a representative among those applications because it is impossible\nto obtain such pre-trained networks. In this work, we present a \"fully\" weakly\nsupervised framework for object localization (\"semi\"-weakly is the counterpart\nwhich uses pre-trained filters for weakly supervised localization) named as\nself-transfer learning (STL). It jointly optimizes both classification and\nlocalization networks simultaneously. By controlling a supervision level of the\nlocalization network, STL helps the localization network focus on correct ROIs\nwithout any types of priors. We evaluate the proposed STL framework using two\nmedical image datasets, chest X-rays and mammograms, and achieve signiticantly\nbetter localization performance compared to previous weakly supervised\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2016 10:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-05"}

Three magnetic transitions observed in\nzero magnetic field are tracked in fields applied along different\ncrystallographic directions using magnetization, heat capacity, and\nmagnetostriction measurements. Qualitatively different temperature-field\ndiagrams are obtained below 10 T for the field applied along $a$ or $b$ and\nalong $c$, respectively.

Our microscopic analysis identifies frustrated\n$J_1-J_2$ spin chains with a sizable antiferromagnetic interchain coupling in\nthe $bc$ plane and ferromagnetic couplings along the $a$ direction. The\ncompetition between these ferromagnetic interchain couplings and the helical\norder within the chain underlies the incommensurate order along the\n$a$-direction, as observed experimentally.

While NGC 6397 is often considered a core\ncollapse cluster, our analysis suggests a flattening of the surface brightness\nprofile at the smallest radii. Although it is among the nearest globular\nclusters, the low velocity dispersion of NGC 6397 of <5km/s imposes heavy\ndemands on the quality of the kinematical data. We show that despite its\nlimited spectral resolution, MUSE reaches an accuracy of 1km/s in the analysis\nof stellar spectra. We find slight evidence for a rotational component in the\ncluster and the velocity dispersion profile that we obtain shows a mild central\ncusp. To investigate the nature of this feature, we calculate spherical Jeans\nmodels and compare these models to our kinematical data. This comparison shows\nthat if a constant mass-to-light ratio is assumed, the addition of an\nintermediate-mass black hole with a mass of 600M_sun brings the model\npredictions into agreement with our data, and therefore could be at the origin\nof the velocity dispersion profile.

To get a new insight into the variability of V1184 Tau, we present new\nphotometric and spectroscopic observations taken in the period 2008-2015.\nDuring these years the source has reached the same high brightness level that\nhad before the remarkable fading of about 5 mag undergone in 2004. The optical\nspectrum is the first obtained when the continuum is at its maximum level. The\nobservations are interpreted in the framework of extinction driven variability.\nWe analyze light curves, optical and near-infrared colors, SED and optical\nspectrum. The emerging picture indicates that the source fading is due to an\nextinction increase of DeltaA_V about 5 mag, associated with a strong infrared\nexcess, attributable to a thermal component at T=1000 K. From the flux of\nH(alpha) we derive a mass accretion rate between 10^-11 -5 10^-10 M_sun yr^-1\ns, consistent with that of classical T Tauri stars of similar mass. The source\nSED was fitted for both the high and low level of brightness. A scenario\nconsistent with the known stellar properties (such as spectral type, mass and\nradius) is obtained only if the distance to the source is of few hundreds of\nparsecs, in contrast with the commonly assumed value of 1.5 kpc. Our analysis\npartially supports that presented by Grinin (2009), according to which the\ncircumstellar disk undergoes a periodical puffing, whose observational effects\nare both to shield the central star and to evidence a disk wind activity.\nHowever, since the mass accretion rate remains almost constant with time, the\nsource is likely not subject to accretion bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2016 13:54:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 11:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

In our new approach the\nnonconforming element interfaces are not defined by the user, but they are\nautomatically detected by the algorithm if the tangential velocity difference\nacross an element interface is sufficiently large. The grid nodes that are\nsufficiently far away from a shear wave are moved with a standard node solver,\nwhile at the interface we insert a new set of nodes that can slide in a\nnonconforming manner. In this way, the elements on both sides of the shear wave\ncan move with a different velocity, without producing highly distorted\nelements. The core of the proposed method is the use of a space-time\nconservation formulation in the construction of the final finite volume scheme,\nwhich completely avoids the need of an additional remapping stage and ensures\nthat the geometric conservation law (GCL) is automatically satisfied. Moreover,\nthe mesh quality remains high and, as a direct consequence, also the time step\nremains almost constant in time, even for highly sheared vortex flows. The\naccuracy of the new scheme has been further improved by incorporating a special\nwell balancing technique that is able to maintain particular stationary\nsolutions of the governing PDE system up to machine precision. A large set of\nnumerical tests has been carried out in order to check the accuracy and the\nrobustness of the new method.

Homogenization is the study of the large-scale\nproperties of these objects. In case of random coefficients, these quantities\nfluctuate and their fluctuations are a priori unrelated. Depending on the law\nof the coefficient field, and in particular on the decay of its correlations on\nlarge scales, these fluctuations may display different scalings and different\nlimiting laws (if any). In this contribution, we identify another crucial\nintrinsic quantity, motivated by H-convergence, which we refer to as the\n\\emph{homogenization commutator} and is related to variational quantities first\nconsidered by Armstrong and Smart. In the simplified setting of the random\nconductance model, we show what we believe to be a general principle, namely\nthat the homogenization commutator drives at leading order the fluctuations of\neach of the four other quantities in a strong norm in probability, which is\nexpressed in form of a suitable two-scale expansion and reveals the\n\\emph{pathwise structure} of fluctuations in stochastic homogenization. In\naddition, we show that the (rescaled) homogenization commutator converges in\nlaw to a Gaussian white noise, and we analyze to which precision the covariance\ntensor that characterizes the latter can be extracted from the representative\nvolume element method.

The model allows to calculate the\nelectric field outside the electrode sheaths, space and time resolved within\nthe RF period. Electrons are found to be heated by strong ambipolar electric\nfields outside the sheath during the phase of sheath expansion in addition to\nclassical sheath expansion heating. By tracing individual electrons we also\nshow that ionization is primarily caused by electrons that collide with the\nexpanding sheath edge multiple times during one phase of sheath expansion due\nto backscattering towards the sheath by collisions. A synergistic combination\nof these different heating events during one phase of sheath expansion is\nrequired to accelerate an electron to energies above the threshold for\nionization. The ambipolar electric field outside the sheath is found to be time\nmodulated due to a time modulation of the electron mean energy caused by the\npresence of sheath expansion heating only during one half of the RF period at a\ngiven electrode. This time modulation results in more electron heating than\ncooling inside the region of high electric field outside the sheath on time\naverage. If an electric field reversal is present during sheath collapse, this\ntime modulation and, thus, the asymmetry between the phases of sheath expansion\nand collapse will be enhanced.

It is shown that quantum mechanics must\nbe considered to be not a theory of particles but a classical field theory in\nthe spirit of classical electrodynamics. In this case, we are not faced with\ndifficulties in interpreting the results of the theory. In the framework of\nclassical electrodynamics, all of the well-known regularities of the\nspontaneous emission of the hydrogen atom are obtained, which is usually\nderived in the framework of quantum electrodynamics.

In describing language as a complex network,\nwhile words are usually associated with nodes, there is more variability in the\nchoice of links and different representations result in different networks.\nHere, we examine a number of such representations of the language network and\nperform a comparative analysis of their characteristics. Our results suggest\nthat, irrespective of link representation, the Ukrainian language network used\nin the selected fables is a strongly correlated, scale-free, small world.
