Also, donor density, acceptor density and donor\nactivation energy were determined via the charge balance equation. This sample\nexhibited hopping conduction below 50K and dislocation scattering closely\ncontrolled electron mobility closely. The obtained results indicated that the\nenhancement of electron mobility in double sample, compared with the single\none, can be attributed to the reduction of dislocation density, two dimensional\nimpurity density in the potential well due to background impurities, and/or\ninterface charge and strain-induced fields, which can be related to better\nelectron confinement in the channel and enhancement in the sheet carrier\nconcentration of 2DEG in this sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2016 16:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-16"}

Many important special cases (e.g. triangle\ncounting) have received significant attention. Color coding is a very general\nand powerful algorithmic technique for subgraph counting. Color coding has been\nshown to be effective in several applications, but scalable implementations are\nonly known for the special case of {\\em tree queries} (i.e. queries of\ntreewidth one).\n  In this paper we present the first efficient distributed implementation for\ncolor coding that goes beyond tree queries: our algorithm applies to any query\ngraph of treewidth $2$. Since tree queries can be solved in time linear in the\nsize of the data graph, our contribution is the first step into the realm of\ncolour coding for queries that require superlinear running time in the worst\ncase. This superlinear complexity leads to significant load balancing problems\non graphs with heavy tailed degree distributions. Our algorithm structures the\ncomputation to work around high degree nodes in the data graph, and achieves\nvery good runtime and scalability on a diverse collection of data and query\ngraph pairs as a result.

Such codes trade the bandwidth needed to repair a\nfailed node with the overall amount of data stored in the network. Minimum\nstorage regenerating (MSR) codes are an important class of optimal regenerating\ncodes that minimize (first) the amount of data stored per node and (then) the\nrepair bandwidth. Specifically, an $[n,k,d]$-$(\\alpha)$ MSR code $\\mathbb{C}$\nover $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is defined as follows. Using such a code $\\mathbb{C}$, a\nfile $\\cal{F}$ consisting of $\\alpha k$ symbols over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ can be\ndistributed among $n$ nodes, each storing $\\alpha$ symbols, in such a way that:\nThe file $\\cal{F}$ can be recovered by downloading the content of any $k$ of\nthe $n$ nodes; and the content of any failed node can be reconstructed by\naccessing any $d$ of the remaining $n-1$ nodes and downloading $\\alpha/(d-k+1)$\nsymbols from each of these nodes. Unfortunately, explicit constructions of\n$[n,k,d]$ MSR codes are known only for certain special cases: either low rate,\nnamely $k/n<0.5$, or high repair connectivity, namely $d = n-1$. Although\nsetting $d = n-1$ minimizes the repair bandwidth, it may be impractical to\nconnect to all the remaining nodes in order to repair a single failed node. Our\nmain result in this paper is an explicit construction of systematic-repair\n$[n,k,d]$ MSR codes for all possible values of parameters $n,k,d$. In\nparticular, we construct systematic-repair MSR codes of high rate $k/n>0.5$ and\nlow repair connectivity $k< d<n-1$. Such codes were not previously known to\nexist. In order to construct these codes, we solve simultaneously several\nrepair scenarios, each of which is expressible as an interference alignment\nproblem. Extension of our results beyond systematic repair remains an open\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2016 19:52:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-16"}

Using these concepts, we propose a\nframework for analyzing the performance and robustness of delta-hedging\nstrategies for path-dependent derivatives across a given set of scenarios. Our\nsetting allows for general path-dependent payoffs and does not require any\nprobabilistic assumption on the dynamics of the underlying asset, thereby\nextending previous results on robustness of hedging strategies in the setting\nof diffusion models. We obtain a pathwise formula for the hedging error for a\ngeneral path-dependent derivative and provide sufficient conditions ensuring\nthe robustness of the delta hedge. We show in particular that robust hedges may\nbe obtained in a large class of continuous exponential martingale models under\na vertical convexity condition on the payoff functional.

The magnetic field connects the rapidly rotating central\nregion with the outer envelope and extracts angular momentum from the central\nregion during gravitational collapse of the cloud core. This process is known\nas magnetic braking. Both analytical and multidimensional simulations have\nshown that disk formation is strongly suppressed by magnetic braking in\nmoderately magnetized cloud cores in the ideal magnetohydrodynamic limit. On\nthe other hand, recent observations have provided growing evidence of a\nrelatively large disk several tens of astronomical units in size existing in\nsome Class 0 young stellar objects.

Various physical mechanisms\nhave been proposed to solve the problem of catastrophic magnetic braking, such\nas misalignment between the magnetic field and the rotation axis, turbulence,\nand non-ideal effect. In this paper, we review the mechanism of magnetic\nbraking, its effect on disk formation and early evolution, and the mechanisms\nthat resolve the magnetic braking problem. In particular, we emphasize the\nimportance of non-ideal effects. The combination of magnetic diffusion and\nthermal evolution during gravitational collapse provides a robust formation\nprocess for the circumstellar disk at the very early phase of protostar\nformation. The rotation induced by the Hall effect can supply a sufficient\namount of angular momentum for typical circumstellar disks around T Tauri\nstars. By examining the combination of the suggested mechanisms, we conclude\nthat the circumstellar disks commonly form in the very early phase of protostar\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 01:34:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 05:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-24"}

The strong exciton oscillator strength resulting in\nup to 20% absorption for a single monolayer points to ultrafast radiative\nrecombination.

Our main contribution is to introduce a novel method called safe\npattern pruning (SPP) for a class of predictive pattern mining problems. The\nSPP method allows us to efficiently find a superset of all the predictive\npatterns in the database that are needed for the optimal predictive model. The\nadvantage of the SPP method over existing boosting-type method is that the\nformer can find the superset by a single search over the database, while the\nlatter requires multiple searches. The SPP method is inspired by recent\ndevelopment of safe feature screening. In order to extend the idea of safe\nfeature screening into predictive pattern mining, we derive a novel pruning\nrule called safe pattern pruning (SPP) rule that can be used for searching over\nthe tree defined among patterns in the database. The SPP rule has a property\nthat, if a node corresponding to a pattern in the database is pruned out by the\nSPP rule, then it is guaranteed that all the patterns corresponding to its\ndescendant nodes are never needed for the optimal predictive model.

Our approach\nrelies on a novel Gaussian process regression with built-in dimensionality\nreduction with the AS represented as an orthogonal projection matrix that\nserves as yet another covariance function hyper-parameter to be estimated from\nthe data.

It is\nassumed that the neighboring nodes are connected by noisy photonic channels,\nand the local gates can be performed quite accurately, while the decoherence of\nmemories is significant. A unitary is often a part of a larger computation or\ncommunication task in a quantum network, and to reduce the amount of\ndecoherence in other systems of the network, we focus on the goal of saving the\ntotal time for implementing a unitary including the time for entanglement\npreparation. We review some previously studied protocols that implement\nbipartite unitaries using local operations and classical communication and\nprior shared entanglement, and apply them to the situation with repeater nodes\nwithout prior entanglement. We find that the protocols using piecewise\nentanglement between neighboring nodes often require less total time compared\nto preparing entanglement between the two end nodes first and then performing\nthe previously known protocols. For a generic bipartite unitary, as the number\nof repeater nodes increases, the total time could approach the time cost for\ndirect signal transfer from one end node to the other.

The main obstacle of this problem is in the difficulty of\ntaking into account the selection bias, i.e., the bias arising from the fact\nthat patterns are selected from extremely large number of candidates in\ndatabases. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for predictive pattern\nmining problems that can address the selection bias issue. Our approach is\nbuilt on a recently popularized statistical inference framework called\nselective inference. In selective inference, statistical inferences (such as\nstatistical hypothesis testing) are conducted based on sampling distributions\nconditional on a selection event. If the selection event is characterized in a\ntractable way, statistical inferences can be made without minding selection\nbias issue. However, in pattern mining problems, it is difficult to\ncharacterize the entire selection process of mining algorithms. Our main\ncontribution in this paper is to solve this challenging problem for a class of\npredictive pattern mining problems by introducing a novel algorithmic\nframework. We demonstrate that our approach is useful for finding statistically\nsignificant patterns from databases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 09:52:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 06:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-10"}

An estimate of a mechanical property, like\nenergy, of an equilibrium system, can be made by averaging over a large number\nmicrostates generated by Boltzmann Monte Carlo methods. However, a thermal\nproperty like entropy is not easily accessible to these methods. The reason is\nsimple. We can assign a numerical value for energy to each microstate. But we\ncan not assign a numerical value for entropy, to a microstate. Entropy is not a\nproperty associated with any single microstate.It is a collective property of\nallthe microstates. Toward calculating entropy and other thermal properties, a\nnon-Boltzmann Monte Carlo technique called Umbrella sampling was proposed in\nthe mid-seventies (of the last century).

Samples of cubic BaTiO3 are known to exhibit breaking of the\ncentric symmetry locally and globally. It has been proposed that the local\nsymmetry breaking originates in polar regions, the precursors of the\nferroelectric phase. Origins of the macroscopic symmetry breaking, which are\nnot well understood, have been previously tentatively correlated with\ninhomogeneities in the samples, such as strain gradients that may align or\nredistribute objects such as charged point defects or polar regions making\nmaterial macroscopically polar. No such data are available for BaTiO3 with\nhexagonal symmetry. We compare dielectric, elastic, and pyroelectric properties\nof the two materials in polycrystalline form. In contrast to cubic BaTiO3,\nhexagonal BaTiO3 does not exhibit macroscopic pyroelectric response at room\ntemperature. This is consistent with apparent absence of polar regions in the\nhexagonal material and the fact that in hexagonal BaTiO3 strain rather then\npolarization is the order parameter for the phase transition into\nferroelectric-ferroelastic phase. The thermally stimulated currents measured in\nhexagonal and cubic BaTiO3, however, show that both materials exhibit\nnoncentric macroscopic symmetry. This result supports the idea that extrinsic\nfactors such as strain gradients, which are apparently common for both\nmaterials, may break the macroscopic symmetry, which may then lead to alignment\nand redistribution of polar regions or charged defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 11:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-07"}

The wind mass transfer from a giant to its white dwarf companion in\nsymbiotic binaries is not well understood. For example, the efficiency of wind\nmass transfer of the canonical Bondi-Hoyle accretion mechanism is too low to\npower the typical luminosities of the accretors. However, recent observations\nand modelling indicate a considerably more efficient mass transfer in symbiotic\nbinaries.\n  Aims. We determine the velocity profile of the wind from the giant at the\nnear-orbital-plane region of eclipsing S-type symbiotic binaries EG And and SY\nMus, and derive the corresponding spherical equivalent of the mass-loss rate.\nWith this approach, we indicate the high mass transfer ratio.\n  Methods. We achieved this aim by modelling the observed column densities\ntaking into account ionization of the wind of the giant, whose velocity profile\nis derived using the inversion of Abel's integral operator for the hydrogen\ncolumn density function.\n  Results. Our analysis revealed the spherical equivalent of the mass-loss rate\nfrom the giant to be a few times 10^{-6}M_{Sun}/yr, which is a factor of >=10\nhigher than rates determined by methods that do not depend on the line of\nsight. This discrepancy rules out the usual assumption that the wind is\nspherically symmetric. As our values were derived from near-orbital-plane\ncolumn densities, these values can be a result of focusing the wind from the\ngiant towards the orbital plane.\n  Conclusions.

We have\nspectroscopically observed 99 out of 110 candidates with $z$-band magnitudes\nbrighter than 19.5 and 64 (64.6\\%) of them are quasars with redshifts of\n$4.4\\lesssim z \\lesssim 5.5$ and absolute magnitudes of $-29\\lesssim M_{1450}\n\\lesssim -26.4$. In addition, we also observed 14 fainter candidates selected\nwith the same criteria and identified 8 (57.1\\%) of them as quasars with\n$4.7<z<5.4$ . Among 72 newly identified quasars, 12 of them are at $5.2 < z <\n5.7$, which leads to an increase of $\\sim$36\\% of the number of known quasars\nat this redshift range. More importantly, our identifications doubled the\nnumber of quasars with $M_{1450}<-27.5$ at $z>4.5$, which will set strong\nconstraints on the bright end of the quasar luminosity function. We also expand\nour method to select quasars at $z\\gtrsim5.7$. In this paper we report the\ndiscovery of four new luminous $z\\gtrsim5.7$ quasars based on SDSS-WISE\nselection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 12:58:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 12:54:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-26"}

We design an efficient and simple protocol in the\nasynchronous communication model that ensures that all nodes eventually agree\non the initially most frequent opinion. In this model, each node is equipped\nwith a random Poisson clock with parameter $\\lambda=1$. Whenever a node's clock\nticks, it samples some neighbors, uniformly at random and with replacement, and\nadjusts its opinion according to the sample.\n  A prominent example is the so-called two-choices algorithm in the synchronous\nmodel, where in each round, every node chooses two neighbors uniformly at\nrandom, and if the two sampled opinions coincide, then that opinion is adopted.\nThis protocol is very efficient and well-studied when $k=2$. If\n$k=O(n^\\varepsilon)$ for some small $\\varepsilon$, we show that it converges to\nthe initial plurality opinion within $O(k \\cdot \\log{n})$ rounds, w.h.p., as\nlong as the initial difference between the largest and second largest opinion\nis $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n \\log n})$. On the other side, we show that there are cases\nin which $\\Omega(k)$ rounds are needed, w.h.p.\n  One can beat this lower bound in the synchronous model by combining the\ntwo-choices protocol with randomized broadcasting.

A convenient tool for studying such\nprocesses are quantum walks. They allow to determine in a quantitative way all\nthe process features. We study the survival probability and the transport\nefficiency on a simple, highly symmetric graph represented by a ring. The\npropagation of excitation is modeled by a discrete-time (coined) quantum walk.\nFor a two-state quantum walk, where the excitation (walker) has to leave its\nactual position to the neighboring sites, the survival probability decays\nexponentially and the transport efficiency is unity. The decay rate of the\nsurvival probability can be estimated using the leading eigenvalue of the\nevolution operator. However, if the excitation is allowed to stay at its\npresent position, i.e. the propagation is modeled by a lazy quantum walk, then\npart of the wave-packet can be trapped in the vicinity of the origin and never\nreaches the sink. In such a case, the survival probability does not vanish and\nthe excitation transport is not efficient. The dependency of the transport\nefficiency on the initial state is determined. Nevertheless, we show that for\nsome lazy quantum walks dynamical percolations of the ring eliminate the\ntrapping effect and efficient excitation transport can be achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 14:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-16"}

Therefore,\nefficient preparation of such W-like states is of great importance in quantum\ncommunications, which has not been studied as much as the preparation of W\nstates. In this letter, we propose a simple optical scheme for efficient\npreparation of large-scale polarization based entangled W-like states by fusing\ntwo W-like states or expanding a W-like state with an ancilla photon. Our\nscheme can also generate large-scale W states by fusing or expanding W or even\nW-like states. The cost analysis show that in generating large scale W states,\nthe fusion mechanism achieves a higher efficiency with non-maximally entangled\nW-like states than maximally entangled W states. Our scheme can also start\nfusion or expansion with Bell states, and it is composed of a polarization\ndependent beam splitter, two polarizing beam splitters and photon detectors.\nRequiring no ancilla photons or controlled gates to operate, our scheme can be\nrealized with the current photonics technology and we believe it enables\nadvances in quantum teleportation and superdense coding in multipartite\nsettings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 09:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

With an aging population and ever-growing demand for medical\ncare, effective management of patients' transitions among different care\nfacilities will prove indispensible for shortening the length of hospital\nstays, improving patient outcomes, allocating critical care resources, and\nreducing preventable re-admissions. In this paper, we focus on an important\nproblem of predicting the so-called \"patient flow\" from longitudinal electronic\nhealth records (EHRs), which has not been explored via existing machine\nlearning techniques. By treating a sequence of transition events as a point\nprocess, we develop a novel framework for modeling patient flow through various\nCUs and jointly predicting patients' destination CUs and duration days. Instead\nof learning a generative point process model via maximum likelihood estimation,\nwe propose a novel discriminative learning algorithm aiming at improving the\nprediction of transition events in the case of sparse data. By parameterizing\nthe proposed model as a mutually-correcting process, we formulate the\nestimation problem via generalized linear models, which lends itself to\nefficient learning based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).\nFurthermore, we achieve simultaneous feature selection and learning by adding a\ngroup-lasso regularizer to the ADMM algorithm. Additionally, for suppressing\nthe negative influence of data imbalance on the learning of model, we\nsynthesize auxiliary training data for the classes with extremely few samples,\nand improve the robustness of our learning method accordingly. Testing on\nreal-world data, we show that our method obtains superior performance in terms\nof accuracy of predicting the destination CU transition and duration of each CU\noccupancy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2016 21:29:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2016 12:13:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 05:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-11"}

We show how the compact approach leads to a\nsystem of equations whose size is independent of the range of node degrees,\nthus significantly reducing the complexity of the model.
