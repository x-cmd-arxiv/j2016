Intriguingly, our simulations show that the conformation Rsn-2\nadopts at an interface is an arrested state along the denaturation pathway.\nMore generally, our computational model should prove a useful, and\ncomputationally efficient, tool in studying the dynamics and energetics of\nprotein-interface interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 16:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

Binary and ternary mixtures were prepared from monodisperse PS with\nweight average molecular weights $5 < M_\\textrm{w} < 490$ kg/mol. Flow dynamics\nand rim morphology of dewetting holes were captured using optical and atomic\nforce microscopy. Slip properties are assessed in the framework of hydrodynamic\nmodels describing the rim height profile of dewetting holes. We show that short\nchains with $M_\\textrm{w}$ below the polymer critical molecular weight for\nentanglements, $M_\\textrm{c}$, can play an important role in slip of highly\nentangled polymers. Among mixtures of the same $M_\\textrm{w}$, those containing\nchains with $M<M_\\textrm{c}$ exhibit larger slip lengths as the number average\nmolecular weight, $M_\\textrm{n}$, decreases. The slip enhancement effect is\nonly applicable when chains with $M<M_\\textrm{c}$ are mixed with highly\nentangled chains such that the content of the long chain component,\n$\\phi_\\textrm{L}$, is dominant ($\\phi_\\textrm{L}<0.5$). These results suggest\nthat short chains affect slip of highly entangled polymers on non-wetting\nsurfaces due to the physical or chemical disparities of end groups, and any\nassociated dynamical effect their presence may have, as compared to the\nbackbone units. The enhanced slip in this regard is attributed to the impact of\nchain end groups or short chain enrichment on the effective interfacial\nfriction coefficient. Accordingly, for entangled PS, a higher concentration of\nend groups or short chains at the interface results in a lower effective\nfriction coefficient which consequently enhances the slip length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 16:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-15"}

Specifically,\nwe show that optimizing the driving entering the work extraction for a given\ntemperature protocol leads to a universal, one-parameter dependence for both\nmaximum efficiency and maximum power as a function of efficiency. In\nparticular, we show that reaching Carnot efficiency (and, hence, Curzon-Ahlborn\nefficiency at maximum power) requires to have control over the amplitude of the\nfull Hamiltonian of the system. Since the kinetic energy cannot be controlled\nby an external parameter, heat engines based on underdamped dynamics can\ntypically not reach Carnot efficiency.

We also provide quantitative results which suggest that the\nadvantages of increasing the synaptic precision (i.e.~the number of internal\nsynaptic states) rapidly vanish after the first few bits, and therefore that,\nfor practical applications, only few bits may be needed for near-optimal\nperformance, consistently with recent biological findings. Finally, we\ndemonstrate how the theoretical analysis can be exploited to design efficient\nalgorithmic search strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 17:27:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 May 2016 18:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

A relevant further step was achieved in 2005 when the possibility was\nadvanced that they could reflect an entire infinite algebra based on\ncombinations of the self-dual relations $q \\to 2-q$ ({\\it additive duality})\nand $q \\to 1/q$ ({\\it multiplicative duality}). The entire algebra collapses\ninto the single fixed point $q=1$, corresponding to the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy\nand statistical mechanics. For $q \\ne 1$, an infinite set of indices $q$\nappears, corresponding in principle to an infinite number of physical\nproperties of a given complex system describable in terms of the so called\n$q$-statistics. The basic idea that is put forward is that, for a given\nuniversality class of systems, a small number (typically one or two) of\nindependent $q$ indices exist, the infinite others being obtained from these\nfew ones by simply using the relations of the algebra. The $q$-triplets appear\nto constitute a few central elements of the algebra. During the last decade, an\nimpressive amount of $q$-triplets have been exhibited in analytical,\ncomputational, experimental and observational results in natural, artificial\nand social systems. Some of them do satisfy the available algebra constructed\nsolely with the additive and multiplicative dualities, but some others seem to\nviolate it. In the present work we generalize those two dualities with the hope\nthat a wider set of systems can be handled within. The basis of the\ngeneralization is given by the {\\it selfdual} relation $q \\to q_a(q) \\equiv\n\\frac{(a+2) -aq}{a-(a-2)q} \\,\\, (a \\in {\\cal R})$. We verify that $q_a(1)=1$,\nand that $q_2(q)=2-q$ and $q_0(q)=1/q$. To physically motivate this\ngeneralization, we briefly review illustrative applications of $q$-statistics,\nin order to exhibit possible candidates where the present generalized algebras\ncould be useful.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 18:34:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

The physical phenomenology of supercooled liquids is as vast as it is\ninteresting. Most significant, the viscosity of the supercooled liquid displays\nan incredible increase over a narrow temperature range. Eventually, the\nsupercooled liquid ceases to flow, becomes a glass, and gains rigidity and\nsolid-like behaviors. Understanding what underpins the monumental growth of\nviscosity, and how rigidity results without long range order is a long-sought\ngoal. Many theories of the glassy slowdown require the growth of static\nlengthscale related to structure with lowering of the temperature. To that end,\nwe have proposed a new, natural lengthscale- \"the shear penetration depth\".\nThis lengthscale quantifies the structural connectivity of the supercooled\nliquid. The shear penetration depth is defined as the distance up to which a\nshear perturbation applied to the boundary propagates into the liquid. We\nprovide numerical data, based on the simulations of $NiZr_2$, illustrating that\nthis length scale exhibits dramatic growth and eventual divergence upon\napproach to the glass transition.

Eclipsing binary stars are believed to\nshow distinct eclipses only if belonging to the EA type. With a decreasing\neclipse width, the statistically optimal value of the trigonometric polynomial\ns (2003ASPC..292..391A) drastically increases from ~2 for elliptic (EL)\nvariables without eclipses, ~6-8 for EW and up to ~30-50 for some EA with\nnarrow eclipses.

This design is\nbased on Wu's $\\textit{effective capacity}$ (EC) concept [1], which\ncharacterizes the maximum throughput of a system subject to statistical\ndelay-QoS requirements at the data-link layer. In the particular context\nconsidered, our main contributions consist of quantifying the\n$\\textit{effective energy-efficiency}$ (EEE)-versus-EC tradeoff and\ncharacterizing the delay-sensitive traffic as a function of the QoS-exponent\n$\\theta$, which expresses the exponential decay rate of the delay-QoS violation\nprobabilities. Upon exploiting the properties of fractional programming, the\noriginally quasi-concave EEE optimization problem having a fractional form is\ntransformed into a subtractive optimization problem by applying Dinkelbach's\nmethod. As a result, an iterative inner-outer loop based resource allocation\nalgorithm is conceived for efficiently solving the transformed EEE optimization\nproblem. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme converges\nwithin a few Dinkelbach algorithm's iterations to the desired solution\naccuracy. Furthermore, the impact of the circuitry power, of the QoS-exponent\nand of the power amplifier inefficiency is characterized numerically. These\nresults reveal that the optimally allocated power maximizing the EEE decays\nexponentially with respect to both the circuitry power and the QoS-exponent,\nwhilst decaying linearly with respect to the power amplifier inefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 21:37:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

One possible explanation of the origin of these anomalies lies in\nthe existence of a metastable liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT) between two\n(high and low density) forms of water. While the anomalies are observed in\nexperiments on bulk and confined water and by computer simulation studies of\nwater-like models, the existence of a LLPT in water is still debated.\nUnambiguous experimental proof of the existence of a LLPT in bulk supercooled\nwater is hampered by fast ice nucleation which is a precursor of the\nhypothesized LLPT. Moreover, the hypothesized LLPT, being metastable, in\nprinciple cannot exist in the thermodynamic limit (infinite size, infinite\ntime). Therefore, computer simulations of water models are crucial for\nexploring the possibility of the metastable LLPT and the nature of the\nanomalies. In this work, we present new simulation results in the NVT ensemble\nfor one of the most accurate classical molecular models of water, TIP4P/2005.\nTo describe the computed properties and explore the possibility of a LLPT we\nhave applied two-structure thermodynamics, viewing water as a non-ideal mixture\nof two interconvertible local structures (\"states\"). The results suggest the\npresence of a liquid-liquid critical point and a LLPT in this model for the\nsimulated length and time scales. We have compared the behavior of TIP4P/2005\nwith other popular water-like models, namely mW and ST2, and with real water,\nall of which are well described by two-state thermodynamics. In view of the\ncurrent debate involving different studies of TIP4P/2005, we discuss\nconsequences of metastability and finite size in observing the liquid-liquid\nseparation. We also address the relationship between the phenomenological order\nparameter of two-structure thermodynamics and the microscopic nature of the\nlow-density structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 22:13:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 18:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

This electric field both decelerates the\nsupersonic ion flow and accelerates the electrons up to high velocities.

These\nstudies showed that the two main classes, the fast and slow rotators, can be\nseparated using stellar kinematics. We showed there is a dichotomy in the\ndynamics of the two classes.

Instead of engineering algorithms by hand, the ability to learn\ncomposable systems automatically from massive amounts of data has led to\nground-breaking performance in important domains such as computer vision,\nspeech recognition, and natural language processing. The most popular class of\ntechniques used in these domains is called deep learning, and is seeing\nsignificant attention from industry. However, these models require incredible\namounts of data and compute power to train, and are limited by the need for\nbetter hardware acceleration to accommodate scaling beyond current data and\nmodel sizes. While the current solution has been to use clusters of graphics\nprocessing units (GPU) as general purpose processors (GPGPU), the use of field\nprogrammable gate arrays (FPGA) provide an interesting alternative. Current\ntrends in design tools for FPGAs have made them more compatible with the\nhigh-level software practices typically practiced in the deep learning\ncommunity, making FPGAs more accessible to those who build and deploy models.\nSince FPGA architectures are flexible, this could also allow researchers the\nability to explore model-level optimizations beyond what is possible on fixed\narchitectures such as GPUs. As well, FPGAs tend to provide high performance per\nwatt of power consumption, which is of particular importance for application\nscientists interested in large scale server-based deployment or\nresource-limited embedded applications.

Assuming Gaussianity of queries, we establish the\nfirst sharp minimax lower bound on the squared error in the order of\n$O(\\frac{\\sqrt{k}\\sigma^2}{n})$, where $k$ is the number of queries asked, and\n$\\sigma^2/n$ is the ordinary signal-to-noise ratio for a single query.

Viscosity and resistivity provide dissipative regularizations of\nthe singularities. In this paper we propose a minimal, local, conservative,\nnonlinear, dispersive regularization of compressible flow and ideal MHD, in\nanalogy with the KdV regularization of the 1D kinematic wave equation. This\nwork extends and significantly generalizes earlier work on incompressible Euler\nand ideal MHD. It involves a micro-scale cutoff length lambda which is a\nfunction of density, unlike in the incompressible case. In MHD, it can be taken\nto be of order the electron collisionless skin depth c/omega_pe. Our\nregularization preserves the symmetries of the original systems, and with\nappropriate boundary conditions, leads to associated conservation laws. Energy\nand enstrophy are subject to a priori bounds determined by initial data in\ncontrast to the unregularized systems. A Hamiltonian and Poisson bracket\nformulation is developed and applied to generalize the constitutive relation to\nbound higher moments of vorticity. A `swirl' velocity field is identified, and\nshown to transport w/rho and B/rho, generalizing the Kelvin-Helmholtz and\nAlfven theorems. The steady regularized equations are used to model a rotating\nvortex, MHD pinch and a plane vortex sheet. The proposed regularization could\nfacilitate numerical simulations of fluid/MHD equations and provide a\nconsistent statistical mechanics of vortices/current filaments in 3D, without\nblowup of enstrophy.

Using examples from our and other's research, we will\ndiscuss how such robophysical studies have begun to aid engineers in the\ncreation of devices that begin to achieve life-like locomotor abilities on and\nwithin complex environments, have inspired interesting physics questions in low\ndimensional dynamical systems, geometric mechanics and soft matter physics, and\nhave been useful to develop models for biological locomotion in complex\nterrain. The rapidly decreasing cost of constructing sophisticated robot models\nwith easy access to significant computational power bodes well for scientists\nand engineers to engage in a discipline which can readily integrate experiment,\ntheory and computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 19:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

The field variables of the theory are the usual orthonormal tetrads\nand also internal space tetrads. Using the fundamental geometric object which\nis the curvature vector, an appropriate Lagrangian has been defined for both\nfree-field and fields with sources. Solutions to the corresponding field\nequations have been developed. In this paper we use the static spherically\nsymmetric tetrad field with sources to model the universe. Our fundamental\nassumption is that the total density comprised of both ordinary and dark matter\nshould be constant. The resulting model with one adjustable parameter predicts\nthat ordinary matter is approximately 77\\% of the total mass content, but this\npercentage is near 0\\% for regions near the center of the universe. The space\nis approximately isotropic for $r$ near zero. The radial and tangential\npressures are negative and unequal. The redshift is also modeled without the\nexpanding universe and an explanation of the value of the cosmological constant\nis given. Equations governing particle motion are also derived which can\nproduce a repulsive effect and produce even larger redshifts. Finally, the\ncosmic microwave background and its anisotropies are addressed and heuristic\narguments are given that suggest that our theory is not inconsistent with these\nobservations. These results add further confirmation that the theory developed\nby Pandres is the fundamental theory of physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 19:06:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 19:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-23"}

To introduce basic ideas, we consider a well known dynamical\nsystem composed of two master-slave coupled Lorenz oscillators. We start\nevidencing that due to the sensitivity of $\\Delta$ computed from temporal time\nseries of slave oscillator, its is possible to detect the stationary breaking\nimposed in the master oscillator. As a second example, the method is carried\nout in a real physiological data acquired from accelerometer sensors\n($\\mathrm{A_{cc}}$) and used to detect micro arousal phenomenology (described\nby a sharp burst in $\\mathrm{A_{cc}}$ signal) during sleep periods in mice.\nMoreover, we show for the first time that making use of recurrence quantifier\nit is possible to infer a coupling between electric signals from hippocampus\nand \"locomotor brain areas\" of mice, based only on non invasive data from\n$\\mathrm{A_{cc}}$.
