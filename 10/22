Its applicability to convex optimization programs has\ngained significant popularity for its intuitive implementation that involves\nonly simple algebraic operations. In fact, if the projection onto the feasible\nset is easy to compute, then the method has low complexity. On the other hand,\nwhen the problem is nonconvex, e.g. because of nonlinear equality constraints,\nthe projection becomes hard and thus impractical. In this paper, we propose a\nprojected gradient method for Nonlinear Programs (NLPs) that only requires\nprojections onto the linearization of the nonlinear constraints around the\ncurrent iterate, similarly to Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP). Although\nthe projection is easier to compute, it makes the intermediate steps unfeasible\nfor the original problem. As a result, the gradient method does not fall either\ninto the projected gradient descent approaches, because the projection is not\nperformed onto the original nonlinear manifold, or into the standard SQP, since\nsecond-order information is not used. For nonlinear smooth optimization\nproblems, we analyze the similarities of the proposed method with SQP and\nassess its local and global convergence to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of\nthe original problem. Further, we show that nonlinear Model Predictive Control\n(MPC) is a promising application of the proposed method, due to the sparsity of\nthe resulting optimization problem. We illustrate the computational efficiency\nof the proposed method in a numerical example with box constraints on the\ncontrol input and a quadratic terminal constraint on the state variable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 16:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-24"}

However, because patient\ncondition changes rapidly and medical staffs are usually overloaded in acute\ncare setting, how to ensure the correctness of the system reaction to those\nrapid changes and managing interaction with physicians remains challenging. In\nthis paper, we propose a domain-specific model-driven design approach to\naddress these challenges for designing clinical guidance systems. Firstly, we\ntranslate the relevant medical knowledge described in generic literature and\ndifferent best practice guidelines into a set of executable and indirectly\nverifiable finite state machine models. We introduce an organ-centric paradigm\nto construct clinical models, and also develop a physician model to track\nphysician-system interactions and deviations. Secondly, for verification of the\ncompositional system model, we translate the model into timed automata, based\non which, we formalize a set of clinical and system safety requirements as\ncomputation tree logic(CTL) formulas and use the UPPAAL model checking tool to\nformally verify those requirements. In this way, the correctness of the model\ncan be mathematically proved. Finally, we can automatically generate the\nexecutable code from the verified model using the corresponding code generation\ntools for finite state machine. For evaluation, we apply the approach to the\ndesign of clinical guidance systems for cardiac arrest. The generated code can\nbe deployed and interact with existing guidance systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 19:10:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-24"}

More precisely, no model can assign deterministic\noutcomes to the projectors of a quantum measurement in a way that depends only\non the projector and not the context (the full set of projectors) in which it\nappeared, despite the fact that the Born rule probabilities associated with\nprojectors are independent of the context. A more general, operational\ndefinition of contextuality introduced by Spekkens, which we will term\n\"probabilistic contextuality\", drops the assumption of determinism and allows\nfor operations other than measurements to be considered contextual.\nProbabilistic noncontextuality represents the postulate that elements of an\noperational theory that cannot be distinguished from each other based on the\nstatistics of arbitrarily many repeated experiments are ontologically\nidentical. In this paper, we introduce a framework that enables us to\ndistinguish between different noncontextuality assumptions in terms of the\nrelationships between the ontological representations of objects in the theory\ngiven a certain relation between their operational representations. This\nframework can be used to motivate and define a \"possibilistic\" analogue,\nencapsulating the idea that elements of an operational theory that cannot be\nunambiguously distinguished operationally can also not be unambiguously\ndistinguished ontologically. We then prove that possibilistic noncontextuality\nis equivalent to an alternative notion proposed by Hardy.

The radio afterglow of GRB 111005A was an order of magnitude less\nluminous than those of local low-luminosity GRBs, and obviously than those of\ncosmological GRBs. The radio flux was approximately constant and then\nexperienced an unusually rapid decay a month after the GRB explosion. Similarly\nto only two other GRBs, we did not find the associated supernovae (SN), despite\ndeep near- and mid-infrared observations 1-9 days after the GRB explosion,\nreaching ~20 times fainter than other SNe associated with GRBs. Moreover, we\nmeasured twice solar metallicity for the GRB location. The low gamma-ray and\nradio luminosities, rapid decay, lack of a SN, and super-solar metallicity\nsuggest that GRB 111005A represents a different rare class of GRBs than typical\ncore-collapse events.

We examine global atomic\ngas-to-stellar mass ratios (G/S) in relation to galaxy environment using\nseveral metrics: group dark matter halo mass M_h , central/satellite\ndesignation, relative mass density of the cosmic web, and distance to nearest\nmassive group. We find that at fixed M_stars, satellites have decreasing G/S\nwith increasing M_h starting clearly at M_h = 10^12 Msun, suggesting the\npresence of starvation and/or stripping mechanisms associated with halo gas\nheating in intermediate-mass groups. The analogous relationship for centrals is\nuncertain because halo abundance matching builds in relationships between\ncentral G/S, stellar mass, and halo mass, which depend on the integrated group\nproperty used as a proxy for halo mass (stellar or baryonic mass). On larger\nscales G/S trends are less sensitive to the abundance matching method. At fixed\nM_h < 10^12 Msun, the fraction of gas-poor centrals increases with large-scale\nstructure density. In overdense regions, we identify a rare population of\ngas-poor centrals in low-mass (M_h < 10^11.4 Msun) halos primarily located\nwithin 1.5 times the virial radius of more massive (M_h > 10^12 Msun) halos,\nsuggesting that gas stripping and/or starvation may be induced by interactions\nwith larger halos or the surrounding cosmic web.

Although\nwe do not find any signs of tunneling in structural relaxation of these\nliquids, their unusually low fragility can be well described by the influence\nof the quantum fluctuations. Confined water presents especially interesting\ncase in comparison to the earlier data on bulk low-density amorphous and vapor\ndeposited water. Confined water exhibits much weaker isotope effect than bulk\nwater, although the effect is still significant. We show that it can be\nascribed to the change of the energy barrier for relaxation due to a decrease\nin the zero-point energy upon D-H substitution. The observed difference in the\nbehavior of confined and bulk water demonstrates high sensitivity of quantum\neffects to the barrier heights and structure of water.

The convergence\nanalysis for the nAC equation follows the standard procedure of consistency and\nstability estimate for the numerical error function. For the nCH equation, due\nto the complicated form of the nonlinear term, a careful expansion of its\ndiscrete gradient is undertaken and an $H^{-1}$ inner product estimate of this\nnonlinear numerical error is derived to establish convergence. In addition, an\na-priori $W^{1,\\infty}$ bound of the numerical solution at the discrete level\nis needed in the error estimate.

Since the signal-to-interference-plus-noise\nratio (SINR) of $m$-th user relies on efficient SIC, we consider three\nscenarios, i.e., perfect SIC (in which the signals of $m-1$ interferers who are\nstronger than $m$-th user are decoded successfully), imperfect SIC (in which\nthe signals of of $m-1$ interferers who are stronger than $m$-th user may or\nmay not be decoded successfully), and imperfect worst case SIC (in which the\ndecoding of the signal of $m$-th user is always unsuccessful whenever the\ndecoding of its relative $m-1$ stronger users is unsuccessful). The derived\nexpressions are customized to capture the performance of a user at rank $m$ in\nan equivalent orthogonal multiple access (OMA) system. Finally, numerical\nresults are presented to validate the derived expressions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2016 04:10:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 21:12:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-14"}

The hypothesis of a\nsizable contribution of Galactic high-energy neutrino events distributed as\n$E^{-2.7}$ [ApJ 826, 185 (2016)] is critically analyzed and its natural\ngeneralization is considered.

Understanding how\ndifferent air pollutants accumulate and propagate is critical to making\nrelevant public policies. In this paper, we use urban big data (air quality\ndata and meteorological data) to identify the \\emph{spatiotemporal (ST) causal\npathways} for air pollutants. This problem is challenging because: (1) there\nare numerous noisy and low-pollution periods in the raw air quality data, which\nmay lead to unreliable causality analysis, (2) for large-scale data in the ST\nspace, the computational complexity of constructing a causal structure is very\nhigh, and (3) the \\emph{ST causal pathways} are complex due to the interactions\nof multiple pollutants and the influence of environmental factors. Therefore,\nwe present \\emph{p-Causality}, a novel pattern-aided causality analysis\napproach that combines the strengths of \\emph{pattern mining} and\n\\emph{Bayesian learning} to efficiently and faithfully identify the \\emph{ST\ncausal pathways}. First, \\emph{Pattern mining} helps suppress the noise by\ncapturing frequent evolving patterns (FEPs) of each monitoring sensor, and\ngreatly reduce the complexity by selecting the pattern-matched sensors as\n\"causers\". Then, \\emph{Bayesian learning} carefully encodes the local and ST\ncausal relations with a Gaussian Bayesian network (GBN)-based graphical model,\nwhich also integrates environmental influences to minimize biases in the final\nresults. We evaluate our approach with three real-world data sets containing\n982 air quality sensors, in three regions of China from 01-Jun-2013 to\n19-Dec-2015. Results show that our approach outperforms the traditional causal\nstructure learning methods in time efficiency, inference accuracy and\ninterpretability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2016 13:17:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 08:30:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2018 07:39:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-19"}

Additionally, the nuclei\nwith angular momenta greater than 1/2 possess a quadrupolar charge\ndistribution. At the intersection of these two phenomena, we devise a simple\nscheme for generating various types of nuclear spin cat states. The native\nbiaxial electric quadrupole interaction that is readily available in strained\nsolid-state systems plays a key role here. However, the fact that built-in\nstrain cannot be switched off poses a challenge for the stabilization of target\ncat states once they are prepared. We remedy this by abruptly diverting via a\nsingle rotation pulse the state evolution to the neighborhood of the fixed\npoints of the underlying classical Hamiltonian flow. Optimal process parameters\nare obtained as a function of electric field gradient biaxiality and nuclear\nspin angular momentum. The overall procedure is seen to be robust under 5%\ndeviations from optimal values. We show that higher level cat states with four\nsuperposed CSS can also be formed using three rotation pulses. Finally, for\nopen systems subject to decoherence we extract the scaling of cat state\nfidelity damping with respect to the spin quantum number. This reveals rates\ngreater than the dephasing of individual CSSs. Yet, our results affirm that\nthese cat states can preserve their fidelities for practically useful durations\nunder the currently attainable decoherence levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2016 13:33:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Aug 2017 12:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}
