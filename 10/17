Linear\nand nonlinear stages of the (inertialess) surfactant and gravity dependent\nlong-wave instability are studied using the lubrication approximation, which\nleads to a system of coupled nonlinear evolution equations for the interface\nand surfactant disturbances. The linear stability is determined by an\neigenvalue problem for the normal modes.

When each packet comes to the head-of-line (HOL) in the buffer, it is\ngiven a deadline $D$ which is the maximum number of times the transmitter can\nattempt retransmission in order to successfully transmit the packet. If this\nnumber of transmission attempts is exhausted, the packet is ejected from the\nbuffer and the next packet comes to the HOL. Costs are incurred in each time\nslot for holding packets in the buffer, expending transmitter power, and\nejecting packets which exceed their deadlines. We investigate how transmission\npower should be chosen so as to minimize the total cost of transmitting the\nitems in the buffer. We formulate the optimal power control problem in a\ndynamic programming framework and then hone in on the special case of fixed\ninterference. For this special case, we are able to provide a precise analytic\ncharacterization of how the power control should vary with the backlog and how\nthe power control should react to approaching deadlines.

Monte Carlo\nsimulations are used to evaluate the performance of the resulting power control\nscheme as compared to the optimal scheme. The resulting power control scheme is\nsub-optimal but it provides a low-complexity approximation of the optimal power\ncontrol.

The scalar field can be either conformally or\nminimally coupled to gravity, and it can be massive or massless, without self\ninteraction. The analysis is made for models containing a single radiation\nfluid, and for the more realistic case of models containing the usual observed\nradiation and dust fluids, which can fit most of the observed features of our\nUniverse, including an almost scale invariant power spectrum of scalar\ncosmological perturbations. In the conformal coupling case, the particle\nproduction is negligible. In the minimal coupling case, for massive particles,\nthe results point to the same physical conclusion within observational\nconstraints: particle production is most important at the bounce energy scale,\nand it is not sensitive neither to its mass nor whether there is dust in the\nbackground model. The only caveat is the case where the particle mass is larger\nthan the bounce energy scale. On the other hand, the energy density of produced\nmassive particles depend on their masses and the energy scale of the bounce.\nFor very large masses and deep bounces, this energy density may overcome that\nof the background. In the case of massless particles, the energy density of\nproduced particles can become comparable to the background energy density only\nfor bounces occurring at energy scales comparable to the Planck scale or above,\nwhich lies beyond the scope of this paper: we expect that the simple\nWheeler-DeWitt approach we are using should be valid only at scales some few\norders of magnitude below the Planck energy.

We show that, in very narrow pores, the strong gas-wall\ninteractions are essential in determining the gas recovery behavior both\nquantitatively and qualitatively. These interactions cause the total diffusion\ncoefficients of the gas molecules in nanopores to be smaller than those\npredicted by kinetic theories, hence slowing down the rate of gas recovery.\nThese interactions also lead to significant adsorption of gas molecules on the\npore walls. Because of the desorption of these gas molecules during gas\nrecovery, the gas recovery from the nanopore does not exhibit the usual\ndiffusive scaling law (i.e., the accumulative recovery scales as $R \\sim\nt^{1/2}$ but follows a super-diffusive scaling law $R \\sim t^n$ ($n>0.5$),\nwhich is similar to that observed in some field experiments.

However, most geometric model fitting methods are unable to\nfit an arbitrary geometric model (e.g. a surface with holes) to incomplete\ndata, due to that the similarity metrics used in these methods are unable to\nmeasure the rigid partial similarity between arbitrary models. This paper hence\nproposes a novel rigid geometric similarity metric, which is able to measure\nboth the full similarity and the partial similarity between arbitrary geometric\nmodels. The proposed metric enables us to perform partial procedural geometric\nmodel fitting (PPGMF). The task of PPGMF is to search a procedural geometric\nmodel space for the model rigidly similar to a query of non-complete point set.\nModels in the procedural model space are generated according to a set of\nparametric modeling rules. A typical query is a point cloud. PPGMF is very\nuseful as it can be used to fit arbitrary geometric models to non-complete\n(incomplete, over-complete or hybrid-complete) point cloud data. For example,\nmost laser scanning data is non-complete due to occlusion. Our PPGMF method\nuses Markov chain Monte Carlo technique to optimize the proposed similarity\nmetric over the model space. To accelerate the optimization process, the method\nalso employs a novel coarse-to-fine model dividing strategy to reject\ndissimilar models in advance. Our method has been demonstrated on a variety of\ngeometric models and non-complete data. Experimental results show that the\nPPGMF method based on the proposed metric is able to fit non-complete data,\nwhile the method based on other metrics is unable. It is also shown that our\nmethod can be accelerated by several times via early rejection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 00:47:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-18"}

These spin singlets can be used to store\nquantum correlations since they preserve entanglement even under dissipation,\ndriving and dipole-dipole interactions. One of the features for these dark\nstates is that their eigenenergies are independent of the qubitphoton coupling\nstrength. We have obtained a novel kind of dark-like states for the multi-qubit\nand multi-photon Rabi models, whose eigenenergies are also constant in the\nwhole coupling regime. Unlike the dark states, the qubits and photon field are\ncoupled in the dark-like states. Furthermore, the photon numbers are bounded\nfrom above commonly at 1, which is different from that for the one-qubit case.\nThe existence conditions of the dark-like states are simpler than exact\nisolated solutions, and may be fine tuned in experiments. While the\nsingle-qubit and multi-photon Rabi model is well-defined only if the photon\nnumber $M\\leq2$ and the coupling strength is below a certain critical value,\nthe dark-like eigenstates for multi-qubit and multiphoton Rabi model still\nexist, regardless of these constraints.

Despite\ntheir good performance in some classification tasks, it is difficult to\nevaluate whether the attributes discovered by these methods are meaningful and\nwhich methods are the most appropriate to discover attributes for visual\ndescriptions. In its simplest form, such an evaluation can be performed by\nmanually verifying whether there is any consistent identifiable visual concept\ndistinguishing between positive and negative exemplars labelled by an\nattribute. This manual checking is tedious, expensive and labour intensive. In\naddition, comparisons between different methods could also be problematic as it\nis not clear how one could quantitatively decide which attribute is more\nmeaningful than the others. In this paper, we propose a novel attribute\nmeaningfulness metric to address this challenging problem. With this metric,\nautomatic quantitative evaluation can be performed on the attribute sets; thus,\nreducing the enormous effort to perform manual evaluation. The proposed metric\nis applied to some recent automatic attribute discovery and hashing methods on\nfour attribute-labelled datasets. To further validate the efficacy of the\nproposed method, we conducted a user study. In addition, we also compared our\nmetric with a semi-supervised attribute discover method using the mixture of\nprobabilistic PCA.

Surprisingly, when these networks\nare trained for object classification, the activity of their early,\nintermediate, and later layers becomes closely related to activity patterns in\ncorresponding parts of the primate ventral visual stream. The activity\nstatistics are far from identical, but perhaps remaining differences can be\nminimized in order to produce artificial networks with highly brain-like\nactivity and performance, which would provide a rich source of insight into\nprimate vision. One way to align CNN activity more closely with neural activity\nis to add cost functions that directly drive deep layers to approximate neural\nrecordings. However, suitably large datasets are particularly difficult to\nobtain for deep structures, such as the primate middle temporal area (MT). To\nwork around this barrier, we have developed a rich empirical model of activity\nin MT. The model is pixel-computable, so it can provide an arbitrarily large\n(but approximate) set of labels to better guide learning in the corresponding\nlayers of deep networks. Our model approximates a number of MT phenomena more\nclosely than previous models. Furthermore, our model approximates population\nstatistics in detail through fourteen parameter distributions that we estimated\nfrom the electrophysiology literature. In general, deep networks with internal\nrepresentations that closely approximate those of the brain may help to clarify\nthe mechanisms that produce these representations, and the roles of various\nproperties of these representations in performance of vision tasks. Although\nour empirical model inevitably differs from real neural activity, it allows\ntuning properties to be modulated independently, which may allow very detailed\nexploration of the origins and functional roles of these properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 03:16:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-18"}

An\nimprovement to the existent polynomial-time algorithm is proposed and\nexperimentally analyzed. The improved algorithm is trying to move pebbles in a\nmore efficient way than the original algorithm by grouping them into so-called\nsnakes and moving them jointly within the snake.

A\ndecoupled impedance model is highly appealing since the\nSingle-Input-Single-Output (SISO) structure makes the analysis and result\ninterpretation very simple. On the other hand, matrix impedance models are more\naccurate, and in some cases necessary. Previous works have applied various\napproximations to obtain decoupled models, and both the dq- and sequence\ndomains have been used. This paper introduces the terms decoupled and\nsemi-decoupled impedance models in order to have a clear classification of the\navailable approximations.\n  The accuracy of 4 decoupled impedance models are discussed based on the\nconcept of Mirror Frequency Coupling (MFC). By definition the decoupled models\nbased on sequence domain impedances will be exact for systems without MFC. In\nthe general case, they are expected to be more accurate than the decoupled\ndq-impedance models. The paper defines a norm $\\epsilon$ to measure the degree\nof coupling in the impedance matrices. This norm equals the error in the\neigenvalue loci between the matrix and semi-decoupled models. This can also be\nviewed as the error in the semi-decoupled Nyquist plot.\n  An example case study consisting of a grid-connected VSC with current\ncontroller and PLL is used to compare the different methods. It is found that\ndecoupled and semi-decoupled models in the dq-domain are only applicable in\ngrids with very low X/R-ratio. Furthermore, it is concluded that the decoupled\nmodel in the sequence domain gives close to equal results as the semi-decoupled\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 07:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-18"}

Beside the\nhomogeneous turbulence, generation of small scale fluctuations can take place\nalso in other realistic configurations, namely, when perturbations superpose to\nan inhomogeneous background magnetic field. When an Alfv\\'en wave propagates in\na medium where the Alfv\\'en speed varies in a direction transverse to the mean\nfield, it undergoes phase-mixing, which progressively bends wavefronts,\ngenerating small scales in the transverse direction. As soon as transverse\nscales get of the order of the proton inertial length $d_p$, kinetic Alfv\\'en\nwaves (KAWs) are naturally generated. KAWs belong to the branch of Alfv\\'en\nwaves and propagate nearly perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field, at\nscales close to $d_p$. Many numerical, observational and theoretical works have\nsuggested that these fluctuations may play a determinant role in the\ndevelopment of the solar-wind turbulent cascade. In the present paper, the\ngeneration of large amplitude KAW fluctuations in inhomogeneous background and\ntheir effect on the protons have been investigated by means of hybrid\nVlasov-Maxwell direct numerical simulations. Imposing a pressure balanced\nmagnetic shear, the kinetic dynamics of protons has been investigated by\nvarying both the magnetic configuration and the amplitude of the initial\nperturbations. Of interest here is the transition from quasi-linear to\nturbulent regimes, focusing, in particular, on the development of important\nnon-Maxwellian features in the proton distribution function driven by KAW\nfluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 07:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

In contrast, classical\nmeasurement error of a confounder can inflate the type I error rate of a test\nof treatment effect. In this paper, we develop a large class of semiparametric\ntest statistics of an exposure causal effect, which are completely robust to\nclassical measurement error of a subset of confounders. A unique and appealing\nfeature of our proposed methods is that they require no external information\nsuch as validation data or replicates of error-prone confounders. We present a\ndoubly-robust form of this test that requires only one of two models to be\ncorrectly specified for the resulting test statistic to have correct type I\nerror rate. We demonstrate validity and power within our class of test\nstatistics through simulation studies.

How these species behave in presence\nof the grain surfaces is still an open question. In this contribution we\ninvestigate whether the difference between nitrile and isonitrile functional\ngroups may induce differences in the adsorption energies of the related isomers\nat the surfaces of interstellar grains of different nature and morphologies.\nThe question was addressed by means of a concerted experimental and theoretical\nstudy of the adsorption energies of CH3CN and CH3NC on the surface water ice\nand silica. The experimental determination of the molecule - surface\ninteraction energies was carried out using temperature programmed desorption\n(TPD) under an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) between 70 and 160 K. Theoretically, the\nquestion was addressed using first principle periodic density functional theory\n(DFT) to represent the organized solid support. The most stable isomer (CH3CN)\ninteracts more efficiently with the solid support than the higher energy isomer\n(CH3NC) for water ice and silica. Comparing with the HCN and HNC pair of\nisomers, the simulations show an opposite behaviour, in which isonitrile HNC\nare more strongly adsorbed than nitrile HCN provided that hydrogen bonds are\ncompatible with the nature of the model surface. The present study confirms\nthat the strength of the molecule surface interaction between isomers is not\nrelated to their intrinsic stability but instead to their respective ability to\ngenerate different types of hydrogen bonds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 08:31:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-18"}

However, many real\nhormonal regulation mechanisms (in particular, testosterone regulation) are in\nfact known to have non-cyclic structures and involve multiple feedbacks; a\nGoodwin-type model thus represents only a part of such a complicated mechanism.\nIn this paper, we examine a new mathematical model of hormonal regulation,\nobtained from the classical Goodwin's oscillator by introducing an additional\nnegative feedback. Local stability properties of the proposed model are\nstudied, and we show that the local instability of its unique equilibrium\nimplies oscillatory behavior of almost all solutions. Furthermore, under\nadditional restrictions we prove that almost all solutions converge to periodic\nones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 11:43:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 13:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-20"}

The Annular Groove Phase Mask (AGPM) is one possible implementation\nof the vector vortex coronagraph, where the helical phase ramp is produced by a\nconcentric subwavelength grating. For several years, we have been manufacturing\nAGPMs by etching gratings into synthetic diamond substrates using inductively\ncoupled plasma etching. Aims. We aim to design, fabricate, optimize, and\nevaluate new L-band AGPMs that reach the highest possible coronagraphic\nperformance, for applications in current and forthcoming infrared high-contrast\nimagers. Methods. Rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) is used for designing\nthe subwavelength grating of the phase mask. Coronagraphic performance\nevaluation is performed on a dedicated optical test bench. The experimental\nresults of the performance evaluation are then used to accurately determine the\nactual profile of the fabricated gratings, based on RCWA modeling. Results. The\nAGPM coronagraphic performance is very sensitive to small errors in etch depth\nand grating profile. Most of the fabricated components therefore show moderate\nperformance in terms of starlight rejection (a few 100:1 in the best cases).\nHere we present new processes for re-etching the fabricated components in order\nto optimize the parameters of the grating and hence significantly increase\ntheir coronagraphic performance. Starlight rejection up to 1000:1 is\ndemonstrated in a broadband L filter on the coronagraphic test bench, which\ncorresponds to a raw contrast of about 1e-5 at two resolution elements from the\nstar for a perfect input wave front on a circular, unobstructed aperture.\nConclusions.

The negativity associated with the W\n-distribution acts as a measure of the nonclassicality of the state.

While randomized hashing on the keys is capable\nof balancing the workload for key-based partitioning when the keys generally\nfollow a static distribution, it is likely to generate poor balancing\nperformance when workload variance occurs on the incoming data stream. This\npaper presents a new key-based workload partitioning framework, with practical\nalgorithms to support dynamic workload assignment for stateful operators. The\nframework combines hash-based and explicit key-based routing strategies for\nworkload distribution, which specifies the destination worker threads for a\nhandful of keys and assigns the other keys with the hashing function. When\nshort-term distribution fluctuations occur to the incoming data stream, the\nsystem adaptively updates the routing table containing the chosen keys, in\norder to rebalance the workload with minimal migration overhead within the\nstateful operator. We formulate the rebalance operation as an optimization\nproblem, with multiple objectives on minimizing state migration costs,\ncontrolling the size of the routing table and breaking workload imbalance among\nworker threads.

Consequently, most of the work done in this field has\nfocused on phenomenological dissipators which act locally on different parts of\nthe system. In this paper we show how to construct Lindblad dissipators for\nquantum many-body systems starting from a microscopic theory of the system-bath\ninteraction. We consider specifically a one-dimensional bosonic tight-binding\nchain connected to two baths at the first and last site, kept at different\ntemperatures and chemical potentials. We then shown that, even though the bath\ncoupling is local, the effective Lindblad dissipator stemming from this\ninteraction is inherently non-local, affecting all normal modes of the system.\nWe then use this formalism to study the current of particles and energy through\nthe system and find that they have the structure of Landauer's formula, with\nthe bath spectral density playing the role of the transfer integral. Finally,\nwe consider infinitesimal temperature and chemical potential gradients and show\nthat the currents satisfy Onsager's reciprocal relations, which is a\nconsequence of the fact that the microscopic quantum dynamics obeys detailed\nbalance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 14:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

The innermost regions\ncannot yet be resolved neither in the optical nor in the infrared and it is\nfair to say that we still lack a satisfactory understanding of the physical\nprocesses, geometry and composition of the central (sub-parsec) components of\nAGN. Like spectral or polarimetric observations, the reverberation data needs\nto be modeled in order to infer constraints on the AGN geometry (such as the\ninner radius or the half-opening angle of the dusty torus). In this research\nnote, we present preliminary modeling results using a time-dependent Monte\nCarlo method to solve the radiative transfer in a simplified AGN set up. We\ninvestigate different model configurations using both polarization and time\nlags and find a high dependency on the geometry to the time-lag response. For\nall models there is a clear distinction between edge-on or face-on viewing\nangles for fluxes and time lags, the later showing a higher\nwavelength-dependence than the former. Time lags, polarization and fluxes point\ntoward a clear dichotomy between the different inclinations of AGN, a method\nthat could help us to determine the true orientation of the nucleus in Seyfert\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 14:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-18"}

However, recent studies show that\nNMT generally produces fluent but inadequate translations (Tu et al. 2016b; Tu\net al. 2016a; He et al. 2016; Tu et al. 2017). This is in contrast to\nconventional Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), which usually yields\nadequate but non-fluent translations. It is natural, therefore, to leverage the\nadvantages of both models for better translations, and in this work we propose\nto incorporate SMT model into NMT framework. More specifically, at each\ndecoding step, SMT offers additional recommendations of generated words based\non the decoding information from NMT (e.g., the generated partial translation\nand attention history). Then we employ an auxiliary classifier to score the SMT\nrecommendations and a gating function to combine the SMT recommendations with\nNMT generations, both of which are jointly trained within the NMT architecture\nin an end-to-end manner.

In\nproperly designed multimode optomechanical systems, we can achieve situations\nin which mode field coupling is the only possible interaction pathway for the\nsystem. This enables, for example, swapping of a single excitation between\nemitter and phonon, creation of nonclassical states of motion and mechanical\nground-state cooling in the bad-cavity regime.

This problem is defined\non an underlying $n$-point metric space. An adversary presents real-time\nrequests online at points of the metric space, and the algorithm is required to\nmatch them, possibly after keeping them waiting for some time. The cost\nincurred is the sum of the distances between matched pairs of points (the\nconnection cost), and the sum of the waiting times of the requests (the delay\ncost). We present an algorithm with a competitive ratio of $O(\\log n)$, which\nimproves the upper bound of $O(\\log^2n+\\log\\Delta)$ of Emek et al, by removing\nthe dependence on $\\Delta$, the aspect ratio of the metric space (which can be\nunbounded as a function of $n$). The core of our algorithm is a deterministic\nalgorithm for MPMD on metrics induced by edge-weighted trees of height $h$,\nwhose cost is guaranteed to be at most $O(1)$ times the connection cost plus\n$O(h)$ times the delay cost of every feasible solution. The reduction from MPMD\non arbitrary metrics to MPMD on trees is achieved using the result on embedding\n$n$-point metric spaces into distributions over weighted hierarchically\nseparated trees of height $O(\\log n)$, with distortion $O(\\log n)$. We also\nprove a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ on the competitive ratio of any\nrandomized algorithm. This is the first lower bound which increases with $n$,\nand is attained on the metric of $n$ equally spaced points on a line.\n  The problem of Min-cost Bipartite Perfect Matching with Delays (MBPMD) is the\nsame as MPMD except that every request is either positive or negative, and\nrequests can be matched only if they have opposite polarity.

We perform a set of simulations with different values of\nthe plasma beta, distributed over three orders of magnitude, from 0.01 to 10.\nIn all the cases, once turbulence is fully developed, we observe a power-law\nspectrum of the fluctuating magnetic field on large scales (in the inertial\nrange) with a spectral index close to -5/3, while in the sub-ion range we\nobserve another power-law spectrum with a spectral index systematically varying\nwith $\\beta$ (from around -3.6 for small values to around -2.9 for large ones).\nThe two ranges are separated by a spectral break around ion scales. The length\nscale at which this transition occurs is found to be proportional to the ion\ninertial length, $d_i$, for $\\beta \\ll 1$ and to the ion gyroradius, $\\rho_i =\nd_i\\sqrt{\\beta}$, for $\\beta \\gg 1$, i.e., to the larger between the two scales\nin both the extreme regimes.

Energy-momentum is just a term\nproportional to the field equations and a 'curl' term with identically zero\ndivergence. Noether proved a \\emph{converse} \"Hilbertian assertion\": such\n\"improper\" conservation laws imply a generally covariant action.\n  Later and independently, particle physicists derived the nonlinear Einstein\nequations assuming the absence of negative-energy degrees of freedom (\"ghosts\")\nfor stability, along with universal coupling: all energy-momentum including\ngravity's serves as a source for gravity. Those assumptions (all but) imply\n(for 0 graviton mass) that the energy-momentum is only a term proportional to\nthe field equations and a symmetric \"curl,\" which implies the coalescence of\nthe flat background geometry and the gravitational potential into an effective\ncurved geometry. The flat metric, though useful in Rosenfeld's stress-energy\ndefinition, disappears from the field equations. Thus the particle physics\nderivation uses a reinvented Noetherian converse Hilbertian assertion in\nRosenfeld-tinged form.\n  The Rosenfeld stress-energy is identically the canonical stress-energy plus a\nBelinfante curl and terms proportional to the field equations, so the flat\nmetric is only a convenient mathematical trick without ontological commitment.\nNeither generalized relativity of motion, nor the identity of gravity and\ninertia, nor substantive general covariance is assumed. The more compelling\ncriterion of lacking ghosts yields substantive general covariance as an output.\nHence the particle physics derivation, though logically impressive, is neither\nas novel nor as ontologically laden as it has seemed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 14:50:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-16"}
