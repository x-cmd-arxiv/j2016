Focusing on the case of Bose-Einstein condensates, and using a\nmeanfield approach to treat inter-particle collisions, we identify the origin\nof dynamical instabilities arising due to the interplay between the external\ndrive and interactions. We present a widely-applicable generic numerical method\nto extract instability rates, and link parametric instabilities to uncontrolled\nenergy absorption at short times. Based on the existence of parametric\nresonances, we then develop an analytical approach within Bogoliubov theory,\nwhich quantitatively captures the instability rates of the system, and provides\nan intuitive picture of the relevant physical processes, including an\nunderstanding of how transverse modes affect the formation of parametric\ninstabilities. Importantly, our calculations demonstrate an agreement between\nthe instability rates determined from numerical simulations, and those\npredicted by theory. To determine the validity regime of the meanfield\nanalysis, we compare the latter to the weakly-coupled conserving approximation.\nThe tools developed and the results obtained in this work are directly relevant\nto present-day ultracold-atom experiments based on shaken optical lattices, and\nare expected to provide an insightful guidance in the quest for Floquet\nengineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2016 16:02:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 19:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

Motivated by the increasing demand response incentives offered\nby service operators, more customers are subscribing to various demand response\nprograms. However, with growing customer participation, the problem of\ndetermining the optimal loads to be curtailed in a microgrid during\ncontingencies within a feasible time frame becomes computationally hard. This\npaper proposes an efficient approximation algorithm for event-based demand\nresponse management in microgrids. In event-based management, it is important\nto curtail loads as fast as possible to maintain the stability of a microgrid\nduring the islanded mode in a scalable manner. A simple greedy approach is\npresented that can rapidly determine a close-to-optimal load curtailment scheme\nto maximize the aggregate customer utility in milliseconds for a large number\nof customers. This paper further derives a novel theoretical guarantee of the\ngap between the proposed efficient algorithm and the optimal solution (that may\nbe computationally hard to obtain). The performance of algorithm is\ncorroborated extensively by simulations with up to thousands of customers. For\nthe sake of practicality, the proposed event-based demand response management\nalgorithm is applied to a feeder from the Canadian benchmark distribution\nsystem. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach\nefficiently optimizes microgrid operation during islanded mode while\nmaintaining appropriate voltage levels and network constrains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2016 17:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

Signals having\nthe same period were found in only 234 stars overwhelmingly in the F2 to K1\nspectral range. The signals cannot be caused by instrumental or data analysis\neffects because they are present in only a very small fraction of stars within\na narrow spectral range and because signal to noise ratio considerations\npredict that the signal should mostly be detected in the brightest objects,\nwhile this is not the case. We consider several possibilities, such as\nrotational transitions in molecules, rapid pulsations, Fourier transform of\nspectral lines and signals generated by Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI).\nThey cannot be generated by molecules or rapid pulsations. It is highly\nunlikely that they come from the Fourier transform of spectral lines because\ntoo many strong lines located at nearly periodic frequencies are needed.\nFinally we consider the possibility, predicted in a previous published paper,\nthat the signals are caused by light pulses generated by Extraterrestrial\nIntelligence to makes us aware of their existence. We find that the detected\nsignals have exactly the shape of an ETI signal predicted in the previous\npublication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis. The fact that\nthey are only found in a very small fraction of stars within a narrow spectral\nrange centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in agreement with the\nETI hypothesis. However, at this stage, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed\nwith further work. Although unlikely, there is also a possibility that the\nsignals are due to highly peculiar chemical compositions in a small fraction of\ngalactic halo stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2016 19:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

We demonstrate that\nthe dark matter interaction types, and hence the annihilation processes\nrelevant for relic density and indirect detection, are strongly dictated by the\nmass generation mechanism chosen for the dark sector particles, and the\nrequirement of gauge invariance. We focus on the class of models in which\nfermionic dark matter couples to a spin-1 vector or axial-vector mediator.\nHowever, in order to generate dark sector mass terms, it is necessary in most\ncases to introduce a dark Higgs field and thus a spin-0 scalar mediator will\nalso be present. In the case that all the dark sector fields gain masses via\ncoupling to a single dark sector Higgs field, it is mandatory that the\naxial-vector coupling of the spin-1 mediator to the dark matter is non-zero;\nthe vector coupling may also be present depending on the charge assignments.\nFor all other mass generation options, only pure vector couplings between the\nspin-1 mediator and the dark matter are allowed. If these coupling restrictions\nare not obeyed, unphysical results may be obtained such as a violation of\nunitarity at high energies. These two-mediator scenarios lead to important\nphenomenology that does not arise in single mediator models.

The first class requires an\ninfinite tower of terms for consistency, which is known to lead uniquely to\ngeneral relativity. The second class only requires a finite number of terms for\nconsistency, which appears as another class of theories of massless spin 2. We\nrecap the causal consistency of general relativity and show how this fails in\nthe second class for the special case of coupling to photons, exploiting\nrelated calculations in the literature. In a companion paper [1] this result is\ngeneralized to a much broader set of theories.

Geodynamo simulations have been successful in\nreproducing many observed properties of the geomagnetic field. However, while\ntheoretical considerations suggest that flow in the core is governed by a\nbalance between Lorentz force, rotational force and buoyancy (called MAC\nbalance for Magnetic, Archimedean, Coriolis) with only minute roles for viscous\nand inertial forces, dynamo simulations must employ viscosity values that are\nmany orders of magnitude larger than in the core due to computational\nconstraints. In typical geodynamo models viscous and inertial forces are not\nmuch smaller than the Coriolis force and the Lorentz force plays a sub-dominant\nrole. This has led to conclusions that these simulations are viscously\ncontrolled and do not represent the physics of the geodynamo. Here we show by a\ndirect analysis of the relevant forces that a MAC balance can be achieved when\nthe viscosity is reduced to values close to the current practical limit.\nLorentz force, buoyancy and the uncompensated (by pressure) part of the\nCoriolis force are of very similar strength, whereas viscous and inertia are\nsmaller by a factor of at least 20 in the bulk of the fluid volume.

First, we provide lower bounds on the space\nrequirements for randomized approximation algorithms processing inputs of\nlength $n$.

For Monte Carlo algorithms, we prove a lower bounds of\n$\\Omega( M \\log\\min\\{|\\Sigma|,M\\})$ bits of memory; here $M=n/E$ for\napproximating the answer with additive error $E$, and $M= \\frac{\\log n}{\\log\n(1+\\varepsilon)}$ for approximating the answer with multiplicative error $(1 +\n\\varepsilon)$.

Thus the obtained lower\nbounds are asymptotically tight up to a logarithmic factor. The third algorithm\nis deterministic and finds a longest palindrome exactly if it is short.

It has been suggested that these events contribute to the mass and\nenergy content of the corona and solar wind, but the extent of these\ncontributions remains uncertain. We have recently modeled the formation and\nevolution of coronal jets using a three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) code with thermodynamics in a large spherical domain that includes the\nsolar wind. Our model is coupled to 3D MHD flux-emergence simulations, i.e, we\nuse boundary conditions provided by such simulations to drive a time-dependent\ncoronal evolution. The model includes parametric coronal heating, radiative\nlosses, and thermal conduction, which enables us to simulate the dynamics and\nplasma properties of coronal jets in a more realistic manner than done so far.\nHere we employ these simulations to calculate the amount of mass and energy\ntransported by coronal jets into the outer corona and inner heliosphere. Based\non observed jet-occurrence rates, we then estimate the total contribution of\ncoronal jets to the mass and energy content of the solar wind to (0.4-3.0) %\nand (0.3-1.0) %, respectively. Our results are largely consistent with the few\nprevious rough estimates obtained from observations, supporting the conjecture\nthat coronal jets provide only a small amount of mass and energy to the solar\nwind. We emphasize, however, that more advanced observations and simulations\nare needed to substantiate this conjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2016 23:56:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-09"}

Algebraic multigrid is a popular and effective\niterative method for solving large, sparse linear systems that arise from\ndiscretizing partial differential equations. However, while AMG is designed for\nsymmetric positive definite matrices (SPD), certain SPD problems, such as\nanisotropic diffusion, are still not adequately addressed by existing methods.\nNon-SPD problems pose an even greater challenge, and in practice AMG is often\nnot considered as a solver for such problems.\n  The focus of this paper is on so-called root-node AMG, which can be viewed as\na combination of classical and aggregation-based multigrid. An algorithm for\nroot-node is outlined and a filtering strategy is developed, which is able to\ncontrol the cost of using root-node AMG, particularly on difficult problems.\nNew theoretical motivation is provided for root-node and energy-minimization as\napplied to symmetric as well non-symmetric systems. Numerical results are then\npresented demonstrating the robust ability of root-node to solve non-symmetric\nproblems, systems-based problems, and difficult SPD problems, including\nstrongly anisotropic diffusion, convection-diffusion, and upwind steady-state\ntransport, in a scalable manner. New, detailed estimates of the computational\ncost of the setup and solve phase are given for each example, providing\nadditional support for root-node AMG over alternative methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 01:51:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 03:05:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 2018 02:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-30"}

Thus neither is the cosmic\nstring stable nor is the fermion number conserved, yet the bound state then\nbecomes stable due to Quantum Mechanics. The other phenomenon concerns a\nmetastable vacuum getting destabilised due to the presence of a cosmic string.\nThis happens because the scalar field signalling spontaneous symmetry breaking\nacquires a vacuum expectation value approaching its true vacuum value in the\ncore of the string.

We take the monolithic approach by\nGibou and Min that results in an extended Hodge projection. The projection\nupdates not only the fluid vector field but also the solid velocities.

The discovery of a high-mobility\ntwo-dimensional electron system (2DES) at interfaces of transition metal oxides\nhas attracted an immense scientific interest due to new opportunities opened in\nthe emerging field of oxide electronics. The subsequent paradigm shift from\ninterfaces to the bare surfaces of TMOs made the confined electron system\naccessible to surface-sensitive spectroscopic techniques and this new era is\nthe focus of the present article.

The numerical\nresults show the formation of an energy-dispersed structure due to the\nenergy-dependent displacement of protons towards the edges of the cloud by the\ngradient-B drift. Another direct effect of the gradient-B drift is the\nformation of ring-shaped velocity distribution functions within the\nvelocity-dispersed structure. Higher energy particles populate the edges of the\nproton beam, while smaller energies are located in the core. Non-gyrotropic\nvelocity distribution functions form on the front-side and trailing edge of the\ncloud; this effect is due to remote sensing of energetic particles with guiding\ncenters inside the beam. The kinetic features revealed by the test-kinetic\nsolutions have features similar to in-situ velocity distribution functions\nobserved by Cluster satellites in the magnetotail, close to the neutral sheet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 08:06:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

We carry out simulations to examine the recovery of the\naveraged surface brightness profile through stacking model HST/ACS images of a\nset of galaxies as functions of Sersic index (n), effective radius (Re) and\naxis ratio (AR).

A substantial body of evidence\nsupports the hypothesis that hydrodynamic coupling between the active\nfilaments, combined with waveform compliance, provides a robust mechanism for\nsynchrony. This elastohydrodynamic mechanism has been incorporated into\n`bead-spring' models in which flagella are represented by microspheres tethered\nby radial springs as internal forces drive them about orbits. While these\nlow-dimensional models reproduce the phenomenon of synchrony, their parameters\nare not readily relatable to those of flagella. More realistic models which\nreflect the elasticity of the axonemes and active force generation take the\nform of fourth-order nonlinear PDEs. While computational studies have shown\nsynchrony, the effects of hydrodynamic coupling between nearby filaments\ngoverned by such models have been theoretically examined only in the regime of\ninterflagellar distances $d$ large compared to flagellar length $L$. Yet, in\nmany biological situations $d/L \\ll 1$. Here, we first present an asymptotic\nanalysis of the hydrodynamic coupling between two filaments in the regime $d/L\n\\ll 1$, and find that the form of the coupling is independent of the details of\nthe internal forces that govern the motion of the filaments. The analysis is\nlike the localized induction approximation for vortex filament motion, extended\nto the case of mutual induction. To understand how the coupling mechanism leads\nto synchrony of extended objects, we introduce a heuristic model of flagellar\nbeating, a single fourth-order nonlinear PDE whose form is derived from\nsymmetry considerations, the physics of elasticity, and the overdamped nature\nof the dynamics. Analytical and numerical studies of this model illustrate how\nsynchrony between two filaments is achieved through the asymptotic coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 08:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

The drawback of these topologies is that switches at\nhigher levels like Spine switches need a high port density and, thus, are\nexpensive and limit the scalability of the network.\n  In this paper, we propose a data center network topology based on De Bruijn\ngraphs completely avoiding a switch hierarchy and implementing a flat network\ntopology of top-of-rack switches instead. This topology guarantees logarithmic\n(short) path length. We show that the required routing logic can be implemented\nby standard prefix matching operations in hardware (TCAM) allowing for using\ncommodity switches without any modification. Moreover, forwarding requires only\na very small number of forwarding table entries, saving costly and\nenergy-intensive TCAM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 09:18:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

We derive a\ngeneric dispersion relation (DR) governing linear sausage waves in straight\nmagnetic tubes for which plasma pressure is not negligible and the density and\ntemperature inhomogeneities of essentially arbitrary form take place in a layer\nof arbitrary width. Focusing on fast modes, we find that $\\beta_{\\rm i}$ only\nweakly influences $k_{\\rm c}$, the critical longitudinal wavenumber separating\nthe leaky from trapped modes. Likewise, for both trapped and leaky modes, the\nperiods $P$ in units of the transverse fast time depend only weakly on\n$\\beta_{\\rm i}$, which is compatible with the fact that the effective\nwavevectors of fast sausage modes are largely perpendicular to the background\nmagnetic field.

Also long-term observations of LS 5039 with H.E.S.S in\nphase I and phase II are reported. This source was monitored at very high\nenergies (VHEs) in a period of time spanning more than ten years. Its spectral\nenergy distribution measured with H.E.S.S. II extends down to 120 GeV. Spectral\nresults from the Fermi-LAT observations are shown as well, and the\ncompatibility with H.E.S.S. results in the overlapping energy range is\ndiscussed. The identification of the new gamma-ray binary candidate HESS\nJ1832-093 will also be presented. Furthermore, the search for VHE emission from\nthe microquasars GRS 1915+105, Circinus X-1 and V4641 Sgr based on data from\nH.E.S.S. observations conducted contemporaneously with the RXTE satellite\nexperiment will be reported. These data provide constraints on the integral\ngamma-ray flux at different X-ray states of the three sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 10:17:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 11:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

The oscillation of the inflaton field during\nthe reheating epoch after inflation plays the role of the driving force, while\nthe phase $\\theta$ of a scalar baryon field (a complex scalar field with baryon\nnumber) plays the role of the angle of the pendulum. When the inflaton is\ncoupled to the scalar baryon, the behavior of the phase $\\theta$ can be\nanalogous to that of the angle of the forced pendulum.

Despite its formal simplicity and advantages in contrast to TD-DFT\n(multiple excitations, for example, can be easily taken into account in an\nensemble), eDFT is not standard which is essentially due to the lack of\nreliable approximate exchange-correlation (xc) functionals for ensembles.\nFollowing Smith et al.

For that purpose, an exact analytical\nexpression for the weight-dependent ensemble exchange energy has been derived.\nThe complementary exact ensemble correlation energy has been computed by means\nof Legendre--Fenchel transforms. Interesting features like discontinuities in\nthe ensemble xc potential in the strongly correlated limit have been\nrationalized by means of a generalized adiabatic connection formalism. Finally,\nfunctional-driven errors induced by ground-state density-functional\napproximations have been studied. In the strictly symmetric case or in the\nweakly correlated regime, combining ensemble exact exchange with ground-state\ncorrelation functionals gives relatively accurate ensemble energies. However,\nwhen approaching the equiensemble in the strongly correlated regime, this\napproximation leads to highly curved ensemble energies with negative slope\nwhich is unphysical. Using both ground-state exchange and correlation\nfunctionals gives much better results in that case. In fact, exact ensemble\nenergies are almost recovered in some density domains.

In contrast, the vast majority of the works\ndedicated to this issue stipulate that the training dataset used to compute the\nempirical risk functional is composed of i.i.d. observations. Beyond the cases\nwhere training data are drawn uniformly without replacement among a large\ni.i.d. sample or modelled as a realization of a weakly dependent sequence of\nr.v.'s, statistical guarantees when the data used to train a classifier are\ndrawn by means of a more general sampling/survey scheme and exhibit a complex\ndependence structure have not been documented yet. It is the main purpose of\nthis paper to show that the theory of empirical risk minimization can be\nextended to situations where statistical learning is based on survey samples\nand knowledge of the related inclusion probabilities. Precisely, we prove that\nminimizing a weighted version of the empirical risk, refered to as the\nHorvitz-Thompson risk (HT risk), over a class of controlled complexity lead to\na rate for the excess risk of the order $O_{\\mathbb{P}}((\\kappa_N (\\log\nN)/n)^{1/2})$ with $\\kappa_N=(n/N)/\\min_{i\\leq N}\\pi_i$, when data are sampled\nby means of a rejective scheme of (deterministic) size $n$ within a statistical\npopulation of cardinality $N\\geq n$, a generalization of basic {\\it sampling\nwithout replacement} with unequal probability weights $\\pi_i>0$. Extension to\nother sampling schemes are then established by a coupling argument. Beyond\ntheoretical results, numerical experiments are displayed in order to show the\nrelevance of HT risk minimization and that ignoring the sampling scheme used to\ngenerate the training dataset may completely jeopardize the learning procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 13:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jan 2019 10:45:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-21"}

It was\nalso designed to identify statistical trends that may appear when running many\nmodels of the formation of low-mass stars by varying the initial conditions. A\nlarge set of 143 calculations of the gravitational collapse of an isolated\nsphere of gas with uniform temperature and a Bonnor-Ebert like density profile\nwas undertaken using a 1D fully implicit Lagrangian radiation hydrodynamics\ncode. The parameter space covered initial masses from 0.2 to 8 Msun,\ntemperatures of 5-30 K and radii between 3000 and 30,000 AU. A spread in the\nthermal evolutionary tracks of the runs was found, due to differing initial\nconditions and optical depths. Within less than an order of magnitude, all\nfirst and second Larson cores had masses and radii independent of the initial\nconditions. The time elapsed between the formation of the first and second\ncores was found to strongly depend on the first core mass accretion rate, and\nno first core in our grid of models lived for longer than 2000 years, before\nthe onset of the second collapse. The end product of a protostellar cloud\ncollapse, the second Larson core, is, at birth, a canonical object with a mass\nand radius of about 3 Mjup and 8 Rjup, independent of its initial conditions.\nThe evolution sequence which brings the gas to stellar densities can however\nproceed in a variety of scenarios, on different timescales, along different\nisentropes, but each story line can largely be predicted by the initial\nconditions.

Super-hot Jupiters\noccupy a temperature regime similar to low mass M-dwarfs, where minimal cloud\ncondensation is expected. However, observations of exoplanets such as WASP-12b\n(Teq ~ 2500 K) result in a transmission spectrum indicative of a cloudy\natmosphere. We re-examine the temperature and pressure space occupied by these\nsuper-hot Jupiter atmospheres, to explore the role of the initial Al- and\nTi-bearing condensates as the main source of cloud material. Due to the high\ntemperatures a majority of the more common refractory material is not depleted\ninto deeper layers and would remain in the vapor phase. The lack of depletion\ninto deeper layers means that these materials with relatively low cloud masses\ncan become significant absorbers in the upper atmosphere. We provide\ncondensation curves for the initial Al- and Ti-bearing condensates that may be\nused to provide quantitative estimates of the effect of metallicity on cloud\nmasses, as planets with metal-rich hosts potentially form more opaque clouds\nbecause more mass is available for condensation. Increased metallicity also\npushes the point of condensation to hotter, deeper layers in the planetary\natmosphere further increasing the density of the cloud. We suggest that planets\naround metal-rich hosts are more likely to have thick refractory clouds, and\ndiscuss the implication on the observed spectra of WASP-12b.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 13:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-18"}

In particular, the power-law version $f(R)\\propto R^n$, resulting\nfrom the existence of Noether symmetries for $f(R)$, is sufficient to implement\nthe approach. In fact, relations between the FP parameters and the corrected\nNewtonian potential, coming from $R^n$, can be found and justified from a\nphysical point of view. Specifically, we analyze the velocity distribution of\nelliptical galaxies and obtain that $r_c$, the scale-length depending on the\ngravitational system properties, is proportional to $r_e$, the galaxy effective\nradius. This fact points out that the gravitational corrections induced by\n$f(R)$ can lead photometry and dynamics of the system. Furthermore, the main\nbyproduct of such an approach is that gravity could work in different ways\ndepending on the scales of self-gravitating systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 13:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

We consider the case in which the\nrobot can allocate limited resources to VIN, due to tight computational\nconstraints. Therefore, we answer the following question: under limited\nresources, what are the most relevant visual cues to maximize the performance\nof visual-inertial navigation? Our approach has four key ingredients. First, it\nis task-driven, in that the selection of the visual cues is guided by a metric\nquantifying the VIN performance. Second, it exploits the notion of\nanticipation, since it uses a simplified model for forward-simulation of robot\ndynamics, predicting the utility of a set of visual cues over a future time\nhorizon. Third, it is efficient and easy to implement, since it leads to a\ngreedy algorithm for the selection of the most relevant visual cues.

We examine here these models, analyzing their ability to\nfit cosmological data using robust model comparison criteria. Type Ia\nsupernovae (SNIa), baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and acoustic scale\ninformation from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have been used. We find\nthat SNIa data either alone or combined with BAO can be well reproduced by both\n$\\Lambda$CDM and power law expansion models with $n\\sim 1.5$, while the\nconstant expansion rate model $(n=1)$ is clearly disfavored. Allowing for some\nredshift evolution in the SNIa luminosity essentially removes any clear\npreference for a specific model. The CMB data are well known to provide the\nmost stringent constraints on standard cosmological models, in particular,\nthrough the position of the first peak of the temperature angular power\nspectrum, corresponding to the sound horizon at recombination, a scale\nphysically related to the BAO scale. Models with $n\\geq 1$ lead to a divergence\nof the sound horizon and do not naturally provide the relevant scales for the\nBAO and the CMB. We retain an empirical footing to overcome this issue: we let\nthe data choose the preferred values for these scales, while we recompute the\nionization history in power law models, to obtain the distance to the CMB. In\ndoing so, we find that the scale coming from the BAO data is not consistent\nwith the observed position of the first peak of the CMB temperature angular\npower spectrum for any power law cosmology.

Network\nalgorithms with similar algebraic graph theoretic structures, called being of\nLaplacian-type in this paper, also arise in other related multi-agent control\nproblems, such as aggregation and containment control, target surrounding,\ndistributed optimization and modeling of opinion evolution in social groups. In\nspite of their similarities, each of such algorithms has often been studied\nusing separate mathematical techniques. In this paper, a novel approach is\noffered, allowing a unified and elegant way to examine many Laplacian-type\nalgorithms for multi-agent coordination. This approach is based on the analysis\nof some differential or difference inequalities that have to be satisfied by\nthe some \"outputs\" of the agents (e.g. the distances to the desired set in\naggregation problems). Although such inequalities may have many unbounded\nsolutions, under natural graphic connectivity conditions all their bounded\nsolutions converge (and even reach consensus), entailing the convergence of the\ncorresponding distributed algorithms. In the theory of differential equations\nthe absence of bounded non-convergent solutions is referred to as the\nequation's dichotomy.

We focus on the following two facets: (1) Adopting\na simple dielectric model where the refractive index $n$ is constant, we\ndemonstrate by means of a mapping procedure how the electromagnetic field in a\nmedium can be mapped into a corresponding field in vacuum. This mapping was\npresented many years ago [I. Brevik and B. Lautrup, Mat. Fys. Medd. Dan. Vid.\nSelsk {\\bf 38}(1), 1 (1970)], but is apparently not well known. A\ncharacteristic property of this procedure is that it shows how natural the\nMinkowski energy-momentum tensor fits into the canonical formalism. Especially\nthe spacelike character of the electromagnetic total four-momentum for a\nradiation field (implying negative electromagnetic energy in some inertial\nframes), so strikingly demonstrated in the Cherenkov effect, is worth\nattention. (2) Our second objective is to give a critical analysis of some\nrecent experiments on electromagnetic momentum. Care must here be taken in the\ninterpretations: it is easy to be misled and conclude that an experiment is\nimportant for the energy-momentum problem, while what is demonstrated\nexperimentally is merely the action of the Abraham-Minkowski force acting in\nsurface layers or inhomogeneous regions. The Abraham-Minkowski force is common\nfor the two energy-momentum tensors and carries no information about field\nmomentum.

Indeed, we rigorously analyze the phase diagram of the\nmodel and show that the critical temperatures for fermion densities below\nhalf-filling can manifest a very different behavior as compared to the case of\ndensities above half-filling. This fact results from the inter-band interaction\nand intra-band Coulomb repulsion in interplay with thermal fluctuations between\ntwo energetic levels. So, if the energy difference between bands is too big\nthen the asymmetry disappears. Moreover, the critical temperature turns out to\nbe a non-monotonic function of the fermion density and the phase diagram of our\nmodel shows \"superconducting domes\" as in high-$T_{c}$ cuprate superconductors.\nThis explains why the maximal critical temperature is attained at donor\ndensities away from the maximal one. Outside the superconducting phase and for\nfermion densities near half-filling the thermodynamics governed by our\nHamiltonian corresponds, as in real high-$T_c$ materials, to a Mott-insulating\nphase. The nature of the inter-band interaction can be electrostatic (screened\nCoulomb interaction), magnetic (for instance some Heisenberg-type one-site\nspin-spin interaction), or a mixture of both. If the inter-band interaction is\npredominately magnetic then - additionally to the electron-hole asymmetry - we\nobserve a reentering behavior meaning that the superconducting phase can only\noccur in a finite interval of temperatures. This phenomenon is rather rare, but\nhas also been observed in the so-called magnetic superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2016 21:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}
