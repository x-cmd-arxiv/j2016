It decreases\nat the beginning (at comparatively low energies) but then starts increasing.\nFrom Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) energies of 23.5 - 62.5 GeV up to higher\nenergies 7 - 13 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) it increases by a factor\nmore than 1.5! According to intuitive classical ideas we would expect a stable\ntendency with increasing proportion of the break-down of protons compared to\ntheir survival probability. One can assume that either the asymptotic freedom\nor the extremely short time of flight of high energy protons through each other\nare in charge of such a surprising effect. The unquestionable principle of\nunitarity combined with the available experimental data on elastic scattering\nis used to get new conclusions about the shape of the interaction region of\ncolliding protons. Its evolution at present energies is considered. Some\npredictions about its behaviour at even higher energies are described with\ndifferent assumptions on relative roles of elastic scattering and inelastic\nprocesses. The shape can transform rather drastically if the proportion of\nelastic processes keeps rising. This unexpected property leads to an unexpected\ncorollary. The possible origin of the effect and its interrelation to the\nstrong interaction dynamics are speculated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2016 16:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

Revocable hierarchical\nIBE (RHIBE) can provide these two methods by organizing the identities of users\nas a hierarchy and broadcasting an update key for non-revoked users per each\ntime period. To provide the key revocation functionality, previous RHIBE\nschemes use a tree-based revocation scheme.

This was analyzed in previous work\n(Longcope et al. 2010), and interpreted as plasma heated and compressed by slow\nmagnetosonic shocks generated during post-reconnection retraction of the flux.\nThat work used analytic expressions from a thin flux tube (TFT) model, which\nneglected many potentially important factors such as thermal conduction and\nchromospheric evaporation. Here we use a numerical solution of the TFT\nequations to produce a more comprehensive and accurate model of the same flare,\nincluding those effects previously omitted. These simulations corroborate the\nprior hypothesis that slow mode shocks persist well after the retraction has\nended, thus producing a compact, loop-top source instead of an elongated jet,\nas steady reconnection models predict. Thermal conduction leads to densities\nhigher than analytic estimates had predicted, and evaporation enhances the\ndensity still higher, but at lower temperatures. X-ray light curves and spectra\nare synthesized by convolving the results from a single TFT simulation with the\nrate at which flux is reconnected, as measured through motion of flare ribbons,\nfor example. These agree well with light curves observed by RHESSI and GOES and\nspectra from RHESSI. An image created from a superposition of TFT model runs\nresembles one produced from RHESSI observations. This suggests that the HXR\nloop-top source, at least the one observed in this flare, could be the result\nof slow magnetosonic shocks produced in fast reconnection models like\nPetschek's.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2016 16:32:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

This signal probes the matter-velocity correlation function,\nscaled by the average optical depth ($\\tau$) of the galaxy groups and clusters\nin the sample, and is thus of fundamental importance for cosmology. However, in\norder to translate pairwise kSZ measurements into cosmological constraints,\nexternal constraints on $\\tau$ are necessary. In this work, we present a new\nmodel for the intra-cluster medium, which takes into account star-formation,\nfeedback, non-thermal pressure, and gas cooling. Our semi-analytic model is\ncomputationally efficient and can reproduce results of recent hydrodynamical\nsimulations of galaxy cluster formation. By calibrating the model using recent\nX-ray measurements of gas density profiles of clusters and $M_{\\mathrm{gas}}-M$\nrelations of groups and clusters, we show that the integrated $\\tau$ is\nconstrained to better than 6% (with a confidence level of 95%), which sets the\ntightest constraints on the external prior on the optical depth of groups and\nclusters reported in the literature to date.

In this project the nanocraft is a gram-scale robotic\nspacecraft comprising two main parts: StarChip and Lightsail.\n  To achieve the goal of the project it is necessary to solve a number of\noutstanding scientific problems. One of these tasks is to make sure that the\nnanocraft position and orientation inside the intense laser beam column is\nstable. The nanocraft driven by intense laser beam pressure acting on its\nLightsail is sensitive to the torques and lateral forces reacting on the\nsurface of the sail. These forces influence the orientation and lateral\ndisplacement of the spacecraft, thus affecting its dynamics. If unstable the\nnanocraft might be expelled from the area of laser beam.

Here we show using one-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic SN\nmodels that the multi-band light curves of SNe IIL are well fit by ordinary red\nsupergiants surrounded by dense circumstellar material (CSM).

Bayesian techniques are\npowerful methods because they can match all available observables\nsimultaneously to stellar models while taking prior knowledge properly into\naccount. However, in most cases it is assumed that observables are uncorrelated\nwhich is generally not the case. Here, we include correlations in the Bayesian\ncode BONNSAI by incorporating the covariance matrix in the likelihood function.\nWe derive a parametrisation of the covariance matrix that, in addition to\nclassical uncertainties, only requires the specification of a correlation\nparameter that describes how observables co-vary. Our correlation parameter\ndepends purely on the method with which observables have been determined and\ncan be analytically derived in some cases. This approach therefore has the\nadvantage that correlations can be accounted for even if information for them\nare not available in specific cases but are known in general. Because the new\nlikelihood model is a better approximation of the data, the reliability and\nrobustness of the inferred parameters are improved. We find that neglecting\ncorrelations biases the most likely values of inferred stellar parameters and\naffects the precision with which these parameters can be determined. For\nexample, we apply our technique to massive OB stars, but emphasise that it is\nvalid for any type of stars. For effective temperatures and surface gravities\ndetermined from atmosphere modelling, we find that masses can be underestimated\non average by $0.5\\sigma$ and mass uncertainties overestimated by a factor of\nabout 2 when neglecting correlations. At the same time, the age precisions are\nunderestimated over a wide range of stellar parameters.

It is argued that because computer models do not hold personal\nprejudice, the predictions they produce will be equally free from prejudice.\nThere is growing recognition that employing algorithms does not remove the\npotential for bias, and can even amplify it, since training data were\ninevitably generated by a process that is itself biased.

Recently,\ndistributed representation of sentences learned by neural models from unlabeled\ndata has been shown to outperform the traditional bag-of-words representation.\nHowever, most of these learning methods consider only the content of a sentence\nand disregard the relations among sentences in a discourse by and large.\n  In this paper, we propose a series of novel models for learning latent\nrepresentations of sentences (Sen2Vec) that consider the content of a sentence\nas well as inter-sentence relations. We first represent the inter-sentence\nrelations with a language network and then use the network to induce contextual\ninformation into the content-based Sen2Vec models. Two different approaches are\nintroduced to exploit the information in the network.

The second approach uses a regularizer to encode the information in the\nnetwork into the existing Sen2Vec model. Experimental results show that our\nproposed models outperform existing methods in three fundamental information\nsystem tasks demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

A\nstandard approach that the medical community has devised to manage widely\nprevalent chronic diseases such as chronic heart failure (CHF) is to have a\ncommittee of experts develop guidelines that all physicians should follow.\nThese guidelines typically consist of a series of complex rules that make\nrecommendations based on a patient's information. Due to their complexity,\noften the guidelines are either ignored or not complied with at all, which can\nresult in poor medical practices. It is not even clear whether it is humanly\npossible to follow these guidelines due to their length and complexity. In the\ncase of CHF management, the guidelines run nearly 80 pages. In this paper we\ndescribe a physician-advisory system for CHF management that codes the entire\nset of clinical practice guidelines for CHF using answer set programming. Our\napproach is based on developing reasoning templates (that we call knowledge\npatterns) and using these patterns to systemically code the clinical guidelines\nfor CHF as ASP rules. Use of the knowledge patterns greatly facilitates the\ndevelopment of our system.

Our work makes two contributions: (i) it shows that highly complex\nguidelines can be successfully coded as ASP rules, and (ii) it develops a\nseries of knowledge patterns that facilitate the coding of knowledge expressed\nin a natural language and that can be used for other application domains.

Typical recommender systems assume\navailability of user- and item-related information, but such information is not\nusually available in access logs. To resolve this problem, we first use\ndiscrete categorical labels to construct categorical combinations from access\nlogs in a bootstrapping manner. Then, we utilize rank statistics of entity rank\nand order categorical combinations for recommendation. From a double-sided cold\nstart, with minimal supervision, Helios learns to recommend most salient\nanomalies at large-scale, and provides visualizations to security experts to\nexplain rationale behind the recommendations. Our experiments show Helios to be\nsuitable for large-scale applications: from cold starts, in less than 60\nminutes, Helios can analyze roughly 4.6 billion records in logs of 400GB with\nabout 300 million potential categorical combinations, then generate ranked\ncategorical combinations as recommended discoveries.

However, the exact amplification mechanisms of cosmic\nmagnetic fields remain relatively poorly understood. Here I start by reviewing\nrecent advances in the numerical and theoretical modelling of the 'turbulent\ndynamo', which may explain the origin of galactic and inter-galactic magnetic\nfields. While dynamo action was previously investigated in great detail for\nincompressible plasmas, I here place particular emphasis on highly compressible\nastrophysical plasmas, which are characterised by strong density fluctuations\nand shocks, such as the interstellar medium. I find that dynamo action works\nnot only in subsonic plasmas, but also in highly supersonic, compressible\nplasmas, as well as for low and high magnetic Prandtl numbers. I further\npresent new numerical simulations from which I determine the growth of the\nturbulent (un-ordered) magnetic field component ($B_\\mathrm{turb}$) in the\npresence of weak and strong guide fields ($B_0$). I vary $B_0$ over 5 orders of\nmagnitude and find that the dependence of $B_\\mathrm{turb}$ on $B_0$ is\nrelatively weak, and can be explained with a simple theoretical model in which\nthe turbulence provides the energy to amplify $B_\\mathrm{turb}$. Finally, I\ndiscuss some important implications of magnetic fields for the structure of\naccretion discs, the launching of jets, and the star formation rate of\ninterstellar clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 01:00:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 05:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-30"}

NWFE was introduced to enjoy optimum\ncharacteristics of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and nonparametric\ndiscriminant analysis (NDA) while rectifying their drawbacks. It emphasizes the\npoints near decision boundary by putting greater weights on them and\ndeemphasizes other points. Incremental nonparametric weighted feature\nextraction (INWFE) is the online version of NWFE. INWFE has advantages of NWFE\nmethod such as extracting more than L-1 features in contrast to LDA. It is\nindependent of the class distribution and performs well in complex distributed\ndata. The effects of outliers are reduced due to the nature of its\nnonparametric scatter matrix. Furthermore, it is possible to add new samples\nasynchronously, i.e. whenever a new sample becomes available at any given time,\nit can be added to the algorithm. This is useful for many real world\napplications since all data cannot be available in advance. This method is\nimplemented on Gaussian and non-Gaussian multidimensional data, a number of UCI\ndatasets and Indian Pine dataset. Results are compared with NWFE in terms of\nclassification accuracy and execution time. For nearest neighbour classifier it\nshows that this technique converges to NWFE at the end of learning process. In\naddition, the computational complexity is reduced in comparison with NWFE in\nterms of execution time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 01:02:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-27"}

The deviations with respect to the\nMaxwellian equilibrium, called kinetic effects, are required to be taken into\naccount specially for fusion reactor plasmas. Generally, because the\nperturbation theory is not consistent with observed steady-state\nnon-Maxwellians, these kinetic effects are numerically evaluated by very\nCPU-expensive codes, avoiding the analytic complexity of velocity phase space\nintegrals. We develop here a new method based on analytic non-Maxwellian\ndistribution functions constructed from non-orthogonal basis sets in order to\n(i) use as few parameters as possible, (ii) increase the efficiency to model\nnumerical and experimental non-Maxwellians, (iii) help to understand unsolved\nproblems such as diagnostics discrepancies from the physical interpretation of\nthe parameters, and (iv) obtain analytic corrections due to kinetic effects\ngiven by a small number of terms and removing the numerical error of the\nevaluation of velocity phase space integrals. This work does not attempt to\nderive new physical effects even if it could be possible to discover one from\nthe better understandings of some unsolved problems, but here we focus on the\nanalytic prediction of kinetic corrections from analytic non-Maxwellians. As\napplications, examples of analytic kinetic corrections are shown for the\nsecondary electron emission, the Langmuir probe characteristic curve, and the\nentropy. This is done by using three analytic representations of the\ndistribution function: the Kappa (KDF), the bi-modal or a new interpreted\nnon-Maxwellian (INMDF) distribution function.

A key\nfeature of the present approach is that the discretization of the wave function\nand its derivatives are made to be independent of any specific metric through\ncoordinate transformation.

In traditional information retrieval\nmodels, on the other hand, terms have discrete or local representations, and\nthe relevance of a document is determined by the exact matches of query terms\nin the body text. We hypothesize that matching with distributed representations\ncomplements matching with traditional local representations, and that a\ncombination of the two is favorable. We propose a novel document ranking model\ncomposed of two separate deep neural networks, one that matches the query and\nthe document using a local representation, and another that matches the query\nand the document using learned distributed representations. The two networks\nare jointly trained as part of a single neural network.

Bayesian phylogenetic algorithms,\nwhich approximate a posterior distribution on trees, have become a popular if\ncomputationally expensive means of doing phylogenetics. Modern data collection\ntechnologies are quickly adding new sequences to already substantial databases.\nWith all current techniques for Bayesian phylogenetics, computation must start\nanew each time a sequence becomes available, making it costly to maintain an\nup-to-date estimate of a phylogenetic posterior. These considerations highlight\nthe need for an \\emph{online} Bayesian phylogenetic method which can update an\nexisting posterior with new sequences.\n  Here we provide theoretical results on the consistency and stability of\nmethods for online Bayesian phylogenetic inference based on Sequential Monte\nCarlo (SMC) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We first show a consistency\nresult, demonstrating that the method samples from the correct distribution in\nthe limit of a large number of particles. Next we derive the first reported set\nof bounds on how phylogenetic likelihood surfaces change when new sequences are\nadded. These bounds enable us to characterize the theoretical performance of\nsampling algorithms by bounding the effective sample size (ESS) with a given\nnumber of particles from below. We show that the ESS is guaranteed to grow\nlinearly as the number of particles in an SMC sampler grows. Surprisingly, this\nresult holds even though the dimensions of the phylogenetic model grow with\neach new added sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 02:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-27"}

In this paper we introduce a concept of cost efficiency for user's\nmobile data management, defined as the ratio of user's mobile data consumption\nbenefits and its expense. We propose an integrated cost-efficiency-based data\ntraffic management scheme including long-term data demand planning, short-term\ndata traffic pre-scheduling and real-time data traffic management. The\nreal-time data traffic management algorithm is proposed to coordinate user's\ndata consumption to tailor to the pre-scheduled data traffic profile.

The classical\n1961 result of Erd\\H{o}s, Ko, and Rado states that every intersecting family of\nr-sets with $r\\leq n/2$ has size at most that of a star. We say that graph G is\nr-EKR if, among all intersecting families of independent r-sets of G, the\nlargest is attained by a star. In 2005 Holroyd and Talbot conjectured that\nevery graph G is r-EKR for all $1\\leq r\\leq \\mu(G)/2$, where $\\mu(G)$ is the\nsize of the smallest maximal independent set in G. We verified the conjecture\nin 2011 for all chordal graphs containing an isolated vertex.\n  For graphs without isolated vertices it is difficult to determine the center\nof the largest star, which is often necessary to prove that they are EKR. A\ntree has the leaf property if its largest star occurs on one of its leaves.

In this\npaper we briefly review the Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE) which can be used\nto quantify the angular power spectrum of the sky signal directly from the\nvisibilities measured in radio-interferometric observations. The salient\nfeatures of the TGE are (1.) it deals with the gridded data which makes it\ncomputationally very fast (2.) it avoids a positive noise bias which normally\narises from the system noise inherent to the visibility data, and (3.) it\nallows us to taper the sky response and thereby suppresses the contribution\nfrom unsubtracted point sources in the outer parts and the sidelobes of the\nantenna beam pattern. We also summarize earlier work where the TGE was used to\nmeasure the C_l of the DGSE using 150 MHz GMRT data. Earlier measurements of\nthe angular power spectrum are restricted to smaller angular multipole l ~ 10^3\nfor the DGSE, the signal at the larger l values is dominated by the residual\npoint sources after source subtraction. The higher sensitivity of the upcoming\nSKA1 Low will allow the point sources to be subtracted to a fainter level than\npossible with existing telescopes.

To\ndescribe the information dynamics of individual path realizations, we introduce\nthe pathwise transfer entropy, the expectation of which is the transfer entropy\naccumulated over a finite time interval. We demonstrate that this formalism\npermits an instantaneous transfer entropy rate. These properties are analogous\nto the behavior of physical quantities defined along paths such as work and\nheat. We use this approach to produce an explicit form for the transfer entropy\nfor pure jump processes, and highlight the simplified form in the specific case\nof point processes (frequently used in neuroscience to model neural spike\ntrains). Finally, we present two synthetic spiking neuron model examples to\nexhibit the pertinent features of our formalism, namely, that the information\nflow for point processes consists of discontinuous jump contributions (at\nspikes in the target) interrupting a continuously varying contribution\n(relating to waiting times between target spikes).

Assessing the percolation\nthreshold of networks has wide applications in network reliability, information\nspread, epidemic control, etc. The theoretical approach so far to assess the\npercolation threshold is mainly based on spectral radius of adjacency matrix or\nnon-backtracking matrix, which is limited to dense graphs or locally treelike\ngraphs, and is less effective for sparse networks with non-negligible amount of\ntriangles and loops. In this paper, we study high-order non-backtracking\nmatrices and their application to assessing percolation threshold. We first\ndefine high-order non-backtracking matrices and study the properties of their\nspectral radii. Then we focus on 2nd-order non-backtracking matrix and\ndemonstrate analytically that the reciprocal of its spectral radius gives a\ntighter lower bound than those of adjacency and standard non-backtracking\nmatrices. We further build a smaller size matrix with the same largest\neigenvalue as the 2nd-order non-backtracking matrix to improve computation\nefficiency.

In a distributed storage system, every storage node has a\nprobability to fail and once an individual storage node fails, it must be\nreconstructed using data stored in the surviving nodes. Computation load and\nnetwork bandwidth are two important issues we need to concern when repairing a\nfailed node. The traditional maximal distance separable (MDS) storage codes\nhave low repair complexity but high repair bandwidth. On the contrary, minimal\nstorage regenerating (MSR) codes have low repair bandwidth but high repair\ncomplexity. Fortunately, the newly introduced piggyback codes combine the\nadvantages of both ones.\n  In this paper, by introducing a novel piggybacking design framework for\nsystematic MDS codes, we construct a storage code whose average repair\nbandwidth rate, i.e., the ratio of average repair bandwidth and the amount of\nthe original data, can be as low as $\\frac{\\sqrt{2r-1}}{r}$, which\nsignificantly improves the ratio $\\frac{r-1}{2r-1}$ of the previous result. In\nthe meanwhile, every failed systematic node of the new code can be\nreconstructed quickly using the decoding algorithm of an MDS code, only with\nsome additional additions over the underlying finite field. This is very fast\ncompared with the complex matrix multiplications needed in the repair of a\nfailed node of an MSR code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 08:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-27"}

When ferromagnets and\nantiferromagnets are coupled together, they often exhibit the exchange bias\neffect, a unidirectional interface exchange field causing a shift of the\nmagnetic hysteresis loop. The effective magnitude of this interface exchange\nfield is at most a few percent of the bulk exchange, arising from pinned\ninterfacial spins in the antiferromagnet. The pinned spins are known to\ncomprise a small fraction of the total number of interface spins, yet their\nexact nature and physical origin has so far been elusive. Here we show that in\nthe technologically important $\\gamma - IrMn_3/CoFe$ structure the pinned\ninterface spins are in fact delocalised over the whole interface layer. The\npinned spins arise from the small imbalance of the number of spins in each\nmagnetic sublattice in the antiferromagnet due to the natural atomic disorder.\nThese pinned spins are strongly coupled to the bulk antiferromagnet explaining\ntheir remarkable stability. Moreover, we find that the ferromagnet strongly\ndistorts the interface spin structure of the antiferromagnet, causing a large\nreversible interface magnetisation that does not contribute to exchange bias.\nThe unexpected delocalised nature of the pinned interface spins explains both\ntheir small number and their stability, uncovering the mysterious microscopic\norigin of the exchange bias effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 09:07:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 08:39:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 10:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-16"}

Surface reconstruction drastically changes\nC60 s spintronic properties 1 the spin-split p-d hybridization involve\nmulti-orbitals of C60 and metal double layers, 2 the subsurface layer dominates\nthe C60 spin properties, and 3) reconstruction induces a large magnetic moment\nin C60 of 0.58 B, which is a synergetic effect of the top two layers as a\nresult of a magnetic direct-exchange interaction. Understanding these complex\nspinterfaces phenomena is a crucial step for their device applications. The\nsurface reconstruction can be realized by annealing at above room temperature\nin experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 09:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-27"}

We find\nthat: (i) continuous radiative feedback stabilizes the disc and suppresses\nfurther fragmentation, reducing the number secondary objects formed; (ii)\nepisodic feedback from secondary objects heats and stabilises the disc when the\noutburst occurs, but shortly after the outburst stops, the disc becomes\nunstable and fragments again. However, fewer secondary objects are formed\ncompared to the the case without radiative feedback. We also find that the mass\ngrowth of secondary objects is mildly suppressed due to the effect of their\nradiative feedback. However, their mass growth also depends on where they form\nin the disc and on their subsequent interactions, such that their final masses\nare not drastically different from the case without radiative feedback.

It is a well-known fact that around one million people suffer from\nParkinson's disease in the United States whereas the number of people suffering\nfrom Parkinson's disease worldwide is around 5 million. Thus, it is important\nto predict Parkinson's disease in early stages so that early plan for the\nnecessary treatment can be made. People are mostly familiar with the motor\nsymptoms of Parkinson's disease, however, an increasing amount of research is\nbeing done to predict the Parkinson's disease from non-motor symptoms that\nprecede the motor ones. If an early and reliable prediction is possible then a\npatient can get a proper treatment at the right time. Nonmotor symptoms\nconsidered are Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD) and\nolfactory loss. Developing machine learning models that can help us in\npredicting the disease can play a vital role in early prediction. In this\npaper, we extend a work which used the non-motor features such as RBD and\nolfactory loss. Along with this the extended work also uses important\nbiomarkers.

Since VNFs\ncan only be placed onto servers located in networked data centers, which is the\nNFV's salient feature, the traffic directed to these data center areas has\nsignificant impact on network load balancing. Network load balancing can be\neven more critical for an ordered sequence of VNFs, also known as Service\nFunction Chains (SFCs), a common cloud and network service approach today. To\nbalance the network load, VNF's can be placed in a smaller cluster of servers\nin the network thus minimizing the distance to the data center. The\noptimization of the placement of these clusters is a challenge as also other\nfactors need to be considered, such as the resource utilization. To address\nthis issue, we study the problem of VNF placement with replications, and\nespecially the potential of VNFs replications to help load balance the network.\nWe design and compare three optimization methods, including Linear Programing\n(LP) model, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Random Fit Placement Algorithm (RFPA)\nfor the allocation and replication of VNFs.

As prominences are believed\nto have a mean horizontal guide field, investigating any turbulence they host\ncould shed light on the nature of MHD turbulence in a wide range of\nastrophysical systems. In this paper we have investigated the nature of the\nturbulent prominence motions using structure function analysis on the velocity\nincrements estimated from H$\\alpha$ Dopplergrams constructed with observational\ndata from Hinode SOT. The pdf of the velocity increments shows that as we look\nat increasingly small spatial separations the distribution displays greater\ndeparture from a reference Gaussian distribution, hinting at intermittency in\nthe velocity field. Analysis of the even order structure functions for both the\nhorizontal and vertical separations showed the existence of two distinct\nregions displaying different exponents of the power law with the break in the\npower law at approximately 2000km. We hypothesise this to be a result of\ninternal turbulence excited in the prominence by the dynamic flows of the\nsystem found at this spatial scale.

A two\ncomponent condensate is then produced with a doublet pair potential mixing an\neven singlet and an odd triplet. When the triplet and the singlet strengths are\ncomparable, the pair potential can have rich nodes. The angular line nodes\n(ALNs) are associated with strong anisotropy and they are widely studied in the\nliterature. When the anisotropy is not strong, they can be replaced by other\ntypes of nodes in closed or open forms affecting the low temperature\nproperties.\n  Here, we focus on the weakly anisotropic case and the line nodes in the\nsuperconducting plane which become circular in the limit of full isotropy. We\nstudy the topology of these radial line nodes (RLNs) and show that it is\ncharacterized by the $Z_2$ classification similar to the Quantum-Spin-Hall\nInsulators. From the thermodynamical perspective, the RLNs cause, even in the\ntopological phases, an exponentially suppressed low temperature behaviour which\ncan be mistaken by nodeless s-wave pairing, thus, providing an explanation to a\nnumber of recent experiments with contraversial pairing symmetries. In the rare\ncase when the RLN is on the Fermi surface, the exponential suppression is\nreplaced by a linear temperature dependence. The RLNs are difficult to detect,\nand for this reason, they may have escaped experimental attention. We\ndemonstrate that Andreev conductance measurements with clean interfaces can\nefficiently probe the weakly anisotropic samples where the RLNs are expected to\nbe found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 11:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

The GRAVITY fringe tracker (FT) will be\nlimited to K~10.5 with UTs and K~7.5 with ATs, for fundamental conceptual\nreasons: the flux of each telescope is distributed among 3 cophasing pairs and\nthen among 5 spectral channels for coherencing. To overcome this limit we\npropose a new FT concept, called Hierarchical Fringe Tracker (HFT) that cophase\npairs of apertures with all the flux from two apertures and only one spectral\nchannel. When the pair is cophased, most of the flux is transmitted as if it\nwas produced by an unique single mode beam and then used to cophase pairs of\npairs and then pairs of groups. At the deeper level, the flux is used in an\noptimized dispersed fringe device for coherencing. On the VLTI such a system\nallows a gain of about 3 magnitudes over the GRAVITY FT. On interferometers\nwith more apertures such as CHARA (6 telescopes) or a future Planet Formation\nImager (12 to 20 telescopes), the HFT would be even more decisive, as its\nperformance does not decrease with the number of apertures. It would allow\nbuilding a PFI reaching a coherent magnitude H~10 with 16 apertures with\ndiameters smaller than 2 m. We present the HFT concept, the first steps of its\nfeasibility demonstration from computer simulations and the optical design of a\n4 telescopes HFT prototype.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 11:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-27"}

From a global analysis of the possible\ncombinations of pairwise fringe sensors, we show that conventional approaches\nused in current interferometers imply the use of prohibitively large telescopes\nand we indicate the innovative strategies that would allow building PFI with\naffordable apertures smaller than 2 m in diameter. The approach with the best\npotential appears to be Hierarchical Fringe Tracking based on \"two beams\nspatial filters\" that cophase pairs of neighboring telescopes with all the\nefficiency of a two telescopes fringe tracker and transmit most of the flux as\nif it was produced by an unique single mode aperture to cophase pairs of pairs\nand then pairs of groups of apertures. We consider also the adaptation to PFI\nof more conventional approaches such as a combination of GRAVITY like fringe\ntrackers or single or multiple chains of 2T fringe trackers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 12:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-27"}

The primary\nstar has recently undergone two major dimming events ($\\Delta$mag $\\approx$ 2\nin V-band), whose origin is still under debate. To shed light on the mechanism\nleading to the dimming events, we study the extinction properties, accretion\nvariability, and gas kinematics using absorption lines from the material\nobscuring star RW Aur A. We compare our moderate resolution X-Shooter spectra\nof the dim state of RW Aur A with other spectral observations. In particular,\nwe analyse archival high resolution UVES spectra obtained during the bright\nstate of the system, in order to track the evolution of the spectral properties\nacross the second dimming event. The spectrum obtained during the dim state\nshows narrow absorption lines in the Na and K optical doublets, where the\nformer is saturated. With a velocity of -60 km/s these lines indicate that\nduring the dim state the disk wind is either enhanced, or significantly\ndisplaced into the line of sight. The photometric evolution across the dimming\nevent shows a gray extinction, and is correlated with a significant reduction\nof the EW of all photospheric lines. Emission lines tracing accretion do not\nvary significantly across the dimming. We conclude that the dimming event is\nrelated to a major perturbation on the inner disk. We suggest that the inner\ndisk is occulting (most of) the star, and thus its photosphere, but is not\nocculting the accretion regions within a few stellar radii. Since observations\nof the outer disk indicate that the disk is modestly inclined (45 - 60 deg), we\npropose that the inner disk might be warped by a yet unseen (sub-)stellar\ncompanion, which may also explain the 2.77 day periodic variability of the\nspectral lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 12:40:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2016 10:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-30"}

Designing time/space-efficient\nsuffix array construction algorithms has attracted significant attention and\nconsiderable advances have been made for the past 20 years. We obtain the\n\\emph{first} in-place suffix array construction algorithms that are optimal\nboth in time and space for (read-only) integer alphabets. Concretely, we make\nthe following contributions:\n  1. For integer alphabets, we obtain the first suffix sorting algorithm which\ntakes linear time and uses only $O(1)$ workspace (the workspace is the total\nspace needed beyond the input string and the output suffix array). The input\nstring may be modified during the execution of the algorithm, but should be\nrestored upon termination of the algorithm.\n  2. We strengthen the first result by providing the first in-place linear time\nalgorithm for read-only integer alphabets with $|\\Sigma|=O(n)$ (i.e., the input\nstring cannot be modified). This algorithm settles the open problem posed by\nFranceschini and Muthukrishnan in ICALP 2007. The open problem asked to design\nin-place algorithms in $o(n\\log n)$ time and ultimately, in $O(n)$ time for\n(read-only) integer alphabets with $|\\Sigma| \\leq n$. Our result is in fact\nslightly stronger since we allow $|\\Sigma|=O(n)$.\n  3. Besides, for the read-only general alphabets (i.e., only comparisons are\nallowed), we present an optimal in-place $O(n\\log n)$ time suffix sorting\nalgorithm, recovering the result obtained by Franceschini and Muthukrishnan\nwhich was an open problem posed by Manzini and Ferragina in ESA 2002.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 12:45:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2017 17:36:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2017 10:17:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 15:34:13 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 28 May 2018 02:42:47 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 9 Nov 2018 17:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-12"}

For the the active device\nthe cost functional is the power ratio, whereas for the passive device it is\nthe drag coefficient. The optimization leads to total power savings of $\\approx\n70\\%$ for the optimal Coanda actuator, and a 40\\% drag reduction for the\noptimal flap. This reduction is mainly achieved through streamlining the base\nflow and suppressing the vortex shedding.

The\nbase is a real or complex number $\\beta$ such that $|\\beta|>1$, and the digit\nset $A$ is a finite set of digits including $0$. Thus a number can be seen as a\nfinite or infinite string of digits. An on-line algorithm processes the input\npiece-by-piece in a serial fashion. On-line arithmetic, introduced by Trivedi\nand Ercegovac, is a mode of computation where operands and results flow through\narithmetic units in a digit serial manner, starting with the most significant\ndigit.\n  In this paper, we first formulate a generalized version of the on-line\nalgorithms for multiplication and division of Trivedi and Ercegovac for the\ncases that $\\beta$ is any real or complex number, and digits are real or\ncomplex. We then define the so-called OL Property, and show that if $(\\beta,\nA)$ has the OL Property, then on-line multiplication and division are feasible\nby the Trivedi-Ercegovac algorithms. For a real base $\\beta$ and a digit set\n$A$ of contiguous integers, the system $(\\beta, A)$ has the OL Property if $\\#\nA > |\\beta|$. For a complex base $\\beta$ and symmetric digit set $A$ of\ncontiguous integers, the system $(\\beta, A)$ has the OL Property if $\\# A >\n\\beta\\overline{\\beta} + |\\beta + \\overline{\\beta}|$. Provided that addition and\nsubtraction are realizable in parallel in the system $(\\beta, A)$ and that\npreprocessing of the denominator is possible, our on-line algorithms for\nmultiplication and division have linear time complexity.

A\nmajor challenge to develop this new skyrmion-based technology is to achieve the\ncontrolled and deterministic creation of magnetic skyrmions without the need of\ncomplex setups. We demonstrate a solution to this challenge by showing how to\ncreate skyrmions and other magnetic textures in ferromagnetic thin films by\nmeans of a homogeneous DC current and without requiring Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteractions. This is possible by exploiting a static loss of stability arising\nfrom the interplay of current-induced spin-transfer torque and a spatially\ninhomogeneous magnetization, which can be achieved, e.g., by locally\nengineering the anisotropy, the magnetic field, or other magnetic interactions.\nThe magnetic textures are created controllably, efficiently, and periodically\nwith a period that can be tuned by the applied current strength. We propose\nspecific experimental setups realizable with simple materials, such as cobalt\nbased materials, to observe the periodic formation of skyrmions. We show that\nadding chiral interactions will not influence the basics of the generations but\nthen influence the consequent dynamics with respect to the stabilization of\ntopological textures.

The equation for the growth rate of this\ninstability in the incompressible limit, and the most-unstable mode that can be\nderived from it, are often used to estimate the strength of the magnetic field\nthat is associated with the observed dynamics. However, there are some issues\nwith the interpretations given. Here we show that the class of most unstable\nmodes $k_u$ for a given $\\theta$, the class of modes often used to estimate the\nstrength of the magnetic field from observations, for the system leads to the\ninstability growing as $\\sigma^2=1/2 A g k_u$, a growth rate which is\nindependent of the strength of the magnetic field and which highlights that\nsmall scales are preferred by the system, but not does not give the fastest\ngrowing mode for that given $k$. We also highlight that outside of the\ninterchange ($\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}=0$) and undular ($\\mathbf{k}$ parallel\nto $\\mathbf{B}$) modes, all the other modes have a perturbation pair of the\nsame wavenumber and growth rate that when excited in the linear regime can\nresult in an interference pattern that gives field aligned filamentary\nstructure often seen in 3D simulations. The analysis was extended to a sheared\nmagnetic field, where it was found that it was possible to extend the results\nfor a non-sheared field to this case.

Using a simple power-law model of magnetic reconnection, motivated by\nsimulations of collisionless reconnection, we determine the allowed range of\nthe large-scale average reconnection rate along the jet, by restricting the\ntotal radiative energy losses incurred and the distance at which the jet first\ncomes into equipartition. We calculate analytic expressions for the cumulative\nradiative energy losses due to synchrotron and inverse-Compton emission along\njets, and derive analytic formulae for the constraint on the initial\nmagnetisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 13:34:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

Some of these activities may\npresent a risk of killing millions or even destroying the planet. Current law\nleaves it to agencies to decide for themselves whether their activities fall\nwithin the bounds of acceptable risk. This Article explores to what extent and\nunder what circumstances the law ought to allow private actions against such\nnon-regulatory agency endeavors. Engaging with this issue is not only\ninteresting in its own right, it allows us to test fundamental concepts of\nagency competence and the role of the courts.\n  Two case studies provide a foundation for discussion: NASA's use of plutonium\npower supplies on spacecraft, which critics say could cause millions of cancers\nin the event of atmospheric disintegration, and a Department of Energy\nparticle-collider experiment (the RHIC, or Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider)\nthat allegedly poses a small risk of collapsing the Earth (via a \"killer\nstrangelet\"). These extreme examples serve as a test-bed for applying insights\nfrom neoclassical economics, behavioral economics, risk-management studies, and\ncognitive psychology. The resulting analysis suggests that in\nlow-probability/high-harm scenarios, agencies are likely to do a poor job of\njudging the acceptability of risk to the public. Instead, generalist judges\nworking in a common-law vein may have surprising advantages. This in turns\nsuggests that under certain circumstances the government should be subject to\nlegal action that provides non-deferential review of discretionary agency\nactions that are non-regulatory in nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 13:34:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-27"}

We show that calibrated\nmeasurements of radio detectors operated in coincidence with host experiments\nmeasuring air showers based on other techniques can be used for comparing the\nenergy scales of these host experiments. Using two approaches, first via direct\namplitude measurements, and second via comparison of measurements with air\nshower simulations, we compare the energy scales of the air-shower experiments\nTunka-133 and KASCADE-Grande, using their radio extensions, Tunka-Rex and\nLOPES, respectively. Due to the consistent amplitude calibration for Tunka-Rex\nand LOPES achieved by using the same reference source, this comparison reaches\nan accuracy of approximately $10\\,\\%$ - limited by some shortcomings of LOPES,\nwhich was a prototype experiment for the digital radio technique for air\nshowers.

Verbitsky has shown, via a reduction to the density\nHales-Jewett theorem, that the value of the repeated game must approach zero,\nas the number of repetitions increases. However, the rate of decay obtained in\nthis way is extremely slow, and it is an open question whether the true rate is\nexponential as is the case for all two-player games.\n  Exponential decay bounds are known for several special cases of multi-player\ngames, e.g., free games and anchored games. In this work, we identify a certain\nexpansion property of the base game and show all games with this property\nsatisfy an exponential decay parallel repetition bound. Free games and anchored\ngames satisfy this expansion property, and thus our parallel repetition theorem\nreproduces all earlier exponential-decay bounds for multiplayer games. More\ngenerally, our parallel repetition bound applies to all multiplayer games that\nare connected in a certain sense.\n  We also describe a very simple game, called the GHZ game, that does not\nsatisfy this connectivity property, and for which we do not know an exponential\ndecay bound.

According to\nthis assumption, research studies have mostly considered them in isolation. In\nthis work we focused on adult content consumption networks, which are present\nin many on-line social media and in the Web in general. We found that few small\nand densely connected communities are responsible for most of the content\nproduction.

Considering that network\ncommunication is the most expensive resource, efficiency is measured first of\nall in terms of the communication needed to implement read and write\noperations.

Conventional studies on stratified shear instabilities\nmake Boussinesq approximation. Free-surface arising due to large density\nvariations between air and water cannot be taken into consideration under this\napproximation. Hence the free-surface is usually replaced by a rigid-lid, and\ntherefore has little effect on the stability of the fluid below it. In this\npaper we have performed non-Boussinesq linear stability analyses of a double\ncirculation velocity profile prevalent in two-layered density stratified lakes.\nOne of our analyses is performed by considering the presence of wind, while the\nother one considers quiescent air. Both analyses have shown similar growth\nrates and stability boundaries. We have compared our non-Boussinesq study with\na corresponding Boussinesq one. The maximum non-Boussinesq growth rate is found\nto be an order of magnitude greater than the maximum Boussinesq growth rate.\nFurthermore, the stability curves in these two studies are very different. The\nnon-Boussinesq instability as well as the Boussinseq one can become three\ndimensional in some sub-ranges of the bulk Richardson number. An analytical\nstudy has also been conducted on a simple broken-line profile representing\ndouble circulation in order to complement the numerical stability analysis. The\nanalytical growth rates are in good agreement with the non-Boussinesq numerical\ngrowth rates observed in continuous profiles. The physical mechanism behind\nthis non-Boussinesq instability is the resonant interaction between a surface\nvorticity-gravity wave existing at the free-surface (air-water interface), and\nan interfacial vorticity-gravity wave existing at the pycnocline (warm and cold\nwater interface). We expect similar kind of non-Boussinesq instability to occur\nin the upper layer of oceans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 15:41:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-27"}

All the core EoSs satisfy the recent observational constraints of\nthe two massive pulsars whose masses are precisely measured.

Moreover, the uncertainties in the crust EoS\nand the matching interface bring insignificant changes, even at maximally\nrotating (Keplerian) configurations.

Now, a natural\nquestion arises that how these degrees of freedom are emerged from nothing? We\ntry to address this issue in a new theory which is more complete than M-theory\nand reduces to it with some limitations. In M-theory, there isn't any stable\nobject like stable M3-branes that our universe is formed on it and for this\nreason can't help us to explain cosmological events. In this research, we\npropose a new theory, named G -theory which could be the mother of M-theory and\nsuperstring theory. In G-theory, at the beginning, two types of G0-branes, one\nwith positive energy and one with negative energy are produced from nothing in\nfourteen dimensions. Then, these branes are compactified on three circles via\ntwo different ways (symmetrically and anti-symmetrically), and two bosonic and\nfermionic parts of action for M0-branes are produced. By joining M0-branes,\nsupersymmetric Mp-branes are created which contain the equal number of degrees\nof freedom for fermions and bosons. Our universe is constructed on one of\nMp-branes and other Mp-brane and extra energy play the role of bulk. By\ndissolving extra energy which is produced by compacting actions of Gp-branes,\ninto our universe, the number of degrees of freedom on it and also it's scale\nfactor increase and universe expands. We test G-theory with observations and\nfind that the the magnitude of the slow-roll parameters and the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio in this model are very smaller than one which are in\nagreement with predictions of experimental data.

We achieve 2$\\times$ better\nresolution than a conventional widefield microscope, while remaining\ninsensitive to aberration-induced pattern distortion and robust against\nparameter tuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 14:55:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 07:12:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-13"}

However, in case of wireless recording of the ECG signal\nit gets corrupted by the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). For the correct\ndiagnosis, removal of AWGN from ECG signals becomes necessary as it affects the\nall the diagnostic features. The natural signals exhibit correlation among\ntheir samples and this property has been exploited in various signal\nrestoration tasks. Motivated by that, in this work we propose a nonlocal\nwavelet transform domain ECG signal denoising method which exploits the\ncorrelations among both local and nonlocal samples of the signal. In the\nproposed method, the similar blocks of the samples are grouped in a matrix and\nthen denoising is achieved by the shrinkage of its two-dimensional discrete\nwavelet transform coefficients. The experiments performed on a number of ECG\nsignals show significant quantitative and qualitative improvement in denoising\nperformance over the existing ECG signal denoising methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 10:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-11"}
