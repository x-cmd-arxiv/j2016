This paper presents and compares\nvarious approaches for personalized vehicle energy consumption prediction,\nincluding a blackbox framework that identifies\ndriver/vehicle/environment-dependent factors and a collaborative filtering\napproach based on matrix factorization. Furthermore, a case study of\ndistance-to-empty prediction for electric vehicles by participatory sensing\ndata is conducted and evaluated empirically, which shows that our approaches\ncan significantly improve the prediction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2016 18:59:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 19:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

However, there exist serious discrepancies in brightness and\nimage structures between the near-infrared gray images and the visible color\nimages. The direct use of the near-infrared gray images brings about another\ncolor distortion problem in the dehazed images. Therefore, the color distortion\nshould also be considered for near-infrared dehazing. To reflect this point,\nthis paper presents an approach of adding a new color regularization to\nconventional dehazing framework. The proposed color regularization can model\nthe color prior for unknown haze-free images from two captured images. Thus,\nnatural-looking colors and fine details can be induced on the dehazed images.\nThe experimental results show that the proposed color regularization model can\nhelp remove the color distortion and the haze at the same time. Also, the\neffectiveness of the proposed color regularization is verified by comparing\nwith other conventional regularizations.

A dynamic beam attenuator (DBA) can help with count rate by\nmodulating x-ray beam intensity such that the low attenuating areas of the\npatient receive lower exposure, and detector behind these areas is not\noverexposed. However, DBA may harden the beam and cause artifacts and errors.\nThis work investigates positive and negative effects of using DBA in PCCT.\nMethods: A simple PCCT with single energy bin, spectroscopic PCCT with 2 and 5\nenergy bins, and conventional energy integrating CT with and without DBA were\nsimulated and investigated using 120kVp tube voltage and 14mGy air dose. The\nDBAs were modeled as made from soft tissue (ST) equivalent material, iron (Fe),\nand holmium (Ho) K-edge material. A cylindrical CT phantom and chest phantom\nwith iodine and CaCO3 contrast elements were used.

The artifacts and errors were decreased with 2bin\nspectroscopic PCCT and nearly eliminated with 5bin spectroscopic CT. The photon\nstarvation noise did present with Fe-DBA due to strong absorption of lower\nenergy photons. The 5bin PCCT with ST-DBA and Ho-DBA were nearly free of\nartifacts and photon starvation noise. The Ho-DBA better preserved low energy\nphotons and decreased beam hardening artifacts, and improved material\ndecomposition. Also, the Ho-DBA was also miniature having 1.4mm thickness and\n2cm length, much smaller than Fe-DBA.

Strong scattering resonances are found whenever\nthe incident energy approaches either a scattering threshold or a quasi-bound\nstate attached to one of the energetically closed higher dispersion branches.

Thus, a systematic review platform that\ncan automate the abstract screening process is of huge importance. Several\nmethods have been proposed for this task. However, it is very hard to clearly\nunderstand the applicability of these methods in a systematic review platform\nbecause of the following challenges: (1) the use of non-overlapping metrics for\nthe evaluation of the proposed methods, (2) usage of features that are very\nhard to collect, (3) using a small set of reviews for the evaluation, and (4)\nno solid statistical testing or equivalence grouping of the methods. In this\npaper, we use feature representation that can be extracted per citation. We\nevaluate SVM-based methods (commonly used) on a large set of reviews ($61$) and\nmetrics ($11$) to provide equivalence grouping of methods based on a solid\nstatistical test. Our analysis also includes a strong variability of the\nmetrics using $500$x$2$ cross validation.

A few included citations present outlying\ncharacteristics and can only be found after a very large number of screening\nsteps.

This scenario means that the empirical\nestimate of the state covariance is not full rank and possibly quite noisy. To\nsolve this problem in this high dimensional regime, we propose a\ncomputationally fast and easy to implement algorithm called the penalized\nensemble Kalman filter (PEnKF). Under certain conditions, it can be\ntheoretically proven that the PEnKF will be accurate (the estimation error will\nconverge to zero) despite having fewer ensemble members than state dimensions.\nFurther, as contrasted to localization methods, the proposed approach learns\nthe covariance structure associated with the dynamical system.

They are shown to\nimprove the estimators' robustness against outliers or impulsive noises. In\nthis paper we explore the numerical stability of linear filtering technique\nproposed recently under the MCC approach. The resulted estimator is called the\nmaximum correntropy criterion Kalman filter (MCC-KF). The purpose of this study\nis two-fold. First, the previously derived MCC-KF equations are revise and the\nrelated Kalman-like equality conditions are proved. Based on this theoretical\nfinding, we improve the MCC-KF technique in the sense that the new method\npossesses a better estimation quality with the reduced computational cost\ncompared with the previously proposed MCC-KF variant. Second, we devise some\nsquare-root implementations for the newly-designed improved estimator.

Factors known to affect the duration of these\nspells are the magnitude or intensity of the price decline, long-term interest\nrates and economic recessions, among others. The result of interest is the\nconditional probability of ending a spell of consecutive months over which\nstock market returns remain negative.

Even when using the same\nstimulation parameters in the same patient, wide variability in the duration of\ntransient response has been reported. These transients have long been\nconsidered important for the mapping of the excitability levels in the\nepileptic brain but their dynamic mechanism is still not well understood.\n  To understand the occurrence of abnormal transients dynamically, we use a\nthalamo-cortical neural population model of epileptic spike-wave activity and\nstudy the interaction between slow and fast subsystems.\n  In a reduced version of the thalamo-cortical model, slow wave oscillations\narise from a fold of cycles (FoC) bifurcation. This marks the onset of a region\nof bistability between a high amplitude oscillatory rhythm and the background\nstate. In vicinity of the bistability in parameter space, the model has\nexcitable dynamics, showing prolonged rhythmic transients in response to\nsuprathreshold pulse stimulation. We analyse the state space geometry of the\nbistable and excitable states, and find that the rhythmic transient arises when\nthe impending FoC bifurcation deforms the state space and creates an area of\nlocally reduced attraction to the fixed point. This area essentially allows\ntrajectories to dwell there before escaping to the stable steady state, thus\ncreating rhythmic transients. In the full thalamo-cortical model, we find a\nsimilar FoC bifurcation structure.\n  Based on the analysis, we propose an explanation of why stimulation induced\nepileptiform activity may vary between trials, and predict how the variability\ncould be related to ongoing oscillatory background activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2016 11:16:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 13:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-08"}

Remarkably, changing the parameters entails unusual\ncrossovers and transitions, e. g., we show that increasing the magnetic field\n(that produces the Hall effect) may convert a \"ferrometallic\" state at low\nfields to a \"squished baryon superfluid\" (with algebraic pairing correlations)\nat high fields. We also show that this system provides a unique opportunity to\nstudy quantum phase separation in a multiflavor ultracold fermionic system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2016 13:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

In some cases, whole body motions may be necessary to\nmaneuver around an obstacle, but most existing footstep planners can only\nselect from a discrete set of predetermined footstep actions; they are unable\nto utilize the continuum of whole body motion that is truly available to the\nrobot platform. Existing motion planners that can utilize whole body motion\ntend to struggle with the complexity of large-scale problems. We introduce a\nplanning method, called the \"Randomized Possibility Graph\", which uses\nhigh-level approximations of constraint manifolds to rapidly explore the\n\"possibility\" of actions, thereby allowing lower-level motion planners to be\nutilized more efficiently. We demonstrate simulations of the method working in\na variety of semi-unstructured environments. In this context,\n\"semi-unstructured\" means the walkable terrain is flat and even, but there are\narbitrary 3D obstacles throughout the environment which may need to be stepped\nover or maneuvered around using whole body motions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2016 23:53:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 18:36:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 21:47:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

Footstep planners are typically only\ndesigned for one mode of locomotion, but traversing unfavorable environments\nmay require several forms of locomotion to be sequenced together, such as\nwalking, crawling, and jumping. Multi-modal motion planners can be used to\naddress some of these problems, but existing implementations tend to be\ntime-consuming and are limited to quasi-static actions. This paper presents a\nmotion planning method to traverse complex environments using multiple\ncategories of continuous actions. To this end, this paper formulates and\nexploits the Possibility Graph---which uses high-level approximations of\nconstraint manifolds to rapidly explore the \"possibility\" of actions---to\nutilize lower-level single-action motion planners more effectively. We show\nthat the Possibility Graph can quickly find routes through several different\nchallenging environments which require various combinations of actions in order\nto traverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2016 00:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

We establish rigorous mathematical expressions for electric loads and\nbattery banks in the micro-grid by considering their characteristics and\nconstraints. Based on these mathematical models, we propose a novel real-time\nscheduling analysis method for priority-based energy management in micro-grid,\nnamed Significant Moments Analysis (SMA). SMA pinpoints all the crucial moments\nwhen electrical operations are requested among the micro-grid and establishes a\ndynamic model to describe the scheduling behavior of electric loads. Using SMA,\nwe can check the scheduling feasibility and predict whether the micro-grid can\ngenerate enough power to support the execution of electric loads. In the case\nwhere the power is insufficient to supply load demands, SMA can provide\naccurate information about the amount of insufficient power and the time when\nthe insufficiency happens. Simulated results are presented to show the\neffectiveness of the proposed analysis method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2016 05:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-06"}

A lot of these algorithms are\ninexact in the sense that they allow perturbations to appear during the\niterative process, and hence they enable one to better deal with noise and\ncomputational errors, as well as superiorization. For many years a certain\nfundamental question has remained open regarding many of these known inexact\nalgorithmic schemes in various finite and infinite dimensional settings, namely\nwhether there exist sequences satisfying these inexact schemes when errors\nappear. We provide a positive answer to this question. Our results also show\nthat various theorems discussing the convergence of these inexact schemes have\na genuine merit beyond the exact case.
