The first part of the thesis\nprovides a user-friendly introduction to ambitwistor strings, as well as a\ncondensed overview over the literature and some novel results.

For analyzing shapes of embeddings of\n$\\mathbb{S}^2$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, Jermyn et al. introduced square-root normal\nfields (SRNFs) that transformed an elastic metric, with desirable invariant\nproperties, into the $\\mathbb{L}^2$ metric.

A critical need\nin shape analysis is to invert solutions (deformations, averages, modes of\nvariations, etc) computed in the SRNF space, back to the original surface space\nfor visualizations and inferences. Due to the lack of theory for understanding\nSRNFs maps and their inverses, we take a numerical approach and derive an\nefficient multiresolution algorithm, based on solving an optimization problem\nin the surface space, that estimates surfaces corresponding to given SRNFs.\nThis solution is found effective, even for complex shapes, e.g. human bodies\nand animals, that undergo significant deformations including bending and\nstretching. Specifically, we use this inversion for computing elastic shape\ndeformations, transferring deformations, summarizing shapes, and for finding\nmodes of variability in a given collection, while simultaneously registering\nthe surfaces.

On one hand, the object track, which is a set of bounding boxes\nwith one bounding box in every frame, would provide strong high-level guidance\nfor the target/background segmentation task. On the other hand, the object\nsegmentation would separate object from other objects and background, which\nwill be useful for determining track locations in every frame.

We review our finding of a transition in the\nanalytical form of the DTE at the point that the sample length equals\n$|z_b-z_b'|$. The highest transmission eigenvalue for stronger asymmetry in\nboundary reflection is strictly smaller than unity. The average transmission\nand profiles of energy density inside the sample can still be described in\nterms of the sample length, $L$, and the boundary extrapolation lengths on both\nsides of the sample, $z_b, z_b'$. For localized waves, we find the energy\ndensity profile within the sample is a segment of the distribution that would\nbe found in a longer sample with length $L+z_b+z_b'$. These results suggest new\nways of controlling wave interference in both diffusive and localized systems\nby varying boundary reflectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 17:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

The Budapest Reference Connectome\nServer depicts the cerebral connections of $n=418$ subjects with a\nfrequency-parameter $k$: For any $k=1,2,...,n$ one can view the graph of the\nedges that are present in at least $k$ connectomes.

As a result, there are\nstill some important unanswered questions about the detailed particle\nacceleration and emission processes occurring during the flares.

Brain motion\nin these recordings pose a unique challenge. The location of individual neurons\nmust be tracked in 3D over time to accurately extract single neuron activity\ntraces. Recordings from small invertebrates like C. elegans are especially\nchallenging because they undergo very large brain motion and deformation during\nanimal movement. Here we present an automated computer vision pipeline to\nreliably track populations of neurons with single neuron resolution in the\nbrain of a freely moving C. elegans undergoing large motion and deformation. 3D\nvolumetric fluorescent images of the animal's brain are straightened, aligned\nand registered, and the locations of neurons in the images are found via\nsegmentation. Each neuron is then assigned an identity using a new\ntime-independent machine-learning approach we call Neuron Registration Vector\nEncoding. In this approach, non-rigid point-set registration is used to match\neach segmented neuron in each volume with a set of reference volumes taken from\nthroughout the recording. The way each neuron matches with the references\ndefines a feature vector which is clustered to assign an identity to each\nneuron in each volume. Finally, thin-plate spline interpolation is used to\ncorrect errors in segmentation and check consistency of assigned identities.\nThe Neuron Registration Vector Encoding approach proposed here is uniquely well\nsuited for tracking neurons in brains undergoing large deformations.

In this paper, we study the following\ntwo-sample testing problem: given two samples generated by two high-dimensional\nlinear models, we aim to test whether the regression coefficients of the two\nlinear models are identical. We propose a framework named TIERS (short for\nTestIng Equality of Regression Slopes), which solves the two-sample testing\nproblem without making any assumptions on the sparsity of the regression\nparameters. TIERS builds a new model by convolving the two samples in such a\nway that the original hypothesis translates into a new moment condition. A\nself-normalization construction is then developed to form a moment test. We\nprovide rigorous theory for the developed framework. Under very weak conditions\nof the feature covariance, we show that the accuracy of the proposed test in\ncontrolling Type I errors is robust both to the lack of sparsity in the\nfeatures and to the heavy tails in the error distribution, even when the sample\nsize is much smaller than the feature dimension.

Two dominant damage mechanisms, i.e.\nmatrix elasto-plastic response and fibre-matrix decohesion are considered and\nmodelled using a non-associative pressure dependent paraboloidal yield\ncriterion and cohesive interface elements respectively. A linear-elastic\ntransversely isotropic material model is used to model yarns/fibres within the\nrepresentative volume element (RVE). A unified approach is used to impose the\nRVE boundary conditions, which allows convenient switching between linear\ndisplacement, uniform traction and periodic boundary conditions. The\ncomputational model is implemented within the framework of the hierarchic\nfinite element, which permits the use of arbitrary orders of approximation.\nFurthermore, the computational framework is designed to take advantage of\ndistributed memory high-performance computing. The accuracy and performance of\nthe computational framework are demonstrated with a variety of numerical\nexamples, including unidirectional FRP composite, a composite comprising a\nmulti-fibre and multi-layer RVE, with randomly generated fibres, and a single\nlayered plain weave textile composite. Results are validated against the\nreference experimental/numerical results from the literature. The computational\nframework is also used to study the effect of matrix and fibre-matrix\ninterfaces properties on the homogenised stress-strain responses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 19:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-18"}

In chapter 5, I study\naffected of the saturated chain conductance by adding oxygen to the chain.\nComparisons between my electronic structure calculations on oligoether chains\nand previous work on alkanes show that the conductance of oligoether is lower\nthan that of alkane chains with the same length. I found that the beta\ntunneling factor per methyl unit of the alkanes is lower than the beta factor\nof oligoether. In the final chapter, molecular dynamic simulations are used to\nexamine the molecular assembly of two candidate molecules for graphene-based\nmolecular electronics, one with one pyrene anchor, Pyrene PEGn exTTF, PPT, and\nthe other with three pyrene anchors, tri pyrene derivative, TPPT, on a\ndisordered graphene surface. PPT is seen to form flat structures whilst TPPT is\nseen to form semicircular cone like micelle structures on the graphene surface.\nIn the presence of water, the PPT tends to aggregate whereas the TPPT micelle\nexpands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 21:39:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-18"}

Nevertheless, it did not prove that computing the permanent was\n#P-hard for any class of matrices which was not previously known. In this\npaper, we present a collection of new results about matrix permanents that are\nderived primarily via these linear optical techniques.\n  First, we show that the problem of computing the permanent of a real\northogonal matrix is #P-hard. Much like Aaronson's original proof, this will\nshow that even a multiplicative approximation remains #P-hard to compute. The\nhardness result even translates to permanents over finite fields, where the\nproblem of computing the permanent of an orthogonal matrix is ModpP-hard in the\nfinite field F_{p^4} for all primes p not equal to 2 or 3. Interestingly, this\ncharacterization is tight: in fields of characteristic 2, the permanent\ncoincides with the determinant; in fields of characteristic 3, one can\nefficiently compute the permanent of an orthogonal matrix by a nontrivial\nresult of Kogan.\n  Finally, we use more elementary arguments to prove #P-hardness for the\npermanent of a positive semidefinite matrix, which shows that certain\nprobabilities of boson sampling experiments with thermal states are hard to\ncompute exactly despite the fact that they can be efficiently sampled by a\nclassical computer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2016 00:03:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2018 04:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-01"}

TCP-based\nalgorithms that probe for bandwidth take a long time to reach the fair-share\nand lead to long flow completion times. An ideal congestion control algorithms\nfor datacenter must provide 1) zero data loss, 2) fast convergence, and 3) low\nbuffer occupancy. However, these requirements present conflicting goals. For\nfast convergence,flows must ramp up quickly, but this risks packet losses and\nlarge queues. Thus, even the state-of-the-art algorithms, such as TIMELY and\nDCQCN, rely on link layer flow control (e.g.,Priority-based Flow Control) to\nachieve zero loss. This paper presents a new approach, called ExpressPass, an\nend-to-end credit-based congestion control algorithm for datacenters.\nExpressPass is inspired by credit-based flow control, but extends it to work\nend-to-end.

Expansion results from spectral graph theory however impose a\ntrade-off between the spectral gap and the fraction of initial vertices as well\nas the fraction of final vertices which corresponds to the probability for\nobtaining the correct computational output. Graphs with spectral gap\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{L^k}\\right)$, $k<2$, turn out to contradict very\nlikely, graphs with $k<1$ even for sure at least one of the efficiency\ncriterias for running time, output probability or Hamiltonian implementation.\n  The above results may also be obstacles for a possible quantum PCP-theorem in\ncomplexity theory claiming the local Hamiltonian problem with constant gap to\nbe QMA-complete since the very same Kitaev Hamiltonian is constructed in the\nQMA-hardness proof for the Local Hamiltonian problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2016 10:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-18"}

Recent observations of radioactive $^{44}$Ti with high-energy\nsatellite telescopes (Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array [NuSTAR], INTEGRAL)\nhave measured gamma-ray line details, which provide direct evidence of\nlarge-scale explosion asymmetries in SN 1987A and in Cassiopeia A (Cas A) even\nby mapping of the spatial brightness distribution (NuSTAR).

Both exhibit\nintriguing resemblance to the observed morphology of the Cas A remnant,\nalthough neither the progenitor nor the explosion was fine-tuned for a perfect\nmatch. Our results demonstrate that the asymmetries observed in this remnant\ncan, in principle, be accounted for by a neutrino-driven explosion, and that\nthe high $^{44}$Ti abundance in Cas A may be explained without invoking rapid\nrotation or a jet-driven explosion, because neutrino-driven explosions\ngenerically eject large amounts of high-entropy matter. The recoil acceleration\nof the NS is connected to mass ejection asymmetries and is opposite to the\ndirection of the stronger explosion, fully compatible with the gravitational\ntugboat mechanism. Our results also imply that Cas A and SN 1987A could possess\nsimilarly \"one-sided\" Ti and Fe asymmetries, with the difference that Cas A is\nviewed from a direction with large inclination angle to the NS motion, whereas\nthe NS in SN 1987A should have a dominant velocity component pointing toward\nus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 May 2017 11:07:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 01:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

These\nachievements were driven by use of the causal ontological approach (proposed\noriginally by Aristotle) to formulate models of physical reality. At the\nbeginning of the 20th century, however, the physics community began to prefer\nmodels based on a fundamentally different approach to human knowledge.\nCopenhagen quantum mechanics (CQM) was used to describe the micro-world. The\nspecial theory of relativity was used to describe the kinematics of objects\nmoving at high velocity values in both the macroscopic and microscopic regions.\nThis phenomenological approach to knowledge has been more focused on how things\nappear - instead of their actual properties and causal sequence. In the middle\nof the 20th century, the causal ontological approach was used to develop a\nsignificant scientific advance: the systematization of fundamental strongly\ninteracting particles on the basis of unified algebra in three-dimensional\nisotopic spin space for spin values 1, 1/2, and 0. However, it was later\nstrongly deformed under the influence of the phenomenological approach and the\nquark model. This paper will show that practically all contemporary theoretical\nmodels of physical reality contain mistakes or unresolved problems. Further\nscientific progress can be obtained if (and only if) scientists return to the\nsuccessful causal ontological approach and falsification. Classical physics may\nbe slightly generalized to enable the description of inertia mass increase in\ndependence on velocity, replacing the relativity theory and CQM.
