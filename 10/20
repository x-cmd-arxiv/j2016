Chiral perturbation\ntheory provides a very powerful tool for studying this phase. However, the\nformalism that is usually employed in this context does not clarify various\naspects of the condensation mechanism and makes the identification of the soft\nmodes problematic. We re-examine the pion condensed phase using different\napproaches within the chiral perturbation theory framework. As a first step, we\nperform a low-density expansion of the chiral Lagrangian valid close to the\nonset of the Bose-Einstein condensation. We obtain an effective theory that can\nbe mapped to a Gross-Pitaevskii Lagrangian in which, remarkably, all the\ncoefficients depend on the isospin chemical potential. The low-density\nexpansion becomes unreliable deep in the pion condensed phase. For this reason,\nwe develop an alternative field expansion deriving a low-energy Lagrangian\nanalog to that of quantum magnets. By integrating out the \"radial\" fluctuations\nwe obtain a soft Lagrangian in terms of the Nambu-Goldstone bosons arising from\nthe breaking of the pion number symmetry. Finally, we test the robustness of\nthe second-order transition between the normal and the pion condensed phase\nwhen next-to-leading-order chiral corrections are included.

The starting point lies in\nproblems that are in principle ill-posed with respect to the initial/final\ndata\\textendash these basically include the Cauchy problem for nonlinear\nelliptic equations and the backward-in-time nonlinear parabolic equations. We\nderive general filters that can be used to stabilize those problems.\nEssentially, we establish the corresponding well-posed problem whose solution\nconverges to the solution of the ill-posed problem. The approximation can be\nconfirmed by the error estimates in the Hilbert space. This work improves very\nmuch many papers in the same line of field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 16:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-20"}

Progressive, widespread paralysis often follows\nover a few years. Does the disease begin with local changes in a small piece of\nneural tissue and then spread? Or does neural decay happen independently across\ndiverse spatial locations? The distinction matters, because local initiation\nmay arise by local changes in a tissue microenvironment, by somatic mutation,\nor by various epigenetic or regulatory fluctuations in a few cells. A local\ntrigger must be coupled with a mechanism for spread. By contrast, independent\ndecay across spatial locations cannot begin by a local change, but must depend\non some global predisposition or spatially distributed change that leads to\napproximately synchronous decay. This article outlines the conceptual frame by\nwhich one contrasts local triggers and spread versus parallel spatially\ndistributed decay.

In particular, besides\nobtaining evidence of a persisting long-time tail, we assign specific and\nunambiguous physical meanings to groups of exponential modes related to the\nlongitudinal and transverse collective dynamics, respectively. We have made\nthis possible by consistently introducing the interpretation of the VAF\nfrequency spectrum as a global density of states in fluids, generalizing a\nsolid-state concept, and by giving to specific spectral components, obtained\nvia the VAF exponential expansion, the corresponding meaning of partial\ndensities of states relative to specific dynamical processes. The clear\nidentification of a high-frequency oscillation of the VAF with the near-top\nexcitation frequency in the dispersion curve of acoustic waves is a neat\nexample of the power of the method. As for the transverse mode contribution,\nits analysis turns out to be particularly important, because the\nmultiexponential expansion reveals a transition marking the onset of\npropagating excitations when the density is increased above a threshold value.\nWhile this finding agrees with recent literature debating the issue of\ndynamical crossover boundaries, such as the one identified with the Frenkel\nline, we can add detailed information on the modes involved in this specific\nprocess in the domains of both time and frequency. This will help obtain a\nstill missing full account of transverse dynamics, in its nonpropagating and\npropagating aspects which are linked by dynamical transitions depending on both\nthe thermodynamic states and the excitation wavevectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 18:40:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

When just one probability is required, a second\nalgorithm is described, an adaptation of De Pril's method, in which the\ncomputation time does not depend on the ordinality, so that even high-order\nprobabilities can be rapidly found. Any survival distribution can be used to\nmodel the inter-arrival times, which gives a rich class of models with great\nflexibility for modelling both underdispersed and overdispersed data. This work\ncould pave the way for the routine use of these distributions as an additional\ntool for modelling event count data. An empirical example using fertility data\nillustrates the use of the method and was fully implemented using an R package\nCountr developed by the authors and available from the Comprehensive R Archive\nNetwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 19:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-20"}

We introduce a notion of local approximate\ncorrectability and code distance, and give a number of equivalent formulations\nthereof, generalizing various exact error-correction criteria. Our tradeoff\nbounds relate the number of physical qubits $n$, the number of encoded qubits\n$k$, the code distance $d$, the accuracy parameter $\\delta$ that quantifies how\nwell the erasure channel can be reversed, and the locality parameter $\\ell$\nthat specifies the length scale at which the recovery operation can be done. In\na regime where the recovery is successful to accuracy $\\epsilon$ that is\nexponentially small in $\\ell$, which is the case for perturbations of local\ncommuting projector codes, our bound reads $kd^{\\frac{2}{D-1}} \\le O\\bigl(n\n(\\log n)^{\\frac{2D}{D-1}} \\bigr)$ for codes on $D$-dimensional lattices of\nEuclidean metric.

However, the clustering statistics of tracers are\nbiased and depend on various properties, such as their host-halo mass and\nassembly history. On very large scales this tracer bias results in a constant\noffset in the clustering amplitude, known as linear bias. Towards smaller\nnonlinear scales, this is no longer the case and tracer bias becomes a\ncomplicated function of scale and time. We focus on tracer bias centred on\ncosmic voids, depressions of the density field that spatially dominate the\nuniverse. We consider three types of tracers: galaxies, galaxy clusters and\nAGN, extracted from the hydrodynamical simulation Magneticum Pathfinder. In\ncontrast to common clustering statistics that focus on auto-correlations of\ntracers, we find that void-tracer cross-correlations are successfully described\nby a linear-bias relation. The tracer-density profile of voids can thus be\nrelated to their matter-density profile by a single number. We show that it\ncoincides with the linear tracer bias extracted from the large-scale\nauto-correlation function and expectations from theory, if sufficiently large\nvoids are considered. For smaller voids we observe a shift towards higher\nvalues. This has important consequences on cosmological parameter inference, as\nthe problem of unknown tracer bias is alleviated up to a constant number.

We\ndemonstrate that the hadronic channel of the mono-top signature can effectively\ndiscriminate the signal from backgrounds by tagging a hadronic top-jet. We show\nthat the hadronic channel of mono-top signature offers a significant\nimprovement over the leptonic channel and the sensitivity reaches $m_{\\tilde\nt_1} \\simeq 420$ GeV at the 13 TeV LHC with 3 ab$^{-1}$ luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

The two spectra are found to\nprogressively harden at rigidity $R = pc/Z >\\,$200 GV, while the p/He ratio is\nfound to fall off steadily as $p/He\\sim\\,R^{-0.08}$. The p/He decrease is often\ninterpreted in terms of particle-dependent acceleration, which is in contrast\nwith the universal nature of DSA mechanisms. A different explanation is that\nthe p-He anomaly reflects a flux transition between two components: a sub-TeV\nflux component (L) provided by hydrogen-rich supernova remnants with soft\nacceleration spectra, and a multi-TeV component (G) injected by younger sources\nwith amplified magnetic fields and hard spectra. In this scenario the\nuniversality of particle acceleration is not violated because both sources\nprovide composition-blind injection spectra. The present work is aimed at\ntesting this model using the low-energy CR flux which is expected to be\nL-dominated. However, at $E\\sim\\,$0.5-10 GeV, the fluxes are affected by energy\nlosses and solar modulation for which a proper modeling is required.

While the Toomre parameter of the disc remains close to its critical\nvalue for the onset of gravitational instability, the dimensionless stress\nparameter is uniquely determined from the thermal energy reservoir of the disc\nand its cooling rate. Our solutions are applicable to the accretion discs with\ndynamically important radiation pressure like in the quasars discs. We show\nthat physical quantities of a gravitoturbulent disc in the presence of\nradiation are significantly modified compared to solutions with only gas\npressure. We show that the dimensionless stress parameter is an increasing\nfunction of the radial distance so that its steepness strongly depends on the\naccretion rate. In a disc without radiation its slope is 4.5, however, we show\nthat in the presence of radiation, it varies between 2 and 4.5 depending on the\naccretion rate and the central mass. As for the surface density, we find a\nshallower profile with an exponent -2 in a disc with sub-Eddington accretion\nrate compared to a similar disc, but without radiation, where its surface\ndensity slope is -3 independent of the accretion rate. We then investigate\ngravitational stability of the disc when the stress parameter reaches to its\ncritical value. In order to self-consistently determine the fragmentation\nboundary, however, it is shown that the critical value of the stress parameter\nis a power-law function of the ratio of gas pressure and the total pressure and\nits exponent is around 1.7.

Here, we present two-stream multi-layer clear-sky\ncalculations of the UV surface radiance on Earth at 3.9 Ga to constrain the UV\nsurface fluence as a function of albedo, solar zenith angle (SZA), and\natmospheric composition. Variation in albedo and latitude (through SZA) can\naffect maximum photoreaction rates by a factor of >10.4; for the same\natmosphere, photoreactions can proceed an order of magnitude faster at the\nequator of a snowball Earth than at the poles of a warmer world. Surface\nconditions are important considerations when computing prebiotic UV fluences.\nFor climatically reasonable levels of CO2, fluence shortward of 189 nm is\nscreened out, meaning that prebiotic chemistry is robustly shielded from\nvariations in UV fluence due to solar flares or variability. Strong shielding\nfrom CO2 also means that the UV surface fluence is insensitive to plausible\nlevels of CH4, O2, and O3. At scattering wavelengths, UV fluence drops off\ncomparatively slowly with increasing CO2 levels. However, if SO2 and/or H2S can\nbuild up to the 1-100 ppm level as hypothesized by some workers, then they can\ndramatically suppress surface fluence and hence prebiotic photoprocesses.

We discuss tetrahedral order comparing with other\ntypes of orientational order, like nematic, polar nematic, polar smectic, and\nactive polar order. In particular, we present hydrodynamic equations for\nphases, where only tetrahedral order exists or tetrahedral order is combined\nwith nematic order. Among the latter we discriminate between three cases, where\nthe nematic director (a) orients along a 4-fold, or (b) along a 3-fold symmetry\naxis of the tetrahedral structure. For the optically isotropic T_d phase, which\nonly has tetrahedral order, we focus on the coupling of flow with e.g.\ntemperature gradients and on the specific orientation behavior in external\nelectric fields. For the transition to the nematic phase, electric fields lead\nto a temperature shift that is linear in the field strength. Electric fields\ninduce nematic order, again linear in the field strength. If strong enough,\nelectric fields can change the tetrahedral structure and symmetry leading to a\npolar phase. We briefly deal with the T phase that arises when tetrahedral\norder occurs in a system of chiral molecules. To case (a) belong (i) the\nnon-polar, achiral, optically uniaxial D2d phase with ambidextrous helicity and\nwith orientational frustration in external fields, (ii) the non-polar\ntetragonal S4 phase, (iii) the non-polar, orthorhombic D2 phase that is\nstructurally chiral featuring ambidextrous chirality, (iv) the polar\northorhombic C2v phase, and (v) the polar monoclinic C2 phase. Case (b) results\nin a trigonal C3v phase that behaves like a biaxial polar nematic phase.\nFinally we discuss some experiments that show typical effects related to the\nexistence of tetrahedral order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 21:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-21"}

We combined ultrafast pump-probe\nRaman scattering and photoemission to directly follow electron-hole excitations\nas well as the G-phonon in graphite after an excitation by an intense laser\npulse. This phonon is known to couple relatively strongly to electrons.\nCross-correlating effective electronic and phonon temperatures places new\nconstraints on model-based fits. The accepted two-temperature model predicts\nthat G-phonon population should start to increase as soon as excited\nelectron-hole pairs are created and that the rate of increase should not depend\nstrongly on the pump fluence. Instead we found that the increase of the\nG-phonon population occurs with a delay of $\\sim$65 fs. This time-delay is also\nevidenced by the absence of the so-called self-pumping for G phonons. It\ndecreases with increased pump fluence. We show that these observations imply a\nnew relaxation pathway: Instead of hot carriers transferring energy to\nG-phonons directly, the energy is first transferred to optical phonons near the\nzone boundary K-points, which then decay into G-phonons via phonon-phonon\nscattering.

Currently social networks\nsuspend the accounts of such extremists in response to user complaints. The\nchallenge is that these extremist users simply create new accounts and continue\ntheir activities. In this work we present a new set of operational capabilities\nto deal with the threat posed by online extremists in social networks.\n  Using data from several hundred thousand extremist accounts on Twitter, we\ndevelop a behavioral model for these users, in particular what their accounts\nlook like and who they connect with. This model is used to identify new\nextremist accounts by predicting if they will be suspended for extremist\nactivity. We also use this model to track existing extremist users as they\ncreate new accounts by identifying if two accounts belong to the same user.\nFinally, we present a model for searching the social network to efficiently\nfind suspended users' new accounts based on a variant of the classic Polya's\nurn setup.

This represents\na significant extension for distances accessible by CW EPR, as nitroxide-based\nspin labels at X-band frequencies can typically only access distances up to\n$\\sim$ 2 nm. We show that this broadening persists at biologically relevant\ntemperatures above 200 K, and that this method is further extendable up to room\ntemperature by immobilizing the sample in glassy trehalose. We show that the\npeak-to-peak broadening of the central transition follows the expected $~1/r^3$\ndependence for the electron-electron dipolar interaction, from cryogenic\ntemperatures up to room temperature. A simple procedure for simulating the\ndependence of the lineshape on interspin distance is presented, in which the\nbroadening of the central transition is modeled as an $S=1/2$ spin whose CW EPR\nlineshape is broadened through electron-electron dipolar interactions with a\nneighboring $S=7/2$ spin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 00:33:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

To overcome the difficulties arising from the inherent\nstrong nonlinearity contained in the constraints, we derive an equivalent\ndefinition of the admissible states.

More precisely, consider a \"Julia\ncontinuum\" C of such a function, i.e. the closure in the Riemann sphere of a\ncomponent of the Julia set.

Conversely, we construct a single disjoint-type entire function\nwith the remarkable property that each arc-like continuum with at least one\nterminal point is realised as a Julia continuum. The class of arc-like continua\nwith terminal points is uncountable.

Time-varying droplet shapes and\ntemperature of the liquid-gas interface are measured using high-speed\nvisualization and infrared thermography, respectively. The motion of the\nparticles inside the evaporating droplet is qualitatively visualized by an\noptical microscope and profile of final particle deposit is measured by an\noptical profilometer. On a non-heated hydrophilic substrate, a ring-like\ndeposit forms after the evaporation, as reported extensively in the literature;\nwhile on a heated hydrophilic substrate, a thinner ring with an inner deposit\nis reported in the present work. The latter is attributed to Marangoni\nconvection and recorded motion of the particles as well as measured temperature\ngradient across the liquid-gas interface confirms this hypothesis. The thinning\nof the ring scales with the substrate temperature and is reasoned to stronger\nMarangoni convection at larger substrate temperature. In case of a non-heated\nhydrophobic substrate, an inner deposit forms due to very early depinning of\nthe contact line. On the other hand, in case of a heated hydrophobic substrate,\nthe substrate heating as well as larger particle concentration helps in the\npinning of the contact line, which results in a thin ring with an inner\ndeposit. We propose a regime map for predicting three types of deposits namely,\nring, thin ring with inner deposit and inner deposit - for varying substrate\ntemperature, substrate wettability and particles concentration. A first-order\nmodel corroborates the liquid-gas interface temperature measurements and\nvariation in the measured ring profile with the substrate temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 03:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-21"}

In the monomer pathway, combinatorial TFs\nsearch for their targets in an independent manner and the protein-protein\ninteractions among them will be insignificant. The protein-protein interactions\nare very strong so that the hetero-oligomer complex of TFs as a whole searches\nfor the cognate sites in case of hetero-oligomer pathway. The TF which arrived\nfirst will recruit the adjacent TFs in a sequential manner in the recruitment\npathway. The free energy released from the protein-protein interactions among\nTFs will be in turn utilized to stabilize the TFs-DNA complex. Such coordinated\nbinding of TFs in fact emerges as the cooperative effect. Monomer and\nhetero-oligomer pathways are efficient only when few TFs are involved in the\ncombinatorial regulation. Detailed random walk simulations suggest that when\nthe number of TFs in a combination increases then the searching efficiency of\nTFs in these pathways decreases with the increasing number of TFs in a power\nlaw manner. The power law exponent associated with the monomer pathway seems to\nbe strongly dependent on the number of TFs, distance between the initial\nposition of TFs from their specific binding sites and the hop size associated\nwith the dynamics of TFs on DNA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 07:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-21"}

However, an unsolved\nchallenge in the field is the realization of all electrical methods to control\nthe spin polarization and spin transistor operation at ambient temperature. For\nthis purpose, two-dimensional (2D) crystals offer a unique platform due to\ntheir remarkable and contrasting spintronic properties, such as weak spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC) in graphene and strong SOC in molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$).\nHere we combine graphene and MoS$_2$ in a van der Waals heterostructure to\nrealize the electric control of the spin polarization and spin lifetime, and\ndemonstrated a spin field-effect transistor (spin-FET) at room temperature in a\nnon-local measurement geometry.

Some protocols replace\nthe trusted authority by a set of authorities, and privacy is guaranteed if\nless than a threshold number of authorities are corrupt. For verifiability,\nstronger security guarantees are demanded. Typically, corrupt authorities that\ntry to fake the result of the tally must always be detected.\n  To provide verifiability, many e-voting protocols use Non-Interactive\nZero-Knowledge proofs (NIZKs). Thanks to their non-interactive nature, NIZKs\nallow anybody, including third parties that do not participate in the protocol,\nto verify the correctness of the tally. Therefore, NIZKs can be used to obtain\nuniversal verifiability. Additionally, NIZKs also improve usability because\nthey allow voters to cast a vote using a non-interactive protocol.\n  The disadvantage of NIZKs is that their security is based on setup\nassumptions such as the common reference string (CRS) or the random oracle (RO)\nmodel. The former requires a trusted party for the generation of a common\nreference string. The latter, though a popular methodology for designing secure\nprotocols, has been shown to be unsound.\n  In this paper, we address the design of an e-voting protocol that provides\nverifiability without any trust assumptions, where verifiability here is meant\nwithout eligibility verification. We show that Non-Interactive\nWitness-Indistinguishable proofs (NIWI) can be used for this purpose. The\ne-voting scheme is private under the Decision Linear assumption, while\nverifiability holds unconditionally. To our knowledge, this is the first\nprivate e-voting scheme with perfect universal verifiability, i.e. one in which\nthe probability of a fake tally not being detected is 0, and with {\\em\nnon-interactive} protocols that does not rely on trust assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 09:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-21"}

Our schemes are\nbased on hidden matching quantum retrieval games and they tolerate noise up to\n23%, which we conjecture reaches 25% asymptotically as the dimension of the\nunderlying hidden matching states is increased. Furthermore, we prove that 25%\nis the maximum tolerable noise for a wide class of quantum money schemes with\nclassical verification, meaning our schemes are almost optimally noise\ntolerant. We use methods in semi-definite programming to prove security in a\nsubstantially different manner to previous proposals, leading to two main\nadvantages: first, coin verification involves only a constant number of states\n(with respect to coin size), thereby allowing for smaller coins; second, the\nre-usability of coins within our scheme grows linearly with the size of the\ncoin, which is known to be optimal. Lastly, we suggest methods by which the\ncoins in our protocol could be implemented using weak coherent states and\nverified using existing experimental techniques, even in the presence of\ndetector inefficiencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 10:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

Then, we turn to study different phase transitions\n(PTs) for our BHs. We start with study of Hawking-Page PT for both linearly and\nBI charged BHs. After that, we discuss the PTs inside the BHs. We present the\nimproved Davies quantities and prove that the PT points shown by them coincide\nwith Ruppeiner ones. We show that the zero temperature PTs are transitions on\nradiance properties of BHs by using Landau-Lifshitz theory. Next, we turn to\nstudy Ruppeiner geometry of linearly and BI charged BHs. For linearly charged\ncase, we show that there are no PT at finite temperature for the case $z\\geq\n2$. For $z<2$, it is found that the number of finite temperature PT points\ndepends on the value of BH charge and is not more than two. When we have two\nfinite temperature PT points, there are no thermally stable BH between these\ntwo points and we have discontinues small/large BH PTs. As expected, for small\nBHs, we observe finite magnitude for Ruppeiner invariant which shows the finite\ncorrelation between possible BH molecules while for large BHs, the correlation\nis very small. Finally, we study the Ruppeiner geometry and thermal stability\nof BI charged Lifshtiz BHs for different values of $z$. We observe that small\nBHs are thermally unstable in some situations. Also, the behavior of\ncorrelation between possible BH molecules for large BHs is the same as linearly\ncharged case. In both linearly and BI charged cases, for some choices of\nparameters, the BH systems behave like a Van der Waals gas near transition\npoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 10:55:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2016 16:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}

While the framework\ndoes not lose the generality, our discussion will be restricted to two\nrepresentative types of inter-chain coupling systems: $J_{3}$- or\n$J_{4}$-system respectively. In spite of the long-range spiral order, the\ndynamical properties of these systems turn out to be highly nontrivial due to\nthe incommensurate noncollinear spin configuration and the strong quantum\nfluctuation effects enhanced by the frustration and low-dimensionality. Both\nthe systems show prominent spin Casimir effects induced by the vacuum\nfluctuation of the spin waves and related modification of the ordering vector,\nLifshitz point's position and sublattice magnetization. Significant and\nspontaneous magnon decay effects are manifested in the quantum corrections to\nthe excitation spectrum. By adjusting the strength of magnetic anisotropy and\nvarying the approximation scheme, it is revealed that these striking distinct\nfeatures are quite robust and have deep connection with both the spin Casimir\nand the magnon decay effects.

Unlike carbon\nnanotube (CNT) membranes, in which the nanotube pores have fixed sizes, the\npores of GO membranes - the interlayer spacing between GO sheets - are of\nvariable size. This presents a challenge for using GO membranes for filtration.\nDespite the great efforts to tune and fix the interlayer spacing, it remains\ndifficult both to reduce the interlayer spacing sufficiently to exclude small\nions while keeping this separation constant against the tendency of GO\nmembranes to swell when immersed in aqueous solution, which greatly affects the\napplications of GO membranes.

The theoretical lower boundary of the size distribution -- the\nso-called 'blowout size' -- is compared in the cases of compact and porous\ngrains.

Whereas in non-rigid paradigms (e.g., standard Taylor expansion or\nnon-idempotent intersection types), bags of resources are multisets and\ninvariant under permutation, in the rigid ones, permutations must be processed\nexplicitly and can be allowed or disallowed. Rigidity enables a fine-grained\ncontrol of reduction paths and their effects on e.g., typing derivations. We\npreviously introduced a very constrained coinductive type system (system S) in\nwhich permutation is completely disallowed. One may wonder in what extent the\nabsence of permutations causes a loss of expressivity w.r.t. reduction paths,\ncompared to a usual multiset framework or a rigid one allowing permutations. We\nanswer this question in the most general case i.e. coinductive type grammars\nwithout validity conditions. Our main contribution is to prove that not only\nevery non-idempotent derivation can be represented by a rigid, permutation-free\nderivation, but also that any dynamic behavior may be captured in this way.

Our framework thus naturally generalizes a previously\nproposed regularization based on the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy related to the\nKullback-Leibler divergence, and solved with the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm. We\ncall the regularized optimal transport distance the rot mover's distance in\nreference to the classical earth mover's distance.

A matching in a graph is a\nsubset of edges of the graph with no shared vertices. A matching is called\nperfect if it matches all the vertices of the underling graph. A geometric\nmatching is a matching in a geometric graph. In this thesis, we study matching\nproblems in various geometric graphs. Among the family of geometric graphs we\nlook at complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, complete multipartite\ngraphs, Delaunay graphs, Gabriel graphs, and $\\Theta$-graphs. The classical\nmatching problem is to find a matching of maximum size in a given graph. We\nstudy this problem as well as some of its variants on geometric graphs. The\nbottleneck matching problem is to find a maximum matching that minimizes the\nlength of the longest edge. The plane matching problem is to find a maximum\nmatching so that the edges in the matching are pairwise non-crossing. A\ngeometric matching is strong with respect to a given shape $S$ if we can assign\nto each edge in the matching a scaled version of $S$ such that the shapes\nrepresenting the edges are pairwise disjoint. The strong matching problem is to\nfind a maximum strong matching with respect to a given shape. The matching\npacking problem is to pack as many edge-disjoint perfect matchings as possible\ninto a geometric graph. We study these problems and establish lower and upper\nbounds on the size of different kinds of matchings in various geometric graphs.\nWe also present algorithms for computing such matchings. Some of the presented\nbounds are tight, while the others need to be sharpened.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 15:32:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-21"}

With $n$\nsignal DOFs at the input, $n-1$ DOFs are asymptotically lost to signal-noise\ninteractions. The main observation is that, nonlinearity introduces a\nmultiplicative noise in the channel, similar to fading in wireless channels.\nThe channel is viewed in the spherical coordinate system, where signal vector\n$\\underline{X}\\in\\mathbb{C}^n$ is represented in terms of its norm\n$|\\underline{X}|$ and direction $\\underline{\\hat{X}}$. The multiplicative noise\ncauses signal direction $\\underline{\\hat{X}}$ to vary randomly on the surface\nof the unit $(2n-1)$-sphere in $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$, in such a way that the\neffective area of the support of $\\underline{\\hat{X}}$ does not vanish as\n$|\\underline{X}|\\rightarrow\\infty$. On the other hand, the surface area of the\nsphere is finite, so that $\\underline{\\hat{X}}$ carries finite information.\nThis observation is used to show several results. Firstly, let $\\mathcal\nC(\\mathcal P)$ be the capacity of a discrete-time periodic model of the optical\nfiber with distributed noise and frequency-dependent loss, as a function of the\naverage input power $\\mathcal P$.

This study\naims to investigate the aneurysmal SAH incidence rate in elderly population\nthan in middle aged population in China. Materials and methods: Aneurysmal SAH\ncases were collected retrospectively from the archives of 21 hospitals in\nMainland China. All the cases collected were from September 2016 and backward\nconsecutively for a period of time up to 8 years. SAH was initially diagnosed\nby brain computed tomography, and CT angiography (CTA) or digital subtraction\nangiography (DSA) was followed and SAH was confirmed to be due to cerebral\naneurysm. When for cases multiple bleeding occurred, the age of the first SAH\nwas used in this study. The toltal incidence from all hospital at each age were\nsummed together for females and males; then adjusted by the total population\nnumber at each age for females and males. The total population data was from\nthe 2010 population census of the People's Republic of China. Results: In total\nthere were 8,144 cases, with 4,861 females and 3,283 males. Our analysis shows\nfor both females and males the relative aneurysmal SAH rate started to decrease\nafter around 65 years old. The males the relative aneurysmal SAH rate might\nhave started to decrease after around 55 years old. Conclusion: In contrast to\nprevious reports, our data demonstrated a decreased aneurysmal subarachnoid\nhemorrhage incidence rate in elderly population than in middle aged population.\nOur data therefore support the hypothesis that aneurysms do not grow\nprogressively once they form but probably either rupture or stabilize and that\nvery elderly patients are at a reduced risk of rupture compared with atients\nwho are younger with the same-sized aneurysms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 16:21:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}
