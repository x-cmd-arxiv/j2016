For\nreal-valued Ashtekar-Barbero variables, this `deformed algebra' approach has\nbeen shown to implement holonomy corrections from loop quantum gravity (LQG) in\na consistent manner, albeit deforming the algebra of modified constraints in\nthe process. This deformation has serious conceptual ramifications, not the\nleast of them being an effective `signature-change' in the deep quantum regime.\nIn this paper, we show that working with self dual variables lead to an\nundeformed algebra of hypersurface deformations, even after including holonomy\ncorrections in the effective constraints. As a necessary consequence, the\ndiffeomorphism constraint picks up non-perturbative quantum corrections thus\nhinting at a modification of the underlying space-time structure, a novel\ningredient compared to the usual treatment of (spatial) diffeomorphisms in LQG.\nThis work extends a similar result obtained in the context of spherically\nsymmetric gravity coupled to a scalar field, suggesting that self dual\nvariables could be better suited than their real counterparts to treat\ninhomogeneous LQG models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 16:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}

This label fusion method is formulated on a\ngraph, which embraces both label priors from atlases and anatomical priors from\ntarget image. To represent a pixel in a comprehensive way, three kinds of\nfeature vectors are generated, including intensity, gradient and structural\nsignature. To select candidate atlas nodes for fusion, rather than exact\nsearching, randomized k-d tree with spatial constraint is introduced as an\nefficient approximation for high-dimensional feature matching. Feature\nSensitive Label Prior (FSLP), which takes both the consistency and variety of\ndifferent features into consideration, is proposed to gather atlas priors. As\nFSLP is a non-convex problem, one heuristic approach is further designed to\nsolve it efficiently. Moreover, based on the anatomical knowledge, parts of the\ntarget pixels are also employed as graph seeds to assist the label fusion\nprocess and an iterative strategy is utilized to gradually update the label\nmap. The comprehensive experiments carried out on two publicly available\ndatabases give results to demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain\nbetter segmentation quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 16:22:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2017 15:13:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-10"}

This is shown by defining a\nbipartite entanglement monotone tailored to this interferometric setting and\nproving that it never exceeds the so-called interferometric power, a quantity\nwhich relies on more general quantum correlations beyond entanglement and\ncaptures the relevant resource. We then prove that the interferometric power\ncan never increase when local commutativity-preserving operations are applied\nto qubit probes, an important step to validate such a quantity as a genuine\nquantum correlations monotone. These findings are accompanied by a\nroom-temperature nuclear magnetic resonance experimental investigation, in\nwhich two-qubit states with extremal (maximal and minimal) interferometric\npower at fixed entanglement are produced and characterized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 17:40:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 17:12:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 18:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

In our model, the decision maker decides\nwhen to observe (costly) information by sampling an underlying continuous-time\nstochastic process (time series) that conveys information about the potential\noccurrence or non-occurrence of an adverse event which will terminate the\ndecision-making process. In her attempt to predict the occurrence of the\nadverse event, the decision-maker follows a policy that determines when to\nacquire information from the time series (continuation), and when to stop\nacquiring information and make a final prediction (stopping). We show that the\noptimal policy has a rendezvous structure, i.e. a structure in which whenever a\nnew information sample is gathered from the time series, the optimal \"date\" for\nacquiring the next sample becomes computable. The optimal interval between two\ninformation samples balances a trade-off between the decision maker's surprise,\ni.e. the drift in her posterior belief after observing new information, and\nsuspense, i.e. the probability that the adverse event occurs in the time\ninterval between two information samples. Moreover, we characterize the\ncontinuation and stopping regions in the decision-maker's state-space, and show\nthat they depend not only on the decision-maker's beliefs, but also on the\ncontext, i.e. the current realization of the time series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 17:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}

The microscopic representation is mapped onto a model of soft\nspheres with fluctuating size, where each sphere represents a microscopic\nsubchain with $N_{\\rm b}$ monomers. By varying $N_{\\rm b}$ a hierarchy of CG\nrepresentations at different resolutions is obtained. Within this hierarchy, CG\nconfigurations equilibrated with Monte Carlo at low resolution are sequentially\nfine-grained into CG melts described with higher resolution.

Recent exfoliation of phosphorene in\ndeoxygenated water promotes the need to re-examine the role of H2O and O2\nmolecules. Considering the presence of high population of vacancies in\nphosphorene, we investigate the interaction of H2O and O2 molecules with\nvacancy-contained phosphorene using first-principles calculations. In contrast\nto the common notion that physisorbed molecules tend to have a stronger\nadsorption at vacancy sites, we show that H2O has nearly the same adsorption\nenergy at the vacancy site as that at the perfect one. Charge transfer analysis\nshows that O2 is a strong electron scavenger, which transfers the lone-pair\nelectrons of the phosphorus atoms to the 2{\\pi}* antibonding orbital of O2. As\na result, the barrier for the O-O bond splitting to form O-P bonds is reduced\nfrom 0.81 eV at the perfect site to 0.59 eV at the defect site, leading to an\nabout 5000 faster oxidizing rate at the defect site than at the perfect site at\nroom temperature. Hence, our work reveals that the vacancy in phosphorene shows\na stronger oxygen affinity than the perfect phosphorene lattice site.\nStructural degradation of phosphorene due to oxidization may occur rapidly at\nedges and grain boundaries where vacancies tend to agglomerate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 17:56:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-08"}

In this letter, we discuss three\ndifferent types of simplified models for this possible excess. In the first\nclass of models, we assume a new resonance couples to both b bar{b} and mu^+\nmu^-. Within the allowed parameter space for the ALEPH data, this type of\nmodels is excluded because of too large Drell-Yan production of dimuon from the\nb bar{b} collision at the LHC. In the second model, we assume that the 30 GeV\nexcess is a new gauge boson Z' that couples to the SM b and a new vectorlike\nsinglet B quark heavier than Z and not to b bar{b}. Then one can account for\nthe ALEPH data without conflict with the DY constraint. The new vectorlike\nquark B can be pair produced at the LHC 8/13 TeV by QCD with sigma(BB) ~\nO(100-1000) pb, and Bq production rate is sigma(Bq) ~ a few pb which is larger\nthan sigma(Bb) roughly by an order of magnitude. Their signatures at the LHC\nwould be 2b + 4mu, bj + 2mu and 2b + 2mu, respectively, which however might\nhave been excluded already by LHC run I and II data since the multi-muon events\nhave low SM background and are rare at the LHC. In the third model, we consider\nZ -> Z' phi followed by Z' -> mu^+ mu^- and phi -> b bar{b} assuming that the\nHiggs field for Z' mass is also charged under the SM U(1)_Y gauge symmetry. In\nthis class of model, we could accommodate the Br(Z -> b bar{b} mu^+ mu^-) ~ 1.1\nX 10^{-5} if we assume very large U(1)' charge for the U(1)' breaking Higgs\nfield.

The interaction intensity is denoted by $\\beta>0$\nand the set of trajectories consists of those self-avoiding paths respecting\nthe prudent condition, which means that they do not take a step towards a\npreviously visited lattice site. The IPSAW interpolates between the interacting\npartially directed self-avoiding walk (IPDSAW) that was analyzed in details in,\ne.g., [Zwanzig and Lauritzen, 1968], [Brak et al., 1992], [Carmona, Nguyen and\nP\\'etr\\'elis, 2013-2016], and the interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) for\nwhich the collapse transition was conjectured in [Saleur, 1986]. Three main\ntheorems are proven. We show first that IPSAW undergoes a collapse transition\nat finite temperature and, up to our knowledge, there was so far no proof in\nthe literature of the existence of a collapse transition for a non-directed\nmodel built with self-avoiding path. We also prove that the free energy of\nIPSAW is equal to that of a restricted version of IPSAW, i.e., the interacting\ntwo-sided prudent walk. Such free energy is computed by considering only those\nprudent path with a general north-east orientation. As a by-product of this\nresult we obtain that the exponential growth rate of generic prudent paths\nequals that of two-sided prudent paths and this answers an open problem raised\nin e.g., [Bousquet-M\\'elou, 2010] or [Dethridge and Guttmann, 2008]. Finally we\nshow that, for every $\\beta>0$, the free energy of ISAW itself is always larger\nthan $\\beta$ and this rules out a possible self-touching saturation of ISAW in\nits conjectured collapsed phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 18:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}

First, we\nmodel the temporal correlations using Markov model and analyze the privacy\nleakage of a DP mechanism when adversaries have knowledge of such temporal\ncorrelations. Our analysis reveals that the privacy leakage of a DP mechanism\nmay accumulate and increase over time. We call it temporal privacy leakage.\nSecond, to measure such privacy leakage, we design an efficient algorithm for\ncalculating it in polynomial time. Although the temporal privacy leakage may\nincrease over time, we also show that its supremum may exist in some cases.\nThird, to bound the privacy loss, we propose mechanisms that convert any\nexisting DP mechanism into one against temporal privacy leakage.

First, each image in the OCT\nstack is denoised using a Wiener deconvolution algorithm that estimates the\nadditive speckle noise variance using a novel Fourier-domain based structural\nerror. This denoising method enhances the image SNR by an average of 12dB.\nNext, the denoised images are subjected to an iterative multi-resolution\nhigh-pass filtering algorithm that detects seven sub-retinal surfaces in six\niterative steps. The thicknesses of each sub-retinal layer for all scans from a\nparticular OCT stack are then compared to the manually marked groundtruth. The\nproposed system uses adaptive thresholds for denoising and segmenting each\nimage and hence it is robust to disruptions in the retinal micro-structure due\nto DME. The proposed denoising and segmentation system has an average error of\n1.2-5.8 $\\mu m$ and 3.5-26$\\mu m$ for segmenting sub-retinal surfaces in normal\nand abnormal images with DME, respectively.

However, a\nsingle vector does not suffice to model the polysemous nature of many\n(frequent) words, i.e., words with multiple meanings. In this paper, we propose\na three-fold approach for unsupervised polysemy modeling: (a) context\nrepresentations, (b) sense induction and disambiguation and (c) lexeme (as a\nword and sense pair) representations. A key feature of our work is the finding\nthat a sentence containing a target word is well represented by a low rank\nsubspace, instead of a point in a vector space. We then show that the subspaces\nassociated with a particular sense of the target word tend to intersect over a\nline (one-dimensional subspace), which we use to disambiguate senses using a\nclustering algorithm that harnesses the Grassmannian geometry of the\nrepresentations. The disambiguation algorithm, which we call $K$-Grassmeans,\nleads to a procedure to label the different senses of the target word in the\ncorpus -- yielding lexeme vector representations, all in an unsupervised manner\nstarting from a large (Wikipedia) corpus in English. Apart from several\nprototypical target (word,sense) examples and a host of empirical studies to\nintuit and justify the various geometric representations, we validate our\nalgorithms on standard sense induction and disambiguation datasets and present\nnew state-of-the-art results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 19:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}

When using the fraction of corresponding\ndark matter and gas particles in the initial conditions (the \"paired fraction\")\nas a proxy of the dark matter and gas segregation strength of a halo, on\naverage about $25$ percent of the baryonic and dark matter of the final halo\nare segregated in the initial conditions. This is at odds with the assumption\nof the standard galaxy formation model. A consequence of this effect is that\nthe baryons and dark matter of the same halo initially experience different\ntidal torques and thus their angular momentum vectors are often misaligned. The\ndegree of the misalignment is largely preserved during later halo assembly and\ncan be understood with the tidal torque theory. The result challenges the\nprecision of some semi-analytical approaches which utilize dark matter halo\nmerger trees to infer properties of gas associated to dark matter haloes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 19:59:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2017 02:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-07"}

Here we create a custom\nMonte Carlo sampler for sparse or noisy radial-velocity measurements of\ntwo-body systems that can produce posterior samples for orbital parameters even\nwhen the likelihood function is poorly behaved. The six standard orbital\nparameters for a binary system can be split into four non-linear parameters\n(period, eccentricity, argument of pericenter, phase) and two linear parameters\n(velocity amplitude, barycenter velocity). We capitalize on this by building a\nsampling method in which we densely sample the prior pdf in the non-linear\nparameters and perform rejection sampling using a likelihood function\nmarginalized over the linear parameters. With sparse or uninformative data, the\nsampling obtained by this rejection sampling is generally multimodal and dense.\nWith informative data, the sampling becomes effectively unimodal but too\nsparse: in these cases we follow the rejection sampling with standard MCMC. The\nmethod produces correct samplings in orbital parameters for data that include\nas few as three epochs. The Joker can therefore be used to produce proper\nsamplings of multimodal pdfs, which are still informative and can be used in\nhierarchical (population) modeling.

The\nprimary was claimed to have a stellar mass greater than 300Msun, making it a\ncandidate for the most massive star known. While the primary is a known late\ntype, H-rich Wolf-Rayet star (WN6h), the secondary could not be so far\nunambiguously detected. Using moderate resolution spectra, we are able to\nderive accurate radial velocities for both components. By performing\nsimultaneous orbital and polarimetric analyses, we derive the complete set of\norbital parameters, including the inclination. The spectra are disentangled and\nspectroscopically analyzed, and an analysis of the wind-wind collision zone is\nconducted.\n  The disentangled spectra and our models are consistent with a WN6h type for\nthe primary, and suggest that the secondary is an O3.5 If*/WN7 type star.

An analysis of\nemission excess stemming from a wind-wind collision yields a similar\ninclination to that obtained from polarimetry (i = 39 +- 6deg). Our analysis\nthus implies M1 = 53^{+40}_{-20} and M2 = 54^{+40}_{-20} Msun, excluding M1 >\n300Msun. A detailed comparison with evolution tracks calculated for single and\nbinary stars, as well as the high eccentricity, suggest that the components of\nthe system underwent quasi-homogeneous evolution and avoided mass-transfer.\nThis scenario would suggest current masses of ~ 80 Msun and initial masses of\nMi,1 ~ 105 and Mi,2 ~ 90Msun, consistent with the upper limits of our derived\norbital masses, and would imply an age of ~2.2 Myr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

Although not proven, it is believed\nthat our invariants are strictly different from other known invariants. It\nremains to be seen if the invariants are sensitive to smooth structures. It is\nexpected that the most general input to the state-sum type construction of\n$(3+1)$-TQFTs is a spherical fusion $2$-category. We show that a $G$-BSFC\ncorresponds to a monoidal $2$-category with certain extra structure, but that\nstructure does not satisfy all the axioms of a spherical fusion $2$-category\ngiven by M. Mackaay. Thus the question of what axioms properly define a\nspherical fusion $2$-category is open.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 20:06:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Nov 2019 16:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-05"}

This generalizes the classical problem of\nscheduling for makespan minimization (case l_infty) and has been thoroughly\nstudied. However, despite the recent push for beyond worst-case analyses, no\nsuch results are known for this problem. In this paper we provide algorithms\nwith simultaneous guarantees for the worst-case model as well as for the\nrandom-order (i.e. secretary) model, where an arbitrary set of jobs comes in\nrandom order. First, we show that the greedy algorithm (with restart), known to\nhave optimal O(p) worst-case guarantee, also has a (typically) improved\nrandom-order guarantee. However, the behavior of this algorithm in the\nrandom-order model degrades with p. We then propose algorithm SIMULTANEOUSLB\nthat has simultaneously optimal guarantees (within constants) in both\nworst-case and random-order models. In particular, the random-order guarantee\nof SIMULTANEOUSLB improves as p increases.\n  One of the main components is a new algorithm with improved regret for Online\nLinear Optimization (OLO) over the non-negative vectors in the lq ball.\nInterestingly, this OLO algorithm is also used to prove a purely probabilistic\ninequality that controls the correlations arising in the random-order model, a\ncommon source of difficulty for the analysis. Another important component used\nin both SIMULTANEOUSLB and our OLO algorithm is a smoothing of the lp-norm that\nmay be of independent interest.

This field\ndivergence limits the gating strength, boundary sharpness, and pitch size of\nperiodic structures, and restricts possible geometries of local gates (due to\nwire packaging), precluding certain device concepts, such as plasmonics and\ntransformation optics based on metamaterials. Here we present a new gating\nconcept based on a dielectric-free self-aligned electrolyte technique that\nallows spatially modulating charges with nanometer resolution. We employ a\ncombination of a solid-polymer electrolyte gate and an ion-impenetrable\ne-beam-defined resist mask to locally create excess charges on top of the gated\nsurface. Electrostatic simulations indicate high carrier density variations of\n$\\Delta n =10^{14}\\text{cm}^{-2}$ across a length of 10 nm at the mask\nboundaries on the surface of a 2D conductor, resulting in a sharp depletion\nregion and a strong in-plane electric field of $6\\times10^8 \\text{Vm}^{-1}$\nacross the so-created junction. We apply this technique to the 2D material\ngraphene to demonstrate the creation of tunable p-n junctions for\noptoelectronic applications. We also demonstrate the spatial versatility and\nself-aligned properties of this technique by introducing a novel graphene\nthermopile photodetector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 20:46:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 18:39:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}

If the\nmagnetic field in the strong shocks is ordered, its component parallel to the\nshock front should be enhanced, and the resultant synchrotron radiation would\nbe polarized. However, such polarization has never been measured. We performed\nspatially-unresolved radio continuum observations of WR 146, a well known a\nWC6+O8 system, at 5 cm and 20 cm with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. No\nlinearly polarized radio emission was detected. The data constrain the\nfractional linear polarization to less than 0.6% between 1 to 8 GHz. This is\ncompatible with a high level of turbulence and a dominant random component in\nthe magnetic field. In this case the relativistic particles could be produced\nby turbulent magnetic reconnection (MR). In order for this scenario to satisfy\nthe required non-thermal energy budget, we find through numerical modeling that\nthe strength of the magnetic field in the WCR must be as high as ~150 mG.\nHowever, if the magnetic field is ordered and DSA is ongoing, then a\ncombination of internal and external Faraday rotation could equally account for\nthe depolarization of the emission. It is not clear whether it is possible to\ndevelop the high level of turbulence and strong magnetic fields required for\nefficient MR in a long-period binary such as WR 146. This scenario might also\nhave trouble explaining the low-frequency cutoff in the spectrum. We therefore\nfavor a scenario where particles are accelerated through DSA and the\ndepolarization is produced by mechanisms other than a large ratio between\nrandom to regular magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 21:05:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

Our\nnewly constructed sample contains 91 nebular spectra of 38 SNe IIP, which is\nthe largest dataset of its kind ever analysed in one study, and many of the\nobjects have complementary photometric data. We determined the peak and total\nluminosity, velocity of the peak, HWHM intensity, and profile shape for many\nemission lines. Temporal evolution of these values and various flux ratios are\nstudied. We also investigate the correlations between these measurements and\nphotometric observables, such as the peak and plateau absolute magnitudes and\nthe late-time light curve decline rates in various optical bands. The strongest\nand most robust result we find is that the luminosities of all spectral\nfeatures (except those of helium) tend to be higher in objects with steeper\nlate-time V-band decline rates. A steep late-time V-band slope likely arises\nfrom less efficient trapping of gamma-rays and positrons, which could be caused\nby multidimensional effects such as clumping of the ejecta or asphericity of\nthe explosion itself. Furthermore, if gamma-rays and positrons can escape more\neasily, then so can photons via the observed emission lines, leading to more\nluminous spectral features. It is also shown that SNe IIP with larger\nprogenitor stars have ejecta with a more physically extended oxygen layer that\nis well-mixed with the hydrogen layer.

The conventional way to\nanswer this counterfactual question is to estimate the effect of the new\ntreatment in comparison to that of the conventional treatment by running a\ncontrolled, randomized experiment. While this approach theoretically ensures an\nunbiased estimator, it suffers from several drawbacks, including the difficulty\nin finding representative experimental populations as well as the cost of\nrunning such trials. Moreover, such trials neglect the huge quantities of\navailable control-condition data which are often completely ignored.\n  In this paper we propose a discriminative framework for estimating the\nperformance of a new treatment given a large dataset of the control condition\nand data from a small (and possibly unrepresentative) randomized trial\ncomparing new and old treatments. Our objective, which requires minimal\nassumptions on the treatments, models the relation between the outcomes of the\ndifferent conditions.

In this paper, a wirelessly powered\ncommunication system is investigated where an energy harvesting transmitter,\ncharged by one or more power beacons via wireless energy transfer, attempts to\ncommunicate with a receiver over a noisy channel. Under a save-then-transmit\nprotocol, the system performance is characterized using metrics such as the\nenergy supply probability at the transmitter, and the achievable rate at the\nreceiver for the case of short packets. Leveraging the framework of\nfinite-length information theory, tractable analytical expressions are derived\nfor the considered metrics in terms of system parameters such as the harvest\nblocklength, the transmit blocklength, the harvested power and the transmit\npower. The analysis provides several useful design guidelines. Though using a\nsmall transmit power or a small transmit blocklength helps avoid energy\noutages, the consequently smaller signal-to-noise ratio or the fewer coding\nopportunities may cause an information outage. Scaling laws are derived to\ncapture this inherent trade-off between the harvest and transmit blocklengths.\nMoreover, the asymptotically optimal transmit power is derived in closed-form.\nNumerical results reveal that power control is essential for improving the\nachievable rate of the system in the finite blocklength regime. The\nasymptotically optimal transmit power yields nearly optimal performance in the\nfinite blocklength regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 22:32:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 22:47:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

Shared spaces constitute considerable office space\narea, in which most office employees perform their meetings and daily tasks,\nand therefore the ACs in these areas have significant impact on the energy\nusage of the entire office building. The cost of this energy consumption,\nhowever, is not paid by the shared space users, and the AC's temperature\nset-point is not determined based on the users' preferences. This latter factor\nis compounded by the fact that different people may have different choices of\ntemperature set-points and sensitivities to change of temperature. Therefore,\nit is a challenging task to design an office policy to decide on a particular\nset-point based on such a diverse preference set. As a result, users are not\naware of the energy consumption in shared spaces, which may potentially\nincrease the energy wastage and related cost of office buildings. In this\ncontext, this paper proposes an energy policy for an office shared space by\nexploiting an established temperature control mechanism. In particular, we\nchoose meeting rooms in an office building as the test case and design a policy\naccording to which each user of the room can give a preference on the\ntemperature set-point and is paid for felt discomfort if the set-point is not\nfixed according to the given preference. On the other hand, users who enjoy the\nthermal comfort compensate the other users of the room. Thus, the policy\nenables the users to be cognizant and responsible for the payment on the energy\nconsumption of the office space they are sharing, and at the same time ensures\nthat the users are satisfied either via thermal comfort or through incentives.\nThe policy is also shown to be beneficial for building management. Through\nexperiment based case studies, we show the effectiveness of the proposed\npolicy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2016 00:13:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

Far-infrared data from Herschel-ATLAS suggest high levels of\ndust (>10^9 M_solar) and a correspondingly large amount of obscured star\nformation (~1000 M_solar / yr). The molecular gas is traced via the J = 1-0\ntransition of 12CO, its luminosity implying total H_2 masses of (1.7 +/- 0.3) x\n10^11 and (9.5 +/- 2.4) x 10^10 (alpha_CO/0.8) M_solar in HATLAS\nJ090426.9+015448 and HATLAS J140930.4+003803 respectively. Both galaxies\nexhibit molecular line emission over a broad (~1000 km/s) velocity range, and\nfeature double-peaked profiles. We interpret this as evidence of either a large\nrotating disk or an on-going merger. Gas depletion timescales are ~100 Myr. The\n1.4 GHz radio luminosities of our targets place them close to the break in the\nluminosity function. As such they represent `typical' z > 2 radio sources,\nresponsible for the bulk of the energy emitted at radio wavelengths from\naccretion-powered sources at high redshift, and yet they rank amongst the most\nmassive systems in terms of molecular gas and dust content. We also detect 115\nGHz rest-frame continuum emission, indicating a very steep high-radio-frequency\nspectrum, possibly classifying the targets as compact steep spectrum objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2016 01:18:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 12:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

We\nrigorously prove that they achieve strictly better error guarantees than the\ncorresponding existing sketches, and demonstrate their practicality and\nsuperiority via an extensive experimental evaluation on both real and synthetic\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2016 03:51:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2017 19:17:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

However, Sparse\nH-Tucker uses a nested sampling technique to overcome a key scalability problem\nin Hierarchical Tucker, which is the creation of an unwieldy intermediate dense\ncore tensor; the result of our approach is a faster, more space-efficient, and\nmore accurate method. We extensively test our method on a real healthcare\ndataset, which is collected from 30K patients and results in an 18th order\nsparse data tensor. Unlike competing methods, Sparse H-Tucker can analyze the\nfull data set on a single multi-threaded machine.

However, in practice, obtaining tight dual bounds usually\nrequires good approximations of the optimal dual penalty, which could be\ntime-consuming due to the conditional expectations that need to be estimated\nvia nested simulation. In this paper, we will develop a framework of regression\napproach to approximating the optimal dual penalty in a non-nested manner, by\nexploring the structure of the function space consisting of all feasible dual\npenalties.

The precoding matrix and the signal\nconstellation in the low-dimensional STBC are jointly designed to guarantee\nomnidirectional coverage at any instant time and sufficiently utilize the power\namplifier capacities of BS transmit antennas, and at the same time, achieve the\nfull diversity of the low-dimensional STBC. Under this framework, several\ndesigns are presented. To provide transmit diversity order of two, a precoded\nAlamouti code is proposed, which has a fast symbol-wise maximum-likelihood (ML)\ndecoding. To provide transmit diversity order of four, three types of STBCs are\nproposed, being referred to as precoded orthogonal STBC (OSTBC), precoded\nquasi-orthogonal STBC (QOSTBC), and precoded coordinate interleaved orthogonal\ndesign (CIOD), respectively.

Flocks of homing pigeons,\nColumba livia, provide a useful model for the study of collective motion and\ndecision making. During homing flights, flock members are forced to resolve\npotentially divergent navigational preferences in order to stay together and\nbenefit from flying in a group. Recent work has demonstrated that some\nindividuals consistently contribute more to the movement decisions of the flock\nthan others do, thereby generating stable hierarchical leader/follower\nnetworks. Yet, what attributes of a flying pigeon reliably predict leadership\nremains an open question. We examined the flexibility of an individual's\nhierarchical leadership rank (i.e. its ordinal position when flock members are\nranked according to the average time differences with which they lead or follow\nothers) as a function of changes in its navigational knowledge. We manipulated\nalready established hierarchical networks in three different flocks, by\nproviding certain individuals with additional homing experience. We found that\nsuch training did not consistently lead to an increase in birds' leadership\nranks, and that, in general, the nature of leader/follower interactions between\ntrained and untrained birds remained unaffected. Thus, leadership hierarchies\nin pigeon flocks appear resistant to changes in the navigational knowledge of a\nsubset of their members, at least when these changes are relatively small. We\ndiscuss the implications of our results in light of the potential benefits of\nstructural stability in decision-making networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2016 08:35:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

While\nthis scenario appears to provide a natural explanation for the observed orbital\nlocations of the circumbinary planets, previous simulations have failed to\nmatch the observed planet orbital parameters. The aim of this work is to\nexamine the role of self-gravity in modifying circumbinary disc structure as a\nfunction of disc mass, prior to considering the evolution of embedded\ncircumbinary planets. In agreement with previous work, we find that for disc\nmasses between 1--5 times the minimum mass solar nebula (MMSN), disc\nself-gravity affects modest changes in the structure and evolution of\ncircumbinary discs. Increasing the disc mass to 10 or 20 MMSN leads to two\ndramatic changes in disc structure. First, the scale of the inner cavity\nshrinks substantially, bringing its outer edge closer to the binary. Second, in\naddition to the eccentric inner cavity, additional precessing eccentric\nring-like features develop in the outer regions of the discs. If planet\nformation starts early in the disc lifetime, these changes will have a\nsignificant impact on the formation and evolution of planets and precursor\nmaterial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2016 10:01:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

During a low accretion phase, the radiatively inefficient\naccretion flow (RIAF) cannot emit enough MeV photons that are needed to sustain\nthe force-free magnetosphere via two-photon collisions. In such a\ncharge-starved region (or a gap), an electric field arises along the magnetic\nfield lines to accelerate electrons and positrons into ultra-relativistic\nenergies. These relativistic leptons emit copious gamma-rays via curvature and\ninverse-Compton (IC) processes. Some of such gamma-rays collide with the\nsubmillimeter-IR photons emitted from the RIAF to materialize as pairs, which\npolarize to partially screen the original acceleration electric field. It is\nfound that the gap gamma-ray luminosity increases with decreasing accretion\nrate. However, if the accretion rate decreases too much, the diminished RIAF\nsoft photon field can no longer sustain a stationary pair production within the\ngap. As long as a stationary gap is formed, the magnetosphere becomes\nforce-free outside the gap by the cascaded pairs, irrespective of the BH mass.\nIf a nearby stellar-mass black hole (BH) is in quiescence, or if a galactic\nintermediate-mass BH is in a very low accretion state, its curvature and IC\nemissions are found to be detectable with Fermi/LAT and imaging atmospheric\nCherenkov telescopes (IACT). If a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus is\nlocated within a few tens of Mpc, the IC emission from its super-massive BH is\nmarginally detectable with IACT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2016 10:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

It has been suggested\nthat there was a distinct group of GRBs, beyond the long and short ones, with\nintermediate durations. However, such a group is not securely confirmed yet.\nStrangely, concerning the spectral hardness, the observations from the Swift\nand RHESSI satellites give different results. For the Swift/BAT database it is\nfound that the intermediate-duration bursts might well be related to so-called\nX-ray flashes (XRFs). On the other hand, for the RHESSI dataset the\nintermediate-duration bursts seem to be spectrally too hard to be given by\nXRFs. The connection of the intermediate-duration bursts and XRFs for the BATSE\ndatabase is not clear as well. The purpose of this article is to check the\nrelation between XRFs and GRBs for the BATSE and RHESSI databases,\nrespectively. We use an empirical definition of XRFs introduced by other\nauthors earlier. For the RHESSI database we also use a transformation between\nthe detected counts and the fluences based on the simulated detector response\nfunction. The purpose is to compare the hardnesses of GRBs with the definition\nof XRFs. There is a 1.3-4.2 % fraction of XRFs in the whole BATSE database. The\nvast majority of the BATSE short bursts are not XRFs because only 0.7-5.7 % of\nthe short bursts can be given by XRFs. However, there is a large uncertainty in\nthe fraction of XRFs among the intermediate-duration bursts. The fraction of\n1-85 % of the BATSE intermediate-duration bursts can be related to XRFs. For\nthe long bursts this fraction is between 1.0 % and 3.4 %. The uncertainties in\nthese fractions are large, however it can be claimed that all BATSE\nintermediate-duration bursts cannot be given by XRFs.

It is particularly important in the\npresence of parallel imaging acceleration, where the noise distribution can\ncontain severe spatial heterogeneities. If the parallel imaging reconstruction\nis a linear process, an exact noise analysis is possible by taking into account\nthe correlations between all the samples involved. However, for k-space based\ntechniques like GRAPPA, the exact analysis has been considered computationally\nprohibitive due to the very large size of the noise covariance matrices\nrequired to characterize the noise propagation from k-space to image-space.\nPrevious methods avoid this computational burden by approximating the GRAPPA\nreconstruction as a pixel-wise linear operation performed in the image-space.\nHowever, these methods are not exact in the presence of non-uniform k-space\nundersampling (e.g.: containing a calibration region). For this reason, in this\nwork we develop an exact characterization of the noise distribution for\nself-calibrated parallel imaging in the presence of arbitrary Cartesian\nundersampling patterns. By exploiting the symmetries and separability in the\nnoise propagation process, the proposed method is computationally efficient and\ndoes not require large matrices.

This result can be seen as a geometric\ngeneralization of the pumping lemma of finite state automata, and closes the\nquestion of what can be computed deterministically in this model. Moreover,\nthis question has motivated the development of a new method called visible\nglues. We believe that this method can also be used to tackle other\nlong-standing problems in computational geometry, in relation for instance with\nself-avoiding paths.

We show that the non-locality of the action, due to the\npresence of the tail effect at the 4PN order, gives rise to an extra\ncontribution to the conserved integral of energy with respect to the\nHamiltonian computed on shell, which was not taken into account in our previous\nwork. We also provide a direct derivation of the periastron advance by taking\ncarefully into account this non-locality. We then argue that the infra-red (IR)\ndivergences in the calculation of the gravitational part of the action are\nproblematic, which motivates us to introduce a second ambiguity parameter, in\naddition to the one already assumed previously. After fixing these two\nambiguity parameters by requiring that the conserved energy and the\nrelativistic periastron precession for circular orbits are in agreement with\nnumerical and analytical gravitational self-force calculations, valid in the\nlimiting case of small mass ratio, we find that our resulting Lagrangian is\nphysically equivalent to the one obtained in the ADM Hamiltonian approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2016 15:57:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 10:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

Considering the movement of a human as a Markovian motion, a modified\nHidden Markov Model (HMM)-based solution is proposed. The proposed method,\nnamely the Marginally Smoothed HMM (MSHMM), utilizes the marginal probabilities\nof location and timing information of the observations to smooth-out the\nemission probabilities while training. Hence, it can efficiently handle\nunforeseen observations during the test phase. The verification performance of\nthis method is compared to a sequence matching (SM) method , a Markov\nChain-based method (MC) and an HMM with basic Laplace Smoothing (HMM-lap).\nExperimental results using the location information of the UMD Active\nAuthentication Dataset-02 (UMDAA02) and the GeoLife dataset are presented.

We\nalso show that a discrete symmetry of $H$ is necessary for the presence of\ntopological influence and find topological influence on a skyrmion\ncharacterized by a non-Abelian permutation group of three elements in the\nground state of an SU(3)-Heisenberg model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 13:14:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 30 Apr 2017 09:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-02"}

Although there are several earlier\ntheoretically calculated yield functions, none of them agrees with experimental\ndata of latitude surveys of sea-level neutron monitors, thus suggesting for an\ninconsistency. A newly computed yield function of the standard sea-level 6NM64\nneutron monitor is presented here separately for primary cosmic ray protons and\n$\\alpha-$particles, the latter representing also heavier species of cosmic\nrays. The computations have been done using the GEANT-4 Planetocosmics\nMonte-Carlo tool and a realistic curved atmospheric model.

The new\ncomputation finally resolves the long-standing problem of disagreement between\nthe theoretically calculated spatial variability of cosmic rays over the globe\nand experimental latitude surveys.
