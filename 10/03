To solve EOCP, the primal-dual active set (PDAS)\nmethod, which is a special semismooth Newton (SSN) method, used to be a\npriority in consideration of their locally superlinear convergence. However, in\ngeneral solving the Newton equations is expensive, especially when the\ndiscretization is in a fine level. Motivated by the success of applying\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for solving large scale\nconvex minimization problem in finite dimension, it is reasonable to extend the\nADMM to solve EOCP. To numerically solve EOCP, the finite element (FE) method\nis used for discretization. Then, a two-phase strategy is presented to solve\ndiscretized problems. In Phase-I, an inexact heterogeneous ADMM (ihADMM) is\nproposed with the aim of solving discretized problems to moderate accuracy or\nusing it to generate a reasonably good initial point to warm-start Phase-II.\nDifferent from the classical ADMM, our ihADMM adopts two different weighted\ninner product to define the augmented Lagrangian function in two subproblems,\nrespectively. Benefiting from such different weighted techniques, two\nsubproblems of ihADMM can be efficiently implemented. Furthermore, theoretical\nresults on the global convergence as well as the iteration complexity results\n$o(1/k)$ for ihADMM are given. In Phase-II, in order to obtain more accurate\nsolution, the primal-dual active set (PDAS) method is used as a postprocessor\nof the ihADMM.

Recently,\nthere has been proposed a large number of new applications in fields such as\nrobotics, machine learning, experimental design, simulation, etc. In this\npaper, we focus on several problems that appear in robotics and autonomous\nsystems: algorithm tuning, automatic control and intelligent design. All those\nproblems can be mapped to global optimization problems. However, they become\nhard optimization problems. Bayesian optimization internally uses a\nprobabilistic surrogate model (e.g.: Gaussian process) to learn from the\nprocess and reduce the number of samples required. In order to generalize to\nunknown functions in a black-box fashion, the common assumption is that the\nunderlying function can be modeled with a stationary process. Nonstationary\nGaussian process regression cannot generalize easily and it typically requires\nprior knowledge of the function. Some works have designed techniques to\ngeneralize Bayesian optimization to nonstationary functions in an indirect way,\nbut using techniques originally designed for regression, where the objective is\nto improve the quality of the surrogate model everywhere. Instead optimization\nshould focus on improving the surrogate model near the optimum.

Therefore, we first tried to\nprovide a textual dataset - that includes not just Bangla, but Romanized Bangla\ntexts as well, is substantial, post-processed and multiple validated, ready to\nbe used in SA experiments. We tested this dataset in Deep Recurrent model,\nspecifically, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), using two types of loss functions\n- binary crossentropy and categorical crossentropy, and also did some\nexperimental pre-training by using data from one validation to pre-train the\nother and vice versa. Lastly, we documented the results along with some\nanalysis on them, which were promising.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2016 23:45:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 02:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-28"}

The present observations with Quantum\nMolecular Dynamics, QMD, simulation with quantum mechanical treatment of every\nwater molecule solvating a beta sheet that would be transient in nature suggest\nthat this steric blocking is not applicable in a hydrophobic region unless a\ncation is present, so that the amino acid beta sheet preference due to this\nsteric blocking is only effective in the presence of a cation. We observed\nbackbone hydration in a polyalanine and to a lesser extent polyvaline alpha\nhelix without a cation being present, but a cation could increase the strength\nof these HBs.\n  Parallel beta sheets have a greater tendency than antiparallel beta sheets of\nequivalent small size to retain regular structure in solvated QMD, and a 4\nstrand 4 inter-PG HB chain parallel beta sheet was used.

Recently, dictionary learning and sparse\ncoding have been widely used for image restoration problems.

However, this approach can generate unwanted edge artifacts and detail\nloss in the non-rain regions. Based on this observation, a new approach for\nshrinking the sparse codes is presented in this paper. To effectively shrink\nthe sparse codes in the rain and non-rain regions, an error map between the\ninput rain image and the reconstructed rain image is generated by using the\nlearned rain dictionary. Based on this error map, both the sparse codes of rain\nand non-rain dictionaries are used jointly to represent the image structures of\nobjects and avoid the edge artifacts in the non-rain regions. In the rain\nregions, the correlation matrix between the rain and non-rain dictionaries is\ncalculated. Then, the sparse codes corresponding to the highly correlated\nsignal-atoms in the rain and non-rain dictionaries are shrunk jointly to\nimprove the removal of the rain structures.

This expected\nutility optimization problem over the set of adapted strategies turns out to\nhave the same solutions as a mean-variance optimization over deterministic\ntrading strategies. That means the optimal adapted trading strategy is both\ndeterministic and time-consistent. It is also found to have an explicit closed\nform that clearly displays interesting properties.

Every observation of SgrA* from\n1985$-$2005 has been searched using an automated processing and detection\npipeline sensitive to transients with timescales between 30 seconds and five\nminutes with a typical detection threshold of $\\sim$100 mJy. Eight possible\ncandidates pass tests to filter false-positives from radio-frequency\ninterference, calibration errors, and imaging artifacts. Two events are\nidentified as promising candidates based on the smoothness of their light\ncurves. Despite the high quality of their light curves, these detections remain\nsuspect due to evidence of incomplete subtraction of the complex structure in\nthe Galactic center, and apparent contingency of one detection on reduction\nroutines. Events of this intensity ($\\sim$100 mJy) and duration ($\\sim$100 s)\nare not obviously associated with known astrophysical sources, and no\ncounterparts are found in data at other wavelengths. We consider potential\nsources, including Galactic center pulsars, dwarf stars, sources like GCRT\nJ1745-3009, and bursts from X-ray binaries. None can fully explain the observed\ntransients, suggesting either a new astrophysical source or a subtle imaging\nartifact.

When photons are\nfew and far in between, the concept of `image' breaks down and it is best to\nconsider directly the flow of photons. Computer vision in this regime, which we\ncall `scotopic', is radically different from the classical image-based paradigm\nin that visual computations (classification, control, search) have to take\nplace while the stream of photons is captured and decisions may be taken as\nsoon as enough information is available. The scotopic regime is important for\nbiomedical imaging, security, astronomy and many other fields. Here we develop\na framework that allows a machine to classify objects with as few photons as\npossible, while maintaining the error rate below an acceptable threshold. A\ndynamic and asymptotically optimal speed-accuracy tradeoff is a key feature of\nthis framework. We propose and study an algorithm to optimize the tradeoff of a\nconvolutional network directly from lowlight images and evaluate on simulated\nimages from standard datasets. Surprisingly, scotopic systems can achieve\ncomparable classification performance as traditional vision systems while using\nless than 0.1% of the photons in a conventional image.

Even if an oracle provided the\ninformation to perfectly disambiguate the underdetermined system, the\nreconstructed image could still have lower image quality than a corresponding\nfully sampled acquisition because of the reduced measurement time. The effects\nof lower SNR and the underdetermined system are coupled during reconstruction,\nmaking it difficult to isolate the impact of lower SNR on image quality. To\nthis end, we present an image quality prediction process that reconstructs\nfully sampled, fully determined data with noise added to simulate the loss of\nSNR induced by a given under-sampling pattern. The resulting prediction image\nempirically shows the effect of noise in under-sampled image reconstruction\nwithout any effect from an underdetermined system.\n  We discuss how our image quality prediction process can simulate the\ndistribution of noise for a given under-sampling pattern, including variable\ndensity sampling that produces colored noise in the measurement data. An\ninteresting consequence of our prediction model is that we can show that\nrecovery from underdetermined non-uniform sampling is equivalent to a weighted\nleast squares optimization that accounts for heterogeneous noise levels across\nmeasurements.\n  Through a series of experiments with synthetic and in vivo datasets, we\ndemonstrate the efficacy of the image quality prediction process and show that\nit provides a better estimation of reconstruction image quality than the\ncorresponding fully-sampled reference image.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2016 05:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

Thus, subject to radiative transfer corrections, the\nfraction of the sky covered by the torus as seen from the central source (known\nas the covering factor $f_c$) can be estimated from the ratio of the infrared\nto the bolometric luminosities of the source as $f_c=L_{\\rm torus}/L_{\\rm\nBol}$. However, the uncertainty in determining $L_{\\rm Bol}$ has made the\nestimation of covering factors by this technique difficult, especially for AGN\nin the local Universe where the peak of the observed SEDs lies in the UV\n(ultraviolet). Here, we determine the covering factors of an X-ray/optically\nselected sample of 51 type~1 AGN. The bolometric luminosities of these sources\nare derived using a self-consistent, energy-conserving model that estimates the\ncontribution in the unobservable far-UV region, using multi-frequency data\nobtained from SDSS, \\textit{XMM-Newton}, \\textit{WISE}, 2MASS and UKIDSS.

This points\nto large-scale torus geometry changes associated with the Eddington-dependent\naccretion flow, rather than a receding torus, with its inner sublimation radius\ndetermined solely by heating from the central source. Furthermore, we do not\nsee any significant change in the distribution of $f_c$ for sub-samples of\nradio-loud sources or Narrow Line Seyfert~1 galaxies (NLS1s), though these\nsub-samples are small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2016 07:11:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2017 06:22:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

Variations of both X-ray components are caused by\nfluctuations in mass accretion rate, but there is a delay between them\ncorresponding to the propagation timescale from the disk Comptonization radius\nto the region of synchrotron Comptonization.

By gathering\nseveral types of expertise, from applied mathematics to physical chemistry,\ndialog is made possible, as a step towards new and more adapted theoretical\nframeworks, capable of meeting the theoretical, methodological and numerical\nchallenges of kinetics-dominated gas phase chemistry in astrophysical\nenvironments.\n  A state of the art panorama is presented, alongside present-day strengths and\nshortcomings. However, coverage is not complete, being limited in this report\nto actual attendance of the workshop.

It also\ncharacterises the moduli space of line bundles with connection that arise in\nthis way. This theorem was extended to the case of p-forms by Gajer in [Ga]. In\nthis paper we provide a generalization of this theorem where we replace the\noriginal manifold by a derived smooth Artin stack. Our derived Artin stacks are\ngeometric stacks on the \\'etale (\\infty,1)-site of affine derived smooth\nmanifolds. We introduce the notion of a n-shifted p-preplectic derived smooth\nArtin stack in analogy with the algebraic case constructed by\nPantev-To\\\"en-Vaqui\\'e-Vezzosi in [PTVV]. This is a derived smooth Artin stack\nendowed with a complex closed (p+1)-form which has been cohomologically shifted\nby degree n.

We then show that\nwhen its n-shifted p-preplectic form is integral, then there exists a\n(p+n-1)-gerbe with p-connection data and curvature corresponding to the\noriginal p-preplectic form.

Coverage problem in sensor network ensures quality of monitoring a\ngiven region. Depending on applications different measures of coverage are\nthere. Barrier coverage is a type of coverage, which ensures all paths that\ncross the boundary of a region intersect at least one sensor's sensing region.\nThe goal of the sensors is to detect intruders as they cross the boundary or as\nthey penetrate a protected area. The sensors are dependent on their battery\nlife. Restoring barrier coverage on sensor failure using mobile sensors with\nminimum total displacement is the primary objective of this paper. A\ncentralized barrier coverage restoring scheme is proposed to increase the\nrobustness of the network. We formulate restoring barrier coverage as bipartite\nmatching problem. A distributed restoring of barrier coverage algorithm is also\nproposed, which restores it by first finding existing alternate barrier. If\nalternate barrier is not found, an alternate barrier is reconstructed by\nshifting existing sensors in a cascaded manner.

To examine such corrections, we employ the\nformalism of Sen's Quantum Entropy Function where the complete quantum entropy\nof a supersymmetric black hole in theories of supergravity is defined as a\npath-integral in the near-horizon region of the black hole. Evaluation of this\npath-integral can then be conducted exactly using localization computation\ntechniques.

A network is formally defined and derived for seed\ndispersion model of aforementioned species where vertices represent habitat\npatches which are connected by an edge if the distance between the patches is\nless than a threshold distance. We define centrality of a network and\ncomputationally identify the habitat patches that are central to the process of\nseed dispersion to occur across the network. We find that the network of\nhabitat patches is a scale free network and at the same time it also displays\nsmall world property characterized by high clustering and low average shortest\npath length. Due to high clustering, the spread of species is locally even as\nseed disperse mutually among the member vertices of a cluster. Also since every\nvertex is only a short number of steps away from every other vertex, the\nspecies rapidly covers all the habitat patches in the component. Also due to\npresence of hubs in the network the spread of species is greatly boosted\nwhenever the species establish and thrive in a hub patch and disperse to\nadjacent patches. However, the network is not modular due to geographical\nconstraints, and is is negatively assortative as the high degree vertices are\nconnected to vertices of low degree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2016 10:19:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

Diffusion and hence the ionic conductivity is studied by\ncalculating the activation barrier, $V_{act}$, experienced by the diffusing\n$Li^{+}$ ion.

Atomically localized $d$ states of HVE dopants lie above the\nFermi energy and that of LVE lie below it.

Web structured data is usually associated\nwith entities or objects in a particular domain. In this paper, we aim to map\nattributes of an entity in a given domain to pre-specified classes of\nattributes in the same domain based on their values. To perform this task, we\npropose a hybrid deep learning network that relies on the format of the\nattributes' values. It does so without any pre-processing or using pre-defined\nhand-crafted features. The hybrid network combines sequence-based neural\nnetworks, namely convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNN), to learn the sequence structure of attributes' values. The CNN\ncaptures short-distance dependencies in these sequences through a sliding\nwindow approach, and the RNN captures long-distance dependencies by storing\ninformation of previous characters. These networks create different vector\nrepresentations of the input sequence which are combined using a pooling layer.\nThis layer applies a specific operation on these vectors in order to capture\ntheir most useful patterns for the task. Finally, on top of the pooling layer,\na softmax function predicts the label of a given attribute value. We evaluate\nour strategy in four different web domains. The results show that the pooling\nnetwork outperforms previous approaches, which use some kind of input\npre-processing, in all domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2016 11:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

Independent observations were obtained with the SOT/SP\nonboard the Hinode spacecraft and with the TIP-2 mounted at the VTT. We apply\nstate-of-the-art inversion techniques to both data sets to retrieve the\nmagnetic field and the corresponding vertical gradient. In the sunspot\npenumbrae we detected patches of negative vertical gradients of the magnetic\nfield strength, i.e.,the magnetic field strength decreases with optical depth\nin the photosphere. The negative gradient patches are located in the inner and\npartly in the middle penumbrae in both data sets. From the SOT/SP observations,\nwe found that the negative gradient patches are restricted mainly to the deep\nphotospheric layers and are concentrated near the edges of the penumbral\nfilaments. MHD simulations also show negative gradients in the inner penumbrae,\nalso at the locations of filaments. Both in the observations and simulation\nnegative gradients of the magnetic field vs. optical depth dominate at some\nradial distances in the penumbra. The negative gradient with respect to optical\ndepth in the inner penumbrae persists even after averaging in the azimuthal\ndirection, both in the observations and, to a lesser extent, also in MHD\nsimulations. We interpret the observed localized presence of the negative\nvertical gradient of the magnetic field strength in the observations as a\nconsequence of stronger field from spines expanding with height and closing\nabove the weaker field inter-spines. The presence of the negative gradients\nwith respect to optical depth after azimuthal averaging can be explained by two\ndifferent mechanisms: the high corrugation of equal optical depth surfaces and\nthe cancellation of polarized signal due to the presence of unresolved opposite\npolarity patches in the deeper layers of the penumbra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2016 11:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

Firstly, the\ndiatomic carbon C(2) is the most abundant sputtered species for Cs+ in the\nenergy range 0.2 keV to 2.0 keV. Secondly, monatomic carbon C(1) is emitted\nwith the least sputtering yield. Thirdly, at low cesium energies i the emitted\nspecies are C(2), C(3) and C(4). Lastly, as the irradiating Cs+ energy\nincreases, the normalized yield of atomic carbon monotonically increases while\nclusters show gradual decrease and saturation.

Previous studies have shown that, while DM models can\nreproduce the spectral properties of the radio halo in the Coma cluster, they\nfail in reproducing the shape of the radio halo surface brightness because they\nproduce a shape that is too concentrated towards the center of the cluster with\nrespect to the observed one. However, in previous studies the DM distribution\nwas modeled as a single spherically symmetric halo, while the DM distribution\nin Coma is found to have a complex and elongated shape. In this work we\ncalculate a range of non-thermal emissions in the Coma cluster by using the\nobserved distribution of DM sub-halos. We find that, by including the observed\nsub-halos in the DM model, we obtain a radio surface brightness with a shape\nsimilar to the observed one, and that the sub-halos boost the radio emission by\na factor between 5 and 20%, thus allowing to reduce the gap between the\nannihilation cross section required to reproduce the radio halo flux and the\nupper limits derived from other observations, and that this gap can be\nexplained by realistic values of the boosting factor due to smaller\nsubstructures. Models with neutralino mass of 9 GeV and composition $\\tau^+\n\\tau^-$, and mass of 43 GeV and composition $b \\bar b$ can fit the radio halo\nspectrum using the observed properties of the magnetic field in Coma, and do\nnot predict a gamma-ray emission in excess compared to the recent Fermi-LAT\nupper limits. These findings make these DM models viable candidate to explain\nthe origin of radio halos in galaxy clusters.

The linear stability analysis\nshows that the stability of the state, determined by the smallest nonzero\neigenvalue, is inversely proportional to the size of the network. The nonlinear\nstability, which we calculated by comparing the potential energy of the type-1\nsaddles with that of the stable synchronous state, depends on the network size\n($N$) in a more complicated fashion. In particular we find that when the\ngenerators and consumers are evenly distributed in an alternating way, the\nenergy barrier, preventing loss of synchronization approaches a constant value.\nFor a heterogeneous distribution of generators and consumers, the energy\nbarrier will decrease with $N$. The more heterogeneous the distribution is, the\nstronger the energy barrier depends on $N$.

We found that it undergoes kind of pulsations as it clearly presents\nrhythmic contraction and expansion patterns with a 2318 yr period together with\na number of already known faster oscillations associated to the planetary\norbital stable resonances. We found that a fast expansion of the Sun-PMC orbit\nfollowed by a slow contraction appears to prevent cosmic rays to enter within\nthe system inner region while a slow expansion followed by a fast contraction\nfavors it. Similarly, the same dynamics could modulate the amount of\ninterplanetary/cosmic dust falling on Earth. These would then cause both the\nradionucleotide production and climate change by means of a cloud/albedo\nmodulation. Other stable orbital resonance frequencies (e.g. at periods of 20\nyr, 45 yr, 60 yr, 85 yr, 159-171-185 yr, etc.) are found in radionucleotide,\nsolar, aurora and climate records, as determined in the scientific literature.\nThus, the result supports a planetary theory of solar and/or climate variation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2016 08:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}
