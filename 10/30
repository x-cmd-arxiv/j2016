While the presence of energy gaps\nbetween the ground and excited states suppresses such excitations, error\ncorrection techniques are required to ensure full scalability of quantum\nannealing. Quantum annealing correction (QAC) is a method that aims to improve\nthe performance of quantum annealers when control over only the problem (final)\nHamiltonian is possible, along with decoding. Building on our earlier work [S.\nMatsuura et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 220501 (2016)], we study QAC using\nanalytical tools of statistical physics by considering the effects of\ntemperature and a transverse field on the penalty qubits in the ferromagnetic\n$p$-body infinite-range transverse-field Ising model. We analyze the effect of\nQAC on second ($p=2$) and first ($p\\geq 3$) order phase transitions, and\nconstruct the phase diagram as a function of temperature and penalty strength.\nOur analysis reveals that for sufficiently low temperatures and in the absence\nof a transverse field on the penalty qubit, QAC breaks up a single, large free\nenergy barrier into multiple smaller ones. We find theoretical evidence for an\noptimal penalty strength in the case of a transverse field on the penalty\nqubit, a feature observed in QAC experiments. Our results provide further\ncompelling evidence that QAC provides an advantage over unencoded quantum\nannealing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2016 16:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-09"}

While great achievements have been made in identifying key\nfeatures to characterize programs, choosing a correct set of features for a\nspecific compiler task remains an ad hoc procedure. In order to guarantee a\ncomprehensive coverage of features, compiler engineers usually need to select\nexcessive number of features. This, unfortunately, would potentially lead to a\nselection of multiple similar features, which in turn could create a new\nproblem of bias that emphasizes certain aspects of a program's characteristics,\nhence reducing the accuracy and performance of the target compiler task. In\nthis paper, we propose FEAture Selection for compilation Tasks (FEAST), an\nefficient and automated framework for determining the most relevant and\nrepresentative features from a feature pool. Specifically, FEAST utilizes\nwidely used statistics and machine-learning tools, including LASSO, sequential\nforward and backward selection, for automatic feature selection, and can in\ngeneral be applied to any numerical feature set. This paper further proposes an\nautomated approach to compiler parameter assignment for assessing the\nperformance of FEAST. Intensive experimental results demonstrate that, under\nthe compiler parameter assignment task, FEAST can achieve comparable results\nwith about 18% of features that are automatically selected from the entire\nfeature pool.

A beam of low energy (<1.25eV) positrons was used to\ndeposit positrons onto the surface of samples consisting of single layer\ngraphene, multi-layer graphene and graphite. The distribution of electrons\nemitted from the samples as a result of the annihilation of the positron showed\npeak extending up to ~12 eV with a maximum at ~4eV. The observed peak was ~17\ntimes larger than the previously observed annihilation induced C KVV peak. An\nanalysis based upon a density functional theory calculation of the positron\nannihilation rates indicates that the width and intensity of the peak is\nconsistent with electron emission resulting from VVV Auger transition excited\nby the annihilation of valence band electrons. Good agreement was found between\nthe data from the single layer graphene on Cu surface with a theoretical line\nshape found from a self-folding of the density of states for a free standing\ngraphene layer. The agreement between the theoretical and measured intensities\nfor the KVV and VVV transitions indicates that the branching ratio for holes to\ndecay via an Auger transition is nearly the same in both cases (i.e. close to\n100%).

We consider here the rate of growth\nof the classical and fractional enstrophy in the fractional Burgers equation in\nthe subcritical and supercritical regimes. Since solutions to this equation\nexhibit, respectively, globally well-posed behavior and finite-time blow-up in\nthese two regimes, this makes it a useful model to study the maximum\ninstantaneous growth of enstrophy possible in these two distinct situations.\nFirst, we obtain estimates on the rates of growth and then show that these\nestimates are sharp up to numerical prefactors. This is done by numerically\nsolving suitably defined constrained maximization problems and then\ndemonstrating that for different values of the fractional dissipation exponent\nthe obtained maximizers saturate the upper bounds in the estimates as the\nenstrophy increases. We conclude that the power-law dependence of the enstrophy\nrate of growth on the fractional dissipation exponent has the same global form\nin the subcritical, critical and parts of the supercritical regime. This\nindicates that the maximum enstrophy rate of growth changes smoothly as global\nwell-posedness is lost when the fractional dissipation exponent attains\nsupercritical values.

When the\ndoping profile is supersonic, we show that the system does not hold any\nsubsonic solution, furthermore, the system doesn't admit any supersonic\nsolution or any transonic solution if such a supersonic doping profile is small\nor the relaxation time is small, but it has at least one supersonic solution\nand infinitely many transonic solutions if the supersonic doping profile is\nclose to the sonic line and the relaxation time is large.

Nonthermal radiation, such as\nphotoluminescence (PL), is a fundamental light matter interaction that\nconventionally involves the absorption of an energetic photon, thermalization,\nand the emission of a redshifted photon. Until recently, the role of rate\nconservation when thermal excitation is significant, has not been studied in\nany nonthermal radiation. A question: What is the overall emission rate if a\nhigh quantum efficiency (QE), PL material, is heated to a temperature where it\nthermally emits a rate of 50 photons/sec at its bend edge, while in parallel is\nPL excited at a rate of 100 photons/sec. Recently, we discovered that the\nanswer is an overall rate of 100 blueshifted photons/sec. In contrast to\nthermal emission, the PL rate is conserved with temperature increase, while\neach photon is blueshifted. Further rise in temperature leads to an abrupt\ntransition to thermal emission where the photon rate increases sharply. These\nfindings show that PL is an ideal optical heat pump. Here we study, for the\nfirst time, the emission rate of PL radiation at moderate QE where nonradiative\nprocesses dominate the dynamics. Though conservation of photon rate does not\napply, we predict that the emission rate at 100% QE is an upper limit for the\noverall emission rate regardless of the QE. Also, the transition temperature to\nthermal emission is QE independent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2016 07:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-01"}

In 1961 Y. Aharonov and Bohm gave a\ncounterexample, whereas Aharonov, Massar and Popescu [2002] showed that under\ncertain conditions the principle holds.

This intriguingly links precision measurements with quantum algorithms.\nOur theorem is stated in terms of a modified TEUP, which we call the\ncomputational TEUP (cTEUP). In this principle the time duration ($\\Delta t$) is\nreplaced by the number of quantum gates required to perform the measurement,\nand we argue why this is more suitable to study if one is to understand the\ntotality of physical resources required to perform an accurate measurement.

It is crucial to obtain\nrelatively accurate channel state information so that beamforming/combining can\nbe performed to compensate for severe path loss in this band. In contrast to\nlower frequencies, a typical mobile millimeter wave channel consists of a few\ndominant paths. It is generally sufficient to estimate the path gains, angles\nof departure (AoD), and angles of arrival (AoA) of those paths. In this paper,\nmultiple transmit and receive antennas and beamforming with a single baseband\nprocessing chain are assumed. We propose a framework for estimating millimeter\nwave channels with intermittent abrupt changes (e.g., blockage or emergence of\ndominant paths) and slow variations of AoDs and AoAs. The solution consists of\nthree components: tracking of the slow channel variations, detection of abrupt\nchanges, followed by (re-)acquisition of channel (and back to the tracking\nstage). For acquisition, we formulate a least squares problem and find its\nsolution based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. To track slow variations\nof AoDs and AoAs, we propose a new approach using Kalman filtering. Finally, an\nalgorithm based on a likelihood test is devised for detecting abrupt changes.\nSimulation results show that, with moderate signal-to-noise ratios, the\nproposed scheme can achieve more than 8 dB higher estimation accuracy than\nseveral other methods using the same number of pilots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2016 10:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-01"}

This has since been extended to other\nprobability spaces including random permutations. One can similarly define an\n\"MT-distribution\" for these algorithms, that is, the distribution of the\nconfiguration they produce. Haeupler et al.

When $G$ is reductive, we formulate K\\\"ulshammer's question and related\nconjugacy problems in terms of the nonabelian 1-cohomology of unipotent\nradicals of parabolic subgroups of $G$, and we give some applications of this\ncohomological approach. In particular, we analyse the case when $G$ is a\nsemisimple group of rank 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2016 15:38:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 22:41:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 31 Dec 2017 23:34:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

In order to do this we introduce for the first time the counterterms\nthat remove the divergences of the action in dilaton gravity for the solutions\nwith curved boundary. Using the counterterm method, we calculate the conserved\nquantities and the action and therefore Gibbs free energy in both the canonical\nand grand-canonical ensembles. We treat the cosmological constant as a\nthermodynamic pressure, and its conjugate quantity as a thermodynamic volume.\nIn the presence of power-Maxwell field, we find an analogy between the\ntopological dilaton black holes with van der Walls liquid-gas system in all\ndimensions provided the dilaton coupling constant $\\alpha$ and the power\nparameter $p$ are chosen properly. Interestingly enough, we observe that the\npower-Maxwell dilaton black holes admit the phase transition in both canonical\nand grand-canonical ensembles.
