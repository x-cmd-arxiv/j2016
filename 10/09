Most healthcare service\nnetwork models have been constructed from patient claims data, using billing\nclaims to link patients with providers.

While these\nalternate methods have seen increasing use in generating healthcare networks,\nthere is little to no literature comparing the differences in the structural\nproperties of the generated networks. To address this issue, we compared the\nproperties of healthcare networks constructed using different algorithms and\nthe 2013 Medicare Part B outpatient claims data. Three different algorithms\nwere compared: binning, sliding frame, and trace-route. Unipartite networks\nlinking either providers or healthcare organizations by shared patients were\nbuilt using each method. We found that each algorithm produced networks with\nsubstantially different topological properties. Provider networks adhered to a\npower law, and organization networks to a power law with exponential cutoff.\nCensoring networks to exclude edges with less than 11 shared patients, a common\nde-identification practice for healthcare network data, markedly reduced edge\nnumbers and greatly altered measures of vertex prominence such as the\nbetweenness centrality. We identified patterns in the distance patients travel\nbetween network providers, and most strikingly between providers in the\nNortheast United States and Florida.

As a consequence, they can be also better manipulated into the\ndesired shape. For example, they get bunched quite fast in interaction with\nacceleration gratings in presence of an external electromagnetic radiation, a\nphenomenon which can be desirable in development of superradiant coherent light\nsources. Here, I examine the spatiotemporal behavior of pulsed electron wave\npackets at low energies interacting with pulsed light and optical gratings,\nusing a quantum-mechanical self-consistent numerical toolbox which is\nintroduced here. It will be shown that electron pulses are accelerated very\nfast in interaction with the near-field of the grating, demanding that a\nsynchronicity condition is met. To prevent the electrons to be transversely\ndeflected from the grating a symmetric double-grating configuration is\nnecessary. It is found that even in this configuration, diffraction due to the\ninteraction of the electron with the standing-wave light inside the gap between\nthe gratings, is a source of defocusing. Moreover, the longitudinal broadening\nof the electron pulse directly affects the final shape of the electron wave\npacket due to the occurrence of multiple electron-photon scatterings. These\ninvestigations pave the way towards the design of more efficient\nelectron-driven photon sources and accelerators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2016 20:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

These instruments, including CHIME in the sub-meter and HERA in\nthe meter bands, are wide-field arrays with multiple-degree beams, typically\noperating in transit mode. Accurate knowledge of their primary beams is\ncritical for separation of bright foregrounds from the desired cosmological\nsignals, but difficult to achieve through astronomical observations alone.\nPrevious beam calibration work has focused on model verification and does not\naddress the need of 21cm experiments for routine beam mapping, to the horizon,\nof the as-built array. We describe the design and methodology of a\ndrone-mounted calibrator, the External Calibrator for Hydrogen Observatories\n(ECHO), that aims to address this need. We report on a first set of trials to\ncalibrate low-frequency dipoles and compare ECHO measurements to an established\nbeam-mapping system based on transmissions from the Orbcomm satellite\nconstellation. We create beam maps of two dipoles at a 9-degree resolution and\nfind sample noise ranging from 1 to 2%. Assuming this sample noise represents\nthe error in the measurement, the higher end of this range is roughly twice the\ndesired requirement. The overall performance of ECHO suggests that the desired\nprecision and angular coverage is achievable in practice with modest\nimprovements. We identify the main sources of systematic error and uncertainty\nin our measurements and describe the steps needed to overcome them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2016 01:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-11"}

This paper considers the scenario in which the binary is the inner\ncomponent of a hierarchical triple stellar system, and derives the requirements\nthat the tertiary companion must satisfy in order to raise the eccentricity and\nobliquity of the inner binary. Through numerical integrations of the secular\noctupole-order equations of motion of stellar triples, coupled with the spin\nprecession of the oblate primary star due to the torque from the secondary, we\nobtain a simple, robust condition for producing spin-orbit misalignment in the\ninner binary: In order to excite appreciable obliquity, the precession rate of\nthe stellar spin axis must be smaller than the orbital precession rate due to\nthe tertiary companion. This yields quantitative requirements on the mass and\norbit of the tertiary. We also present new analytic expressions for the maximum\neccentricity and range of inclinations allowing eccentricity excitation\n(Lidov-Kozai window), for stellar triples with arbitrary masses and including\nthe non-Keplerian potentials introduced by general relativity, stellar tides\nand rotational bulges.

The Reynolds number (Re) based on the cylinder diameter of\nthe body is 22000. The results show that vortex oscillations exist over the\nforebody at the whole range of AOAs. The oscillation is characterized by\nalternate oscillations of a forebody leeward vortex pair up and down and\nin-phase swings from side to side. The vortex shedding can be found at the\nafterbody as AOAs more than 20o, and the shedding region moves forwards\ngradually with AOAs increasing, and accordingly the region of vortex\noscillations contracts and eventually only exists near the nose as AOAs\nsufficiently high. The vortex oscillation and shedding all induce fluctuating\nside forces along the body, but the ones from vortex oscillations are larger.\nThe frequencies of vortex oscillations are similar to the ones of vortex\nshedding at the AOAs of 10o-40o with St=0.085-0.12, in which the flow fields\nover the afterbody are dominated by vortex shedding and forebody-vortex wakes\ntogether; while at AOAs of 50o-80o, the frequencies along the body are\napparently divided into two regimes in which the vortex oscillations over the\nforebody have the frequencies of 0.053-0.064, and the vortex shedding over the\nafterbody has the frequencies of 0.16-0.2.

An empirical model of sunspot area emergence based on Mercury\nplanet conjunctions was developed and the spectra of the model variation and\nthe sunspot area variation compared. By including solar cycle amplitude\nmodulation and the effect of solar magnetic field reversal the model was able\nto predict fine detail in the sunspot area spectrum. As Mercury planet\nconjunctions occur predictably it was possible to compare the time variation of\nband limited components of sunspot area with the corresponding component\nvariations in the model. When the model component variation was stable\ncorresponding components of sunspot area lagged the model variation by a few\ntens of days. When a 180 degree phase change occurred in the model variation\nthe corresponding component of sunspot area followed the change over an\ninterval of a few hundred days, first by decreasing to zero and then emerging\nin phase with the model variation. Where periodicities in sunspot area did not\nmatch periods of Fourier components of the model the autocorrelation function\nof the model variation provided an indirect numerical link to these\nperiodicities.

However, it was found that with a variable threshold above which the\nmodel variation is effective in triggering sunspots, weak Fourier components at\nthe indirect periods were generated. The model with threshold then encompasses\nall of the significant intermediate range periodicities in sunspot area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2016 06:21:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-11"}

We consider both the case\nwhere opinions have one and two dimensions. We find that our dynamics produces\nthe segregation of agents into two cliques, with the opinions of agents in one\nclique differing from those in the other. Depending on the level of bounded\nconfidence, the dynamics can produce either consensus of opinions within each\nclique or the coexistence of several opinion clusters in a clique. For the\nuni-dimensional case, the opinions in one clique are all below the opinions in\nthe other clique, hence defining a \"left clique\" and a \"right clique\".

A convenient and effective way of breaking the translational\nsymmetry associated to such a conservation law is provided by massive gravity\n(MG) bulk theories. We consider generic massive gravity models embedded into\nasymptotically Anti de Sitter spacetime and we analyze them using holographic\ntechniques. We study in detail their consistency and stability. We then focus\nour attention on the transport properties of the CFT duals. A big part of our\nwork is devoted to the analysis of the electric conductivity in relation to\npossible universal bounds and the existence of holographic metal-insulator\ntransitions. We moreover initiate the study of the viscoelastic response and we\nconsider the possible violation of the well known KSS bound. We finally\ndescribe the effects of momentum relaxation on the well known holographic\nmodels for superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2016 14:29:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 09:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-18"}

Recently, Lyapunov\nexponent spectrum of the chaotic signals after being transmitted through a\nwireless channel has been shown to be unaltered, paving the way for wireless\ncommunication using chaos. In wireless communication systems, inter-symbol\ninterference (ISI) caused by multipath propagation is one of the main obstacles\nto achieve high bit transmission rate and low bit error rate (BER). How to\nresist multipath effect is a fundamental problem in a chaos-based wireless\ncommunication system (CWCS). In this paper, implementation of a CWCS is\npresented. It is built to transmit chaotic signals generated by a hybrid\ndynamical system and then to filter the received signals by using the\ncorresponding matched filter to decrease the noise effect and to detect the\nbinary information. We find that the multipath effect can be effectively\nresisted by regrouping the return map of the received signal and by setting the\ncorresponding threshold based on the available information. We show that the\noptimal threshold is a function of the channel parameters and of the\ntransmitted information symbols. Practically, the channel parameters are\ntime-variant, and the future information symbols are unavailable. In this case,\na suboptimal threshold (SOT) is proposed, and the BER using the SOT is derived\nanalytically.
