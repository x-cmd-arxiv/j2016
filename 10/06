In this respect, contact stability plays a critical role in ensuring\nthat robots maintain balance, and it is a key element for balancing and walking\ncontrollers. The Center of Pressure is a contact stability criterion that\ndefines a point that must be kept strictly inside the support polygon in order\nto ensure postural stability. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the\nsensitivity of the static center of pressure: roughly speaking, the rate of\nchange of the center of pressure with respect to the system equilibrium\nconfigurations. This new concept can be used as an additional criterion to\nassess the robustness of the contact stability. We show how the sensitivity of\nthe center of pressure can also be used as a metric to assess balancing\ncontrollers by considering two state-of-the-art control strategies. The\nanalytical analysis is performed on a simplified model, and validated during\nbalancing tasks on the iCub humanoid robot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 16:02:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 May 2017 07:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-30"}

Differently from standard\ntrajectory tracking, maneuver regulation has an intrinsic robustness due to the\nfact that the vehicle is not required to chase a virtual target, but just to\nstay on a (properly designed) desired path with a given velocity profile. In\nthis paper we show how a robust maneuver regulation controller can be easily\ndesigned by converting an existing tracking scheme. The resulting maneuvering\ncontroller has three main appealing features, namely it: (i) inherits the\nrobustness properties of the tracking controller, (ii) gains the appealing\nfeatures of maneuver regulation, and (iii) does not need any additional tuning\nwith respect to the tracking controller. We prove the correctness of the\nproposed scheme and show its effectiveness in experiments on a nano-quadrotor.\nIn particular, we show on a nontrivial maneuver how external disturbances\nacting on the quadrotor cause instabilities in the standard tracking, while\nmarginally affect the maneuver regulation scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 16:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-06"}

We provide a framework\nfor obtaining lower bounds on this quantity based on counting comparable pairs\nrelative to a random chain and apply this framework to obtain supersaturation\nresults for three classical posets: the boolean lattice, the collection of\nsubspaces of $\\mathbb{F}_q^n$ ordered by set inclusion and the set of divisors\nof the square of a square-free integer under the 'divides' relation. The bound\nthat we obtain for the boolean lattice can be viewed as an approximate version\nof a known theorem of Kleitman.\n  In addition, we apply our supersaturation results to obtain (a) upper bounds\non the number of antichains in these posets and (b) asymptotic bounds on the\ncardinality of the largest antichain in $p$-random subsets of these posets\nwhich hold with high probability (for $p$ in a certain range).

It is therefore\nnecessary to quantify the limits within which the scaling laws would remain\napplicable for magnetocaloric research. For this purpose, a threefold approach\nhas been followed: a) the magnetocaloric responses of a set of materials with\nCurie temperatures ranging from 46 to 336 K have been modeled with a mean-field\nBrillouin model, b) experimental data for Gd has been analyzed, and c) a\n3D-Ising model ---which is beyond the mean-field approximation--- has been\nstudied.

In this range, the\npredicted deviations from scaling laws remain below the experimental error\nmargin of carefully performed experiments.

We obtain new and improved bounds for two special cases, one in which\nthe points lie on some algebraic variety of constant degree, and one involving\nincidences between pairs in $P_1\\times P_2$, where $P_1$ is contained in a\nvariety and $P_2$ is arbitrary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 18:34:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 13:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-01"}

Of these, the powerful and beamed jets of Flat Spectrum Radio\nQuasars are particularly interesting, as the X-ray emission cannot be explained\nby an extrapolation of the lower frequency synchrotron spectrum. Instead, the\nmost common model invokes inverse Compton scattering of photons of the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (EC/CMB) as the mechanism responsible for the high energy\nemission. The EC/CMB model has recently come under criticism, particularly\nbecause it should predict a significant steady flux in the MeV-GeV band which\nhas not been detected by the Fermi/LAT telescope for two of the best studied\njets (PKS 0637-752 and 3C273). In this work we revisit some aspects of the\nEC/CMB model and show that electron cooling plays an important part in shaping\nthe spectrum. This can solve the overproduction of gamma-rays by suppressing\nthe high energy end of the emitting particle population. Furthermore, we show\nthat cooling in the EC/CMB model predicts a new class of extended jets that are\nbright in X-rays but silent in the radio and optical bands. These jets are more\nlikely to lie at intermediate redshifts, and would have been missed in all\nprevious X-ray surveys due to selection effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 19:35:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2016 10:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

It has the peculiar feature of dramatically amplifying small\nperturbations, and rather than driving the system to equilibrium it instead\nleads to slowly evolving configurations known as quasi-stationary states that\nfall outside the standard paradigm of statistical mechanics. Violent relaxation\nwas originally identified in gravity-driven stellar dynamics; here we extend\nthe theory into the quantum regime by developing a quantum version of the\nHamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model which exemplifies many of the generic\nproperties of long-range interacting systems. The HMF model can either be\nviewed as describing particles interacting via a cosine potential, or\nequivalently as the kinetic XY-model with infinite range interactions, and its\nquantum fluid dynamics can be obtained from a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation. We show that singular caustics that form during violent relaxation\nare regulated by interference effects in a universal way described by Thom's\ncatastrophe theory applied to waves and this leads to emergent length and time\nscales not present in the classical problem. In the deep quantum regime we find\nthat violent relaxation is suppressed altogether by quantum zero-point motion.\nOur results are relevant to laboratory studies of self-organization in cold\natomic gases with long-range interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 19:37:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 17:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-18"}

We find that the resulting susceptibility increases significantly close\nto the phase transition point. In this regime, which is inaccessible to current\nnumerical studies, we also find a strong dependence on interactions. Our work\nprovides a basis for systematic studies of MBL in open systems and opens a\nroute towards extrapolation of closed system properties from experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 20:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

The\nfields were centered on a pair of emission peaks that correspond to the same\nejection event, and were observed in CO(2-1), SiO(5-4), and SO(65-54).\n  $ Results.$ Both ALMA fields present spatial distributions that are\napproximately elliptical and have their minor axes aligned with the jet\ndirection. As the velocity increases, the emission in each field moves\ngradually across the elliptical region. This systematic pattern indicates that\nthe emitting gas in each field lies in a disk-like structure that is\nperpendicular to the jet axis and is expanding away from the jet. A small\ndegree of curvature in the first-moment maps indicates that the disks are\nslightly curved in the manner expected for bow shocks moving away from the IRAS\nsource.

However, the faint side of the QLF at high redshifts is still too\nuncertain. An accurate estimate of the survey completeness is essential to\nderive an accurate QLF for use in studying the luminosity-dependent density\nevolution of the quasar population. Here we investigate how the luminosity\ndependence of quasar spectra (the Baldwin effect) and the attenuation model for\nthe inter-galactic medium (IGM) affect the completeness estimates. For this\npurpose, we revisit the completeness of quasar surveys specifically at\n$z\\sim4-5$, using the COSMOS images observed with Subaru/Suprime-Cam. As the\nresult, we find that the completeness estimates are sensitive to the luminosity\ndependence of the quasar spectrum and difference in the IGM attenuation models.\nAt $z\\sim4$, the number density of quasars when we adopt the latest IGM model\nand take the luminosity dependence of spectra into account are\n$(3.49\\pm1.62)\\times10^{-7}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ mag$^{-1}$ for $-24.09<M_{1450}<-23.09$\nand $(5.24\\pm2.13)\\times10^{-7}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ mag$^{-1}$ for\n$-23.09<M_{1450}<-22.09$, respectively, which are $\\sim$$24$$\\%$ lower than\nthat estimated by the conventional method.

The discovery of coherent X-ray\npulsations from PSR J1023+0038 (while in the LMXB state) provides us with the\nfirst opportunity to perform timing observations and to compare the neutron\nstar's spin variation during this state to the measured spin-down in the RMSP\nstate.

We focus our approach on the scalings of\nits geometrical fluctuations as a function of its length. At large\nlengthscales, the roughness of the interface, defined as the variance of its\nendpoint fluctuations, follows a power-law behaviour whose exponent\ncharacterises its superdiffusive behaviour. In 1+1 dimensions, the roughness\nexponent is known to be the characteristic 2/3 exponent of the\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. An important feature of the model\ndescription is that its Flory exponent, obtained by a power counting argument\non its Hamiltonian, is equal to 3/5 and thus does not yield the correct KPZ\nroughness exponent. In this work, we review the available power-counting\noptions, and relate the physical validity of the exponent values that they\npredict, to the existence (or not) of well-defined optimal trajectories in a\nlarge-size or low-temperature asymptotics. We identify the crucial role of the\n'cut-off' lengths of the problem (the disorder correlation length and the\nsystem size), which one has to carefully follow throughout the scaling\nanalysis. To complement the latter, we device a novel Gaussian Variational\nMethod (GVM) scheme to compute the roughness, taking into account the effect of\na large but finite interface length. Interestingly, such a procedure yields the\ncorrect KPZ roughness exponent, instead of the Flory exponent usually obtained\nthrough the GVM approach for an infinite interface. We explain the physical\norigin of this improvement of the GVM procedure and discuss possible extensions\nof this work to other disordered systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 20:16:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 08:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

We interpret this\nfinding in the context of observations from our multiwavelength campaign, which\nrevealed the presence of weak narrow nebular emission features from the\nhost-galaxy nucleus and clear differences with respect to superluminous\nsupernova optical spectra. Significant UV flux variability on short time-scales\ndetected at the time of the re-brightening disfavors the shock interaction\nscenario as the source of energy powering the long-lived UV emission, while\ndeep radio limits exclude the presence of relativistic jets propagating into a\nlow-density environment. We propose a model where the extreme luminosity and\ndouble-peaked temporal structure of ASASSN-15lh is powered by a central source\nof ionizing radiation that produces a sudden change of the ejecta opacity at\nlater times. As a result, UV radiation can more easily escape, producing the\nsecond bump in the light-curve. We discuss different interpretations for the\nintrinsic nature of the ionizing source. We conclude that, IF the X-ray source\nis physically associated with the optical-UV transient, ASASSN-15lh most likely\nrepresents the tidal disruption of a main-sequence star by the most massive\nspinning black hole detected to date. In this case, ASASSN-15lh and similar\nevents discovered in the future would constitute the most direct probes of very\nmassive, dormant, spinning, supermassive black holes in galaxies.

Similar to microrheology for equilibrium complex fluids, the unusual\nenhanced particle dynamics reveal intrinsic properties of active fluids.\nNevertheless, previous studies have shown that the translational dynamics of\nspherical tracers are qualitatively similar, independent of whether active\nparticles are pushers or pullers---the two fundamental classes of active\nfluids. Is it possible to distinguish pushers from pullers by simply imaging\nthe dynamics of passive tracers? Here, we investigated the diffusion of\nisolated ellipsoids in algal C. reinhardtii suspensions---a model for\npuller-type active fluids. In combination with our previous results on\npusher-type E. coli suspensions [Peng et al., Phys. Rev.

An ellipsoid diffuses fastest along its major\naxis when immersed in pullers, whereas it diffuses slowest along the major axis\nin pushers. This striking difference can be qualitatively explained using a\nsimple hydrodynamic model. In addition, our study on algal suspensions reveals\nthat the influence of the near-field advection of algal swimming flows on the\ntranslation and rotation of ellipsoids shows different ranges and strengths.\nOur work provides not only new insights into universal organizing principles of\nactive fluids, but also a convenient tool for detecting the class of active\nparticles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 20:47:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

Contrary to this expected behaviour, we have discovered pronounced\nemission traces in bulk, germanium-doped GaN up to 100 K, mimicking excitonic\nbehaviour at high free electron concentrations from 3.4E19/cm3 to 8.9E19/cm3.\nConsequently, we show that a degenerate, three-dimensional electron gas\nstabilizes a novel class of quasiparticles, named collexons, by many-particle\neffects dominated by exchange of electrons with the Fermi gas. The observation\nof collexons and their stabilisation with rising doping concentration, is\nfacilitated by a superior crystal quality due to perfect substitution of the\nhost atom with the dopant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 22:25:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

Therefore,\nstudying the Pluto hazes can shed light on the similarities and differences\nbetween the Pluto and Titan atmospheres. We model the haze distribution using\nthe Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres assuming that the\ndistribution is shaped by sedimentation and coagulation of particles\noriginating from photochemistry. Hazes composed of both purely spherical and\npurely fractal aggregate particles are considered. Agreement between model\nresults and occultation observations is obtained with aggregate particles when\nthe downward flux of photochemical products is equal to the column-integrated\nmethane destruction rate ~1.2 $\\times$ 10$^{-14}$ g cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, while\nfor spherical particles the mass flux must be 2-3 times greater. This flux is\nnearly identical to the haze production flux of Titan previously obtained by\ncomparing microphysical model results to Cassini observations. The aggregate\nparticle radius is sensitive to particle charging, and a particle charge to\nradius ratio of 30 e-/{\\mu}m is necessary to produce ~0.1-0.2 {\\mu}m aggregates\nnear Pluto's surface, in accordance with forward scattering measurements.

The largest coherent structure in\neta Car's outer ejecta can be described as a bent cylinder with roughly the\nsame symmetry axis as the Homunculus nebula.

In this paper, we study the low-tubal-rank tensor\ncompletion problem, i.e., to recover a third-order tensor by observing a subset\nof its elements selected uniformly at random. We propose a fast iterative\nalgorithm, called {\\em Tubal-Alt-Min}, that is inspired by a similar approach\nfor low-rank matrix completion. The unknown low-tubal-rank tensor is\nrepresented as the product of two much smaller tensors with the low-tubal-rank\nproperty being automatically incorporated, and Tubal-Alt-Min alternates between\nestimating those two tensors using tensor least squares minimization. First, we\nnote that tensor least squares minimization is different from its matrix\ncounterpart and nontrivial as the circular convolution operator of the\nlow-tubal-rank tensor model is intertwined with the sub-sampling operator.\nSecond, the theoretical performance guarantee is challenging since\nTubal-Alt-Min is iterative and nonconvex in nature. We prove that 1)\nTubal-Alt-Min guarantees exponential convergence to the global optima, and 2)\nfor an $n \\times n \\times k$ tensor with tubal-rank $r \\ll n$, the required\nsampling complexity is $O(nr^2k \\log^3 n)$ and the computational complexity is\n$O(n^2rk^2 \\log^2 n)$.

As an application of anisotropic Babinet-invertible metasurfaces, we\nexperimentally realize a reconfigurable terahertz polarizer whose transmitting\naxis can be dynamically rotated by $90^\\circ$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 01:31:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 07:03:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2016 01:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

In this paper,\nwe propose a novel computational saliency model, i.e., deep spatial contextual\nlong-term recurrent convolutional network (DSCLRCN) to predict where people\nlooks in natural scenes. DSCLRCN first automatically learns saliency related\nlocal features on each image location in parallel. Then, in contrast with most\nother deep network based saliency models which infer saliency in local\ncontexts, DSCLRCN can mimic the cortical lateral inhibition mechanisms in human\nvisual system to incorporate global contexts to assess the saliency of each\nimage location by leveraging the deep spatial long short-term memory (DSLSTM)\nmodel. Moreover, we also integrate scene context modulation in DSLSTM for\nsaliency inference, leading to a novel deep spatial contextual LSTM (DSCLSTM)\nmodel. The whole network can be trained end-to-end and works efficiently when\ntesting. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that DSCLRCN can\nachieve state-of-the-art performance on saliency detection. Furthermore, the\nproposed DSCLSTM model can significantly boost the saliency detection\nperformance by incorporating both global spatial interconnections and scene\ncontext modulation, which may uncover novel inspirations for studies on them in\ncomputational saliency models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 01:38:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-07"}

We believe that HPC applications should be enabled with\ncapabilities to actively search for and correct errors in their computations.\nThe redundant multithreading (RMT) approach offers lightweight replicated\nexecution streams of program instructions within the context of a single\napplication process.

Our\napproach enables application programmers to scope the extent of redundant\ncomputation. Additionally, the runtime system permits the use of RMT to be\ndynamically enabled, or disabled, based on the resiliency needs of the\napplication and the state of the system.

Learning-based exploration methods, including convolutional neural\nnetworks, provide excellent strategies without human-designed logic for the\nfeature extraction. But the conventional supervised learning algorithms cost\nlots of efforts on the labeling work of datasets inevitably. Scenes not\nincluded in the training set are mostly unrecognized either. We propose a deep\nreinforcement learning method for the exploration of mobile robots in an indoor\nenvironment with the depth information from an RGB-D sensor only.

In arbitrarily constructed simulation\nenvironments, we show that the robot can be quickly adapted to unfamiliar\nscenes without any man-made labeling.

There are no disputes about this statement. On the other hand,\nthere still is a question of why the statement did not mention Wigner's 1939\npaper on the Lorentz group, which was regarded by Wigner and many others as his\nmost important contribution in physics. By many physicists, this paper was\nregarded as a mathematical exposition having nothing to do with physics.\nHowever, it has been more than one half century since 1963, and it is of\ninterest to see what progress has been made toward understanding physical\nimplications of this paper and its historical role in physics. Wigner in his\n1963 paper defined the subgroups of the Lorentz group whose transformations do\nnot change the four-momentum of a given particle, and he called them the little\ngroups. Thus, Wigner's little groups are for internal space-time symmetries of\nparticles in the Lorentz-covariant world. Indeed, this subgroup can explain the\nelectron spin and spins of other massive particles. However, for massless\nparticles, there was a gap between his little group and electromagnetic waves\nderivable Maxwell's equations. This gap was not completely removed until 1990.\nThe purpose of this report is to review the stormy historical process in which\nthis gap is cleared. It is concluded that Wigner's little groups indeed can be\ncombined into one Lorentz-covariant formula which can dictate the symmetry of\nthe internal space-time time symmetries of massive and massless particles in\nthe Lorentz covariant world, just like Einstein's energy-momentum relation\napplicable to both slow and massless particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 05:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-07"}

This assumption however fails to model the behavior of\nnon-Gaussian noises found in practice. Motivated by the robustness and\nsimplicity of maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) in non-Gaussian impulsive\nnoises, this paper proposes a new adaptive filtering algorithm called\nconstrained maximum correntropy criterion (CMCC).

The proposed adaptive filtering algorithm is\neasy to implement and has low computational complexity, and in terms of\nconvergence accuracy (say lower mean square deviation) and stability, can\nsignificantly outperform those MSE based constrained adaptive algorithms in\npresence of heavy-tailed impulsive noises. Additionally, the mean square\nconvergence behaviors are studied under energy conservation relation, and a\nsufficient condition to ensure the mean square convergence and the steady-state\nmean square deviation (MSD) of the proposed algorithm are obtained.

A popular mechanism deployed on civic\ncrowdfunding platforms is a provision point mechanism, wherein, the total\ncontributions must reach a predetermined threshold in order for the project to\nbe provisioned (undertaken). Such a mechanism may have multiple equilibria;\nunfortunately, in many of these equilibria, the project is not funded even if\nit is highly valued among the agents. Recent work has proposed mechanisms with\nrefund bonuses where the project gets funded in equilibrium if its net value is\nhigher than a threshold among the agents who are aware of the crowdfunding\neffort. In this paper, we formalize the notion of social desirability of a\npublic project and propose mechanisms which use the idea of referrals to expand\nthe pool of participants and achieve an equilibrium in which the project gets\nfunded if its net value exceeds a threshold among the entire agent population.\nWe call this new class of mechanisms Referral-Embedded Provision Point\nMechanisms (REPPM).

By referring others to contribute, an agent can, in fact, reduce his\nequilibrium contribution. In our view, the proposed mechanisms will lead to an\nincrease in the number of projects that are funded on civic crowdfunding\nplatforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 08:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-07"}

We apply our method to ALMA archival data of DCN (3-2), DCO+\n(3-2), N2D+ (3-2), and H2CO (3_0,3-2_0,2), (3_2,2-2_2,1), and (3_2,1-2_2,0) in\nthe protoplanetary disk around HD 163296. As a result, (1) the S/N of the\noriginally detected DCN (3-2), DCO+ (3-2), and H2CO (3_0,3-2_0,2) and N2D+\n(3-2) lines are boosted by a factor of >4-5 at their spectral peaks, implying\none order of magnitude shorter integration times to reach the original S/N; and\n(2) the previously undetectable spectra of the H2CO (3_2,2-2_2,1) and\n(3_2,1-2_2,0) lines are materialized at more than 3 sigma. These dramatically\nenhanced S/N allow us to measure intensity distributions in all lines with high\nsignificance. The principle of our method can not only be applied to Keplerian\ndisks but also to any systems with ordered kinematic patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 08:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

The orbital physics in both\nsystems is found to be surprisingly similar, given the fundamental difference\nin the local symmetry. In both systems the Cu p and d contributions at the\nFermi level are very similar. Based on the knowledge of orbital effects we\nidentify that the main cause of the locally induced spin-orbit couplings are Cu\np and d orbitals. By employing the DFT+U formalism as an analysis tool we find\nthat both the p and d orbital contributions are equally important to spin-orbit\ncoupling, although p contributions to the density of states are much higher. We\nfit the DFT data with phenomenological tight-binding models developed\nseparately for the top and bridge positions. Our model Hamiltonians describe\nthe low-energy electronic band structure in the whole Brillouin zone and allow\nus to extract the size of the spin-orbit interaction induced by the local Cu\nadatom to be in the tens of meV. By application of the phenomenological models\nto Green's function techniques, we find that copper atoms act as resonant\nimpurities in graphene with large lifetimes of 50 and 100~fs for top and\nbridge, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 09:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

Here, we propose a\nnovel, process-based, two-phase, erosion-deposition model capable of adequately\ndescribing these complex phenomena commonly observed in landslides, avalanches,\ndebris flows and bedload transport. The model is based on the jump in the\nmomentum flux including changes of material and flow properties along the\nflow-bed interface and enhances an existing general two-phase mass flow model\n(Pudasaini, 2012). A two-phase variably saturated erodible basal morphology is\nintroduced and allows for the evolution of erosion-deposition-depths,\nincorporating the inherent physical process including momentum and rheological\nchanges of the flowing mixture. By rigorous derivation, we show that\nappropriate incorporation of the mass and momentum productions or losses in\nconservative model formulation is essential for the physically correct and\nmathematically consistent description of erosion-entrainment-deposition\nprocesses. We show that mechanically deposition is the reversed process of\nerosion. We derive mechanically consistent closures for coefficients emerging\nin the erosion rate models. We prove that effectively reduced friction in\nerosion is equivalent to the momentum production. With this, we solve the long\nstanding dilemma of mass mobility, and show that erosion enhances the mass flow\nmobility. The novel enhanced real two-phase model reveals some major aspects of\nthe mechanics associated with erosion, entrainment and deposition. The model\nappropriately captures the emergence and propagation of complex frontal surge\ndynamics associated with the frontal ambient-drag with erosion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 10:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-17"}

Big\ndata contains huge values, however, mining knowledge from big data is a\ntremendously challenging task because of data uncertainty and inconsistency.\nAttribute reduction (also known as feature selection) can not only be used as\nan effective preprocessing step, but also exploits the data redundancy to\nreduce the uncertainty. However, existing solutions are designed 1) either for\na single machine that means the entire data must fit in the main memory and the\nparallelism is limited; 2) or for the Hadoop platform which means that the data\nhave to be loaded into the distributed memory frequently and therefore become\ninefficient. In this paper, we overcome these shortcomings for maximum\nefficiency possible, and propose a unified framework for Parallel Large-scale\nAttribute Reduction, termed PLAR, for big data analysis. PLAR consists of three\ncomponents: 1) Granular Computing (GrC)-based initialization: it converts a\ndecision table (i.e., original data representation) into a granularity\nrepresentation which reduces the amount of space and hence can be easily cached\nin the distributed memory: 2) model-parallelism: it simultaneously evaluates\nall feature candidates and makes attribute reduction highly parallelizable; 3)\ndata-parallelism: it computes the significance of an attribute in parallel\nusing a MapReduce-style manner. We implement PLAR with four representative\nheuristic feature selection algorithms on Spark, and evaluate them on various\nhuge datasets, including UCI and astronomical datasets, finding our method's\nadvantages beyond existing solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 10:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-07"}

Using analytical arguments combined with\ndensity-matrix-renormalization-group (DMRG) and exact diagonalization (ED)\ncalculations, we show that for gapless systems the entanglement distance has\npower law dependence on the energy separation and subsystem size with\n$\\alpha_E$ and $\\alpha_{\\ell}$ exponents, respectively. Using conformal field\ntheory (CFT) we find $\\alpha_E = 2$ and $\\alpha_{\\ell} = 4$ for Abelian\ntheories with $c=1$ such as free fermions. For non-Abelian CFTs $\\alpha_E = 0$\n, and $\\alpha_{\\ell}$ is twice the conformal dimension of the thermal primary\nfields. For instance for $Z_3$ parafermion CFT $\\alpha_E = 1$ and\n$\\alpha_{\\ell} = 4/5$. For gapped 1+1D fermion systems, we show that the\nentanglement distance divides the low energy excitations into two branches with\ndifferent values of $\\alpha_E$ and $\\alpha_{\\ell}$. These two branches are\nrelated to momentum transfers near zero and $\\pi$. We also demonstrate that the\nentanglement distance reaches its maximum for degenerate states related through\nnonlocal operators such as Wilson loops. For example, degenerate ground-states\n(GSs) of 2+1 D topological states have maximum entanglement distance. On the\ncontrary, degenerate GSs related through confined anyon excitations such as\ngenons have minimum entanglement distance. Various implications of this concept\nfor quantum simulations are discussed. Finally, based on the ideas developed we\ndiscuss the computational complexity of DMRG algorithms that are capable of\nfinding all degenerate GSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 11:00:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 21:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

It is assumed that there is a small violation of Lorentz invariance and\nthe true symmetry group of nature is a subgroup called SIM(2). This symmetry\ngroup postulates the existence of a fundamental or preferred direction in\nspace-time. We study its implications by using an effective action which\nviolates Lorentz invariance but respects VSR. We find that the problem of\nfinding the masses of fundamental fermions is in general intractable in the\npresence of VSR term. The problem can be solved only in special cases which we\npursue in this paper. We next determine the signal of VSR in torsion pendulum\nexperiment as well as clock comparison experiment. We find that VSR predicts a\nsignal which is different from other Lorentz violating theories and hence a\ndedicated data analysis is needed in order to impose reliable limits. Assuming\nthat signal is absent in data we determine the limits that can be imposed on\nthe VSR parameters. We also study the implications of VSR in particle decay\nexperiments taking the charged pion and kaon decay as an example. The effective\ninteraction between the charged pion and the final state leptons is related to\nthe fundamental VSR mass terms through a loop calculation. We also predict a\nshift in the angular dependence of the decay products due to VSR. In particular\nwe find that these no longer display azimuthal symmetry with respect to the\nmomentum of the pion. Furthermore the azimuthal and polar angle distributions\nshow time dependence with a period of a sidereal day. This time dependence\nprovides us with a novel method to test VSR in future experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 11:44:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2017 11:19:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 12:08:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

Radiation hardness by design\ntechniques have been developed to mitigate this effect and have been\nsuccessfully used. More recent developments in smaller feature size\ntechnologies do not make use of these techniques due to their drawbacks in\nterms of logic density and requirement of dedicated libraries. During operation\nthe resulting increase of the supply current is a serious challenge and needs\nto be considered during the system design.\n  A simple parametrization of the leakage current of NMOS transistors as a\nfunction of total ionizing dose is presented. The parametrization uses a\ntransistor transfer characteristics of the parasitic transistor along the\nshallow trench isolation to describe the leakage current of the nominal\ntransistor. Together with a parametrization of the number of positive charges\ntrapped in the silicon dioxide and number of activated interface traps in the\nsilicon to silicon dioxide interface the leakage current as a function of the\nexposure time to ionizing radiation results. This function is fitted to data of\nthe leakage current of single transistors as well as to data of the supply\ncurrent of full ASICs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 14:26:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

In addition, the\nmedical text mining poses more challenges, e.g., more unstructured text, the\nfast growing of new terms addition, a wide range of name variation for the same\ndrug. The mining is even more challenging due to the lack of labeled dataset\nsources and external knowledge, as well as multiple token representations for a\nsingle drug name that is more common in the real application setting. Although\nmany approaches have been proposed to overwhelm the task, some problems\nremained with poor F-score performance (less than 0.75).

Roughly speaking, we first choose a\nconsensus set of elections (defined via preferences of voters over candidates)\nfor which the result is specified a priori (intuitively, these are elections on\nwhich all voters can easily agree on the result). We also choose a measure of\ndistance between elections. The result of an election outside the consensus set\nis defined to be the result of the closest consensual election under the\ndistance measure.\n  Most previous work has dealt with a definition in terms of preference\nprofiles. However, most voting rules in common use are anonymous and\nhomogeneous. In this case there is a much more succinct representation (using\nthe voting simplex) of the inputs to the rule. This representation has been\nwidely used in the voting literature, but rarely in the context of distance\nrationalizability.\n  We show exactly how to connect distance rationalizability on profiles for\nanonymous and homogeneous rules to geometry in the simplex. We develop the\nconnection for the important special case of votewise distances, recently\nintroduced and studied by Elkind, Faliszewski and Slinko in several papers.\nThis yields a direct interpretation in terms of well-developed mathematical\nconcepts not seen before in the voting literature, namely Kantorovich (also\ncalled Wasserstein) distances and the geometry of Minkowski spaces.\n  As an application of this approach, we prove some positive and some negative\nresults about the decisiveness of distance rationalizable anonymous and\nhomogeneous rules.

Rev. E\n85, 026208 (2012)], where synchronization in a star network of Stuart-Landau\noscillators was investigated. In the RS regime therein described, the central\nhub served as a transmitter of information between peripheral nodes, while\nmaintaining independent dynamics that were asynchronous with the rest of the\nnetwork. One of the key conclusions of that paper was that RS cannot occur in\npure phase-oscillator networks. Here, we show that the RS regime can exist in\nnetworks of Kuramoto oscillators, and that hub nodes can actively drive remote\nsynchronization even in the presence of a repulsive mean field. We apply this\nmodel to study the synchronization dynamics in complex networks endowed with\nhub-nodes, an ubiquitous feature of many natural networks. We show that a\nchange in the natural frequency of a hub can alone reshape synchronization\npatterns, and switch from direct to remote synchronization, or to hub-driven\ndesynchronization. We discuss the potential role of this phenomenon in\nreal-world networks, including the Karate-club and brain connectivity networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 15:12:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-07"}

Individuals live in colonies and\nchange type via resampling and mutation. Each colony contains a seed-bank that\nacts as a genetic reservoir. Individuals can enter the seed-bank and become\ndormant or can exit the seed-bank and become active. In each colony at each\ngeneration a fixed fraction of individuals swap state, drawn randomly from the\nactive and the dormant population. While dormant, individuals suspend their\nresampling. While active, individuals resample from their own colony, but also\nfrom different colonies according to a random walk transition kernel\nrepresentingmigration. Both active and dormant individuals mutate.\n  We derive a formula for the probability that two individuals drawn randomly\nfrom two given colonies are identical by descent, i.e., share a common\nancestor. This formula, which is formulated in Fourier language, is valid when\nthe colonies form a discrete torus. We consider the special case of a symmetric\nslow seed-bank, for which in each colony half of the individuals are in the\nseed-bank and at each generation the fraction of individuals that swap state is\nsmall. This leads to a simpler formula, from which we are able to deduce how\nthe probability to be identical by descent depends on the distance between the\ntwo colonies and various relevant parameters. Through an analysis of random\nwalk Green functions, we are able to derive explicit scaling expressions when\nmutation is slower than migration. We also compute the spatial second moment of\nthe probability to be identical by descent for all parameters when the torus\nbecomes large. For the special case of a symmetric slow seed-bank, we again\nobtain explicit scaling expressions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 15:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-07"}

These precursor molecules or\npre-miRNAs often fold into stem-loop hairpin structures. However, a large\nnumber of sequences with pre-miRNA-like hairpins can be found in genomes. It is\na challenge to distinguish the real pre-miRNAs from other hairpin sequences\nwith similar stem-loops (referred to as pseudo pre-miRNAs). Several\ncomputational methods have been developed to tackle this challenge. In this\npaper we propose a new method, called MirID, for identifying and classifying\nmicroRNA precursors. We collect 74 features from the sequences and secondary\nstructures of pre-miRNAs; some of these features are taken from our previous\nstudies on non-coding RNA prediction while others were suggested in the\nliterature. We develop a combinatorial feature mining algorithm to identify\nsuitable feature sets. These feature sets are then used to train support vector\nmachines to obtain classification models, based on which classifier ensemble is\nconstructed. Finally we use an AdaBoost algorithm to further enhance the\naccuracy of the classifier ensemble. Experimental results on a variety of\nspecies demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method, and its\nsuperiority over existing tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 04:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-10"}

Results Significant\ndecreases in the masses of body, gastrointestinal tract, stomach and liver of\nthe starved group were recorded. The liver and duodenum were the most affected\norgans. The liver showed depletion of glycogen, vacuolation, hyperemia and\ncellular infiltrations. Duodenal villi showed degenerative changes in lamina\nepithelialis and cellular infiltrations in the lamina propria. Biochemical\nanalysis revealed a decreased level of total protein, AST and ALT, increased\ncholesterol, triglycerides and LDL, and unchanged HDL, urea and creatinine by\nstarvation. Conclusion The current study described in details the effect of\nshort time starvation on quail organs. Time-point adaptive responses of male\nquail to starvation and refeeding on quail organs will be investigated in\nfuture studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 01:59:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-24"}

In this paper, we study the\nfirst-passage properties for random walks on the RHPs. Firstly, we propose a\nway to label all the different nodes of the RHPs and derive exact formulas to\ncalculate the mean first-passage time (MFPT) between any two nodes and the mean\ntrapping time (MTT) for any trap node. Then, we compare the trapping efficiency\nbetween any two nodes of the RHPs by using the MTT as the measures of trapping\nefficiency. We find that the central node of the RHPs is the best trapping site\nand the nodes which are the farthest nodes from the central node are the worst\ntrapping sites. Furthermore, we find that the maximum of the MTT is about $4$\ntimes more than the minimum of the MTT. The result is similar to the results in\nthe recursive fractal scale-free trees and T-fractal, but it is quite different\nfrom that in the recursive non-fractal scale-free trees. These results can help\nunderstanding the influences of the topological properties and trap location on\nthe trapping efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 01:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}
