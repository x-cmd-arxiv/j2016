The model can be used to generate new melodies that emulate\nthe style of the musical corpus which was used to train it. Instead of using\nthe $n-$body interactions of $(n-1)-$order Markov models, traditionally used in\nautomatic music generation, we use a $k-$nearest neighbour model with pairwise\ninteractions only. In that way, we keep the number of parameters low and avoid\nover-fitting problems typical of Markov models. We show that long-range musical\nphrases don't need to be explicitly enforced using high-order Markov\ninteractions, but can instead emerge from multiple, competing, pairwise\ninteractions. We validate our Maximum Entropy model by contrasting how much the\ngenerated sequences capture the style of the original corpus without\nplagiarizing it. To this end we use a data-compression approach to discriminate\nthe levels of borrowing and innovation featured by the artificial sequences.\nThe results show that our modelling scheme outperforms both fixed-order and\nvariable-order Markov models.

At this stage in development, the heart valves have\nnot formed and so net flow of blood through the heart must be driven by a\ndifferent mechanism. It is hypothesized that there are two possible mechanisms\nthat drive blood flow at this stage - Liebau pumping (dynamic suction pumping\nor valveless pumping) and peristaltic pumping. We implement the immersed\nboundary method with adaptive mesh refinement (IBAMR) to numerically study the\neffect of hematocrit on the circulation around a valveless. Both peristalsis\nand dynamic suction pumping are considered. In the case of dynamic suction\npumping, the heart and circulatory system is simplified as a flexible tube\nattached to a relatively rigid racetrack. For some Womersley number (Wo)\nregimes, there is significant net flow around the racetrack. We find that the\naddition of flexible blood cells does not significantly affect flow rates\nwithin the tube for Wo $\\leq$ 10. On the other hand, peristalsis consistently\ndrives blood around the racetrack for all Wo and for all hematocrit considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 17:08:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-19"}

This leads to huge datasets\nwith lots of redundant data. A filtering of this data prior to assembly is\nadvisable. Titus Brown et al. (2012) presented the algorithm Diginorm for this\npurpose, which filters reads based on the abundance of their $k$-mers. We\npresent Bignorm, a faster and quality-conscious read filtering algorithm. An\nimportant new feature is the use of phred quality scores together with a\ndetailed analysis of the $k$-mer counts to decide which reads to keep. With\nrecommended parameters, in terms of median we remove 97.15% of the reads while\nkeeping the mean phred score of the filtered dataset high. Using the SDAdes\nassembler, we produce assemblies of high quality from these filtered datasets\nin a fraction of the time needed for an assembly from the datasets filtered\nwith Diginorm.

As\nthe QPOs originate from the innermost accretion flow, they provide the\nopportunity to probe the behaviour of matter in extreme gravity. In this paper,\nwe present a systematic analysis of the inclination dependence of phase lags\nassociated with both Type-B and Type-C QPOs in a sample of 15 Galactic black\nhole binaries. We find that the phase lag at the Type-C QPO frequency strongly\ndepends on inclination, both in evolution with QPO frequency and sign. Although\nwe find that the Type-B QPO soft lags are associated with high inclination\nsources, the source sample is too small to confirm this as a significant\ninclination dependence. These results are consistent with a geometrical origin\nof Type-C QPOs and a different origin for Type-B and Type-C QPOs. We discuss\nthe possibility that the phase lags originate from a pivoting spectral power\nlaw during each QPO cycle, while the inclination dependence arises from\ndifferences in dominant relativistic effects. We also search for energy\ndependences in the Type-C QPO frequency.

Fairness is crucial in participatory decision\nmaking, since generating equitable outcomes is an important goal of these\nprocesses. We argue that the classic game theoretic notion of core captures\nfairness in the setting. To compute the core, we first develop a novel\ncharacterization of a public goods market equilibrium called the Lindahl\nequilibrium, which is always a core solution. We then provide the first (to our\nknowledge) polynomial time algorithm for computing such an equilibrium for a\nbroad set of utility functions; our algorithm also generalizes (in a\nnon-trivial way) the well-known concept of proportional fairness. We use our\ntheoretical insights to perform experiments on real participatory budgeting\nvoting data.

Statistical demographic studies can be carried out considering the\nempirical scaling relation between the size of the BLR and the AGN optical\ncontinuum luminosity. However, there are still biases against low-luminosity or\nreddened AGN, in which the rest-frame optical radiation can be severely\nabsorbed/diluted by the host and the BLR emission lines could be hard to\ndetect. Our purpose is to widen the applicability of virial-based SE relations\nto reliably measure the BH masses also for low-luminosity or intermediate/type\n2 AGN that are missed by current methodology. We achieve this goal by\ncalibrating virial relations based on unbiased quantities: the hard X-ray\nluminosities, in the 2-10 keV and 14-195 keV bands, that are less sensitive to\ngalaxy contamination, and the FWHM of the most important rest-frame NIR and\noptical BLR emission lines. We built a sample of RM AGN having both X-ray\nluminosity and broad optical/NIR FWHM measurements available in order to\ncalibrate new virial BH mass estimators.

Our simulations\nreproduce the observed diversity of kinematic properties and metallicity\ngradients, broadly consistent with observations at z=0-3. Strong negative\nmetallicity gradients only appear in galaxies with a rotating disk, but not all\nrotationally supported galaxies have significant gradients. Strongly perturbed\ngalaxies with little rotation always have flat gradients. The kinematic\nproperties and metallicity gradient of a high-redshift galaxy can vary\nsignificantly on short time-scales, associated with starburst episodes.\nFeedback from a starburst can destroy the gas disk, drive strong outflows, and\nflatten a pre-existing negative metallicity gradient. The time variability of a\nsingle galaxy is statistically similar to the entire simulated sample,\nindicating that the observed metallicity gradients in high-redshift galaxies\nreflect the instantaneous state of the galaxy rather than the accretion and\ngrowth history on cosmological time-scales. We find weak dependence of\nmetallicity gradient on stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR).\nLow-mass galaxies and galaxies with high sSFR tend to have flat gradients,\nlikely due to the fact that feedback is more efficient in these galaxies.

Knowing the\ndistributions of their orbital parameters (OPs) is important for a wide range\nof topics, from stellar feedback to binary evolution channels, from the\ndistribution of supernova types to gravitational wave progenitors, yet, no\ndirect measurements exist outside the Milky Way. The Tarantula Massive Binary\nMonitoring was designed to help fill this gap by obtaining multi-epoch radial\nvelocity monitoring of 102 MBs in the 30 Dor. In this paper, we analyse 32\nVLT/FLAMES observations of 93 O- and 7 B-type binaries. We performed a Fourier\nanalysis and obtained orbital solutions for 82 systems: 51 single- and 31\ndouble-lined spectroscopic binaries. Overall, the OPs and binary fraction are\nremarkably similar across the 30 Dor region and compared to existing Galactic\nsamples (GSs). This indicates that within these domains environmental effects\nare of second order in shaping the properties of MBs. A small difference is\nfound in the distribution of orbital periods (OrbPs), which is slightly flatter\n(in log space) in 30 Dor than in the Galaxy, although this may be compatible\nwithin error estimates and differences in the fitting methodology. Also, OrbPs\nin 30 Dor can be as short as 1.1 d; somewhat shorter than seen in GSs. Equal\nmass binaries q>0.95 in 30 Dor are all found outside NGC 2070 the very young\nand massive cluster at 30 Dor's core. One outstanding exception however is the\nfact that earliest spectral types (O2-O7) tend to have shorter OrbPs than\nlatter (O9.2-O9.7). Our results point to a relative universality of the\nincidence rate of MBs and their OPs in the metallicity range from solar\n($Z_{\\odot}$) to about $0.5Z_{\\odot}$. This provides the first direct\nconstraints on MB properties in massive star-forming galaxies at the Universes\npeak of star formation at redshifts z~1 to 2, which are estimated to have\n$Z~0.5Z_{\\odot}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 20:00:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 18:18:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 17:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-14"}

In this\npaper, a practical CSIT estimation scheme is proposed for frequency division\nduplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems. Specifically, each received pilot symbol\nis first quantized to one bit per dimension at the receiver side and then the\nquantized bits are fed back to the transmitter. A joint one-bit compressed\nsensing algorithm is implemented at the transmitter to recover the channel\nmatrices. The algorithm leverages the hidden joint sparsity structure in the\nuser channel matrices to minimize the training and feedback overhead, which is\nconsidered to be a major challenge for FDD systems. Moreover, the one-bit\ncompressed sensing algorithm accurately recovers the channel directions for\nbeamforming. The one-bit feedback mechanism can be implemented in practical\nsystems using the uplink control channel.

The Imaging Magnetograph Experiment\n(IMaX) recorded two small (~5 arcsec) emerging flux patches in the polarized\nfiltergrams of a photospheric Fe I spectral line. Meanwhile, the Sunrise Filter\nImager (SuFI) captured the highly dynamic chromospheric response to the\nmagnetic fields pushing their way through the lower solar atmosphere. The\nserendipitous capture of this event offers a closer look at the inner workings\nof active region emergence sites. In particular, it reveals in meticulous\ndetail how the rising magnetic fields interact with the granulation as they\npush through the Sun's surface, dragging photospheric plasma in their upward\ntravel. The plasma that is burdening the rising field slides along the field\nlines, creating fast downflowing channels at the footpoints. The weight of this\nmaterial anchors this field to the surface at semi-regular spatial intervals,\nshaping it in an undulatory fashion. Finally, magnetic reconnection enables the\nfield to release itself from its photospheric anchors, allowing it to continue\nits voyage up to higher layers. This process releases energy that lights up the\narch-filament systems and heats the surrounding chromosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 21:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

The rank of an object w.r.t. an individual query is\ncomputed based on its distance from the query location, and the aggregate rank\nis computed from all of the individual rank orderings. Solutions to this\nfundamental problem can be used to monitor the popularity of spatial objects,\nwhich in turn can provide new analytical tools for spatial data. Our work draws\ninspiration from three different domains: rank aggregation, continuous queries\nand spatial databases. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work\nthat considers all three problem domains in a single context. Our problem is\ndifferent from the classical rank aggregation problem in the way that the rank\nof spatial objects are dependent on streaming queries whose locations are not\nknown a priori, and is different from the problem of continuous spatial queries\nbecause new query locations can arrive in any region, but do not move. In order\nto solve this problem, we show how to upper and lower bound the rank of an\nobject for any unseen query. Then we propose an approximation solution to\ncontinuously monitor the top-m objects efficiently, for which we design an\nInverted Rank File (IRF) index to guarantee the error bound of the solution. In\nparticular, we propose the notion of safe ranking to determine whether the\ncurrent result is still valid or not when new queries arrive, and propose the\nnotion of validation objects to limit the number of objects to update in the\ntop-m results.

PCA performs well in the presence of moderate noise and even\nwith missing data, but is also sensitive to outliers. PCA is also known to have\na phase transition when noise is independent and identically distributed;\nrecovery of the subspace sharply declines at a threshold noise variance.\nEffective use of PCA requires a rigorous understanding of these behaviors. This\npaper provides a step towards an analysis of PCA for samples with\nheteroscedastic noise, that is, samples that have non-uniform noise variances\nand so are no longer identically distributed. In particular, we provide a\nsimple asymptotic prediction of the recovery of a one-dimensional subspace from\nnoisy heteroscedastic samples.

By investigating a wide range of\nthree-dimensional appendages with different aspect ratios and lengths, we\nclearly show that the sphere with an appendage may robustly undergo an\ninverted-pendulum-like (IPL) instability. This means that the position of the\nappendage placed behind the sphere and aligned with the free-stream direction\nis unstable, in a similar way that an inverted pendulum is unstable under\ngravity. Due to this instability, non-trivial forces are generated on the body,\nleading to turn and drift, if the body is free to fall under gravity. Moreover,\nwe identify the aspect ratio and length of the appendage that induces the\nlargest side force on the sphere, and therefore also the largest drift for a\nfreely falling body. Finally, we explain the physical mechanisms behind these\nobservations in the context of the IPL instability, i.e., the balance between\nsurface area of the appendage exposed to reversed flow in the wake and the\nsurface area of the appendage exposed to fast free-stream flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2016 05:12:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 12:26:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 15:29:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

IIT essentially proposes that\nquantitative consciousness is identical to maximally integrated conceptual\ninformation, quantified by a measure called $\\Phi^{max}$, and that\nphenomenological experience corresponds to the associated set of maximally\nirreducible cause-effect repertoires of a physical system being in a certain\nstate. However, in order to ultimately apply the theory to experimental data, a\nsufficiently general formulation is needed. With the current work, we provide\nthis general formulation, which comprehensively and parsimoniously expresses\n$\\Phi^{max}$ in the language of probabilistic models. Here, the stochastic\nprocess describing a system under scrutiny corresponds to a first-order\ntime-invariant Markov process, and all necessary mathematical operations for\nthe definition of $\\Phi^{max}$ are fully specified by a system's joint\nprobability distribution over two adjacent points in discrete time. We present\na detailed constructive rule for the decomposition of a system into two\ndisjoint subsystems based on flexible marginalization and factorization of this\njoint distribution. Furthermore, we suspend the approach of interventional\ncalculus based on system perturbations, which allows us to omit undefined\nconditional distributions and virtualization. We validate our formulation in a\npreviously established discrete example system, in which we furthermore address\nthe previously unexplored theoretical issue of quale underdetermination due to\nnon-uniqueness of maximally irreducible cause-effect repertoires, which in turn\nalso entails the sensitivity of $\\Phi^{max}$ to the shape of the conceptual\nstructure in qualia space. In constructive spirit, we propose several\nmodifications of the framework in order to address some of these issues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2016 07:47:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 11:01:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-06"}

Very recent observations indicate that the\nsource is now starting to spin down.

These phenomena suggest the system to have an underlying\nperiodicity of 10.5 years between orbital phase shifts and/or giant outbursts.\nThe suggested periodicity may reflect some long-period dynamics in the\ncircumstellar disk of the Be star, due, e.g., to the Kozai-Lidov effect.

Experimental verifications of plasmon hybridization have been\nthus far mostly limited to optical frequencies, as metals cannot support\nsurface plasmons at longer wavelengths. Here, we introduce the concept of\n'spoof plasmon hybridization' in highly conductive metal structures and\ninvestigate experimentally the interaction of localized surface plasmon\nresonances (LSPR) in adjacent metal disks corrugated with subwavelength spiral\npatterns. We show that the hybridization results in the splitting of spoof\nplasmon modes into bonding and antibonding resonances analogous to molecular\norbital rule and plasmonic hybridization in optical spectrum. These hybrid\nmodes can be manipulated to produce enormous field enhancements (larger than\n5000) by tuning the separation between disks or alternatively, the disk size,\nwhich effectively changes the relative gap size. The impact of the radiation\nloss is considered to find out the optimum disk size that maximizes field\nenhancement capabilities.

Here, we\npropose an extension of the two phase mass flow model (Pudasaini, 2012) by\nincluding a new mechanism, called separation-flux, that leads to strong\nphase-separation in avalanche and debris flows while balancing the enhanced\nsolid flux with the reduced fluid flux. The separation flux mechanism is\ncapable of describing the dynamically evolving phase-separation and levee\nformation in a multi-phase, geometrically three-dimensional debris flow. These\nare often observed phenomena in natural debris flows and industrial processes\nthat involve the transportation of particulate solid-fluid mixture material.\nThe novel separation-flux model includes several dominant physical and\nmechanical aspects such as pressure gradients, volume fractions of solid and\nfluid phases and their gradients, shear-rates, flow depth, material friction,\nviscosity, material densities, topographic constraints, grain size, etc. Due to\nthe inherent separation mechanism, as the mass moves down slope, more and more\nsolid particles are transported to the front and the sides, resulting in\nsolid-rich and mechanically strong frontal surge head, and lateral levees\nfollowed by a weaker tail largely consisting of viscous fluid. The primary\nfrontal solid-rich surge head followed by secondary fluid-rich surges is the\nconsequence of phase-separation. Such typical and dominant phase-separation\nphenomena are revealed for two-phase debris flow simulations. Finally, changes\nin flow composition, that are explicitly considered by the new modelling\napproach, result in significant changes of impact pressure estimates.

However, fishing is a complex\neconomic activity, affected not just by overfishing but also by such factors as\npollution, technology, financial factors and more. For this reason, it is often\ndifficult to state with complete certainty that overfishing is the cause of the\ndecline of a fishery. In this study, we developed a simple dynamic model based\non the earlier, well-known Lotka-Volterra model or Prey-Predator model. To\ndescribe exploitation patterns, we assume that the fish stock and the fishing\nindustry are coupled stock variables in the model and they dynamically affect\neach other, with the fishing yield proportional to both the fishing capital and\nthe fish stock. The model is based on the concept that the fishing industry\nacts as the predator of the resource and that its growth and subsequent decline\nis directly related to the abundance of the fish stock. If the model can be fit\nhistorical data relative to specific fisheries, then it is a strong indication\nthat the fishing industry is strongly affected by the magnitude of the fish\nstock and that, in particular, the decline of the yield and the decline of the\nstock are linked to each other.

The model can also be used as a\nqualitative guide to understand the behavior of several other fisheries.

However, the adiabatic\ncondition requires that the process should be very slow and thus limits its\napplication in quantum computation, where quantum gates are preferred to be\nfast due to the limited coherent times of the quantum systems. Here, we propose\na feasible scheme to implement universal holonomic quantum computation based on\nnon-Abelian geometric phases with superadiabatic quantum control, where the\nadiabatic manipulation is sped up while retaining its robustness against errors\nin the timing control. Consolidating the advantages of both strategies, our\nproposal is thus both robust and fast. The quantum cavity QED system is adopted\nas a typical example to illustrate the merits, where the proposed scheme can be\nrealized in a tripod configuration by appropriately controlling the pulse\nshapes and their relative strength. To demonstrate the distinct performance of\nour proposal, we also compare our scheme with the conventional adiabatic\nstrategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2016 10:28:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2016 03:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

The core-degenerate (CD) scenario has been proposed as an\nalternative way for the production of SNe Ia. In this scenario, SNe Ia are\nformed at the final stage of common-envelope evolution from a merger of a\ncarbon-oxygen white dwarf (CO WD) with the CO core of an asymptotic giant\nbranch companion. However, the birthrates of SNe Ia from this scenario are\nstill not well determined. In this work, we performed a detailed investigation\non the CD scenario based on a binary population synthesis approach. The SN Ia\ndelay times from this scenario are basically in the range of 90Myr-2500Myr,\nmainly contributing to the observed SNe Ia with short and intermediate delay\ntimes although this scenario can also produce some old SNe Ia. Meanwhile, our\nwork indicates that the Galactic birthrates of SNe Ia from this scenario are no\nmore than 20% of total SNe Ia due to more careful treatment of mass transfer.\nAlthough the SN Ia birthrates in the present work are lower than those in Ilkov\n& Soker, the CD scenario cannot be ruled out as a viable mechanism for the\nformation of SNe Ia. Especially, SNe Ia with circumstellar material from this\nscenario contribute to 0.7-10% of total SNe Ia, which means that the CD\nscenario can reproduce the observed birthrates of SNe Ia like PTF 11kx. We also\nfound that SNe Ia happen systemically earlier for a high value of metallicity\nand their birthrates increase with metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2016 10:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-15"}

The uplink user will generate inter-user interference (IUI) on the\ndownlink user through the interference channel. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel IUI suppression approach when the BS knows the full channel station\ninformation. The main idea of the approach is to retransmit the weighted uplink\nsignal as soon as it has been received at the BS. For the narrowband case, we\nfirst derive the closed-form expression of the optimum weighted coefficient\nwhen the SI is perfectly cancelled at the BS and then analyze the performance\nof the proposed IUI suppression approach in practical considerations.\nFurthermore, the proposed IUI suppression approach can be extended to the\nbroadband case using a time-domain weighted filter.

In particular, we find\nthat the asymptotic radial evolution of the Lorentz factor is not strongly\nmodified whether radiation can stream through the reconnection layer or not. On\nthe other hand, we show that the width, density and temperature of the\nreconnection layer are strongly dependent on these assumptions.

The case where the two communities have approximately the\nsame size has been extensively studied and we concentrate here on the community\ndetection problem in the case of unbalanced communities. In this setting,\nspectral algorithms based on the non-backtracking matrix are known to solve the\ncommunity detection problem (i.e. do strictly better than a random guess) when\nthe signal is sufficiently large namely above the so-called Kesten Stigum\nthreshold. In this regime and when the average degree tends to infinity, we\nshow that if the community of a vanishing fraction of the vertices is revealed,\nthen a local algorithm (belief propagation) is optimal down to Kesten Stigum\nthreshold and we quantify explicitly its performance. Below the Kesten Stigum\nthreshold, we show that, in the large degree limit, there is a second threshold\ncalled the spinodal curve below which, the community detection problem is not\nsolvable. The spinodal curve is equal to the Kesten Stigum threshold when the\nfraction of vertices in the smallest community is above\n$p^*=\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{3}}$, so that the Kesten Stigum threshold is\nthe threshold for solvability of the community detection in this case.

With increasing composition of low melting B-polymer, macrophase\nseparation and crystallization temperature changes non-monotonically, which is\nattributed to the change in diffusivity of both the polymers with increasing\ncomposition of B-polymer. In weak segregation strength, however, at high enough\ncomposition of B-polymer, A-polymer yields relatively thicker crystals, which\nis attributed to the dilution effect exhibited by B-polymer.

And one of the emerging technologies\nare light field (LF) cameras based on micro-lens arrays. To record the\ndirectional information of the light rays, a much larger storage space and\ntransmission bandwidth are required by a LF image as compared with a\nconventional 2D image of similar spatial dimension, and the compression of LF\ndata becomes a vital part of its application.\n  In this paper, we propose a LF codec that fully exploits the intrinsic\ngeometry between the LF sub-views by first approximating the LF with disparity\nguided sparse coding over a perspective shifted light field dictionary. The\nsparse coding is only based on several optimized Structural Key Views (SKV);\nhowever the entire LF can be recovered from the coding coefficients. By keeping\nthe approximation identical between encoder and decoder, only the residuals of\nthe non-key views, disparity map and the SKVs need to be compressed into the\nbit stream. An optimized SKV selection method is proposed such that most LF\nspatial information could be preserved. And to achieve optimum dictionary\nefficiency, the LF is divided into several Coding Regions (CR), over which the\nreconstruction works individually.

Secondly, because it is based on a closed-form approximation, ISLA\nmaintains the notable speed advantages of SLA over other methods requiring\nalgorithmic looping (e.g. fast Fourier transform or Panjer recursion).

However, stellar ages can also play a role and a larger stellar\nsample is needed to verify these trends. We also note that some of these stars\npresent a remarkably high level of chromospheric activity, even comparable with\nRSCvn or BY Dra active stars. In addition, we do not observe any correlation\nbetween stellar activity and semi-major axis.\n  We present the first long-term activity study of the star $\\iota$ Horologii,\na young solar-type star which hosts a non-transiting Jovian planet and presents\na high activity level. We analyze our own spectra, obtained between 2002 and\n2015, combined with public HARPS observations. We calculate the Ca II indexes\nderived from the 987 CASLEO and HARPS spectra and convert them to the\nMount-Wilson scale. We found a long-term activity cycle of $\\sim$ 5 years which\nfits the active sequence of Bohm-Vitense. The amplitude of this longer cycle is\nirregular, as was also observed for the shorter one. This fact could be\nattributed to an antisymmetric distribution of active regions on the stellar\nsurface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2016 14:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

Receivers might experience\ndifferent sampling frequencies from transmitter due to manufacturing\nimperfection, Doppler Effect introduced by channel or wrong estimation of\nsymbol rate. Timing synchronization in presence of cycle slip for a burst\nsequence of received information, leads to severe degradation in system\nperformance that represents as shortening or prolonging of bit stream. Therefor\nthe necessity of prior detection and elimination of cycle slip is unavoidable.\nAccordingly, the main idea introduced in this paper is to employ the Gardner\nDetector (GAD) not only to recover a fixed timing offset, its output is also\nprocessed in a way such that timing drifts can be estimated and corrected.\nDeriving a two steps algorithm, eliminates the cycle slips arising from wrong\nestimation of symbol rate firstly, and then iteratively synchronize symbol\ntiming of a burst received signal by applying GAD to a feed forward structure\nwith the additional benefits that convergence and stability problems are\navoided, as they are typical for feedback schemes normally used by GAD. The\nproposed algorithm is able to compensate considerable symbol rate offsets at\nthe receiver side. Considerable results in terms of BER confirm the algorithm\nproficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2016 14:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-13"}

Previous authors have\nsuggested that cycle periods lie on multiple branches, either in the cycle\nperiod-Rossby number plane or the cycle period-rotation period plane. We find\nsome evidence that stars along the active branch show significant average\ntoroidal fields that exhibit large temporal variations while stars exclusively\non the inactive branch remain dominantly poloidal throughout their entire\ncycle. This lends credence to the idea that different shear layers are in\noperation along each branch. There is also evidence that the short magnetic\npolarity switches observed on some stars are characteristic of the inactive\nbranch while the longer chromospherically determined periods are characteristic\nof the active branch. This may explain the discrepancy between the magnetic and\nchromospheric cycle periods found on some stars.

They are characterized by a topological invariant and can be identified\nby the presence of protected edge states. In this article, we show that a local\nimpurity in a Chern insulator induces a twofold response: bound states that\ncarry a chiral current and a net current circulating around the impurity. This\nis a manifestation of broken time symmetry and persists even for an\ninfinitesimal impurity potential. To illustrate this, we consider a Coulomb\nimpurity in the Haldane model. Working in the low-energy long-wavelength limit,\nwe show that an infinitesimal impurity strength suffices to create bound\nstates. We find analytic wavefunctions for the bound states and show that they\ncarry a circulating current. In contrast, in the case of a trivial analogue,\ngraphene with a gap induced by a sublattice potential, bound states occur but\ncarry no current. In the many body problem of the Haldane model at\nhalf-filling, we use a linear response approach to demonstrate a circulating\ncurrent around the impurity. Impurity textures in insulators are generally\nexpected to decay exponentially; in contrast, this current decays polynomially\nwith distance from the impurity. Going beyond the Haldane model, we consider\nthe case of coexisting trivial and non-trivial masses. We find that the\nimpurity induces a local chiral current as long as time reversal symmetry is\nbroken. However, the decay of this local current bears a signature of the\noverall topology - the current decays polynomially in a non-trivial system and\nexponentially in a trivial system. In all cases, our analytic results agree\nwell with numerical tight-binding simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 20:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2017 06:52:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

This everyday situation occurs when two fast-walking\npersons suddenly realize that they are on a frontal collision course and begin\nmaneuvering to avoid collision. If the two walkers' initial maneuverings are in\nthe same direction that can lead to oscillations that lengthen time required to\nreach a stable avoidance trajectory. We introduce a dynamical model with a\nfeedback loop to understand the origin and properties of this oscillation. For\nthe emergence of the oscillatory behavior, two conditions must be satisfied: i)\nthe persons must initiate the avoidance maneuver in the same direction; ii) the\ntime delays in the feedback loop must reverse the phase of the players'\npositions at the oscillation frequency. The oscillation can be terminated at\nany time if one of the walkers decides to stop and/or to communicate. By taking\nover the control of the situation the walker cuts the feedback loop.

The purpose of the present study is to\ndevelop a counterpart of the special relativity theory that is consistent with\nthe existence of a preferred frame but, like the standard relativity theory, is\nbased on the relativity principle and universality of the (\\textit{two-way})\nspeed of light. In the framework developed, a degree of anisotropy of the\none-way velocity acquires meaning of a characteristic of the really existing\nanisotropy caused by motion of an inertial frame relative to the preferred\nframe. The anisotropic special relativity kinematics is developed based on the\nfirst principles: (1) Space-time transformations between inertial frames leave\nthe equation of anisotropic light propagation invariant and (2) A set of the\ntransformations possesses a group structure. The Lie group theory apparatus is\napplied to define groups of space-time transformations between inertial frames.\nApplying the consequences of the transformations to the problem of calculating\nthe CMB temperature distribution yields an equation in which the angular\ndependence coincides with that obtained on the basis of the standard relativity\ntheory but the mean temperature is corrected by the terms second order in the\nobserver velocity.
