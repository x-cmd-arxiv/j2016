It is shown that abstruse layer profiles\nmay be converted to real layer structures using the modified Bohm theory, where\nthe quantum potential is due to an Auger electron effect. It is also pointed\nout that the stationary probability density predicts multilayer structures of\nabstruse depth profiles caused by carbon desorption and oxygen adsorption\nprocesses.

Splines play a key role in approximation\ntheory, geometric modeling, and numerical analysis, their properties depend on\ncombinatorics, topology, and geometry of a simplicial or polyhedral subdivision\nof a region in R^k, and are often quite subtle. We describe four algebraic\ntechniques which are useful in the study of splines: homology, graded algebra,\nlocalization, and inverse systems. Our goal is to give a hands-on introduction\nto the methods, and illustrate them with concrete examples in the context of\nsplines. We highlight progress made with these methods, such as a formula for\nthe third coefficient of the polynomial giving the dimension of the spline\nspace in high degree, much of which builds on pioneering work of Schumaker,\nAlfeld-Schumaker, and Billera. The objects appearing here may be computed using\nthe Macaulay2 software system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 16:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-18"}

Since coronal\nemission on active stars appears to be dominated by flare activity, CMEs pose a\nquandary for understanding the fraction of their energy budget stars can spend\non magnetic activity. One answer is magnetic suppression of CMEs, in which the\nstrong large-scale fields of active stars entrap and prevent CMEs unless their\nfree energy exceeds a critical value. The CME-less flaring active region NOAA\n2192 presents a possible solar analogue of this.

Instead, the DE decay rate is\nassumed to be a constant depending only on intrinsic properties of DE and the\ntype of a decay channel, similar to case of the radioactive decay of unstable\nparticles and nuclei. As a consequence, the DE energy density becomes a\nfunction of the proper time elapsed since its formation, presumably in the very\nearly Universe. Such a natural type of DE decay can profoundly affect the\nexpansion history of the Universe and its age. Metastable DE can decay in three\ndistinct ways: (i) exponentially, (ii) into dark matter, (iii) into dark\nradiation. Testing metastable DE models with observational data we find that\nthe decay half-life must be many times larger than the age of the Universe.\nModels in which dark energy decays into dark matter lead to lower values of the\nHubble parameter at large redshifts relative to $\\Lambda$CDM. Consequently\nthese models provide a better fit to cosmological BAO data (especially data\nfrom from high redshift quasars) than concordance ($\\Lambda$CDM) cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 16:19:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 May 2017 05:14:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 10:16:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-23"}

The new formalism\nrecovers the Spitzer resistivity, as well as the concept of thermal force if\nthe heat flux is assumed to be proportional to a temperature gradient.\nFurthermore, if the pressure tensor is related to viscous stress, the latter\nenters the expression for the resistivity.

In magnetic reconnection, however, particle\nacceleration and radiation are decoupled because the electric field is larger\nthan the magnetic field in the diffusion region. We carry out two-dimensional\nparticle-in-cell simulations to determine the extent to which magnetic\nreconnection can produce synchrotron radiation above the burnoff limit. We use\nthe test particle comparison (TPC) method to isolate the effects of cooling by\ncomparing the trajectories and acceleration efficiencies of test particles\nincident on such a reconnection region with and without cooling them. We find\nthat the cooled and uncooled particle trajectories are typically similar during\nacceleration in the reconnection region, and derive an effective limit on\nparticle acceleration that is inversely proportional to the average magnetic\nfield experienced by the particle during acceleration. Using the calculated\ndistribution of this average magnetic field as a function of uncooled final\nparticle energy, we find analytically that cooling does not affect power-law\nparticle energy spectra except at energies far above the synchrotron burnoff\nlimit. Finally, we compare fully cooled and uncooled simulations of\nreconnection, confirming that the synchrotron burnoff limit does not produce a\ncutoff in the particle energy spectrum.

Our approach is based on the totally geodesic embedding of the\ntarget manifold into $\\mathbb{R}^N$ . Since embeddings of Riemannian manifolds\ninto Euclidean spaces can easily be made totally geodesic by extending the\nRiemannian metric in a certain way into some tubular neighbourhood, the here\npresented approach is quite general. Totally geodesic embeddings allow to\nreformulate the harmonic map heat flow in a neighbourhood of the embedded\ntarget manifold. This reformulation has the advantage that the problem becomes\nunconstrained: Instead of assuming a priori that the solution to the flow maps\ninto the target manifold this fact becomes a property of the solution to the\nextended flow for special initial data. The solution space to the reformulated\nproblem therefore exists of maps which are also allowed to map into the ambient\nspace of the target manifold. This simplifies the discretization of the\nproblem. Based on this observation, we here propose algorithms for the\ncomputation of the harmonic map heat flow and of harmonic maps. In contrast to\nprevious schemes, our algorithm does not make use of projections onto the\ntarget manifold, discrete tangential deformations, geodesic finite elements or\nof Lagrange multipliers.

While a variety of animal monitoring strategies\nexist, most of them rely on mounting devices. However, in real world, it is\ndifficult to find these animals and install mounting devices. In this paper, we\npropose an animal monitoring application by utilizing wireless sensor networks\n(WSNs) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The objective of the application is\nto detect locations of endangered species in large-scale wildlife areas and\nmonitor movement of animals without any attached devices. In this application,\nsensors deployed throughout the observation area are responsible for gathering\nanimal information. The UAV flies above the observation area and collects the\ninformation from sensors.

The UAV receives a certain amount of reward from an area if some animals\nare detected at that location. We solve the MDP using Q-learning such that the\nUAV prefers going to those areas that animals are detected before.

Instead, using a 1 kpc\nresolution smears out individual clumps, resulting in their apparent merging.\nThis causes significant overestimations of the clump radii and, therefore,\nmasses derived using methods that use their observed sizes.

Currently available for this purpose are purely analytic models,\nwhich are accurate only to within an order of magnitude, and detailed numerical\nsimulations, which are more accurate but are applied to any event separately.\nIn this paper we derive an analytic model that is calibrated by numerical\nsimulations. This model is much more accurate than previous analytic models,\nyet it is as simple to use. To derive the model we analyze simulated light\ncurves from numerical explosion of $124$ red supergiant progenitors, calculated\nusing the stellar evolution code MESA. We find that although the structure of\nthe progenitors we consider varies, the resulting light curves can be described\nrather well based only on the explosion energy, ejecta mass and progenitor\nradius. Our calibrated analytic model, which is based on these three\nparameters, reproduces the bolometric luminosity within $25\\%-35\\%$ accuracy\nand the observed temperature within $15\\%$ accuracy (compared to previous\nanalytic models which are indeed found to be accurate only to within an order\nof magnitude).

We present a\nscattering mitigation framework for radio imaging with very long baseline\ninterferometry (VLBI) that partially overcomes this limitation. Our framework,\n\"stochastic optics,\" derives from a simplification of strong interstellar\nscattering to separate small-scale (\"diffractive\") effects from large-scale\n(\"refractive\") effects, thereby separating deterministic and random\ncontributions to the scattering. Stochastic optics extends traditional\nsynthesis imaging by simultaneously reconstructing an unscattered image and its\nrefractive perturbations. Its advantages over direct imaging come from\nutilizing the many deterministic properties of the scattering -- such as the\ntime-averaged \"blurring,\" polarization independence, and the deterministic\nevolution in frequency and time -- while still accounting for the stochastic\nimage distortions on large scales. These distortions are identified in the\nimage reconstructions through regularization by their time-averaged power\nspectrum. Using synthetic data, we show that this framework effectively removes\nthe blurring from diffractive scattering while reducing the spurious image\nfeatures from refractive scattering. Stochastic optics can provide significant\nimprovements over existing scattering mitigation strategies and is especially\npromising for imaging the Galactic Center supermassive black hole, Sagittarius\nA*, with the Global mm-VLBI Array and with the Event Horizon Telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 20:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

The jet deposits\n$10^{51}-10^{52}$ erg into this cocoon. This energy is comparable to the GRB's\nenergy and to the energy of the accompanying supernova, yet its signature has\nbeen largely neglected so far. A fraction of the cocoon energy is released\nduring its expansion following the breakout from the star and later as it\ninteracts with the surrounding matter. We explore here the possible signatures\nof the cocoon emission and outline a framework to calculate them from the\nconditions of the cocoon at the time of the jet breakout. We show that the\ncocoon signature depends strongly on the level of mixing between the shocked\njet and shocked stellar material that fills it, which is currently unknown. We\nfind that if there is no mixing at all then the $\\gamma$-ray emission from the\ncocoon is so bright that it should have been already detected, and the lack of\nsuch detections indicates that mixing at some level must take place. We\ncalculate also the expected signal for partial and full mixing. While the\ntypical signals are weaker than GRBs' afterglows, the latter are highly beamed\nwhile the former have wide angles. We predict that future optical, UV and X-ray\ntransient searches, like LSST, ZTF, ULTRASAT, ISS-Lobster and others will most\nlikely detect such signals, providing a wealth of information on the\nprogenitors and jets of GRBs. While we focus on long GRBs, we note that\nanalogous (but weaker) cocoons may arise in short GRBs as well. Their\nsignatures might be the most promising electromagnetic counterparts for\ngravitational waves merger's signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 21:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

For astrophysical applications, one\nneeds to have a metric that captures all the properties of the spacetime around\na neutron star. Furthermore, an accurate appropriately parameterised metric,\ni.e., a metric that is given in terms of parameters that are directly related\nto the physical structure of the neutron star, could be used to solve the\ninverse problem, which is to infer the properties of the structure of a neutron\nstar from astrophysical observations. In this work we present such an\napproximate stationary and axisymmetric metric for the exterior of neutron\nstars, which is constructed using the Ernst formalism and is parameterised by\nthe relativistic multipole moments of the central object. This metric is given\nin terms of an expansion on the Weyl-Papapetrou coordinates with the multipole\nmoments as free parameters and is shown to be extremely accurate in capturing\nthe physical properties of a neutron star spacetime as they are calculated\nnumerically in general relativity. Because the metric is given in terms of an\nexpansion, the expressions are much simpler and easier to implement, in\ncontrast to previous approaches. For the parameterisation of the metric in\ngeneral relativity, the recently discovered universal 3-hair relations are used\nto produce a 3-parameter metric. Finally, a straightforward extension of this\nmetric is given for scalar-tensor theories with a massless scalar field, which\nalso admit a formulation in terms of an Ernst potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 22:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-09"}

According to this model, a multiplex network\nbecomes more and more fragile as the number of layers increases. In this\nrespect, the addition of a new layer of interdependent nodes to a preexisting\nmultiplex network will never improve its robustness. Whereas such a model seems\nappropriate to understand the effect of interdependencies in the simplest\nscenario of a network composed of only two layers, it may seem not suitable to\ncharacterize the robustness of real systems formed by multiple network layers.\nIt seems in fact unrealistic that a real system, evolved, through the\ndevelopment of multiple layers of interactions, towards a fragile structure. In\nthis paper, we introduce a model of percolation where the condition that makes\na node functional is that the node is functioning in at least two of the layers\nof the network. The model reduces to the commonly adopted percolation model for\nmultiplex networks when the number of layers equals two. For larger number of\nlayers, however, the model describes a scenario where the addition of new\nlayers boosts the robustness of the system by creating redundant\ninterdependencies among layers. We prove this fact thanks to the development of\na message-passing theory able to characterize the model in both synthetic and\nreal-world multiplex graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 23:27:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 12:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-10"}

This is\nclosely related to the structure of Rapoport-Zink spaces and of affine\nDeligne-Lusztig varieties.\n  We prove a Hodge-Newton decomposition for affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties\nand for the special fibres of Rapoport-Zink spaces, relating these spaces to\nanalogous ones defined in terms of Levi subgroups, under a certain condition\n(Hodge-Newton decomposability) which can be phrased in combinatorial terms.\n  Second, we study the Shimura varieties in which every non-basic\n$\\sigma$-isogeny class is Hodge-Newton decomposable. We show that (assuming the\naxioms of \\cite{HR}) this condition is equivalent to nice conditions on either\nthe basic locus, or on all the non-basic Newton strata of the Shimura\nvarieties. We also give a complete classification of Shimura varieties\nsatisfying these conditions.\n  While previous results along these lines often have restrictions to\nhyperspecial (or at least maximal parahoric) level structure, and/or\nquasi-split underlying group, we handle the cases of arbitrary parahoric level\nstructure, and of possibly non-quasi-split underlying groups. This results in a\nlarge number of new cases of Shimura varieties where a simple description of\nthe basic locus can be expected.

The star formation rate is shown to be directly\nrelated to the molecular gas, but indirectly to HI and total gas densities. The\ndependence of the SF law on the gaseous phase is explained by the phase\ntransition theory between HI and H$_2$ gases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 01:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

Small mass planets do\nnot affect the gas profile and migrate in the fast type~I migration. Although\ntype~I migration can be directed outwards for planets smaller than $20-30\nM_\\oplus$, planets above this mass should be lost into the central star long\nbefore the disc disperses. Massive planets open a gap and subsequently migrate\nin the slower, type~II migration, which could save them from migrating all the\nway to the star. Hence, growing giant planets can be saved if and only if they\ncan reach the gap opening mass, because this extends their migration\ntime-scale, allowing them to eventually survive at large orbits until the disc\nitself disperses.\n  However, most of the previous studies only measured the torques on planets\nwith fixed masses and orbits to determine the migration rate. Additionally, the\ntransition between type~I and type~II migration itself is not well studied.\nHere we use isothermal 2D disc simulations with FARGO-2D1D to study the\nmigration behaviour of gas accreting protoplanets in discs. We find that\nmigrating giant planets always open gaps in the disc. We further show\nanalytically and numerically that planets growing in the runaway gas accretion\nregime will reach gap opening masses before migrating all the way to the\ncentral star if the disc is not extremely viscous and/or thick. An accretion\nrate limited to the radial gas flow in the disc, in contrast, is not fast\nenough. When gas accretion by the planet is taken into account, the gap opening\nprocess is accelerated because the planet accretes material originating from\nits horseshoe region. This allows an accreting planet to transition to type~II\nmigration before being lost even if gas fails to be provided for a rapid enough\ngrowth and the gap opening mass is not reached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 02:09:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

The mass loss from massive stars is not understood well. Eta Car is\na unique object for studying the massive stellar wind during the LBV phase.

The nature of both stars\nis uncertain, although we know from X-ray studies that there is a wind-wind\ncollision whose properties change with orbital phase.\n  Methods. Observations of Eta Car were carried out with the ESO VLTI and the\nAMBER instrument between approximately five and seven months before the August\n2014 periastron passage.

Secondly, we show that in\nthe WTDiff gravity the cosmological constant is a mere integration constant as\nin unimodular gravity, but it does not receive any radiative corrections unlike\nthe unimodular gravity. A key point in this proof is to construct a covariantly\nconserved energy-momentum tensor, which is achieved on the basis of this\nequivalence relation.

Expenditure\ninformation on each transaction between users and items is widely available on\ne-commerce websites, often appearing next to the rating information, while\nthere is seldom study on the correlation between expenditures and rating\nscores.

This recognition relies on the inference of a multilevel\nstatistical model which uses 1) the conditional relations between levels of\ndescription (steps and phases) and 2) the temporal relations among steps and\namong phases.

The sensor and the estimator have the common objective of minimizing\nexpected distortion in the estimation of the state of the process, over a\nfinite time horizon. The sensor is either charged a cost for each transmission\nor constrained on transmission times. As opposed to the prior work where\ncommunication between the sensor and the estimator was assumed to be perfect\n(noiseless), in this work an additive noise channel with fixed power constraint\nis considered; hence, the sensor has to encode its message before transmission.\nUnder some technical assumptions, we obtain the optimal encoding and estimation\npolicies in conjunction with the optimal transmission schedule. The impact of\nthe presence of a noisy channel is analyzed numerically based on dynamic\nprogramming. This analysis yields some rather surprising results such as a\nphase transition phenomenon in the number of used transmission opportunities,\nwhich was not encountered in the noiseless communication setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 08:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

An East-West longitudinal (azimuthal)\nasymmetry is found to exist in the distribution of flare sources of solar\nproton events. With the same longitudinal separation between the flare sources\nand the magnetic field line footpoint of observer, the number of the solar\nproton events originating from solar sources located on the eastern side of the\nnominal magnetic footpoint of observer is larger than the number of the solar\nproton events from solar sources located on the western side. We emphasize the\nimportance of this statistical investigation in two aspects. On the one hand,\nthis statistical finding confirms our previous simulation results obtained by\nnumerically solving five-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation of solar energetic\nparticle (SEP) transport. On the other hand, the East-West longitudinally\n(azimuthally) asymmetric distribution of solar proton events accumulated over a\nlong time period provides an observational evidence for the effects of\nperpendicular diffusion on the SEP propagation in the heliosphere. We further\npoint out that, in the sense of perpendicular diffusion, our numerical\nsimulations and statistical results of SEP events confirm each other. We\ndiscuss in detail the important effects of perpendicular diffusion on the\nformation of the East-West azimuthal (longitudinal) asymmetry of SEP\ndistribution in two physical scenarios, i.e., 'multiple SEP events with one\nspacecraft' and 'one SEP event with multiple spacecraft'. A functional relation\nI_{max}(r)=kr^{-1.7} quantifying the radial dependence of SEP peak intensities\nis obtained and utilized in the analysis of physical mechanism. The\nrelationship between our results and those of Dresing et al. is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 09:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

On Earth,\nthe ensuing gradient of mean molecular weight has relatively few dynamical\nconsequences because N$_2$ is heavier than water vapor, so that only the\nrelease of latent heat significantly impacts convection. On the contrary, in an\nhydrogen dominated atmosphere (e.g. giant planets), all condensing species are\nsignificantly heavier than the background gas. This can stabilize the\natmosphere against convection near a cloud deck if the enrichment in the given\nspecies exceeds a critical threshold. This raises two questions. What is\ntransporting energy in such a stabilized layer, and how affected can the\nthermal profile of giant planets be? To answer these questions, we first carry\nout a linear analysis of the convective and double-diffusive instabilities in a\ncondensable medium showing that an efficient condensation can suppress\ndouble-diffusive convection. This suggests that a stable radiative layer can\nform near a cloud condensation level, leading to an increase in the temperature\nof the deep adiabat. Then, we investigate the impact of the condensation of the\nmost abundant species---water---with a steady-state atmosphere model. Compared\nto standard models, the temperature increase can reach several hundred degrees\nat the quenching depth of key chemical tracers. Overall, this effect could have\nmany implications for our understanding of the dynamical and chemical state of\nthe atmosphere of giant planets, for their future observations (with Juno for\nexample), and for their internal evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 09:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

This\nproblem is encountered in a wide array of applications-from biological networks\nto social networks to ontologies-where multiple networked data sources need to\nbe integrated. Due to the difficulty of the task, an accurate alignment can\nrarely be found without human assistance. Thus, it is of great practical\nimportance to develop network alignment algorithms that can optimally leverage\nexperts who are able to provide the correct alignment for a small number of\nnodes. Yet, only a handful of existing works address this active network\nalignment setting.\n  The majority of the existing active methods focus on absolute queries (\"are\nnodes $a$ and $b$ the same or not?\"), whereas we argue that it is generally\neasier for a human expert to answer relative queries (\"which node in the set\n$\\{b_1, \\ldots, b_n\\}$ is the most similar to node $a$?\"). This paper\nintroduces two novel relative-query strategies, TopMatchings and\nGibbsMatchings, which can be applied on top of any network alignment method\nthat constructs and solves a bipartite matching problem. Our methods identify\nthe most informative nodes to query by sampling the matchings of the bipartite\ngraph associated to the network-alignment instance.\n  We compare the proposed approaches to several commonly-used query strategies\nand perform experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our\nsampling-based strategies yield the highest overall performance, outperforming\nall the baseline methods by more than 15 percentage points in some cases. In\nterms of accuracy, TopMatchings and GibbsMatchings perform comparably. However,\nGibbsMatchings is significantly more scalable, but it also requires\nhyperparameter tuning for a temperature parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 10:02:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2017 09:41:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-07"}

In particular, we argue that it is still unclear how baryons (not\nhadrons) could form at the cosmological transition. A critical role should be\nplayed by diquark states, whose abundance in the early plasma needs to be\naccurately evaluated. We estimate that, if the number of quarks belonging to a\ndiquark state, at the beginning of the cosmological transition, is $<\\sim\n1:10^6$, its dynamics could be modified by the process of B-transfer from\nplasma to hadrons. In turn, by assuming B-transfer to cause just mild\nperturbations and, in particular, no entropy input, we study the deviations\nfrom the tracking regime, in the frame of SCDEW models.

The\noptimal orders of convergence in space and in time are achieved for smooth and\nnonsmooth initial solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 10:43:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 17:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

While some of\nthese protocols were first implemented and used and later documented, other\nwere first specified and then implemented. Regardless of how protocols came to\nbe, their definitions can contain traps that lead to insecure implementations\nor deployments. A classical example is insufficiently strict authentication\nrequirements in a protocol specification. The resulting Misconfigurations,\ni.e., not enabling strong authentication, are common root causes for Internet\nsecurity incidents. Indeed, Internet protocols have been commonly designed\nwithout security in mind which leads to a multitude of misconfiguration traps.\nWhile this is slowly changing, to strict security considerations can have a\nsimilarly bad effect. Due to complex implementations and insufficient\ndocumentation, security features may remain unused, leaving deployments\nvulnerable.\n  In this paper we provide a systematization of the security traps found in\ncommon Internet protocols.

We also use their phonon\nspectra to show that the mechanical stability of the Pmmn8 sheet is superior to\nthat of the Pmmn2 sheet. Nanoribbons derived from Pmmn8 are not only more\nstable than those derived from Pmmn2, but also more interesting from the\ntechnological point of view.

The chemical and physical properties of dense clumps of\nmolecular clouds are strongly affected by the kinetic temperature. Therefore,\nthis parameter is essential for a better understanding of the interstellar\nmedium. Formaldehyde, a molecule which traces the entire dense molecular gas,\nappears to be the most reliable tracer to directly measure the gas kinetic\ntemperature.We aim to determine the kinetic temperature with spectral lines\nfrom formaldehyde and to compare the results with those obtained from ammonia\nlines for a large number of massive clumps.Three 218 GHz transitions\n(JKAKC=303-202, 322-221, and 321-220) of para-H2CO were observed with the 15m\nJames Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) toward 30 massive clumps of the Galactic\ndisk at various stages of high-mass star formation. Using the RADEX non-LTE\nmodel, we derive the gas kinetic temperature modeling the measured para-H2CO\n322-221/303-202and 321-220/303-202 ratios. The gas kinetic temperatures derived\nfrom the para-H2CO (321-220/303-202) line ratios range from 30 to 61 K with an\naverage of 46 K. A comparison of kinetic temperature derived from para-H2CO,\nNH3, and the dust emission indicates that in many cases para-H2CO traces a\nsimilar kinetic temperature to the NH3 (2,2)/(1,1) transitions and the dust\nassociated with the HII regions. Distinctly higher temperatures are probed by\npara-H2CO in the clumps associated with outflows/shocks. Kinetic temperatures\nobtained from para-H2CO trace turbulence to a higher degree than NH3\n(2,2)/(1,1) in the massive clumps. The non-thermal velocity dispersions of\npara-H2CO lines are positively correlated with the gas kinetic temperature.

Hence, it is inferred that stabilised discontinuous\nGalerkin methods are highly robust as well as computationally efficient\nnumerical methods to deal with natural convection problems arising in\nincompressible computational thermo-fluid dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 12:25:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 11:46:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 10:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-16"}

To apply the nucleation\ntheorem to experiments performed along an isochoric path, for instance, in\ncavitation experiments in mineral inclusions, knowledge of the bubble entropy\nis required. Using computer simulations, we compute the entropy of bubbles in\nwater as a function of their volume over a wide range of tensions from free\nenergy calculations. We find that the bubble entropy is an important\ncontribution to the free energy which significantly lowers the barrier to\nbubble nucleation, thereby facilitating cavitation. Furthermore, the bubble\nentropy per surface area depends on the curvature of the liquid--vapor\ninterface, decreasing approximately linearly with its mean curvature over the\nstudied range of bubble volumes. At room temperature, the entropy of a flat\nliquid--vapor interface at ambient pressure is very similar to that of critical\nbubbles over a wide range of tensions, which justifies the use of the former as\nan approximation when interpreting data from experiments.

Given the source input image and the\nreference attribute, DIAT aims to generate a facial image that owns the\nreference attribute as well as keeps the same or similar identity to the input\nimage. In general, our model consists of a mask network and an attribute\ntransform network which work in synergy to generate a photo-realistic facial\nimage with the reference attribute. Considering that the reference attribute\nmay be only related to some parts of the image, the mask network is introduced\nto avoid the incorrect editing on attribute irrelevant region. Then the\nestimated mask is adopted to combine the input and transformed image for\nproducing the transfer result. For joint training of transform network and mask\nnetwork, we incorporate the adversarial attribute loss, identity-aware adaptive\nperceptual loss, and VGG-FACE based identity loss. Furthermore, a denoising\nnetwork is presented to serve for perceptual regularization to suppress the\nartifacts in transfer result, while an attribute ratio regularization is\nintroduced to constrain the size of attribute relevant region. Our DIAT can\nprovide a unified solution for several representative facial attribute transfer\ntasks, e.g., expression transfer, accessory removal, age progression, and\ngender transfer, and can be extended for other face enhancement tasks such as\nface hallucination.

This method uses a few femtoseconds\nlong relativistic electron bunch to probe the wake produced in a plasma by an\nintense laser pulse or an ultra-short relativistic charged particle beam. As\nthe probe bunch traverses the wake, its momentum is modulated by the electric\nfield of the wake, leading to a density variation of the probe after free-space\npropagation. This variation of probe density produces a snapshot of the wake\nthat can directly give many useful information of the wake structure and its\nevolution.

The instability of the strong electric field due to\ncreation of electron pairs is one of the examples, which is known as Schwinger\nprocess. What matters are the coupling of particles to the electromagnetic\nfield and the mass of the particle to be produced. The critical electric field\nfor electrons in the minimal coupling is ~ m^2/e . Spin 1/2 neutral particles\nbut with magnetic dipole moments can interact with the electromagnetic field\nthrough Pauli coupling. The instability of the particular vacuum under the\nstrong magnetic field can be formulated as the emergence of imaginary parts of\nthe effective potential. In this talk, the development of the imaginary part in\nthe effective potential as a function of the magnetic field strength is\ndiscussed for the configurations of the uniform magnetic field and the\ninhomogeneous magnetic field. Neutrinos are the lightest particle(if not photon\nor gluon) in the \"standard model\", of which electromagnetic property is poorly\nknown experimentally. Recently the observation of neutrino oscillation shows\nthe necessity of neutrino masses. It implies that the standard model is\nsubjected to be modified such that non-trivial electromagnetic structure of\nneutrino should be reconsidered although they are assigned to be neutral. And\nthe possibility of anomalous electromagnetic form factor is an open question\ntheoretically and experimentally. In this talk, the implication of\nnon-vanishing magnetic dipole moment of neutrinos is also discussed: the\ninstability of the strong magnetic field and the enhancement of neutrino\nproduction in high energy collider experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 14:40:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

Self-pulsing\nregimes, where the laser periodically releases a short pulse of light, are\nparticularly interesting for many applications, from material science to\ntelecommunications. Self-pulsing regimes need to produce pulses very regularly\nand, as such, they are also known to be particularly sensitive to\nperturbations, such as noise or light injection.\n  We investigate the effect of delayed optical feedback on the dynamics of a\nself-pulsing semiconductor laser with saturable absorber (SLSA). More\nprecisely, we consider the Yamada model with delay -- a system of three\ndelay-differential equations (DDEs) for two slow and one fast variable -- which\nhas been shown to reproduce accurately self-pulsing features as observed in\nSLSA experimentally. This model is also of broader interest because it is quite\nclosely related to mathematical models of other self-pulsing systems, such as\nexcitable spiking neurons.\n  We perform a numerical bifurcation analysis of the Yamada model with delay,\nwhere we consider both the feedback delay, the feedback strength and the\nstrength of pumping as bifurcation parameters. We find a rapidly increasing\ncomplexity of the system dynamics when the feedback delay is increased from\nzero.

Although those platforms do not have\nsensors for 3D depth sensing capability, knowledge of depth is an essential\npart in many robotics activities. Therefore, recently, there is an increasing\ninterest in depth estimation using monocular images. As this task is inherently\nambiguous, the data-driven estimated depth might be unreliable in robotics\napplications. In this paper, we have attempted to improve the precision of\nmonocular depth estimation by introducing 2D planar observation from the\nremaining laser range finder without extra cost. Specifically, we construct a\ndense reference map from the sparse laser range data, redefining the depth\nestimation task as estimating the distance between the real and the reference\ndepth. To solve the problem, we construct a novel residual of residual neural\nnetwork, and tightly combine the classification and regression losses for\ncontinuous depth estimation. Experimental results suggest that our method\nachieves considerable promotion compared to the state-of-the-art methods on\nboth NYUD2 and KITTI, validating the effectiveness of our method on leveraging\nthe additional sensory information. We further demonstrate the potential usage\nof our method in obstacle avoidance where our methodology provides\ncomprehensive depth information compared to the solution using monocular camera\nor 2D laser range finder alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 21:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-08"}
