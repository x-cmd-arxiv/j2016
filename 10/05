A typical approach involves sparsely representing patches in a\nlow-resolution (LR) input image via a dictionary of example LR patches, and\nthen using the coefficients of this representation to generate the\nhigh-resolution (HR) output via an analogous HR dictionary. However, most\nexisting sparse representation methods for super resolution focus on the\nluminance channel information and do not capture interactions between color\nchannels. In this work, we extend sparsity based super-resolution to multiple\ncolor channels by taking color information into account. Edge similarities\namongst RGB color bands are exploited as cross channel correlation constraints.\nThese additional constraints lead to a new optimization problem which is not\neasily solvable; however, a tractable solution is proposed to solve it\nefficiently.

In this work, we\npropose a wavelet-based coarse-grained numerical scheme, based on the framework\nof Equation-Free Projective Integration, for a kinetic plasma system modeled by\nthe Vlasov-Poisson equations. A kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) code is used to\nsimulate the meso scale dynamics for short time intervals. This allows the\nextrapolation over long time-steps of the behavior of a coarse wavelet-based\ndiscretization of the system. To validate the approach and the underlying\nconcepts, we perform two 1D1V numerical experiments: nonlinear propagation and\nsteepening of an ion wave, and the expansion of a plasma slab in vacuum. The\ndirect comparisons to resolved PIC simulations show good agreement. We show\nthat the speedup of the projective integration scheme over the full particle\nscheme scales linearly with the system size, demonstrating efficiency while\ntaking into account fully kinetic, non-Maxwellian effects.

Currently, there are three proposed mechanisms for SLSNe:\n(1) pair-instability supernovae (PISN), (2) magnetar-driven supernovae, and (3)\nmodels in which the supernova ejecta interacts with a circumstellar material\nejected before the explosion. Based on current observations of SLSNe, the PISN\norigin has been disfavoured for a number of reasons. Many PISN models provide\noverly broad light curves and too reddened spectra, because of massive ejecta\nand a high amount of nickel. In the current study we re-examine PISN properties\nusing progenitor models computed with the GENEC code. We calculate supernova\nexplosions with FLASH and light curve evolution with the radiation\nhydrodynamics code STELLA.

Existing\nstrategies for strain design typically focus on designing mutations that\nachieve the highest yield possible while maintaining growth viability. While\nthese methods are computationally tractable, an optimum productivity could be\nachieved by a dynamic strategy in which the intracellular division of resources\nis permitted to change with time. New methods for the design and implementation\nof dynamic microbial processes, both computational and experimental, have\ntherefore been explored to maximize productivity. However, solving for the\noptimal metabolic behavior under the assumption that all fluxes in the cell are\nfree to vary is a challenging numerical task. This work presents an efficient\nmethod for the calculation of a maximum theoretical productivity of a batch\nculture system using a dynamic optimization framework. This metric is analogous\nto the maximum theoretical yield, a measure that is well established in the\nmetabolic engineering literature and whose use helps guide strain and pathway\nselection. The proposed method follows traditional assumptions of dynamic flux\nbalance analysis: (1) that internal metabolite fluxes are governed by a\npseudo-steady state, and (2) that external metabolite fluxes are dynamically\nbounded. The optimization is achieved via collocation on finite elements, and\naccounts explicitly for an arbitrary number of flux changes. The method can be\nfurther extended to explicitly solve for the trade-off curve between maximum\nproductivity and yield. We demonstrate the method on succinate production in\ntwo common microbial hosts, Escherichia coli and Actinobacillus succinogenes,\nrevealing that nearly optimal yields and productivities can be achieved with\nonly two discrete flux stages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2016 18:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

In addition, with\nthe increasing number of scene categories, label ambiguity has become another\ncrucial issue in large-scale classification. This paper focuses on large-scale\nscene recognition and makes two major contributions to tackle these issues.\nFirst, we propose a multi-resolution CNN architecture that captures visual\ncontent and structure at multiple levels. The multi-resolution CNNs are\ncomposed of coarse resolution CNNs and fine resolution CNNs, which are\ncomplementary to each other.

The\nminimization problem is to be solved via mathematical optimization. The main\nfeature of ME is that it directs input space exploration by only executing the\nrepresenting function, thus avoiding static or symbolic reasoning about the\nprogram semantics, which is particularly challenging for numerical code. To\nillustrate this feature, we develop an ME-based algorithm for coverage-based\ntesting of numerical code.

This implies that major mergers are more common at high\nredshift than implied by the simplest arguments assuming a constant\nobservability time. Several effects contribute to this trend: (1) The fraction\nof massive, major (4:1) pairs which merge by today increases weakly from ~0.5\nat z=1 to ~0.8 at z=3. (2) The median time elapsed between an observed pair and\nfinal remnant decreases by a factor of two from z~1 to z~3.

Moreover, we study the effect of stellar foreground\ncontamination in the line-of-sight kinematics of the NSC. Our study shows that\nno fine tuning of the orientation of the infalling globular clusters is\nnecessary to result in a rotating NSC. We suggest that cluster-inspiral is a\nviable mechanism for the formation of rotating NSCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2016 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

In this paper, we study the trend\nof the SN rates with the intrinsic colours, the star formation activity and the\nmass of the parent galaxies. We have considered a sample of about 130000\ngalaxies and a SN sample of about 50 events. We found that the SN Ia rate per\nunit mass is higher by a factor of six in the star-forming galaxies with\nrespect to the passive galaxies. The SN Ia rate per unit mass is also higher in\nthe less massive galaxies that are also younger. These results suggest a\ndistribution of the delay times (DTD) less populated at long delay times than\nat short delays. The CC SN rate per unit mass is proportional to both the sSFR\nand the galaxy mass. The trends of the Type Ia and CC SN rates as a function of\nthe sSFR and the galaxy mass that we observed from SUDARE data are in agreement\nwith literature results at different redshifts. The expected number of SNe Ia\nis in agreement with the observed one for all four DTD models considered both\nin passive and star-forming galaxies so we can not discriminate between\ndifferent progenitor scenarios.

While the slope of the relation between the SN Ia rate and the U\n- J color in star-forming galaxies can be reproduced well by all four DTD\nmodels considered, only the steepest of them is able to account for the rates\nand colour in star-forming and passive galaxies with the same value of the SN\nIa production efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2016 20:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

To model swelling of ionic microgels, we derive a statistical\nmechanical theorem, which proves exact within the cell model, for the\nelectrostatic contribution to the osmotic pressure inside a permeable colloidal\nmacroion. Applying the theorem, we demonstrate how the distribution of\ncounterions within an ionic microgel determines the internal osmotic pressure.\nBy combining the electrostatic pressure, which we compute via both\nPoisson-Boltzmann theory and molecular dynamics simulation, with the elastic\npressure, modeled via the Flory-Rehner theory of swollen polymer networks, we\nshow how deswelling of ionic microgels with increasing concentration of\nparticles can result from a redistribution of counterions that reduces\nelectrostatic pressure.

A key experimental challenge in bead-based assays is that the number of\nmotors on a bead is not well defined.

When the data\nare missing not at random, the parameter of interest is not identifiable in\ngeneral. Without additional assumptions, we can derive bounds of the parameters\nof interest, which, unfortunately, are often too wide to be informative.\nTherefore, it is of great importance to sharpen these worst-case bounds by\nexploiting additional information. Traditional missing data analysis uses only\nthe information of the binary missing data indicator, that is, a certain data\npoint is either missing or not. Nevertheless, real data often provide more\ninformation than a binary missing data indicator, and they often record\ndifferent types of missingness. In a motivating HIV status survey, missing data\nmay be due to the units' unwillingness to respond to the survey items or their\nhospitalization during the visit, and may also be due to the units' temporarily\nabsence or relocation. It is apparent that some missing types are more likely\nto be missing not at random, but other missing types are more likely to be\nmissing at random. We show that making full use of the missing types results in\nnarrower bounds of the parameters of interest.

On the other hand, the existence of pressure maxima in\nthe disk could act as migration traps and locations for solid material\naccumulation, favoring the formation of massive cores. We aim to study the\nradial drift of pebbles and planetesimals and planet migration at pressure\nmaxima in a protoplanetary disk and their implications for the formation of\nmassive cores as triggering a gaseous runaway accretion phase. The time\nevolution of a viscosity driven accretion disk is solved numerically\nintroducing a a dead zone as a low-viscosity region in the protoplanetary disk.\nA population of pebbles and planetesimals evolving by radial drift and\naccretion by the planets is also considered. Finally, the embryos embedded in\nthe disk grow by the simultaneous accretion of pebbles, planetesimals and the\nsurrounding gas. Our simulations show that the pressure maxima generated at the\nedges of the low-viscosity region of the disk act as planet migration traps,\nand that the pebble and planetesimal surface densities are significantly\nincreased due to the radial drift towards pressure maxima locations. However,\nour simulations also show that migration trap locations and solid material\naccumulation locations are not exactly at the same positions. Thus, a planet's\nsemi-major axis oscillations around zero torque locations, predicted by MHD and\nHD simulations, are needed for the planet to accrete all the available material\naccumulated at the pressure maxima.

As such, we propose a new adversary\nresistant technique that obstructs attackers from constructing impactful\nadversarial samples by randomly nullifying features within samples. In this\nwork, we evaluate our proposed technique against a real world dataset with\n14,679 malware variants and 17,399 benign programs. We theoretically validate\nthe robustness of our technique, and empirically show that our technique\nsignificantly boosts DNN robustness to adversarial samples while maintaining\nhigh accuracy in classification. To demonstrate the general applicability of\nour proposed method, we also conduct experiments using the MNIST and CIFAR-10\ndatasets, generally used in image recognition research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 00:46:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 16:20:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 17:24:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2017 17:25:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-28"}

The\nsetup consisted of one NaI crystal to measure de-excitation and annihilation\nphotons associated with beta decay.

The setup was shielded from the reactor core by 8 m of\nuninterrupted concrete. Background radiation, responsible for ca. 1% of the\ntotal countrate with either source, increased by merely 3% when the reactor\nstatus changed from OFF to ON.

A correct assessment of correlated noise is\nfundamental to determine the true statistical significance of our findings.\nHere we review three of the most widely used correlated-noise estimators in the\nexoplanet field, the time-averaging, residual-permutation, and\nwavelet-likelihood methods. We argue that the residual-permutation method is\nunsound in estimating the uncertainty of parameter estimates. We thus recommend\nto refrain from this method altogether.

For neutrino masses of $0.1~{\\rm eV}$, we have found the\namplitude of annual modulation in the standard case is ${\\cal M} \\approx\n0.05\\%$, which will be increased to $0.1\\%$ and $0.15\\%$ in the presence of\nadditional thermal and nonthermal right-handed neutrinos, respectively. The\nfuture detection of such a modulation will be helpful in understanding the\nMajorana or Dirac nature of massive neutrinos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 10:23:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 06:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

The\nproposed method of the IBM team, consist of an intermediate speech separation\nand then a single-talker speech recognition.

Comparing it to the challenge\nwinner, it uses maximum uncertainty during the decoding which cannot be used in\nthe past two-phased method.

The non-linear fluid\ntheory developed by Schamel has identified three separate regimes of\nion-acoustic solitary waves based on the trapping parameter. Here, the\ndisintegration process and the resulting self-consistent IASWs are studied in a\nwide range of trapping parameters covering all the three regimes continuously.\nThe dependency of features such as the time of disintegration, the number,\nspeed and size of IASWs on the trapping parameter are focused upon. It is shown\nthat an increase in this parameter slows down the propagation of IASWs while\ndecreases their sizes in the phase space. These features of IASWs tend to\nsaturate for large value of trapping parameters. The disintegration time shows\na more complicated behavior than what was predicted by the theoretical\napproach. Also for the case of trapping parameters bigger than one, propagation\nof IASWs is observed in contrast with the theoretical predictions. The kinetic\nsimulation results unveil a smooth and well-defined dependency of solitary\nwaves' features on the trapping parameter, showing the possibility of bridging\nall the three regimes. Finally, it is shown that for beta around zero, the\nelectron phase space structure of the accompanying vortex stays symmetric. The\neffect of the electron-to-ion temperature ratio on the disintegration and the\npropagation of IASWs are considered as a benchmarking test of the simulation\ncode (in the nonlinear regime).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 12:34:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-06"}

The first\napproach is based on the popular Papanastasiou regularisation of the fluid\nrheology in conjunction with explicit modification of the lattice Boltzmann\nrelaxation rate. The second approach uses a locally-implicit formulation to\nsimultaneously solve for the fluid stress and the underlying particle\ndistribution functions. After investigating issues related to the lattice\nsymmetry and non-hydrodynamic Burnett stresses, the two models were compared in\nterms of spatial convergence and their behaviour in transient and inertial\nflows. The choice of lattice and the presence of Burnett stresses was found to\ninfluence the results of both models, however the latter did not significantly\ndegrade the velocity field. Using Bingham flows in ducts and synthetic porous\nmedia, it was found that the implicitly-regularised model was superior in\ncapturing transient and inertial fluid behaviour. This result presents\npotential implications for the application of the Papanastasiou-regularised\nmodel in such scenarios. In creeping flows the performance of both models was\nfound to be both similar and satisfactory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 12:46:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-06"}

An inherent\ndifficulty with this method is how to treat overlapping absorption, i.e.\nabsorption by more than one gas in a given spectral region. We have evaluated\nthe applicability of three different methods in hot Jupiter and brown dwarf\natmosphere models, all of which have been previously applied within models in\nthe literature: (i) Random overlap, both with and without resorting and\nrebinning, (ii) equivalent extinction and (iii) pre-mixing of opacities, where\n(i) and (ii) combine k-coefficients for different gases to obtain\nk-coefficients for a mixture of gases, while (iii) calculates k-coefficients\nfor a given mixture from the corresponding mixed line-by-line opacities. We\nfind that the random overlap method is the most accurate and flexible of these\ntreatments, and is fast enough to be used in one-dimensional models with\nresorting and rebinning. In three-dimensional models such as GCMs it is too\nslow, however, and equivalent extinction can provide a speed-up of at least a\nfactor of three with only a minor loss of accuracy while at the same time\nretaining the flexibility gained by combining k-coefficients computed for each\ngas individually.

A secondary objective\nwas to investigate the impact of image quantization.Material and methods: A\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act -compliant secondary\nanalysis of deidentified prospectively acquired PET/CT test-retest datasets of\n74 patients from multi-center Merck and ACRIN trials was performed.\nMetabolically active volumes were automatically delineated on PET with Fuzzy\nLocally Adaptive Bayesian algorithm. 3DSlicerTM was used to semi-automatically\ndelineate the anatomical volumes on low-dose CT components. Two quantization\nmethods were considered: a quantization into a set number of bins\n(quantizationB) and an alternative quantization with bins of fixed width\n(quantizationW). Four shape descriptors, ten first-order metrics and 26\ntextural features were computed. Bland-Altman analysis was used to quantify\nrepeatability. Features were subsequently categorized as very reliable,\nreliable, moderately reliable and poorly reliable with respect to the\ncorresponding volume variability. Results: Repeatability was highly variable\namongst features. Numerous metrics were identified as poorly or moderately\nreliable. Others were (very) reliable in both modalities, and in all categories\n(shape, 1st-, 2nd- and 3rd-order metrics). Image quantization played a major\nrole in the features repeatability. Features were more reliable in PET with\nquantizationB, whereas quantizationW showed better results in CT.Conclusion:\nThe test-retest repeatability of shape and heterogeneity features in PET and\nlow-dose CT varied greatly amongst metrics. The level of repeatability also\ndepended strongly on the quantization step, with different optimal choices for\neach modality. The repeatability of PET and low-dose CT features should be\ncarefully taken into account when selecting metrics to build multiparametric\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 12:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-06"}

The observed $\\dot M(t)$ is obtained from spectral modelling of the\narchival RXTE/PCA data.

Whereas\nlong time ago, Peierls and Landau's theoretical work demonstrated that any one-\nand two-dimensional materials could not exist in any finite temperature\nenvironment. Then, two basic issues became a central concern for many\nresearchers: How can stable low-D materials exist? What kind of low-D materials\nare stable? Here, we establish an energy stability criterion for low-D\nmaterials, which seeks to provide a clear answer to these questions. For a\ncertain kind of element, the stability of its specific low-D structure is\ndetermined by several derivatives of its interatomic potential.

In Newtonian gravity, the axisymmetry of the\nsystem about the black hole's velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ implies that the dynamical\nfriction must be anti-parallel to $\\mathbf{v}$. However, in general relativity\nthe black hole's spin $\\mathbf{S}$ need not be parallel to $\\mathbf{v}$,\nbreaking the axisymmetry of the system and generating a new component of\ndynamical friction similar to the Lorentz force $\\mathbf{F} = q\\mathbf{v}\n\\times \\mathbf{B}$ experienced by a particle with charge $q$ moving in a\nmagnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$.

So here we start from quadratic\nComplexe which yield naturally the 'light cone'\n$x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}-x_{0}^{2}=0$ when being related to (homogeneous)\npoint coordinates $x_{\\alpha}^{2}$ and infinitesimal dynamics by tetrahedral\nComplexe (or line elements). This introduces naturally projective\ntransformations by preserving anharmonic ratios. Referring to old work of\nPl{\\\"u}cker relating quadratic Complexe to optics, we discuss (linear)\nsymplectic symmetry and line coordinates, the main purpose and thread within\nthis paper, however, is the identification and discussion of special relativity\nas direct invariance properties of line/Complex coordinates as well as their\nrelation to 'quantum field theory' by complexification of point coordinates or\nComplexe. This can be established by the Lie mapping which relates\nlines/Complexe to sphere geometry so that SU(2), SU(2)$\\times$U(1),\nSU(2)$\\times$SU(2) and the Dirac spinor description emerge without additional\nassumptions. We give a short outlook in that quadratic Complexe are related to\ndynamics e.g.~power expressions in terms of six-vector products of Complexe,\nand action principles may be applied. (Quadratic) products like\n$F^{\\mu\\nu}F_{\\mu\\nu}$ or $F^{a\\,\\mu\\nu}F^{a}_{\\mu\\nu}$, $1\\leq a\\leq 3$ are\nnatural quadratic Complex expressions ('invariants') which may be extended by\nline constraints $\\lambda k\\cdot\\epsilon=0$ with respect to an 'action\nprinciple' so that we identify 'quantum field theory' with projective or\nline/Complex geometry having applied the Lie mapping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 11:53:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

We\npresent a new inference algorithm to infer CensusSTL formulae from the\ntrajectory data of a group of agents. We first identify the \"inner logic\" STL\nformula and then infer the subgroups based on whether the agents' behaviors\nsatisfy the \"inner logic\" formula at each time point. We use two different\napproaches to infer the subgroups based on similarity and complementarity,\nrespectively. The \"outer logic\" CensusSTL formula is inferred from the census\ntrajectories of different subgroups. We apply the algorithm in analyzing data\nfrom a soccer match by inferring the CensusSTL formula for different subgroups\nof a soccer team.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 14:27:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

A Thermodynamic approach to socio-economics has\nbrought to a new interdisciplinary scientific field called econophysics. Why\nthermodynamic? Thermodynamic is a statistical theory for large atomic system\nunder constraints of energy[1] and the economy can be considered a large system\ngoverned by complex rules. The present job proposes a new application, starting\nfrom econophysic, passing throughout the thermodynamic laws to interpret and to\ndescribed the Technology Transfer (TT) activities. Using the definition of\neconomy (i.e. economy[dictionary def.] = the process or system by which goods\nand services are produced, sold, and bought in a country or region) the TT can\nbe considered an important sub-domain of the economy and a transversal new area\nof the scientific research. The TT is the process of transferring knowledge,\nthat uses the results from the research to produce innovation and to ensure\nthat scientific and technological developments could become accessible to a\nwider range of users. Starting from important Universities (MIT, Stanford,\nOxford, etc) nowadays the TT is assuming a central role. It is called the third\nmission, together with education and research. The importance to provide new\ntheories and tools to describe the TT activities and their behavior, has been\nretained fundamental to support the social rapid evolution that is involving\nthe TT offices. The presented work uses the thermodynamic theories applying\nthem to Technology Transfer and starting from the concept of entropy, exergy\nand anergy. The output analysis should become an help to make decision to\nimprove the TT activities and a better resources employment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2016 18:36:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}
