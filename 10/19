Here we\ninvestigate the origin of these asymmetries through three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations describing the outburst during the first 20 days of\nevolution. The model takes into account thermal conduction and radiative\ncooling and assumes a blast wave propagates through an equatorial density\nenhancement. From the simulations, we synthesize the X-ray emission and derive\nthe spectra as they would be observed with Chandra. We find that both the blast\nwave and the ejecta distribution are efficiently collimated in polar directions\ndue to the presence of the equatorial density enhancement. The majority of the\nX-ray emission originates from the interaction of the blast with the equatorial\ndensity enhancement and is concentrated on the equatorial plane as a ring-like\nstructure.

While simple, this algorithm has a main drawback:\nit cannot scale to high-dimensional feature spaces since the number of regions\nincrease exponentially with the number of dimensions. In this paper, we address\nthis limitation by introducing a simple extension of MAP-Elites that has a\nconstant, pre-defined number of regions irrespective of the dimensionality of\nthe feature space. Our main insight is that methods from computational geometry\ncould partition a high-dimensional space into well-spread geometric regions.

Unfortunately,\nprobabilistic program inference is often intractable, and existing PPLs mostly\nrely on expensive, approximate sampling-based methods. To alleviate this\nproblem, one could try to learn from past inferences, so that future inferences\nrun faster. This strategy is known as amortized inference; it has recently been\napplied to Bayesian networks and deep generative models. This paper proposes a\nsystem for amortized inference in PPLs. In our system, amortization comes in\nthe form of a parameterized guide program. Guide programs have similar\nstructure to the original program, but can have richer data flow, including\nneural network components. These networks can be optimized so that the guide\napproximately samples from the posterior distribution defined by the original\nprogram. We present a flexible interface for defining guide programs and a\nstochastic gradient-based scheme for optimizing guide parameters, as well as\nsome preliminary results on automatically deriving guide programs. We explore\nin detail the common machine learning pattern in which a 'local' model is\nspecified by 'global' random values and used to generate independent observed\ndata points; this gives rise to amortized local inference supporting global\nmodel learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 18:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

Key examples include the\nTully-Fisher relation (TFR) --- i.e., the tight correlation between luminosity\n($L$) and rotational velocity ($V_\\textrm{rot}$) --- and the 3-dimensional\nluminosity-velocity-radius ($LVR$) scaling relation. Several past studies have\ncharacterized the MW as a 1--1.5$\\sigma$ outlier to the TFR. This study\nreexamines such comparisons using new estimates of MW properties that are\nrobust to many of the systematic uncertainties that have been a problem in the\npast and are based on assumptions consistent with those used for other spiral\ngalaxies. Comparing to scaling relations derived from modern extragalactic\ndata, we find that our Galaxy's properties are in excellent agreement with TFRs\ndefined using any SDSS-filter absolute magnitude, stellar mass, or baryonic\nmass as the $L$ proxy. We next utilize disk scale length ($R_\\textrm{d}$)\nmeasurements to extend this investigation to the $LVR$ relation. Here we find\nthat our Galaxy lies farther from the relation than $\\sim$90\\% of other spiral\ngalaxies, yielding $\\sim$9.5$\\sigma$ evidence that it is unusually compact for\nits $L$ and $V_\\textrm{rot}$ (based on MW errors alone), a result that holds\nfor all of the $L$ proxies considered. The expected $R_\\textrm{d}$ for the MW\nfrom the $LVR$ relation is $\\sim$5 kpc, nearly twice as large as the observed\nvalue, with error estimates placing the two in tension at the $\\sim$1.4$\\sigma$\nlevel. The compact scale length of the Galactic disk could be related to other\nways in which the MW has been found to be anomalous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

However, most models\nover-predict the number of low-mass galaxies at high redshifts and the color of\nmodel galaxies are not right in the sense that low-mass satellite galaxies are\ntoo red and centrals are too blue. The recent version of the L-Galaxies model\nby Henriques et al.(H15) is a step forward to solve these problems by\nreproducing the evolution of stellar mass function and the overall fraction of\nred galaxies. In this paper we compare the two model predictions of L-Galaxies\n(the other is Guo et al. , G13) to the SDSS data in detail. We find that in the\nH15 model the red fraction of central galaxies now agrees with the data due to\ntheir implementation of strong AGN feedback, but the stellar mass of centrals\nin massive haloes is now slightly lower than the data. For satellite galaxies,\nthe red fraction of low-mass galaxies ($\\log M_{*}/M_{\\odot} < 10$) also agrees\nwith the data, but the color of massive satellites ($10 < \\log M_{*}/M_{\\odot}\n< 11$) is slightly bluer.

The walkers are animals such as rodents in considerations of the\nHantavirus epidemic, infected or susceptible, the reaction is the transmission\nof infection, and the confining potential represents the tendency of the\nanimals to stay in the neighborhood of their home range centers. Calculations\nare based on a recently developed formalism (Kenkre and Sugaya, Bull. Math.\nBio. 76, 3016 (2014)) structured around analytic solutions of a Smoluchowski\nequation and one of its aims is the resolution of peculiar but well-known\nproblems of reaction-diffusion theory in 2-dimensions. In the present analysis,\nreaction occurs not at points but in spatial regions of dimensions larger than\n0. The analysis uncovers interesting nonintuitive phenomena one of which is\nsimilar to that encountered in the 1-dimensional analysis given in the quoted\narticle, and another specific to the fact that the reaction region is spatially\nextended. The analysis additionally provides a realistic description of\nobservations on animals transmitting infection while moving on what is\neffectively a 2-dimensional landscape. Along with the general formalism and\nexplicit 1-dimensional analysis given in Bull. Math. Bio. 76, 3016 (2014), the\npresent work forms a model calculational tool for the analysis for the\ntransmission of infection in dilute systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 21:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-20"}

A key\ncomponent of monitoring is an effective method for detecting the change in\nlower percentiles of the solid lumber strength based on multiple samples. In a\nrecent study by Verrill et al.\\ (2015), eight statistical tests proposed by\nwood scientists were examined thoroughly based on real and simulated data sets.\nThese tests are found unsatisfactory in differing aspects such as seriously\ninflated false alarm rate when observations are clustered, suboptimal power\nproperties, or having inconvenient ad hoc rejection regions.

In this paper, we use a\nnonparametric random effects model to handle the within cluster correlations,\ncomposite empirical likelihood to avoid explicit modelling of the correlations\nstructure, and a density ratio model to combine the information from multiple\nsamples. In addition, we propose a cluster-based bootstrapping procedure to\nconstruct the monitoring test on quantiles which satisfactorily controls the\ntype I error in the presence of within cluster correlation.

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is popular\nin solving MF problems because it can deal with large data sets and is easy to\ndo incremental learning. We observed that SGD for MF is memory bound.\nMeanwhile, single-node CPU systems with caching performs well only for small\ndata sets; distributed systems have higher aggregated memory bandwidth but\nsuffer from relatively slow network connection. This observation inspires us to\naccelerate MF by utilizing GPUs's high memory bandwidth and fast intra-node\nconnection. We present cuMF_SGD, a CUDA-based SGD solution for large-scale MF\nproblems. On a single CPU, we design two workload schedule schemes, i.e.,\nbatch-Hogwild! and wavefront-update that fully exploit the massive amount of\ncores. Especially, batch-Hogwild! as a vectorized version of Hogwild! overcomes\nthe issue of memory discontinuity. We also develop highly-optimized kernels for\nSGD update, leveraging cache, warp-shuffle instructions and half-precision\nfloats.

To test this, we learn a quadrotor dynamics model using only\ntranslational and only rotational training trajectories, each of which can be\ncontrolled independently, and then use it to simultaneously control the yaw and\nposition of a quadrotor, which is non-trivial because of nonlinear couplings\nbetween the two motions.

Some materials hosting Dirac fermions are natural\nplatforms for interlayer coherence effects such as Coulomb drag and exciton\ncondensation. Here we determine the role played by the anomalous Hall effect in\nCoulomb drag in massive Dirac fermion systems. We focus on topological\ninsulator films with out-of plane magnetizations in both the active and passive\nlayers. The transverse response of the active layer is dominated by a\ntopological term arising from the Berry curvature. We show that the topological\nmechanism does not contribute to Coulomb drag, yet the longitudinal drag force\nin the passive layer gives rise to a transverse drag current. This anomalous\nHall drag current is independent of the active-layer magnetization, a fact that\ncan be verified experimentally. It depends non-monotonically on the\npassive-layer magnetization, exhibiting a peak that becomes more pronounced at\nlow densities. These findings should stimulate new experiments and quantitative\nstudies of anomalous Hall drag.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 05:16:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

Upcoming large surveys are going to\ntake images of billions of point sources, including many faint stars, with\nshort exposure times. Real-time estimation of the centroids of stars is crucial\nfor real-time PSF estimation, and maximal precision is required for\nmeasurements of proper motion.\n  The fundamental Cram\\'{e}r-Rao lower bound sets a limit on the\nroot-mean-squared-error achievable by optimal estimators. In this work, we aim\nto compare the performance of various centroiding methods, in terms of\nsaturating the bound, when they are applied to relatively low signal-to-noise\nratio unsaturated stars assuming zero-mean constant Gaussian noise. In order to\nmake this comparison, we present the ratio of the root-mean-squared-errors of\nthese estimators to their corresponding Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound as a function of\nthe signal-to-noise ratio and the full-width at half-maximum of faint stars.\n  We discuss two general circumstances in centroiding of faint stars: (i) when\nwe have a good estimate of the PSF, (ii) when we do not know the PSF. In the\ncase that we know the PSF, we show that a fast polynomial centroiding after\nsmoothing the image by the PSF can be as efficient as the maximum-likelihood\nestimator at saturating the bound. In the case that we do not know the PSF, we\ndemonstrate that although polynomial centroiding is not as optimal as PSF\nprofile fitting, it comes very close to saturating the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao lower\nbound in a wide range of conditions. We also show that the moment-based method\nof center-of-light never comes close to saturating the bound, and thus it does\nnot deliver reliable estimates of centroids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 05:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-20"}

Quark matter is\ndescribed as a mixture of free Fermi gases composed by quarks $u$, $d$, $s$ and\nelectrons, in chemical equilibrium under weak interactions. Due to the presence\nof strong magnetic fields the particles' transverse motion is quantized into\nLandau levels, and the surface tension has a different value in the parallel\nand transverse directions with respect to the magnetic field.\n  We calculate the transverse and longitudinal surface tension for different\nvalues of the magnetic field and for quark matter drops with different sizes,\nfrom a few fm to the bulk limit. For baryon number densities between $2-10$\ntimes the nuclear saturation density, the surface tension falls in the range $2\n- 20$ MeV /fm$^{2}$. The largest contribution comes from strange quarks which\nhave a surface tension an order of magnitude larger than the one for $u$ or $d$\nquarks and more than two orders of magnitude larger than for electrons. Our\nresults show that the total surface tension is quite insensitive to the size of\nthe drop.

These CRRs were much larger, more anisotropic and\noccurred more frequently than CRRs in the bulk ($d\\gtrsim100$ particles) or\nafter deposition. Their centers of mass moved towards the surface, while the\nparticles within moved towards the bulk, causing free-volume \"bubbles\" to move\ntowards the surface to give a more compact bulk glass. This two-step relaxation\nin two surface layers is distinct from the previously assumed relaxation in one\nsurface mobile layer\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 07:43:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-20"}

Despite the increasing interest in M dwarfs, our knowledge of the\nchromospheres of these stars is far from being complete. We aim to test whether\nthe relations between activity, rotation, and stellar parameters and flux-flux\nrelationships also hold for early-M dwarfs on the main-sequence. We analyse in\nan homogeneous and coherent way a well defined sample of 71 late-K/early-M\ndwarfs that are currently being observed in the framework of the HArps-n red\nDwarf Exoplanet Survey (HADES). Rotational velocities are derived using the\ncross-correlation technique while emission flux excesses in the Ca II H & K and\nBalmer lines from Halpha up to Hepsilon are obtained by using the spectral\nsubtraction technique. The relationships between the emission excesses and the\nstellar parameters are studied. Relations between pairs of fluxes of different\nchromospheric lines are also studied. We find that the strength of the\nchromospheric emission in the Ca II H & K and Balmer lines is roughly constant\nfor stars in the M0-M3 spectral range. Our data suggest that a moderate but\nsignificant correlation between activity and rotation might be present as well\nas a hint of kinematically selected young stars showing higher levels of\nemission. We find our sample of M dwarfs to be complementary in terms of\nchromospheric and X-ray fluxes with those of the literature, extending the\nanalysis of the flux-flux relationships to the very low flux domain. Our\nresults agree with previous works suggesting that the activity-rotation-age\nrelationship known to hold for solar-type stars also applies to early-M dwarfs.\nWe also confirm previous findings that the field stars which deviate from the\nbulk of the empirical flux-flux relationships show evidence of youth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 08:20:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 09:16:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

Understanding their magnetic activity is important because it affects our\nability to detect small planets, and it plays a key role in the\ncharacterization of the stellar environment. We analyze observations of the Ca\nII H&K and H{\\alpha} lines as diagnostics of chromospheric activity for\nlow-activity early-type M dwarfs. We analyze the time series of spectra of 71\nearly-type M dwarfs collected for the HADES project for planet search purposes.\nThe HARPS-N spectra provide simultaneously the H&K doublet and the H{\\alpha}\nline. We develop a reduction scheme able to correct the HARPS-N spectra for\ninstrumental and atmospheric effects, and to provide flux-calibrated spectra in\nunits of flux at the stellar surface. The H&K and H{\\alpha} fluxes are compared\nwith each other, and their variability is analyzed. We find that the H and K\nflux excesses are strongly correlated with each other, while the H{\\alpha} flux\nexcess is generally less correlated with the H&K doublet. We also find that\nH{\\alpha} emission does not increase monotonically with the H&K line flux,\nshowing some absorption before being filled in by chromospheric emission when\nH&K activity increases. Analyzing the time variability of the emission fluxes,\nwe derive a tentative estimate of the rotation period (of the order of a few\ntens of days) for some of the program stars, and the typical lifetime of\nchromospheric active regions (a few stellar rotations). Our results are in good\nagreement with previous studies. In particular, we find evidence that the\nchromospheres of early-type M dwarfs could be characterized by different\nfilaments coverage, affecting the formation mechanism of the H{\\alpha} line. We\nalso show that chromospheric structure is likely related to spectral type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 09:16:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-06"}

Currently, the\ncommonly applied method is by visual inspection, which is very time-consuming\nand it is easy to overlook some noisy bands. In this study, we find an inherent\nconnection between target detection algorithms and the corrupted band removal.\nAs an example, for the matched filter (MF), which is the most widely used\ntarget detection method for hyperspectral data, we present an automatic\nMF-based algorithm for bad band identification. The MF detector is a filter\nvector, and the resulting filter output is the sum of all bands weighted by the\nMF coefficients. Therefore, we can identify bad bands only by using the MF\nfilter vector itself, the absolute value of whose entry accounts for the\nimportance of each band for the target detection. For a specific target of\ninterest, the bands with small MF weights correspond to the noisy or bad ones.\nBased on this fact, we develop an automatic bad band preremoval algorithm by\nutilizing the average absolute value of MF weights for multiple targets within\na scene. Experiments with three well known hyperspectral datasets show that our\nmethod can always identify the water absorption and other low signal-to-noise\n(SNR) bands that are usually chosen as bad bands manually.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 09:31:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-20"}

We report here on the analysis of a well-observed\nimplosion in the form of an arcade contraction associated with a filament\neruption, during the C3.5 flare SOL2013-06-19T07:29. A sequence of events\nincluding magnetic flux-rope instability and distortion, followed by filament\neruption and arcade implosion, lead us to conclude that the implosion arises\nfrom the transfer of magnetic energy from beneath the arcade as part of the\nglobal magnetic instability, rather than due to local magnetic energy\ndissipation in the flare. The observed net contraction of the imploding loops,\nwhich is found also in nonlinear force-free field extrapolations, reflects a\npermanent reduction of magnetic energy underneath the arcade. This event shows\nthat, in addition to resulting in expansion or eruption of overlying field,\nflux-rope instability can also simultaneously implode unopened field due to\nmagnetic energy transfer. It demonstrates the \"partial opening of the field\"\nscenario, which is one of the ways in 3D to produce a magnetic eruption without\nviolating the Aly-Sturrock hypothesis. In the framework of this observation we\nalso propose a unification of three main concepts for active region magnetic\nevolution, namely the metastable eruption model, the implosion conjecture, and\nthe standard \"CSHKP\" flare model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 09:35:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-06"}

We also propose a novel IMU\ninitialization method, which computes the scale, the gravity direction, the\nvelocity, and gyroscope and accelerometer biases, in a few seconds with high\naccuracy. We test our system in the 11 sequences of a recent micro-aerial\nvehicle public dataset achieving a typical scale factor error of 1% and\ncentimeter precision. We compare to the state-of-the-art in visual-inertial\nodometry in sequences with revisiting, proving the better accuracy of our\nmethod due to map reuse and no drift accumulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 10:17:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 15:45:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

When an electron beam is launched in a\nplasma of Maxwellian electrons and motionless protons and this initial\nequilibrium is perturbed by a monochromatic density disturbance, the electric\nfield amplitude grows exponentially in time and then undergoes nonlinear\nsaturation, associated with the kinetic effects of particle trapping and phase\nspace vortex generation.

This scenario introduces a new field of transverse\nwaves. Significance of the theory rests on a mathematical theorem associated\nwith the conservation law of current flux, expressed in a form of 4d physical\nspace-time representation, which predicts a system of Maxwell-type equation and\nsupports transverse waves traveling with a phase speed c_t. In regard to the\nstreaky wall flows, there exist both dynamical mechanism and energy channel\nwhich excite transverse waves and exchange energy between flow field and wave\nfield. Energy is supplied from the flow field to the wave field if wavelengths\nare sufficiently large. The waves are accompanied with a new mechanism of\nenergy dissipation, an internal friction analogous to the Ohm's effect. Some\npart of the energy is dissipated into heat. Thus, there exists a sustaining\nmechanism, which implies that the streaky structure of wall-bounded turbulence\nis a dissipative structure.\n  The predictions are consistent with experimental observations of wall\nturbulence: (i) Existence of traveling waves: The waves are characterized by\ntwo scales of wavelength and a damping-length d. (ii) Existence of two large\nscales (LSM and VLSM) observed in turbulent shear flows: Those are interpreted\nby the waves amplified with the transient growth mechanism and maintained by\ninteraction with the new transverse wave field. The waves are robust since they\nhave their own energy and momentum. (iii) Enhanced energy dissipation in wavy\nturbulence. Its bulk rate of energy dissipation takes a form resembling the\nmodels of eddy-viscosity, and its coefficient \\nu_D is estimated to be of the\norder of c_t d and much larger than the molecular viscosity.\n  No self-contradiction is incurred by the new field introduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 12:06:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 12:05:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

This systematic tendency in\neye guidance likely masks attentional selection driven by image properties and\ntop-down cognitive processes. Here we show that the central fixation bias can\nbe reduced by delaying the initial saccade relative to image onset. In four\nscene-viewing experiments we manipulated observers' initial gaze position and\ndelayed their first saccade by a specific time interval relative to the onset\nof an image. We analyzed the distance to image center over time and show that\nthe central fixation bias of initial fixations was significantly reduced after\ndelayed saccade onsets. We additionally show that selection of the initial\nsaccade target strongly depended on the first saccade latency. Processes\ninfluencing the time course of the central fixation bias were investigated by\ncomparing simulations of several dynamic and statistical models. Model\ncomparisons suggest that the central fixation bias is generated by a default\nactivation as a response to the sudden image onset and that this default\nactivation pattern decreases over time. Our results suggest that it may often\nbe preferable to use a modified version of the scene viewing paradigm that\ndecouples image onset from the start signal for scene exploration and\nexplicitly controls the central fixation bias.

Algorithms for identifying dense subgraphs are\nused in biology, in finance, in spam detection, etc. Standard formulations of\nthis problem such as the problem of finding the maximum clique of a graph are\nhard to solve. However, some tractable formulations of the problem have also\nbeen proposed, focusing mainly on optimizing some density function, such as the\ndegree density and the triangle density. However, maximization of degree\ndensity usually leads to large subgraphs with small density. In this paper, we\nintroduce the k-clique-graph densest subgraph problem, k >= 3, a novel\nformulation for the discovery of dense subgraphs. Given an input graph, its\nk-clique-graph is a new graph created from the input graph where each vertex of\nthe new graph corresponds to a k-clique of the input graph and two vertices are\nconnected with an edge if they share a common (k-1)-clique. We define a simple\ndensity function, the k-clique-graph density, which gives compact and at the\nsame time dense subgraphs, and we project its resulting subgraphs back to the\ninput graph. In this paper we focus on the triangle-graph densest subgraph\nproblem obtained for k=3. To optimize the proposed function, we present an\nefficient greedy approximation algorithm that scales well to larger graphs. We\nevaluate the proposed algorithm on real datasets and compare it with other\nalgorithms in terms of the size and the density of the extracted subgraphs. The\nresults verify the ability of the proposed algorithm in finding high-quality\nsubgraphs in terms of size and density. Finally, we apply the proposed method\nto the important problem of keyword extraction from textual documents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 13:28:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2016 07:25:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2018 17:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-10"}

Stellarators in which the orbit-averaged radial magnetic drift vanishes\nare called omnigeneous, and they exhibit neoclassical transport levels\ncomparable to those of axisymmetric tokamaks. However, the effect of deviations\nfrom omnigeneity cannot be neglected in practice. For sufficiently low\ncollision frequencies (below the values that define the $1/\\nu$ regime), the\ncomponents of the drifts tangential to the flux surface become relevant. This\narticle focuses on the study of such collisionality regimes in stellarators\nclose to omnigeneity when the gradient of the non-omnigeneous perturbation is\nsmall. First, it is proven that closeness to omnigeneity is required to\npreserve radial locality in the drift-kinetic equation for collisionalities\nbelow the $1/\\nu$ regime. Then, it is shown that neoclassical transport is\ndetermined by two layers in phase space. One of the layers corresponds to the\n$\\sqrt{\\nu}$ regime and the other to the superbanana-plateau regime. The\nimportance of the superbanana-plateau layer for the calculation of the\ntangential electric field is emphasized, as well as the relevance of the latter\nfor neoclassical transport in the collisionality regimes considered in this\npaper. In particular, the tangential electric field is essential for the\nemergence of a new subregime of superbanana-plateau transport when the radial\nelectric field is small. A formula for the ion energy flux that includes the\n$\\sqrt{\\nu}$ regime and the superbanana-plateau regime is given. The energy\nflux scales with the square of the size of the deviation from omnigeneity.\nFinally, it is explained why below a certain collisionality value the\nformulation presented in this article ceases to be valid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 14:05:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 14:25:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 11:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

Methodology: Germination of seeds was evaluated under salt stresses\nusing 5 treatment levels: 0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mM of NaCl. Corrected\ngermination rate (GC), germination rate index (GRI) and mean germination time\n(MGT) were recorded during 10 days. Results: The results indicated that\ngermination was significantly reduced in all species with the increase in NaCl\nconcentrations. However, significant interspecific variation for salt tolerance\nwas observed. The greatest variability in tolerance was observed at moderate\nsalt stress (200 mM of NaCl) and the decrease in germination appeared to be\nmore accentuated in A. cyanophylla and A. cyclops. Although, A. raddiana,\nremains the most interesting, it preserved the highest percentage (GC = 80%)\nand velocity of germination in all species studied in this study, even in the\nhigh salt levels. This species exhibited a particular adaptability to salt\nenvironment, at least at this stage in the life cycle and could be recommended\nfor plantation establishment in salt affected areas. On the other hand, when\nungerminated seeds were transferred from NaCl treatments to distilled water,\nthey recovered largely their germination without a lag period and with high\nspeed.

This is followed by an upturn of resistivity in low temperature\nregion when the pressure is increased, which is explained as a semiconductor\nbehavior. This feature gradually gets enhanced up to a pressure of about\n2.52GPa. Then a non-monotonic temperature dependent resistivity appears upon\nfurther increasing pressure, which is accompanied by a strong suppression to\nthe low temperature resistivity upturn. Simultaneously, a superconducting\ntransition occurs at about 3.92K under a pressure of about 2.63GPa. With\nfurther increasing pressure, a second superconducting transition emerges at\nabout 7K under about 2.8GPa. For these two superconducting states, the\nsuperconductivity induced magnetic screening volumes are quite large.

We find a long-term decrease in the proton temperature-speed (Tp-Vp)\nslope that lasted from 1972 to 2010, but has been trending upward since 2010.\nSince the solar wind proton density-speed (np-Vp) relationship is not linear\nlike the Tp-Vp relationship, we perform power law fits for np-Vp.

The\nadditional objections that are particular to the proposal, such as the physical\ninterpretation/origin of the flea perturbation, the use of potentials to solve\na dynamical problem, slow collapse times, the inability to handle unequal\nprobabilities, and the dictatorial role of the flea perturbation, lead us to\nbelieve that the Landsman-Reuvers proposal is lacking in both physical\ngrounding and theoretical promise. Finally, an overview is given of the\nchallenges that were encountered in this attempt to solve the measurement\nproblem from within quantum theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 17:36:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-20"}

Similar to linear tomosynthesis, the source and detector\nare translated in opposite directions and the data acquisition system targets\non a region-of-interest (ROI) to acquire data for image reconstruction. This\nkind of tomography architecture was named parallel translational computed\ntomography (PTCT). In our previous studies, filtered backprojection (FBP)-type\nalgorithms were developed to reconstruct images from PTCT. However, the\nreconstructed ROI images from truncated projections have severe truncation\nartifacts. In this paper, we propose two backprojection filtering (BPF)-type\nalgorithms named MP-BPF and MZ-BPF to reconstruct ROI images from truncated\nPTCT data. A weight function is constructed to deal with data redundancy for\nmulti-linear translations modes. Extensive numerical simulations are performed\nto evaluate the proposed MP-BPF and MZ-BPF algorithms for PTCT in fan-beam\ngeometry.

Precise estimates of the probabilities of occurrence and level\nof extreme concentrations are formidable due to the combination of complex\nphysical and chemical processes involved.

In this paper, extremes of\nnitrogen oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO$_2$) and ozone (O$_3$) concentrations\nare investigated using two models.

In particular, our analysis reveals an\nintriguing connection between fast mixing and the existence of smooth\nmeasure-preserving mappings from a convex space to the non-convex space. For\nplanning, we show advantages of Hit-and-Run compared to state-of-the-art\nplanning methods such as Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 04:39:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-28"}

One of the benefits of SVM algorithms, compared with neural\nnetworks and decision trees is that they can be less susceptible to over\nfitting than those other algorithms are to over training. This issue is related\nto the generalisation of a multivariate algorithm (MVA); a problem that has\noften been overlooked in particle physics. We discuss cross validation and how\nthis can be used to improve the generalisation of a MVA in the context of High\nEnergy Physics analyses. The examples presented use the Toolkit for\nMultivariate Analysis (TMVA) based on ROOT and describe our improvements to the\nSVM functionality and new tools introduced for cross validation within this\nframework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 15:13:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

The model describes the elastic\nproperties of flat periodic structure. With this model the behavior of a\ntwo-dimensional array of infinite fibers is simulated. The material that\ncontains a row of broken fibers is considered. These broken fibers form the\nfailure in the material that shapes like a long straight crack. The lattice is\ntensioned in the direction, which is orthogonal to the direction of straight\ncrack. The conditions of fracture of this lattice are investigated. The closed\nform expression for the stress in the first unbroken fiber and the expression\nfor fracture toughness are given. These values are the functions of mechanical\nparameters of lattice and tensions in both families of fibers. The closed form\nsolution demonstrates a notable behavior of the material. Namely, the fracture\nbehavior of two-dimensional lattice is cardinally depends upon the pre-stress\nin the material in the direction, parallel to crack direction. If the tension\nin fibers that parallel to the crack direction exists, it stabilizes the crack\ngrowth and makes the load distribution in the unbroken fibers more even. The\ntwo-dimensional lattice behaves in the presence of tension in both directions\nsimilarly to the plane elastic media. The finite length crack assumes the shape\nof the elongated elliptic split. Another behavior of lattice occurs if the\nfibers, parallel to crack direction, are unstressed. The character of stress\nconcentration near the crack differs. The load distribution at the crack tip\nvaries considerably. The first unbroken fiber carries higher load. The crack is\nlens-shaped and the crack borders form at the tip the finite angle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 08:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-05"}
