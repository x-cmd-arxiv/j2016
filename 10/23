A fundamental understanding of these\nprocesses is still far from being achieved. Here, we characterize creep and\nfluidization on the basis of a mesoscopic viscoplastic model that includes\nthermally activated yielding events and a broad distribution of energy\nbarriers, which may be lowered under the effect of a local deformation. We\nrelate the creep exponent observed before fluidization to the width of barrier\ndistribution and to the specific form of stress redistribution following\nyielding events. We show that Andrade creep is accompanied by local\nstrain-hardening driven by stress redistribution and find that the fluidization\ndepends exponentially on the applied stress. The simulation results are\ninterpreted in the light of a mean-field analysis, and should help in\nrationalizing the creep phenomenology of amorphous solids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2016 16:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}

Yet their collective actions also allow\nus to learn something about the world, in particular, infer attributes of\nplaces people visit or interact with. Imagine classifying whether a hotel has a\ngym or a swimming pool, or whether a restaurant has a romantic atmosphere\nwithout ever asking its patrons. Algorithms we present can do just that.\n  Many web applications rely on knowing attributes of places, for instance,\nwhether a particular restaurant has WiFi or offers outdoor seating. Such data\ncan be used to support a range of user experiences, from explicit query-driven\nsearch to personalized place recommendations. However, obtaining these\nattributes is generally difficult, with existing approaches relying on\ncrowdsourcing or parsing online reviews, both of which are noisy, biased, and\nhave limited coverage. Here we present a novel approach to classifying place\nattributes, which learns from patrons' visit patterns based on anonymous\nobservational data.\n  Our method, STEPS, learns from aggregated sequences of place visits. For\nexample, if many people visit the restaurant on a Saturday evening, coming from\na luxury hotel or theater, and stay for a long time, then this restaurant is\nmore likely to have a romantic atmosphere. On the other hand, if most people\nvisit the restaurant on weekdays, coming from work or a grocery store, then the\nrestaurant is less likely to be romantic. We show that such transition features\nare highly predictive of place attributes. In an extensive empirical\nevaluation, STEPS nearly doubled the coverage of a state of the art approach\nthanks to learning from observational location data, which allowed our method\nto reason about many more places.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2016 19:41:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}

The bounds in the nonsparse case are\ntight up to polylogarithmic factors, while in the sparse case the bounds are\ntight up to a multiplicative factor in $d$ for large $d$.

The BS provides the dynamical\norigin of the electroweak symmetry breaking, triggered by mixing between the\nelementary Higgs and a composite Higgs generated by a new-color strong\ndynamics, hypercolor (HC). At the HC strong coupling scale, the classical-scale\ninvariance assumed in the model is dynamically broken as well as the \"chiral\"\nsymmetry present in the HC sector. In addition to the composite Higgs, HC\nbaryons emerge to potentially be stable because of the unbroken HC baryon\nnumber symmetry. Hence the lightest HC baryon can be a DM candidate. Of\ninterest in the present scenario is that HC pions can be as heavy as the HC\nbaryon due to the possibly enhanced-explicit \"chiral\"-breaking effect triggered\nafter the BS mechanism, so the HC baryon pair cannot annihilate into HC pions.\nAs in the standard setup of freeze-in scenario, it is assumed that the DM was\nnever in the thermal equilibrium, which ends up with no thermal abundance. It\nis then the non-thermal BSP process that crucially comes into the game below\nthe HC scale: the HC baryon significantly couples to the standard-model Higgs\nvia the BS mechanism, and can non-thermally be produced from the thermal plasma\nbelow the HC scale, which turns out to allow the TeV mass scale for the\ncomposite baryonic DM, much smaller than the generic bound placed in the\nconventional thermal freeze-out scenario, to account for the observed relic\nabundance.

The main characteristics of the design are: beam energy 45 to 175\nGeV, 100 km circumference with two interaction points (IPs) per ring,\nhorizontal crossing angle of 30 mrad at the IP and the crab-waist scheme [1]\nwith local chromaticity correction. The crab-waist scheme is implemented within\nthe local chromaticity correction system without additional sextupoles, by\nreducing the strength of one of the two sextupoles for vertical chromatic\ncorrection at each side of the IP. So-called \"tapering\" of the magnets is\napplied, which scales all fields of the magnets according to the local beam\nenergy to compensate for the effect of synchrotron radiation (SR) loss along\nthe ring. An asymmetric layout near the interaction region reduces the critical\nenergy of SR photons on the incoming side of the IP to values below 100 keV,\nwhile matching the geometry to the beam line of the FCC proton collider\n(FCC-hh) [2] as closely as possible. Sufficient transverse/longitudinal dynamic\naperture (DA) has been obtained, including major dynamical effects, to assure\nan adequate beam lifetime in the presence of beamstrahlung and top-up\ninjection. In particular, a momentum acceptance larger than +/-2% has been\nobtained, which is better than the momentum acceptance of typical collider\nrings by about a factor of 2. The effects of the detector solenoids including\ntheir compensation elements are taken into account as well as synchrotron\nradiation in all magnets. The optics presented in this paper is a step toward a\nfull conceptual design for the collider.

In particular, for globally coupled systems,\nthe number of firing neurons monotonically reduces upon increasing the strength\nof inhibition (neurons' death). However, the random pruning of the connections\nis able to reverse the action of inhibition, i.e. in a sparse network a\nsufficiently strong synaptic strength can surprisingly promote, rather than\ndepress, the activity of the neurons (neurons' rebirth). Thus the number of\nfiring neurons reveals a minimum at some intermediate synaptic strength. We\nshow that this minimum signals a transition from a regime dominated by the\nneurons with higher firing activity to a phase where all neurons are\neffectively sub-threshold and their irregular firing is driven by current\nfluctuations. We explain the origin of the transition by deriving an analytic\nmean field formulation of the problem able to provide the fraction of active\nneurons as well as the first two moments of their firing statistics.

A mock-up corridor monitored using a camera placed on\nazimuthal position is used to study pedestrians' behavior in unidirectional and\nbidirectional flows. Additionally, a commercial tablet is fixed on the chest of\nsample pedestrians to examine their body rotation (or yawing) which cannot be\nobtained using position tracking alone. Angular velocity is recorded and\nsimultaneously stored in a central location using a wireless network, thus\nallowing the analysis of body movements with a high sampling rate and a limited\ndelay. To investigate the influence of major/minor flow proportion (flow-ratio)\non bidirectional streams two different situations were tested: the balanced\nconfiguration (with equal flows in both directions) and an unbalanced\nconfiguration (with different major and minor flow). Results clearly show that\nunidirectional flow is more stable compared to the bidirectional case,\nrequiring less time to cross the experimental section and showing a very small\namount of rotation during the whole experiment. Both bidirectional\nconfigurations showed high values of body rotation, in particular during lane\nformation and dissolution. Finally, rotation directly measured on pedestrians'\nbody was compared with the one obtained indirectly by analyzing pedestrians'\ntrajectories. The comparison shows that, at least from a qualitative point of\nview, both methods are in agreement, thus suggesting that even properties which\ncan only be measured by motion sensing could be obtained indirectly through the\nanalysis of trajectories. Concluding, it has been suggested that while lanes\nhelp smooth out bidirectional flows, larger instabilities are observed compared\nto the unidirectional case. Lane separation and/or appropriate guidance are\ntherefore required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2016 15:32:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2018 00:25:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2018 11:21:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 May 2018 13:49:29 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 08:36:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-09"}

Actually, we notice that the flow solves a radial L\\\"owner equation\nand as such, the general theory of L\\\"owner equations implies that it is\nunivalent in some connected region in the open unit disc. We also prove that\nits inverse defines the Aleksandrov-Clark measure at $z=1$ of some Herglotz\nfunction which is absolutely-continuous with an essentially bounded density. As\na by-product, we deduce that $z=1$ belongs only to the discrete spectrum of the\nunitary operator whose spectral dynamics are governed by the flow. Moreover, we\nuse a previous result due to the first author in order to derive an explicit,\nyet complicated, expression of the moments of both the unitary and the free\nJacobi processes. The paper is closed with some remarks on the boundary\nbehavior of the flow's inverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2016 06:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

This non-convex inverse problem is known\nas phase retrieval. The case considered in this paper concerns phaseless\nmeasurements taken with respect to a Gabor frame. It arises naturally in many\npractical applications, such as diffraction imaging and speech recognition. We\npresent a reconstruction algorithm that uses a nearly optimal number of\nphaseless time-frequency structured measurements and discuss its robustness in\nthe case when the measurements are corrupted by noise. We show how geometric\nproperties of the measurement frame are related to the robustness of the\nphaseless reconstruction. The presented algorithm is based on the idea of\npolarization as proposed by Alexeev, Bandeira, Fickus, and Mixon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2016 18:58:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 08:51:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-13"}
