Since \\eqref{main eq}\nadmits global-in-time solution with small initial data, to present shock\nformation, we consider a class of large data. Moreover, no symmetric assumption\nis imposed on the data. Compared to our previous work [18], here we pose data\non the hypersurface $\\{(t,x)|t=-r_{0}\\}$ instead of $\\{(t,x)|t=-2\\}$, with\n$r_{0}$ being arbitrarily large. We prove an a priori energy estimate\nindependent of $r_{0}$. Therefore a complete description of the solution\nbehavior as $r_{0}\\rightarrow\\infty$ is obtained. This allows us to relax the\nrestriction on the profile of initial data which still guarantees shock\nformation. Since \\eqref{main eq} can be viewed as a model equation for\ndescribing the propagation of electromagnetic waves in nonlinear dielectric,\nthe result in this paper reveals the possibility to use wave pulse with weak\nintensity to form electromagnetic shocks in laboratory. A main new feature in\nthe proof is that all estimates in the present paper do \\emph{not} depend on\nthe parameter $r_{0}$, which requires different methods to obtain energy\nestimates. As a byproduct, we prove the existence of semi-global-in-time\nsolutions which lead to shock formation by showing that the limits of the\ninitial energies exist as $r_{0}\\rightarrow\\infty$. The proof combines the\nideas in [5] where the the formation of shocks for 3-dimensional relativistic\ncompressible Euler equations with small initial data is established, and the\nshort pulse method introduced in [6] and generalized in [15], where the\nformation of black holes in general relativity is proved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 16:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-14"}

Recent studies show a scaling of the\ndivertor broadening with an inverse power law to the target temperature $T_t$,\npromising its reduction to be a way of distributing the power entering the\ndivertor volume onto a large surface area.\n  It is shown that for pure conductive transport in the divertor region the\nsuggested inverse power law scaling to $T_t$ is only valid for high target\nelectron temperatures. For decreasing target temperatures ($T_t < 20\\,$eV) the\nincrease of $S$ stagnates and the conductive model results in a finite value of\n$S$ even for zero target temperature. It is concluded that the target\ntemperature is no valid parameter for a power law scaling, as it is not\nrepresentative for the entire divertor volume. This is shown in simulations\nsolving the 2D heat diffusion equation, which is used as reference for an\nanalytic 1D model describing the divertor broadening along a field line solely\nby the ratio of the perpendicular to the parallel diffusivity.\n  By assuming the temperature dependence of these two quantities an integral\nform of $S$ is derived, relying only on the temperature distribution along the\nseparatrix between X-point and target. Integration along the separatrix results\nin an approximation for $S$, being in agreement with the 2D simulations. This\nmodel is also applicable to scenarios including heat losses, e.g. due to\nradiation.\n  Convective transport can not be neglected for high recycling conditions,\nhence the derived expression for $S$ is not expected to hold. However, based on\nthe non-vanishing parallel transport, respective the finite parallel transport\ntime, the divertor broadening is expected to reach a finite value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 16:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-28"}

In time division duplexing systems, however, the reuse of uplink\ntraining pilots among cells results in additional channel estimation error,\nwhich causes downlink inter-cell interference, even when large numbers of\nantennas are employed. Handling this interference with conventional network\nMIMO techniques is challenging due to the large channel dimensionality.\nFurther, the implementation of large antenna precoding/combining matrices is\nassociated with high hardware complexity and power consumption. In this paper,\nwe propose multi-layer precoding to enable efficient and low complexity\noperation in full-dimensional massive MIMO, where a large number of antennas is\nused in two dimensions. In multi-layer precoding, the precoding matrix of each\nbase station is written as a product of a number of precoding matrices, each\none called a layer. Multi-layer precoding (i) leverages the directional\ncharacteristics of large-scale MIMO channels to manage inter-cell interference\nwith low channel knowledge requirements, and (ii) allows for an efficient\nimplementation using low-complexity hybrid analog/digital architectures. We\npresent a specific multi-layer precoding design for full-dimensional massive\nMIMO systems. The performance of this precoding design is analyzed and the\nper-user achievable rate is characterized for general channel models. The\nasymptotic optimality of the proposed multi-layer precoding design is then\nproved for some special yet important channels.

The\narrival of customers with distances less than x is assumed to be a Poisson\nprocess with rate lambda(x)=int_0^x h(y)dy<\\infty, where h(y) is a nonnegative\nintensity function of the distance y. In a loss system M/G/1/1 we define the\nthreshold Nash equilibrium strategy x_e and the optimal social threshold\nstrategy x^*.

However,\nsevere energy constraints require much more careful accounting of energy usage\nthan what prior art provides. In particular, the available energy, the\ndiffering power consumption levels for listening, receiving, and transmitting,\nas well as the limited control bandwidth must all be considered. Therefore, we\nformulate the problem of maximizing the throughput among a set of heterogeneous\nbroadcasting nodes with differing power consumption levels, each subject to a\nstrict ultra-low-power budget. We obtain the oracle throughput (i.e., maximum\nthroughput achieved by an oracle) and use Lagrangian methods to design EconCast\n- a simple asynchronous distributed protocol in which nodes transition between\nsleep, listen, and transmit states, and dynamically change the transition\nrates. EconCast can operate in groupput or anyput modes to respectively\nmaximize two alternative throughput measures. We show that EconCast approaches\nthe oracle throughput.

To do so, we\nquantify the azimuthal dependence of the stacked lensing signal around seven\ndifferent proxies for the orientation of the dark matter distribution, as it is\na priori unknown which one traces the orientation best. On small scales, the\nmajor axis of the brightest group/cluster member (BCG) provides the best proxy,\nleading to a clear detection of an anisotropic signal.

Modeling the signal with an elliptical\nNavarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile on scales < 250 kpc, which roughly\ncorresponds to half the virial radius, and assuming that the BCG is perfectly\naligned with the dark matter, we find an average halo ellipticity of e_h=0.38\n+/- 0.12.

We use zoom N -body\nsimulations to investigate the origin of this phenomenon. For each halo at\nredshift z=0, we determine the time in which the physical volume containing its\nfinal mass becomes stable. We consider five examples for which this happens at\nz~1.5 and two that do not stabilize by z=0. The zoom simulations show that\nearly-collapsing haloes do not grow in mass at z=0 while late-forming ones show\na net inflow. The reason is that 'accreting' haloes are located at the nodes of\na network of thin filaments feeding them. Conversely, each 'stalled' halo lies\nwithin a prominent filament that is thicker than the halo size. Infalling\nmaterial from the surroundings becomes part of the filament while matter within\nit recedes from the halo. We conclude that assembly bias originates from\nquenching halo growth due to tidal forces following the formation of non-linear\nstructures in the cosmic web, as previously conjectured in the literature. Also\nthe internal dynamics of the haloes change: the velocity anisotropy profile is\nbiased towards radial (tangential) orbits in accreting (stalled) haloes. Our\nfindings reveal the cause of the yet unexplained dependence of halo clustering\non the anisotropy. Finally, we extend the excursion-set theory to account for\nthese effects.

An alternative to optical tweezers and\nother single-molecule techniques, they use feedback to counteract the Brownian\nmotion of a molecule of interest. The trap first acquires information about a\nmolecule's position and then applies an electric feedback force to move the\nmolecule. Since electric forces are stronger than optical forces at small\nscales, feedback traps are the best way to trap single molecules without\n\"touching\" them. Feedback traps can do more than trap molecules: They can also\nsubject a target object to forces that are calculated to be the gradient of a\ndesired potential function U(x). If the feedback loop is fast enough, it\ncreates a virtual potential whose dynamics will be very close to those of a\nparticle in an actual potential U(x). But because the dynamics are entirely a\nresult of the feedback loop--absent the feedback, there is only an object\ndiffusing in a fluid--we are free to specify and then manipulate in time an\narbitrary potential U(x,t). Here, we review recent applications of feedback\ntraps to studies on the fundamental connections between information and\nthermodynamics, a topic where feedback plays an even more-fundamental role.

In this work, we report that\novercrowding can unjam gap-free monolayers through increasing isotropic\ncompression. The transition boundary is determined by the isotropic compression\nand the cell-cell adhesion. We explicitly construct the free energy landscape\nfor the T1 topological transition during monolayer rearrangement, and find that\nit evolves from single-barrier shape to double-barrier shape upon completion of\nthe unjamming process. Our analyses reveal that the overcrowding and adhesion\ninduced unjamming transition reflects the mechanical yielding of the highly\ndeformable monolayer, which differs from those caused by loosing up a packed\nparticulate assembly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 20:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-17"}

The\ntested form of streamlined music, which was tested primarily by listeners who\nfelt they benefited from this type of music, significantly outperformed plain\nmusic on measures of perceived focus, task persistence, precognition, and\ncreative thinking, with borderline effects on mood. In contrast, this same form\nof streamlined music did not significantly influence measures assessing visual\nattention, verbal memory, logical thinking, self-efficacy, perceived stress, or\nself-transcendence. We also found that improvements in perceived focus over a\n2-month period were correlated with improvements in emotional state, including\nmood.

We use\na biophysical model to investigate the different roles of local and long-range\ninhibition in the respiratory network, a key component of which is the\npre-B\\\"otzinger complex inspiratory microcircuit. Increasing inhibition within\nthe microcircuit results in a limited number of out-of-phase neurons before\nrhythmicity and synchrony degenerate. Thus, unstructured local inhibition is\ndestabilizing and cannot support the generation of more than one rhythm. A\ntwo-phase rhythm requires restructuring the network into two microcircuits\ncoupled by long-range inhibition in the manner of a half-center. In this\ncontext, inhibition leads to greater stability of the two out-of-phase rhythms.\nWe support our computational results with in vitro recordings from mouse\npre-B\\\"otzinger complex. Partial excitation block leads to increased rhythmic\nvariability, but this recovers following blockade of inhibition. Our results\nsupport the idea that local inhibition in the pre-B\\\"otzinger complex is\npresent to allow for descending control of synchrony or robustness to adverse\nconditions like hypoxia. We conclude that the balance of inhibition and\nexcitation determines the stability of rhythmogenesis, but with opposite roles\nwithin and between areas.

Spike bursts are regarded as analogous to the auroral\nkilometric radiation (AKR), which is associated with the precipitation of\nauroral electrons in a geomagnetic substorm. Originally, a loss-cone-driven\nversion of ECME, developed for AKR, was applied to spike bursts, but it is now\nwidely accepted that a different, horseshoe-driven, version of EMCE applies to\nAKR. We explore the implications of the assumption that horseshoe-driven ECME\nalso applies to spike bursts. We develop a 1D model for the acceleration of the\nelectrons by a parallel electric field, and show that under plausible\nassumptions it leads to a horseshoe distribution of electrons in a solar flare.\nA second requirement for horseshoe-driven ECME is an extremely low plasma\ndensity, referred to as a density cavity. We argue that a coronal density\ncavity should develop in association with a hard X-ray burst, and that such a\ndensity cavity can overcome a long-standing problem with the escape of ECME\nthrough the second-harmonic absorption layer. Both the horseshoe distribution\nand the associated coronal density cavity are highly localized, and could not\nbe resolved in the statistically large number of local precipitation regions\nneeded to explain a hard X-ray burst. The model highlights the \"number problem\"\nin the supply of the electrons needed to explain a hard X-ray burst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 00:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Polarized radiation from blazars is\none key piece of evidence for synchrotron radiation at low energies and it also\nvaries dramatically. The polarization of blazars is of interest for\nunderstanding the origin, confinement, and propagation of jets. However, even\nthough numerous measurements have been performed, the mechanisms behind jet\ncreation, composition and variability are still debated. We performed\nsimultaneous gamma-ray and optical photopolarimetry observations of 45 blazars\nbetween Jul. 2008 and Dec. 2014 to investigate the mechanisms of variability\nand search for a basic relation between the several subclasses of blazars. We\nidentify a correlation between the maximum degree of optical linear\npolarization and the gamma-ray luminosity or the ratio of gamma-ray to optical\nfluxes. Since the maximum polarization degree depends on the condition of the\nmagnetic field (chaotic or ordered), this result implies a systematic\ndifference in the intrinsic alignment of magnetic fields in pc-scale\nrelativistic jets between different types blazars (FSRQs vs. BL Lacs), and\nconsequently between different types of radio galaxies (FR Is vs. FR IIs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 02:26:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

We examine how the group speeds ($v_{\\rm gr}$) depend on angular\nfrequency ($\\omega$) for sausage modes in pressureless coronal tubes with\ncontinuous transverse density distributions by solving the dispersion relation\npertinent to the case where the density inhomogeneity of arbitrary form takes\nplace in a transition layer of arbitrary thickness. We find that in addition to\nthe transverse lengthscale $l$ and density contrast $\\rho_{\\rm i}/\\rho_{\\rm\ne}$, the group speed behavior depends also on the detailed form of the density\ninhomogeneity. For parabolic profiles, $v_{\\rm gr}$ always decreases with\n$\\omega$ first before increasing again, as happens for the much studied top-hat\nprofiles. For linear profiles, however, the behavior of the $\\omega-v_{\\rm gr}$\ncurves is more complex. When $\\rho_{\\rm i}/\\rho_{\\rm e} \\lesssim 6$, the curves\nbecome monotonical for large values of $l$. On the other hand, for higher\ndensity contrasts, a local maximum $v_{\\rm gr}^{\\rm max}$ exists in addition to\na local minimum $v_{\\rm gr}^{\\rm min}$ when coronal tubes are diffuse. With\ntime-dependent computations, we show that the different behavior of group speed\ncurves, the characteristic speeds $v_{\\rm gr}^{\\rm min}$ and $v_{\\rm gr}^{\\rm\nmax}$ in particular, is reflected in the temporal evolution and Morlet spectra\nof impulsively generated wave trains. We conclude that the observed\nquasi-periodic wave trains not only can be employed to probe such key\nparameters as density contrasts and profile steepness, but also have the\npotential to discriminate between the unknown forms of the transverse density\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 03:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

In\nthis paper we analyze the results of direct numerical simulations of stratified\nplane Couette flows, in the limit of rapid thermal diffusion, to measure the\nturbulent diffusivity and turbulent viscosity as a function of the local shear\nand the local stratification. We find that the stability criterion proposed by\nZahn (1974), namely that the product of the gradient Richardson number and the\nPrandtl number must be smaller than a critical values $(J\\Pr)_c$ for\ninstability, adequately accounts for the transition to turbulence in the flow,\nwith $(J\\Pr)_c \\simeq 0.007$. This result recovers and confirms the prior\nfindings of Prat et al. (2016). Zahn's model for the turbulent diffusivity and\nviscosity (Zahn 1992), namely that the mixing coefficient should be\nproportional to the ratio of the thermal diffusivity to the gradient Richardson\nnumber, does not satisfactorily match our numerical data when applied as is. It\nfails (as expected) in the limit of large stratification where the Richardson\nnumber exceeds the aforementioned threshold for instability, but it also fails\nin the limit of low stratification where the turbulent eddy scale becomes\nlimited by the computational domain size. We propose a revised model for\nturbulent mixing by diffusive stratified shear instabilities, that now properly\naccounts for both limits, fits our data satisfactorily, and recovers Zahn's\n1992 model in the limit of large Reynolds numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 04:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

Multi-task features are then extracted from the\ntrained models and cross-task-feature training is conducted which shows the\nvalue of fusing multimodal features extracted from multi-tasks.

After processing images of the\nevent by using a speckle-masking image reconstruction, we identified\nwhite-light (WL) flare ribbons on opposite sides of the magnetic neutral line.\nWe derive the lightcurve decay times of the WL flare kernels at each resolution\nelement by assuming that the kernels consist of one or two components that\ndecay exponentially, starting from the peak time. As a result, 42% of the\npixels have two decay-time components with average decay times of 15.6 and 587\ns, whereas the average decay time is 254 s for WL kernels with only one\ndecay-time component. The peak intensities of the shorter decay-time component\nexhibit good spatial correlation with the WL intensity, whereas the peak\nintensities of the long decay-time components tend to be larger in the early\nphase of the flare at the inner part of the flare ribbons, close to the\nmagnetic neutral line. The average intensity of the longer decay-time\ncomponents is 1.78 times higher than that of the shorter decay-time components.\nIf the shorter decay time is determined by either the chromospheric cooling\ntime or the nonthermal ionization timescale and the longer decay time is\nattributed to the coronal cooling time, this result suggests that WL sources\nfrom both regions appear in 42% of the WL kernels and that WL emission of the\ncoronal origin is sometimes stronger than that of chromospheric origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 04:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

In this paper we present the methodology for\npolarization calibration at 700-900 MHz, applied on data obtained from the\nGreen Bank Telescope (GBT).

The resulting fractional errors on polarization\nmeasurements on boresight are well controlled to within 0.6%-0.8% of their\ntotal intensity. The polarized beam patterns are measured by performing spider\nscans across both polarized quasars and pulsars. A dominant Stokes I to V\nleakage feature and secondary features of Stokes I to Q and I to U leakages in\nthe 700-900 MHz frequency range are identified.

AGB can be mapped\nusing synthetic aperture radar data (SAR) or passive optical data. However,\nthese data are insensitive to high AGB levels (\\textgreater{}150 Mg/ha, and\n\\textgreater{}300 Mg/ha for P-band), which are commonly found in tropical\nforests. Studies have mapped the rough variations in AGB by combining optical\nand environmental data at regional and global scales. Nevertheless, these maps\ncannot represent local variations in AGB in tropical forests. In this paper, we\nhypothesize that the problem of misrepresenting local variations in AGB and AGB\nestimation with good precision occurs because of both methodological limits\n(signal saturation or dilution bias) and a lack of adequate calibration data in\nthis range of AGB values. We test this hypothesis by developing a calibrated\nregression model to predict variations in high AGB values (mean\n\\textgreater{}300 Mg/ha) in French Guiana by a methodological approach for\nspatial extrapolation with data from the optical geoscience laser altimeter\nsystem (GLAS), forest inventories, radar, optics, and environmental variables\nfor spatial inter-and extrapolation. Given their higher point count, GLAS data\nallow a wider coverage of AGB values. We find that the metrics from GLAS\nfootprints are correlated with field AGB estimations (R 2 =0.54, RMSE=48.3\nMg/ha) with no bias for high values. First, predictive models, including\nremote-sensing, environmental variables and spatial correlation functions,\nallow us to obtain \"wall-to-wall\" AGB maps over French Guiana with an RMSE for\nthe in situ AGB estimates of ~51 Mg/ha and R${}^2$=0.48 at a 1-km grid size. We\nconclude that a calibrated regression model based on GLAS with dependent\nenvironmental data can produce good AGB predictions even for high AGB values if\nthe calibration data fit the AGB range. We also demonstrate that small temporal\nand spatial mismatches between field data and GLAS footprints are not a problem\nfor regional and global calibrated regression models because field data aim to\npredict large and deep tendencies in AGB variations from environmental\ngradients and do not aim to represent high but stochastic and temporally\nlimited variations from forest dynamics. Thus, we advocate including a greater\nvariety of data, even if less precise and shifted, to better represent high AGB\nvalues in global models and to improve the fitting of these models for high\nvalues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 08:53:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-17"}

The\nsources of influence can be generally divided into external, which are\nindependent of social context, or as originating from peers, such as family and\nfriends. An important question is how to disentangle the social contagion by\npeers from external influences. While a variety of experimental and\nobservational studies provided insight into this problem, identifying the\nextent of social contagion based on large-scale observational data with an\nunknown network structure remains largely unexplored. By bridging the gap\nbetween the large-scale complex systems perspective of collective human\ndynamics and the detailed approach of the social sciences, we present a\nparsimonious model of social influence, and apply it to a central topic in\npolitical science -- elections and voting behavior. We provide an analytical\nexpression of the county vote-share distribution in a two party system, which\nis in excellent agreement with 92 years of observed U.S. presidential election\ndata. Analyzing the social influence topography over this period reveals an\nabrupt transition in the patterns of social contagion -- from low to high\nlevels of social contagion. The results from our analysis reveal robust\ndifferences among regions of the United States in terms of their social\ninfluence index. In particular, we identify two regions of 'hot' and 'cold\nspots of social influence, each comprising states that are geographically\nclose. These results suggest that social contagion effects are becoming more\ninstrumental in shaping large scale collective political behavior, which is at\nthe core of democratic societies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 10:59:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 22:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

To obtain these\ncross sections, the Universe production cross section is multiplied by the\nparticle or dark energy distribution in accelerating Universe. Also missing\ncross section for each matter and dark energy due to formation of event\nhorizon, is calculated. It is clear that the cross section of particles\nproduced near event horizon of Universe is much larger for higher acceleration\nof Universe. This is because as the acceleration of Universe becomes larger,\nthe Unruh temperature becomes larger and the thermal radiations of particles\nare enhanced. There are different channels for producing Higgs boson in\naccelerating Universe. Universe maybe decay to quark and gluons, and then these\nparticles interact with each other and Higgs boson is produced. Also, some\nHiggs boson are emitted directly from event horizon of Universe. Comparing\nHiggs boson cross sections via different channels, it is observed that at lower\nacceleration, a_Universe<2.5 a_(early Universe), the Universe will not be able\nto emit Higgs, but is still able to produce a quark and eventually for\na_Universe<1.5 a_(early Universe) the Universe can only emit massless gluons.\nAs the acceleration of Universe at the LHC increases, a_Universe>2.5 a_(early\nUniverse), most of Higgs boson production will be due to Unruh effect near\nevent horizon of Universe. Finally comparing the production cross section for\ndark energy with particle cross sections, it is found that the cross section\nfor dark energy is dominated by QCD matter, Higgs boson and neutrino. This\nresult is consistent with previous predictions for dark energy cross section.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 11:18:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 00:23:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

We analyse the common envelope (CE) stage of the \"traditional\"\nformation channel in binaries where the first-formed compact object undergoes\nan in-spiral inside the envelope of its evolved companion star and ejects the\nenvelope in that process. We calculate envelope binding energies of donor stars\nwith initial masses between 4 and 115 Msun for metallicities of Z=Zsun/2 and\nZ=Zsun/50, and derive minimum masses of in-spiralling objects needed to eject\nthese envelopes. We find that CE evolution, besides from producing WD-WD and\nNS-NS binaries, may, in principle, also produce massive BH-BH systems with\nindividual BH component masses up to ~50-60 Msun, in particular for donor stars\nevolved to giants. However, the physics of envelope ejection of massive stars\nremains uncertain.

For the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model, the value of jerk parameter is -1 throughout the evolution\nhistory. Now any model dependent estimation of the value of the jerk parameter\nwould indicate the deviation of the model from the cosmological constant. In\nthe present work, it has also been shown that for a constant jerk parameter\nmodel, any deviation of its value from -1 would not allow the dark matter to\nhave an independent conservation, thus indicating towards an interaction\nbetween dark matter and dark energy. Statistical analysis with different\nobservational data sets (namely the observational Hubble parameter data (OHD),\nthe type Ia supernova data (SNe), and the baryon acoustic oscillation data\n(BAO)) lead to a well constrained values of the jerk parameter and the model\nremains at a very close proximity of the $\\Lambda$CDM. The possibility of\ninteraction is found to be more likely at high redshift rather than at present\nepoch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 11:58:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 13:31:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 09:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-12"}

Light-weight controllets also allow for pushing control logic\nonto switches to minimize latency and communication overhead.

In\nan observation that closely resembles the dynamical slowdown observed in\nsupercooled liquids, the phenomenon of kinetic arrest in Laponite suspensions\nis accompanied by a growth in the $\\alpha$-relaxation time with increasing\nsample aging time, $t_{w}$. The ubiquitous dynamic slowdown and fragile\nbehavior observed in glass forming liquids approaching the glass transition is\ntypically ascribed to the growth in the size of distinct dynamical\nheterogeneities. In this article, we present the characterization of the\ndynamical heterogeneities in aging colloidal Laponite clay systems by invoking\nthe three-point dynamic susceptibility formalism. The average time-dependent\ntwo-point intensity autocorrelation and its sensitivity to the control\nparameter $t_{w}$ are probed in dynamic light scattering experiments.\nDistributions of relaxation time scales deduced from Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts\nequation widen with increasing $t_{w}$ signifying the heterogeneous dynamic\nslowdown. A suitable formalism to calculate three-point correlation function is\nemployed for aging colloidal suspension where the main control parameter is\n$t_{w}$. The calculated three-point dynamic susceptibility exhibits a peak,\nwith the peak height increasing with evolving $t_{w}$. The number of\ndynamically correlated particles is seen to initially increase with increasing\n$t_{w}$ at a fast rate, before eventually slowing down close to the non-ergodic\ntransition point.This observation is in agreement with reports on supercooled\nliquids.

Pioneer radial velocity follow-up observations with the UVES\nspectrograph at the ESO - VLT of this system clearly ruled out the large radial\nvelocity variation, leaving a discrepancy between the observation and the\nprediction. In this paper, we further characterise the microlensing system by\nanalysing its spectral energy distribution (SED) derived using the UVES\nspectrum and new observations with the ARCoIRIS (CTIO) near-infrared\nspectrograph and the Keck adaptive optics instrument NIRC2 in the J, H, and Ks\nbands. We determine the mass and distance of the stars independently from the\nmicrolensing modelling. We find that the SED is compatible with a giant star in\nthe Galactic bulge and a foreground star with a mass of 0.94+/-0.09Msun at a\ndistance of 1.07+/-0.24kpc. We find that this foreground star is likely the\nlens.

A thoughtful re-analysis of the microlensing event is mandatory to\nfully understand the reason of this new discrepancy. More importantly, this\npaper demonstrates that spectroscopic follow-up observations of microlensing\nevents are possible and provide independent constraints on the parameters of\nthe lens and source stars, hence breaking some degeneracies in the analysis.\nUV-to-NIR low-resolution spectrographs like X-SHOOTER (ESO - VLT) could\nsubstantially contribute to this follow-up efforts, with magnitude limits above\nall microlensing events detected so far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 13:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

We have\nconducted a suite of partitioning experiments to characterize Zn metal-silicate\nelemental and isotopic fractionation as a function of time, temperature, and\ncomposition. Experiments were conducted at temperatures from 1473-2273K, with\nrun durations from 5-240 minutes for four starting materials. Chemical and\nisotopic equilibrium is achieved within 10 minutes. Zinc metal-silicate\nisotopic fractionation displays no resolvable dependence on temperature,\ncomposition, or oxygen fugacity.

Most current single image SR methods use empirical risk\nminimisation, often with a pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss. However,\nthe outputs from such methods tend to be blurry, over-smoothed and generally\nappear implausible. A more desirable approach would employ Maximum a Posteriori\n(MAP) inference, preferring solutions that always have a high probability under\nthe image prior, and thus appear more plausible. Direct MAP estimation for SR\nis non-trivial, as it requires us to build a model for the image prior from\nsamples. Furthermore, MAP inference is often performed via optimisation-based\niterative algorithms which don't compare well with the efficiency of\nneural-network-based alternatives. Here we introduce new methods for amortised\nMAP inference whereby we calculate the MAP estimate directly using a\nconvolutional neural network. We first introduce a novel neural network\narchitecture that performs a projection to the affine subspace of valid SR\nsolutions ensuring that the high resolution output of the network is always\nconsistent with the low resolution input. We show that, using this\narchitecture, the amortised MAP inference problem reduces to minimising the\ncross-entropy between two distributions, similar to training generative models.\nWe propose three methods to solve this optimisation problem: (1) Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GAN) (2) denoiser-guided SR which backpropagates\ngradient-estimates from denoising to train the network, and (3) a baseline\nmethod using a maximum-likelihood-trained image prior. Our experiments show\nthat the GAN based approach performs best on real image data. Lastly, we\nestablish a connection between GANs and amortised variational inference as in\ne.g. variational autoencoders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 14:58:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 14:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 13:08:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

This is in parallel\nwith the quantum mechanics where the scientific content and experimental\nsupport of this branch of physics is embedded in the formalism of quantum\nmechanics and not in its philosophical interpretations such as the Copenhagen\nschool or the parallel worlds explanations. Einstein theory of special\nrelativity gets unduly credit from the success of the relativistic mechanics of\nLorentz transformations. Hence, all the postulates and consequences of Einstein\ninterpretation which have no direct experimental or observational support\nshould be reexamined and the relativistic mechanics of Lorentz transformations\nshould be treated in education, academia and research in a similar fashion to\nthat of quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 07:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

Tentative proposals\n(MOND theory of a modified Newton s law and extraneous dark matter) do not\nbring a definite clarification. We propose here a new approach to this problem,\nwithout exotic matter and using the classical Newton force. But we introduce a\nnew additional universal acceleration, which could represent a universal\nexpansion law valid at the scale level of a galaxy. We show that this\nhypothesis leads to a good description of the observed variations of the\ngalactic transverse velocity. It can be considered as a consequence of the\nScale Expansion Cosmos theory (SEC) introduced by J. Masreliez, but we\npostulate that the space expansion acceleration universally applies at any\nscale. We obtain a formal derivation of the Tully Fisher law, linking the\nconstant galactic transverse velocity to its total mass, via the universal\nminimum acceleration. We derive a good estimate of the TF acceleration\ncoefficient and show that expansion should be proportional to the square root\nof the local volumic mass density. Our conjecture is in fact a new dynamics\nprinciple which could be applied to many other physical problems at different\nscales. Applying it to the range of the solar planet system confirms the well\nknown Kepler laws, at least as a valid approximation for the order of magnitude\nof the solar system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 10:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-21"}
