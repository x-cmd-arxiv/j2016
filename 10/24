Two types of superconformal mechanics, with and without a DFF\nterm, are considered. Without a DFF term (Calogero potential only) the\nsupersymmetry is unbroken. The models with a DFF term correspond to deformed\n(if the Calogero potential is present) or undeformed oscillators. For these\n(un)deformed oscillators the classical invariant superconformal algebra acts as\na spectrum-generating algebra of the quantum theory. Besides the $osp(1|2)$\nexamples, we explicitly quantize the superconformally-invariant worldine\n$\\sigma$-models defined by the ${\\cal N}=4$ $(1,4,3)$ supermultiplet (with\n$D(2,1;\\alpha)$ invariance, for $\\alpha\\neq 0,-1$) and by the ${\\cal N}=2$\n$(2,2,0)$ supermultiplet (with two-dimensional target and $sl(2|1)$\ninvariance). The parameter $\\alpha$ is the scaling dimension of the $(1,4,3)$\nsupermultiplet and, in the DFF case, has a direct interpretation as a vacuum\nenergy. In the DFF case, for the $sl(2|1)$ models, the scaling dimension\n$\\lambda$ is quantized (either $\\lambda=\\frac{1}{2}+{\\mathbb Z}$ or\n$\\lambda={\\mathbb Z}$).

As a result, they are currently not suitable for outdoor\nenvironments and mobile devices. This paper aims at tracking/estimating hand\nposes using passive stereo which avoids these limitations. A benchmark with\n18,000 stereo image pairs and 18,000 depth images captured from different\nscenarios and the ground-truth 3D positions of palm and finger joints (obtained\nfrom the manual label) is thus proposed. This paper demonstrates that the\nperformance of the state-of-the art tracking/estimation algorithms can be\nmaintained with most stereo matching algorithms on the proposed benchmark, as\nlong as the hand segmentation is correct. As a result, a novel stereo-based\nhand segmentation algorithm specially designed for hand tracking/estimation is\nproposed.

It is plausible that similar considerations could prove fruitful for\nmodified gravity theories. In this article, we pursue from a numerical\nrelativistic viewpoint the $3+1$ formulation of metric $f(R)$ gravity as it\narises from the fourth order equations of motion, without invoking the\ndynamical equivalence with Brans-Dicke theories. We present the resulting\nsystem of evolution and constraint equations for a generic function $f(R)$,\nsubject to the usual viability conditions. We confirm that the time propagation\nof the $f(R)$ Hamiltonian and Momentum constraints take the same Mathematical\nform as in general relativity, irrespective of the $f(R)$ model. We further\nrecast the 3+1 system in a form akin to the BSSNOK formulation of numerical\nrelativity. Without assuming any specific model, we show that the ADM version\nof $f(R)$ is weakly hyperbolic and is plagued by similar zero speed modes as in\nthe general relativity case. On the other hand the BSSNOK version is strongly\nhyperbolic and hence a promising formulation for numerical simulations in\nmetric $f(R)$ theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2016 19:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}

Although the model is not universal, it can\nefficiently solve several problems whose classical efficient solutions are not\nknown. Furthermore, it was recently shown that if the one-clean qubit model is\nclassically efficiently simulated, the polynomial hierarchy collapses to the\nsecond level. A disadvantage of the one-clean qubit model is, however, that the\nclean qubit is too clean: for example, in realistic NMR experiments,\npolarizations are not enough high to have the perfectly pure qubit. In this\npaper, we consider a more realistic one-clean qubit model, where the clean\nqubit is not clean, but depolarized. We first show that, for any polarization,\na multiplicative-error calculation of the output probability distribution of\nthe model is possible in a classical polynomial time if we take an\nappropriately large multiplicative error. The result is in a strong contrast to\nthat of the ideal one-clean qubit model where the classical efficient\nmultiplicative-error calculation (or even the sampling) with the same amount of\nerror causes the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. We next show that, for\nany polarization lower-bounded by an inverse polynomial, a classical efficient\nsampling (in terms of a sufficiently small multiplicative error or an\nexponentially-small additive error) of the output probability distribution of\nthe model is impossible unless BQP is contained in the second level of the\npolynomial hierarchy, which suggests the hardness of the classical efficient\nsimulation of the one non-clean qubit model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2016 22:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

Strong\nvariations of the brightness distributions are found, depending on the\norientation of the warp with respect to the line of sight.

Orbiting a nearby\nM2.5 dwarf and receiving virtually the same stellar insolation as Earth, K2-18b\nwould be a prime candidate for the first detailed atmospheric characterization\nof a habitable-zone exoplanet using HST and JWST. Here, we report the detection\nof a third transit of K2-18b near the predicted transit time using the Spitzer\nSpace Telescope. The Spitzer detection demonstrates the periodic nature of the\ntwo transit events discovered by K2, confirming that K2-18 is indeed orbited by\na super-Earth in a 33-day orbit and ruling out the alternative scenario of two\nsimilarly-sized, long-period planets transiting only once within the 75-day K2\nobservation. We also find, however, that the transit event detected by Spitzer\noccurred 1.85 hours (7-sigma) before the predicted transit time. Our joint\nanalysis of the Spitzer and K2 photometry reveals that this early occurrence of\nthe transit is not caused by transit timing variations (TTVs), but the result\nof an inaccurate K2 ephemeris due to a previously undetected data anomaly in\nthe K2 photometry likely caused by a cosmic ray hit.

The side chain free energy\nis computed on the fly, allowing the protein backbone dynamics to traverse a\ngreatly smoothed energetic landscape. This results in extremely rapid\nequilibration and sampling of the Boltzmann distribution. Because our method\nemploys a reduced model involving single-bead side chains, we also provide a\nnovel, maximum-likelihood method to parameterize the side chain model using\ninput data from high resolution protein crystal structures. We demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art accuracy for predicting $\\chi_1$ rotamer states while\nconsuming only milliseconds of CPU time.

The\nphysical and chemical evolutions are followed until the end of the main\naccretion phase. When mass averaged over the whole disk, a forming disk has a\nsimilar H2O abundance and HDO/H2O abundance ratio as their precollapse values\n(within a factor of 2), regardless of time in our models. Consistent with\nprevious studies, our models suggest that interstellar water ice is delivered\nto forming disks without significant alteration. On the other hand, the local\nvertically averaged H2O ice abundance and HDO/H2O ice ratio can differ more, by\nup to a factor of several, depending on time and distance from a central star.\nKey parameters for the local variations are the fluence of stellar UV photons\nen route into the disk and the ice layered structure, the latter of which is\nmostly established in the prestellar stages.

We are interested in comparing the error of this least-squares\napproximation measured in $L^2(\\Gamma,d\\rho)$ with the best achievable\npolynomial approximation error when using downward closed sets of cardinality\n$n$. We establish conditions between the dimension $n$ and the size $m$ of the\nsample, under which these two errors are proven to be comparable. Our main\nfinding is that the dimension $d$ enters only moderately in the resulting\ntrade-off between $m$ and $n$, in terms of a logarithmic factor $\\ln(d)$, and\nis even absent when the optimization is restricted to a relevant subclass of\ndownward closed sets, named {\\it anchored} sets. In principle, this allows one\nto use these methods in arbitrarily high or even infinite dimension. Our\nanalysis builds upon [2] which considered fixed and nonoptimized downward\nclosed multi-index sets. Potential applications of the proposed results are\nfound in the development and analysis of numerical methods for computing the\nsolution to high-dimensional parametric or stochastic PDEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 07:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}

Sophisticated similarity measures are standard for\ntime series matching, as they are usually misaligned. Dynamic Time Warping or\nDTW is the most widely used similarity measure for time series because it\ncombines alignment and matching at the same time. However, the alignment makes\nDTW slow. To speed up the expensive similarity search with DTW, branch and\nbound based pruning strategies are adopted. However, branch and bound based\npruning are only useful for very short queries (low dimensional time series),\nand the bounds are quite weak for longer queries. Due to the loose bounds\nbranch and bound pruning strategy boils down to a brute-force search.\n  To circumvent this issue, we design SSH (Sketch, Shingle, & Hashing), an\nefficient and approximate hashing scheme which is much faster than the\nstate-of-the-art branch and bound searching technique: the UCR suite. SSH uses\na novel combination of sketching, shingling and hashing techniques to produce\n(probabilistic) indexes which align (near perfectly) with DTW similarity\nmeasure. The generated indexes are then used to create hash buckets for\nsub-linear search. Our results show that SSH is very effective for longer time\nsequence and prunes around 95% candidates, leading to the massive speedup in\nsearch with DTW. Empirical results on two large-scale benchmark time series\ndata show that our proposed method can be around 20 times faster than the\nstate-of-the-art package (UCR suite) without any significant loss in accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 08:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}

How this information is extracted by downstream neurons is\nunclear. In this theoretical paper, we investigate to what extent a single cell\ncould detect a given spike pattern and what the optimal parameters to do so\nare, in particular the membrane time constant $\\tau$. Using a leaky\nintegrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron with instantaneous synapses and homogeneous\nPoisson input, we were able to compute this optimum analytically. Our results\nindicate that a relatively small $\\tau$ (at most a few tens of ms) is usually\noptimal, even when the pattern is much longer. This is somewhat counter\nintuitive as the resulting detector ignores most of the pattern, due to its\nfast memory decay. Next, we wondered if spike-timing-dependent plasticity\n(STDP) could enable a neuron to reach the theoretical optimum. We simulated a\nLIF neuron equipped with additive spike-timing-dependent potentiation and\nhomeostatic rate-based depression, and repeatedly exposed it to a given input\nspike pattern. As in previous studies, the LIF progressively became selective\nto the repeating pattern with no supervision, even when the pattern was\nembedded in Poisson activity. Here we show that, using certain STDP parameters,\nthe resulting pattern detector can be optimal. Taken together, these results\nmay explain how humans can learn repeating visual or auditory sequences. Long\nsequences could be recognized thanks to coincidence detectors working at a much\nshorter timescale. This is consistent with the fact that recognition is still\npossible if a sound sequence is compressed, played backward, or scrambled using\n10ms bins.

However the size and slow rotation of these galaxies appear\ninsufficient to support a mean-field dynamo action to excite such fields. Here\nwe suggest a new mechanism to explain large-scale magnetic fields in galaxies\nthat are too small to support mean-field dynamo action. The key idea is that we\ndo not identify large-scale and mean magnetic fields. In our scenario the the\nmagnetic structures originate from a small-scale dynamo which produces\nsmall-scale magnetic field in the galactic disc and a galactic wind that\ntransports this field into the galactic halo where the large turbulent\ndiffusion increases the scale and order of the field. As a result, the magnetic\nfield becomes large-scale; however its mean value remains vanishing in a strict\nsense. We verify the idea by numerical modelling of two distinct simplified\nconfigurations, a thin disc model using the no-$z$ approximation, and an\naxisymmetric model using cylindrical $r,z$ coordinates. Each of these allows\nreduction of the problem to two spatial dimensions. Taken together, the models\nsupport the proposition that the general trends will persist in a fully 3D\nmodel. We demonstrate that a pronounced large-scale pattern can develop in the\ngalactic halo for a wide choice of the dynamo governing parameters. We believe\nthat our mechanism can be relevant to explaining the presence of the fields\nobserved in the halos of dwarf galaxies. We emphasize that detailed modelling\nof the proposed scenario needs 3D simulations, and adjustment to the specific\ndynamo governing parameters of dwarf galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 11:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

However, current\nprotein assay methods are not compatible with both reducers and detergents,\nwhich are however present simultaneously in most denaturing extraction buffers\nused in proteomics and electrophoresis, and in particular in SDS\nelectrophoresis. We found that inclusion of cyclodextrins in a Coomassie\nblue-based assay made it compatible with detergents, as cyclodextrins complex\ndetergents in a 1:1 molecular ratio. As this type of assay is intrinsically\nresistant to reducers, we have thus developed a single step assay that is both\ndetergent and reducer compatible. Depending on the type and concentration of\ndetergents present in the sample buffer, either beta-cyclodextrin or\nalpha-cyclodextrin can be used, the former being able to complex a wider range\nof detergents and the latter being able to complex higher amounts of detergents\ndue to its greater solubility in water. Cyclodextrins are used at final\nconcentrations of 2-10 mg/mL in the assay mix. This typically allows to measure\nsamples containing as little as 0.1 mg/mL protein, in the presence of up to 2%\ndetergent and reducers such as 5 % mercaptoethanol or 50 mM DTT in a single\nstep with a simple spectrophotometric assay.

The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) has the largest field of\nview (FOV) for detecting GRBs as it views the entire unocculted sky, but as a\nnon-imaging instrument it relies on the relative count rates observed in each\nof its 14 detectors to localize transients.

Here we present the BAyesian Location Reconstruction Of GRBs ({\\tt\nBALROG}) method for localizing and characterising GBM transients. Our approach\neliminates the systematics of previous approaches by simultaneously fitting for\nthe location and spectrum of a source. It also correctly incorporates the\nuncertainties in the location of a transient into the spectral parameters and\nproduces reliable positional uncertainties for both well-localized sources and\nthose for which the GBM data cannot effectively constrain the position.

The\nreason is that all libraries in widespread use come with no guarantees about\nthe computed results. This would seem to prevent any attempt at formal\nverification of programs that use them: without a specification for the\nfunctions, no conclusion can be drawn statically about the behavior of the\nprogram. We propose an alternative to surrender. We introduce a pragmatic\napproach that leverages the fact that most math.h/cmath functions are almost\npiecewise monotonic: as we discovered through exhaustive testing, they may have\nglitches, often of very small size and in small numbers. We develop interval\nrefinement techniques for such functions based on a modified dichotomic search,\nthat enable verification via symbolic execution based model checking, abstract\ninterpretation, and test data generation. Our refinement algorithms are the\nfirst in the literature to be able to handle non-correctly rounded function\nimplementations, enabling verification in the presence of the most common\nimplementations. We experimentally evaluate our approach on real-world code,\nshowing its ability to detect or rule out anomalous behaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 12:39:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2017 15:22:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 14:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

It turns out that the answer to\nthis question can be quite counter-intuitive due to the non-monotone dynamics\nof the model. In this paper, we investigate various notions of advantage one of\nthe colours might initially possess, and in the course of doing so, we\ndetermine which of the two colours emerges victorious for various nontrivial\npairs of distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 14:34:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2017 23:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-07"}

To devise a flexible and efficient solution, we customize a\nrecently proposed framework for non-convex optimization over networks, which\nhinges on a (primal) convexification-decomposition technique to handle\nnon-convexity, and a dynamic consensus procedure to diffuse information among\nthe agents.

It is well-known that\nfinancial time series display conditional heteroscedasticity. Among the large\nnumber of conditional heteroscedastic models, the generalized autoregressive\nconditional heteroscedastic (GARCH) process is the most popular and influential\none. So far, feasible quantile regression methods for this task have been\nconfined to a variant of the GARCH model, the linear GARCH model, owing to its\ntractable conditional quantile structure. This paper considers the widely used\nGARCH model. An easy-to-implement hybrid conditional quantile estimation\nprocedure is developed based on a simple albeit nontrivial transformation.\nAsymptotic properties of the proposed estimator and statistics are derived,\nwhich facilitate corresponding inferences. To approximate the asymptotic\ndistribution of the quantile regression estimator, we introduce a mixed\nbootstrapping procedure, where a time-consuming optimization is replaced by a\nsample averaging. Moreover, diagnostic tools based on the residual quantile\nautocorrelation function are constructed to check the adequacy of the fitted\nconditional quantiles. Simulation experiments are carried out to assess the\nfinite-sample performance of the proposed approach. The favorable performance\nof the conditional quantile estimator and the usefulness of the inference tools\nare further illustrated by an empirical application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 15:10:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}

Therefore, we perform a large-scale search for evidence of\nsignals consistent with quasi-periodic pulsations in solar flares, focusing on\nthe 1 - 300s timescale. We analyse 675 M- and X-class flares observed by GOES\nin 1-8\\AA\\ soft X-rays between 2011 February 1 and 2015 December 31.\nAdditionally, over the same era we analyse Fermi/GBM 15-25 keV X-ray data for\neach of these flares that was associated with a Fermi/GBM solar flare trigger,\na total of 261 events. Using a model comparison method, we determine whether\nthere is evidence for a substantial enhancement in the Fourier power spectrum\nthat may be consistent with a QPP signature, based on three tested models; a\npower-law plus a constant, a broken power-law plus constant, and a\npower-law-plus-constant with an additional QPP signature component. From this,\nwe determine that ~30% of GOES events and ~8% of Fermi/GBM events show strong\nsignatures consistent with classical interpretations of QPP. For the remaining\nevents either two or more tested models cannot be strongly distinguished from\neach other, or the events are well-described by single power-law or broken\npower-law Fourier power spectra. For both instruments, a preferred\ncharacteristic timescale of ~5-30 s was found in the QPP-like events, with no\ndependence on flare magnitude in either GOES or GBM data. We also show that\nindividual events in the sample show similar characteristic timescales in both\nGBM and GOES datasets.

The aim\nof this study is to quantify the temperature dependent changes in the acoustic\nand viscoelastic properties of liver and investigate their effect on ARF\ninduced displacements by using both experimental methods and simulations.\nFurthermore, the temperature dependent viscoelastic properties of liver are\nexperimentally measured over a frequency range of 0.1-200 Hz at temperatures\nreaching 80 C, and both conventional and fractional Zener models are used to\nfit the data.\n  The fractional Zener model was found to fit better with the experimental\nviscoelasticity data with respect to the conventional model with up to two\nmagnitudes lower sum of squared errors (SSE).

At low temperatures\nbefore thermal ablation, attenuation was found to affect the displacement\namplitude. At higher temperature, the decrease in displacement amplitude occurs\napproximately at 60-70 C due to the combined effect of viscoelasticity changes\nand lesion growth overpowering the effect of attenuation.

To reduce latency, systems typically rely on a cache to service\nread-requests closer to the client. However, caches are not effective for\nwrite-heavy workloads, which have to be processed by the storage system in\norder to maintain serializability.\n  This paper presents a new technique, called optimistic abort, which reduces\nnetwork latency for high-contention, write-heavy workloads by identifying\ntransactions that will abort as early as possible, and aborting them before\nthey reach the store. We have implemented optimistic abort in a system called\nGotthard, which leverages recent advances in network data plane programmability\nto execute transaction processing logic directly in network devices. Gotthard\nexamines network traffic to observe and log transaction requests. If Gotthard\nsuspects that a transaction is likely to be aborted at the store, it aborts the\ntransaction early by re-writing the packet header, and routing the packets back\nto the client. Gotthard significantly reduces the overall latency and improves\nthe throughput for high-contention workloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 15:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}

Differently from other works, we showed that\nrock-paper-scissors (RPS) patterns occur by introducing a simple kind of random\nmobility in a lattice sparsely occupied. Such pattern has been revealed to be\nvery important in the conservation of the species in ecological and social\nenvironments. The goal of this paper is to show that we do not need more\nelaborated schemes for construction of the neighbourhood in the game to observe\nRPS patterns as suggested in the literature. As an interesting additional\nresult, in this contribution we also propose an alternative method to quantify\nthe RPS density in a quantitative context of the game theory which becomes\npossible to perform a finite size scaling study. Such approach can be very\ninteresting to be applied in other games generically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 04:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

In about a quarter century, we have witnessed the winter\nof AI (1990) being transformed and transported to the zenith of tabloid fodder\nabout AI (2015). The discussion at hand is about the elements that constitute\nthe canonical idea of intelligence. The delivery of intelligence as a\npay-per-use-service, popping out of an app or from a shrink-wrapped software\ndefined point solution, is in contrast to the bio-inspired view of intelligence\nas an outcome, perhaps formed from a tapestry of events, cross-pollinated by\ninstances, each with its own microcosm of experiences and learning, which may\nnot be discrete all-or-none functions but continuous, over space and time. The\nenterprise world may not require, aspire or desire such an engaged solution to\nimprove its services for enabling digital transformation through the deployment\nof digital twins, for example. One might ask whether the \"work-flow on\nsteroids\" version of decision support may suffice for intelligence? Are we\nharking back to the era of rule based expert systems?

Only very recently, feature selection\nhas drawn adequate attention in the context of longitudinal modeling. Standard\ntechniques, such as generalized estimating equations, have been modified to\nselect features by imposing sparsity-inducing regularizers. However, they do\nnot explicitly model how a dependent variable relies on features measured at\nproximal time points. Recent graphical Granger modeling can select features in\nlagged time points but ignores the temporal correlations within an individual's\nrepeated measurements. We propose an approach to automatically and\nsimultaneously determine both the relevant features and the relevant temporal\npoints that impact the current outcome of the dependent variable. Meanwhile,\nthe proposed model takes into account the non-{\\em i.i.d} nature of the data by\nestimating the within-individual correlations. This approach decomposes model\nparameters into a summation of two components and imposes separate block-wise\nLASSO penalties to each component when building a linear model in terms of the\npast $\\tau$ measurements of features. One component is used to select features\nwhereas the other is used to select temporal contingent points. An accelerated\ngradient descent algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the related\noptimization problem with detailed convergence analysis and asymptotic\nanalysis.
