In particular, one of them occurred\nsimultaneously with an M2.4 flare on 23 October at 02:41 UT (SOLA2003-10-23).\nBoth events were observed by ARIES H-alpha Solar Tower-Telescope, TRACE, SOHO,\nand RHESSI instruments. The flare was very impulsive and followed by a narrow\nCME. A local force-free model of AR 10484 is the basis to compute its topology.\nWe find bald patches (BPs) at the flare site. This BP topology is present for\nat least two days before. Large-scale field lines, associated with the BPs,\nrepresent open loops. This is confirmed by a global PFSS model. Following the\nbrightest leading edge of the H-alpha and EUV jet emission, we can temporarily\nassociate it with a narrow CME.\n  Results: Considering their characteristics, the observed broad jets appear to\nbe of the blowout class. As the most plausible scenario, we propose that\nmagnetic reconnection could occur at the BP separatrices forced by the\ndestabilization of a continuously reformed flux rope underlying them. The\nreconnection process could bring the cool flux-rope material into the\nreconnected open field lines driving the series of recurrent blowout jets and\naccompanying CMEs.\n  Conclusions: Based on a model of the coronal field, we compute the AR 10484\ntopology at the location where flaring and blowout jets occurred from 21 to 24\nOctober 2003. This topology can consistently explain the origin of these\nevents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 16:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

Exact quantum algorithms for Simon's problem have also been\nproposed, which deterministically solve the problem with O(n) queries. Also the\nquantum lower bound \\Omega(n) for Simon's problem is known.

We want to not only identify dense\nsubgraphs, but also build a hierarchy among them (e.g., larger but sparser\nsubgraphs formed by two smaller dense subgraphs). Peeling algorithms (k-core,\nk-truss, and nucleus decomposition) have been effective to locate many dense\nsubgraphs. However, constructing a hierarchical representation of density\nstructure, even correctly computing the connected k-cores and k-trusses, have\nbeen mostly overlooked. Keeping track of connected components during peeling\nrequires an additional traversal operation, which is as expensive as the\npeeling process. In this paper, we start with a thorough survey and point to\nnuances in problem formulations that lead to significant differences in\nruntimes. We then propose efficient and generic algorithms to construct the\nhierarchy of dense subgraphs for k-core, k-truss, or any nucleus decomposition.\nOur algorithms leverage the disjoint-set forest data structure to efficiently\nconstruct the hierarchy during traversal. Furthermore, we introduce a new idea\nto avoid traversal.

While there are many methods\nto pseudorandomly generate domains, we focus in this paper on detecting (and\ngenerating) domains on a per-domain basis which provides a simple and flexible\nmeans to detect known DGA families. Recent machine learning approaches to DGA\ndetection have been successful on fairly simplistic DGAs, many of which produce\nnames of fixed length. However, models trained on limited datasets are somewhat\nblind to new DGA variants.\n  In this paper, we leverage the concept of generative adversarial networks to\nconstruct a deep learning based DGA that is designed to intentionally bypass a\ndeep learning based detector. In a series of adversarial rounds, the generator\nlearns to generate domain names that are increasingly more difficult to detect.\nIn turn, a detector model updates its parameters to compensate for the\nadversarially generated domains. We test the hypothesis of whether\nadversarially generated domains may be used to augment training sets in order\nto harden other machine learning models against yet-to-be-observed DGAs. We\ndetail solutions to several challenges in training this character-based\ngenerative adversarial network (GAN).

Two tracking\ncriteria are introduced to evaluate approximate minimizer quality: one based on\nbeing accurate with respect to the mean trajectory, and the other based on\nbeing accurate in high probability (IHP). An estimate of a bound on the\nminimizers' change, combined with properties of the chosen optimization\nalgorithm, is used to select the number of samples needed to meet the desired\ntracking criterion. A technique to estimate the change in minimizers is\nprovided along with analysis to show that eventually the estimate upper bounds\nthe change in minimizers.

Statistical machine\ntranslation (SMT) is the dominant paradigm in this field. In SMT, translations\nare generated by means of statistical models whose parameters are learned from\nbilingual data. Scalability is a key concern in SMT, as one would like to make\nuse of as much data as possible to train better translation systems.\n  In recent years, mobile devices with adequate computing power have become\nwidely available. Despite being very successful, mobile applications relying on\nNLP systems continue to follow a client-server architecture, which is of\nlimited use because access to internet is often limited and expensive. The goal\nof this dissertation is to show how to construct a scalable machine translation\nsystem that can operate with the limited resources available on a mobile\ndevice.\n  The main challenge for porting translation systems on mobile devices is\nmemory usage. The amount of memory available on a mobile device is far less\nthan what is typically available on the server side of a client-server\napplication. In this thesis, we investigate alternatives for the two components\nwhich prevent standard translation systems from working on mobile devices due\nto high memory usage.

Through this experience, we have come to\nappreciate that typical Weyl semimetals host many Weyl points. For instance,\nthe first Weyl semimetal observed in experiment, TaAs, hosts 24 Weyl points.\nSimilarly, the Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ series, recently under study as the first\nType II Weyl semimetal, has eight Weyl points. However, it is well-understood\nthat for a Weyl semimetal without inversion symmetry but with time-reversal\nsymmetry, the minimum number of Weyl points is four. Realizing such a minimal\nWeyl semimetal is fundamentally relevant because it would offer the simplest\n\"hydrogen atom\" example of an inversion-breaking Weyl semimetal. At the same\ntime, transport experiments and device applications may be simpler in a system\nwith as few Weyl points as possible. Recently, TaIrTe$_4$ has been predicted to\nbe a minimal, inversion-breaking Weyl semimetal. However, crucially, the Weyl\npoints and Fermi arcs live entirely above the Fermi level, making them\ninaccessible to conventional angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).\nHere we use pump-probe ARPES to directly access the band structure above the\nFermi level in TaIrTe$_4$. We directly observe Weyl points and topological\nFermi arcs, showing that TaIrTe$_4$ is a Weyl semimetal. We find that, in\ntotal, TaIrTe$_4$ has four Weyl points, providing the first example of a\nminimal inversion-breaking Weyl semimetal.

We\ninvestigate the gas and dust evolution simultaneously assuming simplified\nprescriptions for a dead zone and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind acting on\nthe disk. We explore whether the resulting gas and dust distribution can create\nsignatures similar to those observed in transition disks. For the dust\nevolution, we included the transport, growth, and fragmentation of dust\nparticles. To compare with observations, we produced synthetic images in\nscattered optical light and in thermal emission at mm wavelengths. In all\nmodels with a dead zone, a bump in the gas surface density is produced that is\nable to efficiently trap large particles ($\\gtrsim 1$ mm) at the outer edge of\nthe dead zone. The gas bump reaches an amplitude of a factor of $\\sim5$, which\ncan be enhanced by the presence of an MHD wind that removes mass from the inner\ndisk. While our 1D simulations suggest that such a structure can be present\nonly for $\\sim$1 Myr, the structure may be maintained for a longer time when\nmore realistic 2D/3D simulations are performed. In the synthetic images,\ngap-like low-emission regions are seen at scattered light and in thermal\nemission at mm wavelengths, as previously predicted in the case of planet-disk\ninteraction. As a conclusion, main signatures of transition disks can be\nreproduced by assuming a dead zone in the disk, such as gap-like structure in\nscattered light and millimetre continuum emission, and a lower gas surface\ndensity within the dead zone. Previous studies showed that the Rossby wave\ninstability can also develop at the edge of such dead zones, forming vortices\nand also creating asymmetries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 20:00:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2016 20:24:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

The first approach seems to be\nself-consistent, but in a limited range of the dielectric constant. As to the\ndirect instantaneous interaction between two electrons,it was hypothesized as\ndue to the exchange by the band LO phonons. The latter supposition was\nincorrect. In the current paper, it shows that the contributions into the\npairing matrix element possessing the structure of a net attraction come about\nonly as the result of disorder. Indeed, the experiment revealed the mobility\nedge in doped SrTiO3. Doped electrons occupying states with the energy below\nthe mobility edge are localized on dopants thereby become strongly coupled with\nthe lattice vibrations. The emergence of the localized phonon modes attached to\ndefect is one of the results of such electron-lattice coupling. For two\nelectrons in the conduction band the virtual exchange by the quantum of such\nlocal mode manifests itself as the effective attraction. The total contribution\ninto the pairing matrix element from these processes, increasing with\nconcentration can overwhelm the Coulomb repulsion screened by the band LO\nphonons. That is, the role previously ascribed to the band LO phonons actually\nbelongs to the localized phonons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 20:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-10"}

In contrast to prior works, which often released\noffline packets, including the source code of a modified Tor client and a\nsnapshot of the Internet topology, ASmoniTor is an online system that assists\nend users with mitigating the threat of AS-level adversaries in a near\nreal-time fashion. For Tor clients proposed in previous works, users need to\ncompile the source code on their machine and continually update the snapshot of\nthe Internet topology in order to obtain accurate AS-path inferences. On the\ncontrary, ASmoniTor is an online platform that can be utilized easily by not\nonly technical users, but also by users without a technical background, because\nthey only need to access it via Tor and input two parameters to execute an\nAS-aware path selection algorithm. With ASmoniTor, the author makes three key\ntechnical contributions to the research against AS-level adversaries in the Tor\nnetwork. First, ASmoniTor does not require the users to initiate complicated\nsource code compilations. Second, it helps to reduce errors in AS-path\ninferences by letting users input a set of suspected ASes obtained directly\nfrom their own traceroute measurements. Third, the Internet topology database\nat the back-end of ASmoniTor is periodically updated to assure near real-time\nAS-path inferences between Tor exit nodes and the most likely visited websites.\nFinally, in addition to its convenience, ASmoniTor gives users full control\nover the information they want to input, thus preserving their privacy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 20:59:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-10"}

In the considered model, at the demand side, it is\nassumed that customers can act as prosumers who own renewable energy sources\nand can both produce and consume energy. Due to the coupling between the\nprosumers' decisions and the stochastic nature of renewable energy, the\ninteraction among prosumers is formulated as a stochastic game, in which each\nprosumer seeks to maximize its payoff, in terms of revenues, by controlling its\nenergy consumption and demand. In particular, the subjective behavior of\nprosumers is explicitly reflected into their payoff functions using prospect\ntheory, a powerful framework that allows modeling real-life human choices. For\nthis prospect-based stochastic game, it is shown that there always exists a\nstationary Nash equilibrium where the prosumers' trading policies in the\nequilibrium are independent of the time and their histories of the play.\nMoreover, a novel distributed algorithm with no information sharing among\nprosumers is proposed and shown to converge to an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium.\nOn the other hand, at the supply side, the interaction between the utility\ncompany and the prosumers is formulated as an online optimization problem in\nwhich the utility company's goal is to learn its optimal energy allocation\nrules. For this case, it is shown that such an optimization problem admits a\nno-regret algorithm meaning that regardless of the actual outcome of the game\namong the prosumers, the utility company can follow a strategy that mitigates\nits allocation costs as if it knew the entire demand market a priori.\nSimulation results show the convergence of the proposed algorithms to their\npredicted outcomes and present new insights resulting from prospect theory that\ncontribute toward more efficient energy management in the smart grids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 21:02:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2017 17:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

In this game,\nthe attacker launches cyber attacks on a number of cyber components of the CPS\nto maximize the potential harm to the physical system while the system operator\nchooses to defend a number of cyber nodes to thwart the attacks and minimize\npotential damage to the physical side. The proposed game explicitly accounts\nfor the fact that both attacker and defender can have different computational\ncapabilities and disparate levels of knowledge of the system.

A fundamental barrier for parallelizing large-scale SGD is the fact\nthat the cost of communicating the gradient updates between nodes can be very\nlarge. Consequently, lossy compression heuristics have been proposed, by which\nnodes only communicate quantized gradients. Although effective in practice,\nthese heuristics do not always provably converge, and it is not clear whether\nthey are optimal.\n  In this paper, we propose Quantized SGD (QSGD), a family of compression\nschemes which allow the compression of gradient updates at each node, while\nguaranteeing convergence under standard assumptions. QSGD allows the user to\ntrade off compression and convergence time: it can communicate a sublinear\nnumber of bits per iteration in the model dimension, and can achieve\nasymptotically optimal communication cost. We complement our theoretical\nresults with empirical data, showing that QSGD can significantly reduce\ncommunication cost, while being competitive with standard uncompressed\ntechniques on a variety of real tasks.\n  In particular, experiments show that gradient quantization applied to\ntraining of deep neural networks for image classification and automated speech\nrecognition can lead to significant reductions in communication cost, and\nend-to-end training time. For instance, on 16 GPUs, we are able to train a\nResNet-152 network on ImageNet 1.8x faster to full accuracy.

Furthermore, when a region\n$A$ and its complement $\\bar{A}$ are specified on the boundary\n$\\partial\\Sigma$, we show that the boundary entanglement entropy $S(A)$ of the\nemergent tensor network satisfies the Ryu-Takayanagi formula in the\nsemiclassical regime, i.e. $S(A)$ is proportional to the minimal area of the\nbulk surface attached to the boundary of $A$ in $\\partial\\Sigma$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 03:45:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 21:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-24"}

In the quadrupole scan, a larger drift distance between the\nquadrupole and the screen is preferred because it gives a better thin-lens\napproximation. A high bunch-charge beam, however, will undergo emittance growth\nin the long drift caused by the space-charge force. We present a method that\nmitigates this growth by introducing a quadrupole scan with a short drift and\nwithout using the thin-lens approximation. The quadrupole in this method is\ntreated as a thick lens, and the emittance is extracted by using the thick-lens\nequations. Apart from being precise, our method can be readily applied without\nmaking any change to the beamline and has no need for a big drift space.

For instance,\nimagine a set-up where unitary operations are easy to make, but only one\nmeasurement at the end of the experiment is allowed. In this paper, we provide\na general reconstruction scheme that yields operationally well-defined dynamics\nfor any conceivable kind of experimental situation. If one additional operation\ncan be performed, these `restricted' dynamics allow for the construction of\nwitnesses for initial correlations and the presence of memory effects.

Models of stars that differ from the Sun will\nrequire a good knowledge of the attenuation of the convective blueshift to\nestimate its impact on the variations. It is therefore crucial to precisely\ndetermine not only the amplitude of the convective blueshift for different\ntypes of stars, but also the dependence of this convective blueshift on\nmagnetic activity, as these are key factors in our model producing the RV. We\nstudied a sample of main sequence stars with spectral types from G0 to K2 and\nfocused on their temporally averaged properties: the activity level and a\ncriterion allowing to characterise the amplitude of the convective blueshift.\nWe find the differential velocity shifts of spectral lines due to convection to\ndepend on the spectral type, the wavelength (this dependence is correlated with\nthe Teff and activity level), and on the activity level. This allows us to\nquantify the dependence of granulation properties on magnetic activity for\nstars other than the Sun. The attenuation factor of the convective blueshift\nappears to be constant over the considered range of spectral types. We derive a\nconvective blueshift which decreases towards lower temperatures, with a trend\nin close agreement with models for Teff lower than 5800 K, but with a\nsignificantly larger global amplitude. We finally compare the observed RV\nvariation amplitudes with those that could be derived from our convective\nblueshift using a simple law and find a general agreement on the amplitude. Our\nresults are consistent with previous results and provide, for the first time,\nan estimation of the convective blueshift as a function of Teff, magnetic\nactivity, and wavelength, over a large sample of G and K main sequence stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 07:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

From the saddle point solutions, especially the excited\nstate solutions, it is shown that the system self-organizes into blocks coupled\nwith their neighbors like superspins, which are emergent variables. Taking the\nfluctuation around these saddle point solutions into account, we get an\neffective Hamiltonian, including the emergent superspins of the blocks, the\nfluctuation around the saddle point solutions, and their couplings. Applying\nStratonovich-Hubbard transformation to the part of superspins, we get a\nLandau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian for the blocks. From the saddle point\nequations for the blocks, we can get the second generation blocks, of which\nsizes are much larger than the first generation blocks. Repeating this\nprocedure again and again, we get many generations of blocks to describe the\nasymptotic behavior. If a field is applied, the effective field on the\nsuperspins is multiplied greatly and proportional to the block size. For a very\nsmall field, the effective field on the higher generation superspins can be so\nstrong to cause the superspins polarizaed radically. This can explain the extra\nlarge critical isotherm exponent discovered in the experiments. The phase space\nof reduced temperature vs. field is divided into many layers , in which\ndifferent generation blocks dominate the critical behavior. The sizes of the\ndifferent generation emergent blocks are new relevant length scales.

The essence of the\napproach is the use of underlying algebraic structure enforced in such problems\nby other practical constraints such as, for example, null shaping constraint.\nAccording to this approach, instead of relaxing the non-convex rankconstrained\nSDP problem to a feasible set of positive semidefinite matrices, we restrict it\nto a space of polynomials whose dimension is equal to the desired rank. The\nresulting optimization problem is then convex as its solution is required to be\nfull rank, and can be efficiently and exactly solved. A simple matrix\ndecomposition is needed to recover the solution of the original problem from\nthe solution of the restricted one. We show how this approach can be applied to\nsolving some important signal processing problems that contain null-shaping\nconstraints.

To that purpose, we\nconsider four groups of numerical tests, ranging from solutions of the\nthree-dimensional, force-free equilibrium, to magneto-hydrodynamical numerical\nsimulations. Almost all methods are found to produce the same value of magnetic\nhelicity within few percent in all tests.

The main technical\ntool used in this paper is a relativisation technique where ordinal analysis is\ncarried out relative to an arbitrary but fixed set x. A classic result from\nordinal analysis is the characterisation of the provably recursive functions of\nPeano Arithmetic, PA, by means of the fast growing hierarchy [10]. Whilst it is\npossible to formulate the natural numbers within KP, the theory speaks\nprimarily about sets. For this reason it is desirable to obtain a\ncharacterisation of its provably total set functions. We will show that KP\nproves the totality of a set function precisely when it falls within a\nhierarchy of set functions based upon a relativised constructible hierarchy\nstretching up in length to any ordinal below the Bachmann-Howard ordinal. As a\nconsequence of this result we obtain that IKP + forall x,y (x in y or x not in\ny) is conservative over KP for forall-exists-formulae, where IKP stands for\nintuitionistic Kripke-Platek set theory. In a similar vein, utilising [56], it\nis shown that KP(P) proves the totality of a set function precisely when it\nfalls within a hierarchy of set functions based upon a relativised von Neumann\nhierarchy of the same length. The relativisation technique applied to KP(P)\nwith the global axiom of choice, AC-global, also yields a parameterised\nextension of a result in [58], showing that KP(P) + AC-global is conservative\nover KP(P) + AC and CZF + AC for Pi_2 in powerset statements. Here AC stands\nfor the ordinary axiom of choice and CZF refers to constructive\nZermelo-Fraenkel set theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 09:06:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-10"}

For the\nmass ratio corresponding to $^{40}$K impurities in a gas of $^{87}$Rb atoms we\nprovide an explicit comparison with the experimental findings of a recent study\ncarried out at JILA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 09:40:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 08:51:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2016 21:44:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

Our formalism\nis applicable to general long-wavelength dynamics and, although here we\nexplicitly focus on ferromagnetic insulators possessing U(1) symmetry, our\napproach can be easily extended to other classes of magnetic materials. As an\nillustrative example, we apply our theory to investigate a domain wall floating\nover a spin superfluid, whose dynamics is triggered thermally at the system's\nedge. Our results demonstrate that the local pumping of coherent spin dynamics\nby a thermal magnon gas offers an alternative route - with no need for\nconducting components and thus devoid of Ohmic losses - for the control and\nmanipulation of topological solitons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 11:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

In spite of its obviousness as a problem, it has remained absent from the\nscientific debate due to the lack of candidates for a proper answer.

The dynamical scenario is rather generic since it\nis exclusively based on the reiterative occurrence of the two most standard\nmechanisms of nonlinear dynamics: the saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations, and\nits extraordinary richness makes feasible the well-defined occurrence of\nordered features over enormously complex dynamical activities as simply arising\nfrom the proper structure of dynamical relations among the system components,\ni.e., without requiring any other physical cause than those involved in such\nrelations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 11:03:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 09:28:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 12:01:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 08:14:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

The distribution of the random\nshift is determined solely by the large-distance (\"infra-red\", IR) limit of the\nmodel, and is equal to the free energy distribution at the critical temperature\nup to a translation. the decoration process is determined solely by the\nsmall-distance (\"ultraviolet\", UV) limit, in terms of the biased minimal\nprocess. Our approach provides connections of the replica framework to results\nin the probability literature and sheds further light on the freezing/duality\nconjecture which was the source of many previous results for log-REMs. In this\nway we derive the general and explicit formulae for the joint probability\ndensity of depths of the first and second minima (as well its higher-order\ngeneralizations) in terms of model-specific contributions from UV as well as IR\nlimits. In particular, we show that the second min statistics is largely\nindependent of details of UV data, whose influence is seen only through the\nmean value of the gap. For a given log-correlated field this parameter can be\nevaluated numerically, and we provide several numerical tests of our theory\nusing the circular model of $1/f$-noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 11:05:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-20"}

(2015a).\n  Results: For 1.0 Msun stars, the winds can be accelerated to several thousand\nkm/s, and the effects of magneto-centrifugal forces are much weaker for lower\nmass stars. We find that the different assumptions for how to scale the wind\ntemperature to other stars lead to significantly different mass loss rates for\nthe rapid rotators. If we assume a constant temperature, the mass loss rates of\nsolar mass stars do not saturate at rapid rotation, which we show to be\ninconsistent with observed rotational evolution. If we assume the wind\ntemperatures scale positively with rotation, the mass loss rates are only\ninfluenced significantly at rotation rates above 75 OmegaSun. We suggest that\nmodels with increasing wind speed for more rapid rotators are preferable to\nthose that assume a constant wind speed. If this conclusion is confirmed by\nmore sophisticated wind modelling. it might provide an interesting\nobservational constraint on the properties of stellar winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 12:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

Currently,\nthe most effective methods are based on three steps: 1) detection of individual\n$\\mu$C candidates, 2) clustering of individual $\\mu$C candidates, and 3)\nclassification of $\\mu$C clusters. Where the second step is motivated both to\nreduce the number of false positive detections from the first step and on the\nevidence that malignancy depends on a relatively large number of $\\mu$C\ndetections within a certain area. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to\n$\\mu$C detection, consisting of the detection \\emph{and} classification of\nindividual $\\mu$C candidates, using shape and appearance features, using a\ncascade of boosting classifiers. The final step in our approach then clusters\nthe remaining individual $\\mu$C candidates. The main advantage of this approach\nlies in its ability to reject a significant number of false positive $\\mu$C\ncandidates compared to previously proposed methods. Specifically, on the\nINbreast dataset, we show that our approach has a true positive rate (TPR) for\nindividual $\\mu$Cs of 40\\% at one false positive per image (FPI) and a TPR of\n80\\% at 10 FPI.

A specific class of these\nnew preconditioners are considered here.

This common formulation allows us to explain in detail how and\nwhy all these methods work. The domain decomposition formulation also allows us\nto avoid technicalities in the implementation description we give of these\nrecent methods.\n  The equivalence of these methods with optimized Schwarz methods translates at\nthe discrete level into equivalence with approximate block LU decomposition\npreconditioners, and we give in each case the algebraic version, including a\ndetailed description of the approximations used. While we chose to use the\nHelmholtz equation for which these methods were developed, our notation is\ncompletely general and the algorithms we give are written for an arbitrary\nsecond order elliptic operator.

Finally, we discuss the concept of $\\beta^{k}$-derivation of\nBiHom-Lie superalgebras and prove that the set of all $\\beta^{k}$-derivation\nhas a natural BiHom-Lie superalgebra structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 14:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-10"}

In our model every network node is associated with a virtual\ncommunity and a trust index, which quantitatively measures the trustworthiness\nof this node in its community. If a sensor node's trust value is smaller than a\nthreshold, it suggests that this node encounters a fault and thus its sensor\nreading can not be trusted at this moment. This concept of sensor node trust\ndiscriminates our model with the other alternatives, e.g.,the Markov random\nfields. The practical issues, including spatiotemporal correlations of neighbor\nnodes' sensor readings, the presence of sensor faults and the requirement of\nonline processing are linked together by the concept trust and are all taken\ninto account in the modeling stage. Based on the proposed model, the trust\nvalue of each node is updated online by a particle filter algorithm upon the\narrival of new observations. The decision on whether a node is located in the\nevent region is made based upon the current estimate of this node's trust\nvalue. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can provide\nstriking better performance than existent methods in terms of error rate in\ndetecting the event region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 14:00:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 17:19:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-19"}

The growing (unstable)\nmodes of the temperature distribution along the surface may be responsible for\nthe LIPSS (Laser Induced Periodic Surface Structures) formation. After the end\nof the laser pulse and before the complete coupling between lattice and\nelectrons occurs, the evolution of the amplitude of the subsequent modulation\nin the lattice temperature reveals different tendencies depending on the\nspatial period of the initial modulation. This instability-like behaviour is\nshown to arise due to the perturbation of the electronic temperature which\nrelaxes slower for bigger spatial periods and thus imparts more significant\nmodulations to the lattice temperature. Small spatial periods of the order of\n100 nm and smaller experience stabilization and fast decay from the more\nefficient lateral heat diffusion which facilitates the relaxation of the\nelectronic temperature amplitude due to in-depth diffusion. An analytical\ninstability analysis of a simplified version of the TTM set of equations\nsupports the lattice temperature modulation behaviour obtained in the\nsimulations and reveals that in-depth diffusion length is a determining\nparameter in the dispersion relation of unstable modes.

These heterocysts form a\nquasi-regular pattern in the filament, representing a prototype of patterning\nand morphogenesis in prokaryotes. Recent years have seen advances in the\nidentification of the molecular mechanism regulating this pattern. We use this\ndata to build a theory on heterocyst pattern formation, for which both genetic\nregulation and the effects of cell division and filament growth are key\ncomponents. The theory is based on the interplay of three generic mechanisms:\nlocal autoactivation, early long range inhibition, and late long range\ninhibition. These mechanisms can be identified with the dynamics of hetR, patS\nand hetN expression. Our theory reproduces quantitatively the experimental\ndynamics of pattern formation and maintenance for wild type and mutants. We\nfind that hetN alone is not enough to play the role as the late inhibitory\nmechanism: a second mechanism, hypothetically the products of nitrogen fixation\nsupplied by heterocysts, must also play a role in late long range inhibition.\nThe preponderance of even intervals between heterocysts arises naturally as a\nresult of the interplay between the timescales of genetic regulation and cell\ndivision.

A recently emerging area where\nnucleation is highly relevant is the initiation of filamentous protein\nself-assembly, a process that has broad implications from medicine to\nnanotechnology. As such, spontaneous nucleation of protein fibrils has received\nmuch attention in recent years with many theoretical and experimental studies\nfocussing on the underlying physical principles. In this paper we make a step\nforward in this direction and explore the early time behaviour of filamentous\nprotein growth in the context of nucleation theory. We first provide an\noverview of the thermodynamics and kinetics of spontaneous nucleation of\nprotein filaments in the presence of one relevant degree of freedom, namely the\ncluster size. In this case, we review how key kinetic observables, such as the\nreaction order of spontaneous nucleation, are directly related to the physical\nsize of the critical nucleus. We then focus on the increasingly prominent case\nof filament nucleation that includes a conformational conversion of the\nnucleating building-block as an additional slow step in the nucleation process.\nUsing computer simulations, we study the concentration dependence of the\nnucleation rate. We find that, under these circumstances, the reaction order of\nspontaneous nucleation with respect to the free monomer does no longer relate\nto the overall physical size of the nucleating aggregate but rather to the\nportion of the aggregate that actively participates in the conformational\nconversion. Our results thus provide a novel interpretation of the common\nkinetic descriptors of protein filament formation, including the reaction order\nof the nucleation step or the scaling exponent of lag times, and put into\nperspective current theoretical descriptions of protein aggregation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 15:18:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2017 11:55:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-05"}

We test the hypothesis that barlenses, roundish\ncentral components embedded in bars, could form a part of the bar in a similar\nmanner to boxy/peanut bulges in the edge-on view. A sample of 79 barlens\ngalaxies was selected from the S$^4$G and the NIRS0S surveys. The sizes,\nellipticities, and orientations of barlenses were measured and used to define\nthe barlens regions in the color measurements. The orientations of barlenses\nwere studied with respect to those of the \"thin bars\" and the line-of-nodes of\nthe disks. For 47 galaxies color maps were constructed using the SDSS images in\nfive optical bands, u, g, r, i, and z. Colors of bars, barlenses, disks, and\ncentral regions of the galaxies were measured using two different approaches\nand color-color diagrams sensitive to metallicity, stellar surface gravity, and\nshort lived stars were constructed. Color differences between the structure\ncomponents were calculated for each individual galaxy, and presented in\nhistogram form. We find that the colors of barlenses are very similar to those\nof the surrounding bars, indicating that most probably they form part of the\nbar. We also find that barlenses have orientations closer to the disk\nline-of-nodes than to the thin bars, which is consistent with the idea that\nthey are vertically thick, in a similar manner as the boxy/peanut structures in\nmore inclined galaxies. Typically, the colors of barlenses are similar to those\nof normal E/S0 galaxies. Galaxy by galaxy studies show that in spiral galaxies\nvery dusty barlenses also exist, along with barlenses with rejuvenated stellar\npopulations. The central regions of galaxies are found to be on average redder\nthan bars or barlenses, although galaxies with bluer central peaks also exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 15:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

One reason for this is the fact that a fine mesh is required to\naccurately discretize the electrical conductivity model of a given setting.\nThis conductivity model may vary over several orders of magnitude and these\nvariations can occur over a large range of length scales. Using a very fine\nmesh for the discretization of this setting leads to the necessity to solve a\nlarge system of equations that is often difficult to deal with. To keep the\nsimulations computationally tractable, coarse meshes are often employed for the\ndiscretization of the model. Such coarse meshes typically fail to capture the\nfine-scale variations in the conductivity model resulting in inaccuracies in\nthe predicted data. In this work, we introduce a framework for constructing a\ncoarse-mesh or upscaled conductivity model based on a prescribed fine-mesh\nmodel. Rather than using analytical expressions, we opt to pose upscaling as a\nparameter estimation problem. By solving an optimization problem, we obtain a\ncoarse-mesh conductivity model. The optimization criterion can be tailored to\nthe survey setting in order to produce coarse models that accurately reproduce\nthe predicted data generated on the fine mesh. This allows us to upscale\narbitrary conductivity structures, as well as to better understand the meaning\nof the upscaled quantity. We use 1D and 3D examples to demonstrate that the\nproposed framework is able to emulate the behavior of the heterogeneity in the\nfine-mesh conductivity model, and to produce an accurate description of the\ndesired predicted data obtained by using a coarse mesh in the simulation\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 00:12:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

The Blazhko effect, in RR Lyrae type stars, is a century old\nmystery. Dozens of theory exists, but none have been able to entirely reproduce\nthe observational facts associated to this modulation phenomenon. Existing\ntheory all rely on the usual continuous modelization of the star. Aims. We\npresent a new paradigm which will not only explain the Blazhko effect, but at\nthe same time, will give us alternative explanations to the red limit of the\ninstability strip, the synchronization of layers, the mode selection and the\nexistence of a limit cycle for radially pulsating stars. Methods. We describe\nthe RR Lyrae type pulsating stars as a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators.\nConsidering a spatial discretisation of the star, supposing a spherical\nsymmetry, we develop the equation of motion and energy up to the third order in\nthe radial and adiabatic case. Then, we include the influence of the ionization\nregion as a relaxation oscillator by including elements from synchronisation\ntheory. Results. This discrete approach allows us to exploit existing results\nin the coupled nonlinear oscillator field. For instance, the study of\nsynchronicity leads to an explanation of the mode selection, the layers\nsynchronisation, the limit cycle and the red limit of the instability strip.\nBut, most of all, the analogy with the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) experiment\nenables us to understand the Blazhko effect.
