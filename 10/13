In particular, this work\nprovides a sharp analysis of: (1) mini-batching, a method of averaging many\nsamples of a stochastic gradient to both reduce the variance of the stochastic\ngradient estimate and for parallelizing SGD and (2) tail-averaging, a method\ninvolving averaging the final few iterates of SGD to decrease the variance in\nSGD's final iterate. This work presents non-asymptotic excess risk bounds for\nthese schemes for the stochastic approximation problem of least squares\nregression.\n  Furthermore, this work establishes a precise problem-dependent extent to\nwhich mini-batch SGD yields provable near-linear parallelization speedups over\nSGD with batch size one. This allows for understanding learning rate versus\nbatch size tradeoffs for the final iterate of an SGD method.

A non-asymptotic\nanalysis of communication efficient parallelization schemes such as\nmodel-averaging/parameter mixing methods is then provided.\n  Finally, this work sheds light on some fundamental differences in SGD's\nbehavior when dealing with agnostic noise in the (non-realizable) least squares\nregression problem.

In this region of\nthicknesses, the dimension resonance occurs, where an index of refraction has a\nmaximum and a coefficient of absorption has a minimum. The numerical\ncalculation of the optical parameters of some materials (Ag, Al, Fe, Ge, Si,\nSe, Te) have been carried out with the use of the experimental data of\nreflection and transparency of thin layers, obtained in a series of works, and\nwith our formulas for the wave amplitudes and the laws of refractions. The\nanalogues of the Fresnel formulas and the Snell law have been derived from the\nMaxwell boundary conditions where the absorption and conductivity of media were\ntaken into account.

The modest metallicity dependence\nimplies that if WC or WO stars are formed in metal deficient environments,\ntheir mass-loss rates are higher than currently anticipated.

The initial value problem then consists of specifying initial data\nfor all relevant fields on one such a spatial hypersurface. These fields are\nthe 3-metric and extrinsic curvature together with matter fields such as fluid\nvelocity, energy density and rest mass density. There is a lot of freedom in\nchoosing such initial data. This freedom corresponds to the physical state of\nthe system at the initial time. At the same time the initial data have to\nsatisfy the Hamiltonian and momentum constraint equations of General Relativity\nand can thus not be chosen completely freely. We discuss the conformal\ntransverse traceless and conformal thin sandwich decompositions that are\ncommonly used in the construction of constraint satisfying initial data. These\ndecompositions allow us to specify certain free data that describe the physical\nnature of the system. The remaining metric fields are then determined by\nsolving elliptic equations derived from the constraint equations. We describe\ninitial data for single black holes and single neutron stars, and how we can\nuse conformal decompositions to construct initial data for binaries made up of\nblack holes or neutron stars. Orbiting binaries will emit gravitational\nradiation and thus lose energy. Since the emitted radiation tends to\ncircularize the orbits over time, one can thus expect that the objects in a\ntypical binary move on almost circular orbits with slowly shrinking radii. This\nleads us to the concept of quasi-equilibrium which essentially assumes that\ntime derivatives are negligible in corotating coordinates, for binaries on\nalmost circular orbits. We review how quasi-equilibrium assumptions can be used\nto make physically well motivated approximations that simplify the elliptic\nequations we have to solve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2016 17:52:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2016 14:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

The dynamics of scroll waves is affected\nby the presence of inhomogeneities, which, in a very general way, can be of\n\\textit{(i)} ionic type, i.e., they affect the reaction part, or \\textit{(ii)}\nconduction type, i.e., they affect the diffusion part of an RD equation.

This is well\nassessed by observations in the local Universe. However the efficiency of this\nmechanism has poorly been tested so far for high redshift, actively star\nforming, galaxies. We present a suite of pc-resolution hydrodynamical numerical\nsimulations to compare the star formation process along a merging sequence of\nhigh and low z galaxies, by varying the gas mass fraction between the two\nmodels. We show that, for the same orbit, high-redshift gas-rich mergers are\nless efficient than low-redshift ones at producing starbursts: the star\nformation rate excess induced by the merger and its duration are both around 10\ntimes lower than in the low gas fraction case. The mechanisms that account for\nthe star formation triggering at low redshift - the increased compressive\nturbulence, gas fragmentation, and central gas inflows - are only mildly, if\nnot at all, enhanced for high gas fraction galaxy encounters. Furthermore, we\nshow that the strong stellar feedback from the initially high star formation\nrate in high redshift galaxies does not prevent an increase of the star\nformation during the merger. Our results are consistent with the observed\nincrease of the number of major mergers with increasing redshift being faster\nthan the respective increase in the number of starburst galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2016 21:03:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 16:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

The photocurrent excited with incident p-polarized light (the\ncase for resonant surface plasmon excitation) is significantly amplified in\ncomparison with that for s-polarized light (without surface plasmon\nresonances). We observe that the photocurrent is greater for shorter\nwavelengths (for both s and p-polarizations) due to the increased photothermal\ncurrent resulting from higher damping of surface plasmons at shorter wavelength\nexcitation. Position-dependent Raman spectroscopic analysis of the\noptically-excited graphene photodetector indicates the presence of charge\ncarriers near the metallic edge.

In the recent decade with the availability of \"big\ndata\", more and more experiments have large sample size and increasingly rich\nside information that enable and require experimenters to discover and\nunderstand heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE). There are two aspects in HTE\nunderstanding, one is to predict the effect conditioned on a given set of side\ninformation or a given individual, the other is to interpret the HTE structure\nand summarize it in a memorable way. The former aspect can be treated as a\nregression problem, and the latter aspect focuses on concise summarization and\ninterpretation.

In usual circumstances, this direct space\ncondition is equivalent to the Fourier space hyperuniformity condition that the\nstructure factor vanishes as the wavenumber goes to zero. In this paper, we\ncomprehensively study the effect of aspherical window shapes with\ncharacteristic size $L$ on the direct space condition for hyperuniform systems.\nFor lattices, we demonstrate that the variance growth rate can depend on the\nshape as well as the orientation of the windows, and in some cases, the growth\nrate can be faster than the window volume ($L^d$), which may lead one to\nfalsely conclude that the system is non-hyperuniform solely according to the\ndirect space condition. We analyze the effect of window orientation on the\ngrowth rate, especially for two-dimensional lattices using square windows.\nBased on this analysis, we explain the reason why the variance can grow faster\nthan the window area ($L^2$) or even slower than the window perimeter ($L$).\nThis analysis demonstrates an example of physical systems exhibiting\ncommensurate-incommensurate transitions and is closely related to problems in\nnumber theory (e.g., Diophantine approximation and Gauss' circle problem) and\ndiscrepancy theory. We prove that for a hyperuniform system its\norientationally-averaged variance, instead of the conventional one using\nwindows with a fixed orientation, has a common large-$L$ asymptotic behavior\nregardless of the window shape (for convex windows), thus it can be used to\nresolve the window-shape dependence of the growth rate of the variance on the\nspherical-window condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 03:20:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2016 05:31:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 22:37:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-24"}

Complex\ncalls lead males to a greater reproductive success than simple calls do.\nHowever, the complex calls are also more attractive to the main predator of\nthese amphibians, the bat Trachops cirrhosus. Therefore, as M. Ryan suggests,\nthe complexity of the calls let the frogs keep a trade off between reproductive\nsuccess and predation. In this paper, we first propose to model the proportion\nof simple to complex calls as a symmetric game of two strategies. We also\npropose a model with three strategies (simple callers, complex callers and\nquiet males), where we assess the effect of a male that keeps quiet and\nintercepts females, which would play a role of Intrasexual selection. We\nanalyze the stable points of the replicator equations of the models that we\npropose. Under the assumption that the decision of the males takes into account\nthis trade off between reproductive success and predation, our model reproduces\nthe observed behavior reported in the literature with minimal assumption on the\nparameters. From the three strategies model, we verify that the quiet strategy\ncould only coexists with the simple and complex strategies as long as the rate\nat which quiet males intercept females is high.

Most previous\nwork on random financial networks assumes independent connections between\nbanks, whereas our framework explicitly allows for (dis)assortative edge\nprobabilities (e.g., a tendency for small banks to link to large banks). We\nanalyze default cascades triggered by shocking the network and find that the\ncascade can be understood as an explicit iterated mapping on a set of edge\nprobabilities that converges to a fixed point. We derive a cascade condition\nthat characterizes whether or not an infinitesimal shock to the network can\ngrow to a finite size cascade, in analogy to the basic reproduction number\n$R_0$ in epidemic modelling. The cascade condition provides an easily computed\nmeasure of the systemic risk inherent in a given banking network topology.\nUsing the percolation theory for random networks we also derive an analytic\nformula for the frequency of global cascades. Although the analytical methods\nare derived for infinite networks, we demonstrate using Monte Carlo simulations\nthe applicability of the results to finite-sized networks. We show that\nedge-assortativity, the propensity of nodes to connect to similar nodes, can\nhave a strong effect on the level of systemic risk as measured by the cascade\ncondition. However, the effect of assortativity on systemic risk is subtle, and\nwe propose a simple graph theoretic quantity, which we call the\ngraph-assortativity coefficient, that can be used to assess systemic risk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 04:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

This scenario is\nthought to be quite common in the interiors of stars and giant planets, and\nunderstanding the transport of heat and chemical species by ODDC is of great\nimportance to stellar and planetary evolution models. Fluids unstable to ODDC\nhave a tendency to form convective thermo-compositional layers which\nsignificantly enhance the fluxes of temperature and chemical composition\ncompared with microscopic diffusion. Although a number of recent studies have\nfocused on studying properties of both layered and non-layered ODDC, few have\naddressed how additional physical processes such as global rotation affect its\ndynamics.

In both methods, the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA), which\ndecouples excitations and de-excitations, is widely used to reduce\ncomputational cost. Here, we study the effect of the TDA on exciton binding\nenergies of solids obtained from the Casida equation using long-range corrected\n(LRC) exchange-correlation kernels. We find that the TDA underestimates\nTDDFT-LRC exciton binding energies of semiconductors slightly, but those of\ninsulators significantly (i.e., by more than 100%), and thus it is essential to\nsolve the full Casida equation to describe strongly bound excitons. These\nfindings are relevant in the ongoing search for accurate and efficient TDDFT\napproaches for excitons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 06:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-14"}

The critical pressure corresponding to the closure of\nthe band gap is calculated, at which BiTeI becomes a topological insulator.\nComparison of the critical pressure to the pressure at which BiTeI undergoes a\nstructural phase transition indicates that the closure of the band gap would\nnot be hindered by a structural transformation.

Companies try to\ncommercialize these data using data mining or machine learning methods. For\nthis purpose, the data are categorized or classified, but often at high\n(monetary or temporal) costs. An effective approach to reduce these costs is to\napply any kind of active learning (AL) methods, as AL controls the training\nprocess of a classifier by specific querying individual data points (samples),\nwhich are then labeled (e.g., provided with class memberships) by a domain\nexpert. However, an analysis of current AL research shows that AL still has\nsome shortcomings. In particular, the structure information given by the\nspatial pattern of the (un)labeled data in the input space of a classification\nmodel (e.g.,~cluster information), is used in an insufficient way. In addition,\nmany existing AL techniques pay too little attention to their practical\napplicability. To meet these challenges, this article presents several\ntechniques that together build a new approach for combining AL and\nsemi-supervised learning (SSL) for support vector machines (SVM) in\nclassification tasks. Structure information is captured by means of\nprobabilistic models that are iteratively improved at runtime when label\ninformation becomes available. The probabilistic models are considered in a\nselection strategy based on distance, density, diversity, and distribution (4DS\nstrategy) information for AL and in a kernel function (Responsibility Weighted\nMahalanobis kernel) for SVM. The approach fuses generative and discriminative\nmodeling techniques. With 20 benchmark data sets and with the MNIST data set it\nis shown that our new solution yields significantly better results than\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 09:36:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 09:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-17"}

Using this\ncondition, we first prove that every $K_4$-minor free graph of odd-girth $2k+1$\nadmits a homomorphism to the projective hypercube of dimension $2k$.

Restricting our attention to a path allows us to implicitly\ncompute reachability between the path vertices and the rest of the graph in\ntime that depends logarithmically rather than linearly in the size of the path.\nThis new observation alone, however, is not enough, since we need to find an\nefficient way to represent the strongly connected components using paths.

These rules are then fed into an inference engine to produce a fuzzy\ninference system (FIS) and to infer the results. In this paper, we have used a\nSugeno type fuzzy inference system to build the FES. At the next step, the\nadaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is used to refine the FES\nparameters and improve its performance. The proposed framework is then employed\nto attain the performance of a human expert used to predict earthquakes in the\nZagros area based on the idea of coupled earthquakes.

Strong magnetic field is a necessary\ningredient for jet formation, however, the advection of the external field in a\ngeometrically thin disk is inefficient. The gas with a small angular velocity\nmay fall from the Bondi radius $R_{\\rm B}$ nearly freely to the circularization\nradius $R_{\\rm c}$, and a thin accretion disk is formed within $R_{\\rm c}$. We\nsuggest that the external magnetic field is substantially enhanced in this\nregion, and the magnetic field at $R_{\\rm c}$ can be sufficiently strong to\ndrive outflows from the disk if the angular velocity of the gas is low at\n$R_{\\rm B}$. The magnetic field is efficiently dragged in the disk, because\nmost angular momentum of the disk is removed by the outflows that leads to a\nsignificantly high radial velocity. The strong magnetic field formed in this\nway may accelerate jets in the region near the black hole either by the\nBlandford-Payne or/and Blandford-Znajek mechanisms. We suggest that the radio\ndichotomy of AGNs predominantly originates from the angular velocity of the\ncircumnuclear gas. An AGN will appear as a radio-loud (RL) one if the angular\nvelocity of the circumnuclear gas is lower than a critical value at the Bondi\nradius, otherwise, it will appear as a radio-quiet (RQ) AGN. This is supported\nby the observations that RL nuclei are invariably hosted by core galaxies. Our\nmodel suggests that the mass growth of the black holes in RL quasars is much\nfaster than that in RQ quasars with the same luminosity, which is consistent\nwith the fact that the massive black holes in RL quasars are systematically a\nfew times heavier than those in their RQ counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 13:05:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 01:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

The reduced Hilbert space is generated via the\nparticle-number projected BCS state along with projected seniority-zero two and\nfour quasi-particle excitations. Furthermore, the extent by which the\nunderlying BCS state breaks U(1) symmetry is optimized in presence of the\nprojected two and four quasi-particle excitations... The quality of the newly\ndesigned method is tested against exact solutions of the so-called attractive\npairing Hamiltonian problem.\n  Results: By construction, the method reproduce exact results for N=2 and N=4.\nFor N=(8,16,20) the error on the ground-state correlation energy is less than\n(0.006, 0.1, 0.15) % across the entire range of inter-nucleon coupling defining\nthe pairing Hamiltonian and driving the normal-to-superfluid quantum phase\ntransition. The presently proposed method offers the advantage to automatically\naccess the low-lying spectroscopy, which it does with high accuracy.\n  Conclusions: The numerical cost of the newly designed variational method is\npolynomial (N$^6$) in system size. It achieves an unprecedented accuracy on the\nground-state correlation energy, effective pairing gap and one-body entropy as\nwell as on the excitation energy of low-lying states of the attractive pairing\nHamiltonian. This constitutes a strong enough motivation to envision its\napplication to realistic nuclear Hamiltonians in view of providing a\ncomplementary, accurate and versatile ab initio description of mid-mass\nopen-shell nuclei in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 13:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

Previous\nstudies of this framework have focused on a particular class of DDM ensembles\n--- motivated primarily by KK towers in theories with extra dimensions --- in\nwhich the density of states scales roughly as a polynomial of mass. In this\npaper, by contrast, we study the properties of a different class of DDM\nensembles in which the density of states grows exponentially with mass.\nEnsembles with this Hagedorn-like property arise naturally as the \"hadrons\"\nassociated with the confining phase of a strongly-coupled dark sector; they\nalso arise naturally as the gauge-neutral bulk states of Type I string\ntheories. We study the dynamical properties of such ensembles, and demonstrate\nthat an appropriate DDM-like balancing between decay widths and abundances can\nemerge naturally --- even with an exponentially rising density of states. We\nalso study the effective equations of state for such ensembles, and investigate\nsome of the model-independent observational constraints on such ensembles that\nfollow directly from these equations of state. In general, we find that such\nconstraints tend to introduce correlations between various properties of these\nDDM ensembles such as their associated mass scales, lifetimes, and abundance\ndistributions. For example, we find that these constraints allow DDM ensembles\nwith energy scales ranging from the GeV scale all the way to the Planck scale,\nbut the total present-day cosmological abundance of the dark sector must be\nspread across an increasing number of different states in the ensemble as these\nenergy scales are dialed from the Planck scale down to the GeV scale.

This paper considers a hybrid coordinated scheme\nas a means to benefit from both policies. Consider the downlink of a\nmulti-cloud radio access network, where each cloud is connected to several\nbase-stations (BSs) via high capacity links, and, therefore, allows for joint\nsignal processing within the cloud transmission. Across the multiple clouds,\nhowever, only scheduling-level coordination is permitted, as low levels of\nbackhaul communication are feasible. The frame structure of every BS is\ncomposed of various time/frequency blocks, called power-zones (PZs), which are\nmaintained at a fixed power level. The paper addresses the problem of\nmaximizing a network-wide utility by associating users to clouds and scheduling\nthem to the PZs, under the practical constraints that each user is scheduled to\na single cloud at most, but possibly to many BSs within the cloud, and can be\nserved by one or more distinct PZs within the BSs' frame. The paper solves the\nproblem using graph theory techniques by constructing the conflict graph. The\nconsidered scheduling problem is, then, shown to be equivalent to a\nmaximum-weight independent set problem in the constructed graph, which can be\nsolved using efficient techniques. The paper then proposes solving the problem\nusing both optimal and heuristic algorithms that can be implemented in a\ndistributed fashion across the network. The proposed distributed algorithms\nrely on the well-chosen structure of the constructed conflict graph utilized to\nsolve the maximum-weight independent set problem. Simulation results suggest\nthat the proposed optimal and heuristic hybrid scheduling strategies provide\nappreciable gain as compared to the scheduling-level coordinated networks, with\na negligible degradation to signal-level coordination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 15:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-14"}
