A well-known construction of such functions comes from\nBochner's characterization, which connects a positive-definite function with a\nprobability distribution. Another construction, which appears to have attracted\nless attention, is Polya's criterion that characterizes a subset of these\nfunctions. In this paper, we study the latter characterization and derive a\nnumber of novel kernels little known previously.\n  In the context of large-scale kernel machines, Rahimi and Recht (2007)\nproposed a random feature map (random Fourier) that approximates a kernel\nfunction, through independent sampling of the probability distribution in\nBochner's characterization. The authors also suggested another feature map\n(random binning), which, although not explicitly stated, comes from Polya's\ncharacterization. We show that with the same number of random samples, the\nrandom binning map results in an Euclidean inner product closer to the kernel\nthan does the random Fourier map. The superiority of the random binning map is\nconfirmed empirically through regressions and classifications in the\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 16:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-28"}

In this\npaper, we work in the rigid-spacetime approximation and consider field\ntrajectories within the single-field attractor, which is a generic feature of\nthese models. We construct the Floquet charts to find regions of parameter\nspace in which particle production is efficient for both the adiabatic and\nisocurvature modes, and analyze the resonance structure using analytic and\nsemi-analytic techniques. Particle production in the adiabatic direction is\ncharacterized by the existence of an asymptotic scaling solution at large\nvalues of the nonminimal couplings, $\\xi_I \\gg 1$, in which the dominant\ninstability band arises in the long-wavelength limit, for comoving wavenumbers\n$k \\rightarrow 0$. However, the large-$\\xi_I$ regime is not reached until\n$\\xi_I \\geq {\\cal O} (100)$. In the intermediate regime, with $\\xi_I \\sim {\\cal\nO}(1 - 10)$, the resonance structure depends strongly on wavenumber and\ncouplings. The resonance structure for isocurvature perturbations is distinct\nand more complicated than its adiabatic counterpart. An intermediate regime,\nfor $\\xi_I \\sim {\\cal O} (1 - 10)$, is again evident. For large values of\n$\\xi_I$, the Floquet chart consists of densely spaced, nearly parallel\ninstability bands, suggesting a very efficient preheating behavior. The\nincreased efficiency arises from features of the nontrivial field-space\nmanifold in the Einstein frame, which itself arises from the fields' nonminimal\ncouplings in the Jordan frame, and has no analogue in models with minimal\ncouplings. Quantitatively, the approach to the large-$\\xi_I$ asymptotic\nsolution for isocurvature modes is slower than in the case of the adiabatic\nmodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 16:22:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Jan 2018 17:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-30"}

In the latter case, we compute the\ngravitational $1/N$ corrections to the bulk field in various gauges, and then\nwrite a CFT expression for a putative bulk field whose geodesic integral\ncaptures the contribution of Virasoro descendants to the OPE of interest.

We consider both deformed nuclei, in which the pairing condensate is\nweak and the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation is the appropriate mean-field\ntheory, and nuclei with strong pairing condensates, in which the appropriate\ntheory is the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approximation, a method that\nexplicitly violates particle-number conservation. For the HFB approximation, we\npresent a general projection formula for a condensate that is time-reversal\ninvariant and a simpler formula for the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) limit,\nwhich is realized in nuclei with spherical condensates. We apply the method to\nthree heavy nuclei: a typical deformed nucleus $^{162}$Dy, a typical spherical\nnucleus $^{148}$Sm, and a transitional nucleus $^{150}$Sm in which the pairing\ncondensate is deformed.

Moreover, such a demonstration\nwould be a breakthrough at the level of fundamental physics: the first clear\ndemonstration of a non-Abelian excitation. It is therefore important to clarify\nthe expected signals of Majorana physics in the braiding context, and to\ndifferentiate these signals from those that might also arise in non-topological\nvariants of the same system. A definitive and critical distinction between\nsignals expected in topological (i.e. anyonic) and non-topological (i.e.\ntrivial) situations is therefore essential for future progress in the field.

The theoretical\nmodels outline the strong dependence of this quantity on the underlying star\nformation history. Spiral galaxies are characterised by a nearly constant DTS\nas a function of the stellar mass and cosmic time, whereas PSPHs present an\nearly steep increase of the DTS, which stops at a maximal value and decreases\nin the latest stages. In their late starburst phase, these models show a\ndecrease of the DTS with their mass, which allows us to explain the observed\nanti-correlation between the DTS and the stellar mass. The observed redshift\nevolution of the DTS ratio shows an increase from z~0 to z~1, followed by a\nroughly constant behaviour at 1<z<2.5.

In such materials, time-dependent\npumping of electrons from a non-chiral external source generates a\nnon-vanishing chiral chemical potential. This is due to the different\ncapacities of the left- and right-handed (LH and RH) chiral Weyl cones arising\nfrom the difference in the density of states in the LH and RH cones. The chiral\nchemical potential then generates, via the chiral anomaly, a current along the\ndirection of an applied magnetic field even in the absence of an external\nelectric field. The source of chirality imbalance in this new setup is thus due\nto the band structure of the system and the presence of (non-chiral) electron\nsource, and not due to the parallel electric and magnetic fields.

By analysis of archival RXTE data of six oscillation\nsources, we investigate the accretion rate dependence of the amplitude of burst\noscillations. This more than doubles the size of the sample analysed previously\nby Muno et al. (2004), who found indications for a relationship between\naccretion rate and oscillation amplitudes. We find that burst oscillation\nsignals can be detected at all observed accretion rates. Moreover, oscillations\nat low accretion rates are found to have relatively small amplitudes\n($A_\\text{rms}\\leq0.10$) while oscillations detected in bursts observed at high\naccretion rates cover a broad spread in amplitudes ($0.05\\leq\nA_\\text{rms}\\leq0.20$). In this paper we present the results of our analysis\nand discuss these in the light of current burst oscillation models.\nAdditionally, we investigate the bursts of two sources without previously\ndetected oscillations.

The first extends the\nwell-known cardinality bound $2^{\\psi(X)}$ for a compactum $X$ in a new\ndirection.

This provides the first broadband X-ray spectral analysis of\nthe source, spanning nearly two decades in energy (0.5-30 keV). Previous X-ray\nobservations of the source below 10 keV indicated strong reflection/obscuration\non the basis of a pronounced iron fluorescence line at 6.4 keV. The hard X-ray\nenergy coverage of NuSTAR, together with self-consistent toroidal reprocessing\nmodels, enables direct broadband constraints on the obscuring column density of\nthe source. We find the source to be heavily Compton-thick (CTK) with an\nobscuring column in excess of $3.6\\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, unconstrained at\nthe upper end. We further find an intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity of\n$\\textrm{log}_{10}(L_{\\textrm{2-10 keV}} \\textrm{[erg s}^{-1}]) =\n43.4^{+0.6}_{-1.1}$ to 90% confidence, almost 400 times the observed flux, and\nconsistent with various multi-wavelength diagnostics.

Starting with the historical Mount Wilson monitoring program,\nCaH&K lines have been widely used to trace stellar magnetic activity, and as a\nproxy for rotation period and consequently for stellar age. Monitoring stellar\nactivity has also become essential in filtering out false-positives due to\nmagnetic activity in extra-solar planet surveys. The Ca H&Kemission is\ntraditionally quantified through the R'HK-index, which compares the\nchromospheric flux in the doublet to the overall bolometric flux of the star.\nMuch work has been done to characterize this index for FGK-dwarfs, but M-dwarfs\nwere left out of these analyses and no calibration of their Ca ii H&K emission\nto an R'HK exists to date. We set out to characterize the magnetic activity of\nthe low and very low-mass stars by providing a calibration of the R'HK-index\nthat extends to the realm of M-dwarfs, and by evaluating the relation between\nR'HK and the rotation period. We calibrated the bolometric and photospheric\nfactors for M-dwarfs to properly transform the S-index into the R'HK. We\nmonitored magnetic activity through the Ca ii H&K emission lines in the HARPS\nM-dwarf sample. The R'HK index, like the fractional X-ray luminosity L_X/Lbol,\nshows a saturated correlation with rotation, with saturation setting in around\na ten days rotation period. Above that period, slower rotators show weaker Ca\nii activity, as expected. Under that period, the R'HK index saturates to\n~10^-4. Stellar mass modulates the Ca ii activity, with R'HK showing a constant\nbasal activity above 0.6Msun and then decreasing with mass between 0.6Msun and\nthe fully-convective limit of 0.35Msun. Short-term variability of the activity\ncorrelates with its mean level, stars with higher R'HK index show larger R'HK\nvariability, as previously observed for earlier spectral types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 20:39:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 14:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

Current mobility management solutions generally require a\ncentral entity in the network core, tracking IP address movement and anchoring\ntraffic from source to destination through point-to-point tunnels. Intuitively,\nthis approach suffers from scalability limitations as it creates bottlenecks in\nthe network, due to sub-optimal routing via the anchor point. Meanwhile,\nalternative anchorless, solutions are not feasible due to the current\nlimitations of the IP semantics, which strongly ties addressing information to\nlocation. In contrast, novel path-based forwarding solutions may be exploited\nfor feasible anchorless solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel\nnetwork-based mobility management solution that facilitates IP mobility over\nsuch a path-based forwarding substrate. Our solution exploits the advantages of\nsuch substrates in decoupling path calculation from data transfer to eliminate\nthe need for anchoring traffic through the network core; thereby, allowing\nflexible path calculation and service provisioning. Furthermore, by eliminating\nthe limitation of routing via the anchor point, our approach reduces the\nnetwork cost compared to anchored solution through bandwidth saving while\nmaintaining comparable handover delay. We evaluate our solution through\nanalytical and simulation models and compare it with the IETF standardized\nsolution, Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).

The inability of evaluating composition effort is due to three key\nproblems.

We propose robust, fast, and\ndistributed network localization algorithms, resilient to high-power noise, but\nalso precise under regular Gaussian noise. We use the Huber M-estimator as a\ndifference measure between the distance of estimated nodes and noisy range\nmeasurements, thus obtaining a robust (but nonconvex) optimization problem. We\nthen devise a convex underestimator solvable in polynomial time, and tight in\nthe inter-node terms. We also provide an optimality bound for the convex\nunderestimator. We put forward a new representation of the Huber function\ncomposed with a norm, enabling distributed robust localization algorithms to\nminimize the proposed underestimator. The synchronous distributed method has\noptimal convergence rate and the asynchronous one converges in finite time, for\na given precision. The main highlight of our contribution lies on the fact that\nwe pay no price for distributed computation nor in accuracy, nor in\ncommunication cost or convergence speed.

Such uncertainties are\ntypically addressed by using multiple, accurately chosen training signals to\nrecover the missing information on the sensing model, an approach that can be\nresource-consuming and cumbersome. Conversely, blind calibration does not\nemploy any training signal, but corresponds to a bilinear inverse problem whose\nalgorithmic solution is an open issue. We here address blind calibration as a\nnon-convex problem for linear random sensing models, in which we aim to recover\nan unknown signal from its projections on sub-Gaussian random vectors, each\nsubject to an unknown positive multiplicative factor (or gain). To solve this\noptimisation problem we resort to projected gradient descent starting from a\nsuitable, carefully chosen initialisation point. An analysis of this algorithm\nallows us to show that it converges to the exact solution provided a sample\ncomplexity requirement is met, i.e., relating convergence to the amount of\ninformation collected during the sensing process. Interestingly, we show that\nthis requirement grows linearly (up to log factors) in the number of unknowns\nof the problem. This sample complexity is found both in absence of prior\ninformation, as well as when subspace priors are available for both the signal\nand gains, allowing a further reduction of the number of observations required\nfor our recovery guarantees to hold. Moreover, in the presence of noise we show\nhow our descent algorithm yields a solution whose accuracy degrades gracefully\nwith the amount of noise affecting the measurements. Finally, we present some\nnumerical experiments in an imaging context, where our algorithm allows for a\nsimple solution to blind calibration of the gains in a sensor array.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 22:46:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2016 17:09:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 16:27:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 21:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

The method assumes that low-dimensional bases that accurately capture\nthe time evolution of the state are available. The method adopts the parareal\nframework for time parallelism, which is defined by an initialization method, a\ncoarse propagator, and a fine propagator. Rather than employing usual\napproaches for initialization and coarse propagation, we propose novel\ndata-driven techniques that leverage the available time-evolution bases. The\ncoarse propagator is defined by a forecast (proposed in Ref. [12]) applied\nlocally within each coarse time interval, which comprises the following steps:\n(1) apply the fine propagator for a small number of time steps, (2) approximate\nthe state over the entire coarse time interval using gappy POD with the local\ntime-evolution bases, and (3) select the approximation at the end of the time\ninterval as the propagated state. We also propose both local-forecast and\nglobal-forecast initialization. The method is particularly well suited for\nPOD-based reduced-order models (ROMs). In this case, spatial parallelism\nquickly saturates, as the ROM dynamical system is low dimensional; thus, time\nparallelism is needed to enable lower wall times. Further, the time-evolution\nbases can be extracted from the (readily available) right singular vectors\narising during POD computation.

Coded modulation over a\nbroadcast channel subject to a specific channel-input modulation constraint\nremains an important open problem. Some progress has been made in the related\narea of unequal-error protection modulations which can be considered\nsingle-user broadcast transmission, but it does not approach all points on the\nboundary of the capacity region. This paper studies broadcast coded modulation\nusing multilevel coding (MLC) subject to a specific channel input\nconstellation. The conditions under which multilevel codes can achieve the\nconstellation-constrained capacity of the AWGN broadcast channel are derived.\nFor any given constellation, we propose a pragmatic multilevel design technique\nwith near constellation-constrained-capacity performance where the coupling of\nthe superposition inner and outer codes are localized to each bit-level. It is\nshown that this can be further relaxed to a code coupling on only one bit\nlevel, with little or no penalty under natural labeling. The rate allocation\nproblem between the bit levels of the two users is studied and a pragmatic\nmethod is proposed, again with near-capacity performance. In further pursuit of\nlower complexity, a hybrid MLC-BICM is proposed, whose performance is shown to\nbe very close to the boundary of the constellation-constrained capacity region.\nSimulation results show that good point-to-point LDPC codes produce excellent\nperformance in the proposed coded modulation framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 01:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-31"}

The star is enhanced in refractory elements when\ncompared to the Sun, and the refractory enrichment is even stronger after\ncorrections for Galactic chemical evolution. We determined a NLTE Li abundance\nof 1.52 dex, which is four times higher than what would be expected for the age\nof HIP 68468. The older age is also supported by the low log(R'HK) (-5.05) and\nlow jitter. Engulfment of a rocky planet of 6 Earth masses can explain the\nenhancement in both lithium and the refractory elements. [Conclusions]. The\nsuper-Neptune planet candidate is too massive for in situ formation, and\ntherefore its current location is most likely the result of planet migration\nthat could also have driven other planets towards its host star, enhancing thus\nthe abundance of lithium and refractory elements in HIP 68468. The intriguing\nevidence of planet accretion warrants further observations to verify the\nexistence of the planets that are indicated by our data and to better constrain\nthe nature of the planetary system around this unique star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 03:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

Using Keldysh formalism, we calculate, nonpertubatively in the\nsystem-bath coupling, the steady-state properties of the system and obtain\nnon-equilibrium distribution function.

While usage of this portal is high, we know very little\nabout how exactly users search and explore ontologies and what kind of usage\npatterns or user groups exist in the first place. Deeper insights into user\nbehavior on such portals can provide valuable information to devise strategies\nfor a better support of users in exploring and finding existing ontologies, and\nthereby enable better ontology reuse. To that end, we study and group users\naccording to their browsing behavior on BioPortal using data mining techniques.\nAdditionally, we use the obtained groups to characterize and compare\nexploration strategies across ontologies. In particular, we were able to\nidentify seven distinct browsing-behavior types, which all make use of\ndifferent functionality provided by BioPortal. For example, Search Explorers\nmake extensive use of the search functionality while Ontology Tree Explorers\nmainly rely on the class hierarchy to explore ontologies. Further, we show that\nspecific characteristics of ontologies influence the way users explore and\ninteract with the website. Our results may guide the development of more\nuser-oriented systems for ontology exploration on the Web.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 10:33:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 20:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

A close inspection of the EUV shows that still no good fit to the\nobserved shape of the stellar continuum flux can be achieved although He, C, N,\nO, Al, Si, P, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cr, Ni Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Kr, Zr, Mo,\nSn, Xe, and Ba are included in the stellar atmosphere models. There are two\npossible reasons for the deviation between observed and synthetic flux in the\nEUV. Opacities from hitherto unconsidered elements in the model-atmosphere\ncalculation may be missing and/or the effective temperature is slightly lower\nthan previously determined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 11:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

There have been\nmany proposals for dealing with reversible behavior, usually involving\ninserting it somehow into the irreversible FORC distribution. Here we will try\nto do the opposite, to separate them into another function which we will call\nthe (reversible) \"saturation field distribution\", which is identically zero for\na completely irreversible system of hysterons, while the irreversible FORC\ndistribution is identically zero for a reversible system. Thus in a system with\nboth purely reversible and purely irreversible components, such as\nsingle-domain Stoner-Wohlfarth particles with hard or easy axis along the\nfield, this approach cleanly separates them.

The hardness\nresult is due to the presence of the matching constraints given that the\nsimpler multi-unit case can be approximated up to a constant factor of $2$. The\ngoal of this paper is to circumvent the hardness result by restricting\nourselves to specific settings of valuations and budgets. Two particularly\nsignificant scenarios are: each buyer has a budget that is greater than her\nsingle-value valuation, and each buyer has a budget that is lower than her\nsingle-value valuation. Surprisingly, in both scenarios we are able to achieve\na $1/4$-approximation to the optimal envy-free revenue. The algorithms utilize\na novel version of the Ausebel ascending price auction. These results may\nsuggest that, although it is difficult to approximate the optimal revenue in\ngeneral, ascending price auctions could achieve relatively good revenue in most\nof the practical settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 14:01:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-31"}

We find an\nexcellent agreement between the observations and model predictions of the\ndominant cooling timescales and the onset of catastrophic cooling.

Cluster randomized trials (CRT)\ncapture both direct and indirect intervention effects; the latter depends\nheavily on contact networks within and across clusters. We propose a novel\nclass of connectivity-informed trial designs that leverages information about\nsuch networks in order to improve public health impact and preserve ability to\ndetect intervention effects.\n  Methods: We consider CRTs in which the order of enrollment is based on the\ntotal number of ties between individuals across clusters (based either on the\ntotal number of inter-cluster connections or on connections only to untreated\nclusters). We include options analogous both to traditional Parallel and\nStepped Wedge designs. We also allow for control clusters to be \"held-back\"\nfrom re-randomization for some period. We investigate the performance epidemic\ncontrol and power to detect vaccine effect performance of these designs by\nsimulating vaccination trials during an SEIR-type epidemic using a\nnetwork-structured agent-based model.\n  Results: In our simulations, connectivity-informed designs have lower peak\ninfectiousness than comparable traditional designs and reduce cumulative\nincidence by 20%, but with little impact on time to end of epidemic and reduced\npower to detect differences in incidence across clusters. However even a brief\n\"holdback\" period restores most of the power lost compared to traditional\napproaches.\n  Conclusion: Incorporating information about cluster connectivity in design of\nCRTs can increase their public health impact, especially in acute outbreak\nsettings, with modest cost in power to detect an effective intervention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 08:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

Despite much progress, little attention has\nbeen paid to spatially embedded networks, where the underlying geographic\ndistance, rather than the graph distance, is an important and relevant aspect\nof the partner rewiring process. It thus remains largely unclear how individual\npartner rewiring range preference, local vs. global, emerges and affects\ncooperation. Here we explicitly address this issue using a coevolutionary model\nof cooperation and partner rewiring range preference in spatially embedded\nsocial networks. In contrast to local rewiring, global rewiring has no distance\nrestriction but incurs a one-time cost upon establishing any long range link.\nWe find that under a wide range of model parameters, global partner switching\npreference can coevolve with cooperation. Moreover, the resulting partner\nnetwork is highly degree-heterogeneous with small average shortest path length\nwhile maintaining high clustering, thereby possessing small-world properties.\nWe also discover an optimum availability of reputation information for the\nemergence of global cooperators, who form distant partnerships at a cost to\nthemselves.

The distance between the DPRK and LocSAT aftershock epicenters is\n25.5 km, i.e. by an order of magnitude larger than that obtained by the WCC\nrelative location method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 06:58:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-10"}

Many\nof them involve a central server, or a collection of servers, that either store\nthe files, or act as a gateway for them to be shared.
