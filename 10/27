Existing\nworks considered improving the task accuracy through voting or learning\nmethods, they usually did not fully take into account reducing the latency of\nthe task completion. When a task requester posts a group of tasks (e.g.,\nsentiment analysis), and one can only obtain answers of all tasks after the\nlast task is accomplished. As a consequence, the time delay of even one task in\nthis group could delay the next step of the task requester's work from minutes\nto days, which is quite undesirable for the task requester.\n  Inspired by the importance of the task accuracy and latency, in this paper,\nwe will propose a novel crowdsourcing framework, namely Fast and Reliable\ncrOwdsourcinG framework (FROG), which intelligently assigns tasks to workers,\nsuch that the latencies of tasks are reduced and the expected accuracies of\ntasks are met. Specifically, our FROG framework consists of two important\ncomponents, task scheduler and notification modules. For the task scheduler\nmodule, we formalize a FROG task scheduling (FROG-TS) problem, in which the\nserver actively assigns workers with tasks with high reliability and low\nlatency. We prove that the FROG-TS problem is NP-hard. Thus, we design two\nheuristic approaches, request-based and batch-based scheduling. For the\nnotification module, we define an efficient worker notifying (EWN) problem,\nwhich only sends task invitations to those workers with high probabilities of\naccepting the tasks. To tackle the EWN problem, we propose a smooth kernel\ndensity estimation approach to estimate the probability that a worker accepts\nthe task invitation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of our proposed FROG platform on both real and\nsynthetic data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 16:44:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 2018 13:32:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-26"}

This experimental data\nwere also used to create a synthetic microstructure within a finite element\nmodel. The development of intragranular stresses were then simulated during\ntensile loading of the model using anisotropic elasticity. Driving forces for\nphase transformation and slip were calculated from these stresses. The\ngrain-average responses of individual austenite crystals examined before and\nafter multiple stress-induced transformation events showed that grains at the\nspecimen interior carry more stress and plastically deform less than the\nsurface grains as the superelastic response shakes down. Examination of the\nheterogeneity within individual grains showed that regions near grain\nboundaries exhibit larger stress variation compared to the grain interiors.\nThis intragranular heterogeneity is more strongly driven by the constraints of\nneighboring grains than the initial stress state and orientation of the\nindividual grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 17:10:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2016 23:16:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2017 16:18:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-20"}

Static typing provides error\ndetection and strong guarantees while dynamic typing enables rapid prototyping\nand flexible programming idioms.

In eye synthesis, in order to generate accurate eye\nmovements and dynamic wrinkle variations around eye regions, we propose another\nnovel algorithm to colorize the NIR eye images and further remove the \"red eye\"\neffects caused by the colorization. Results show that both hardware setup and\nsystem framework are robust to synthesize realistic face images in video\nsequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 19:41:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 05:44:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-28"}

The observations of the\nsource at the first node are to be losslessly replicated with a given\nprobability of outage at the second node, which receives data from the first\nnode over a constant-rate errorless channel. We develop a system and associated\nstrategies for joint distributed source coding (encoding and decoding) and\ntransmission control in order to achieve low end-to-end delay. Slepian-Wolf\ncoding in its traditional form cannot be applied in our scenario, since the\nencoder requires the joint statistics of the observations and the associated\ndecoding delay is very high. We analytically evaluate the performance of our\nstrategies and show that the delay achieved by them are order optimal, as the\nconditional entropy of the source approaches to the channel rate. We also\nevaluate the performance of our algorithms based on real-world experiments\nusing two cameras recording videos of a scene at different angles. Having\nrealized our schemes, we demonstrated that, even with a very low-complexity\nquantizer, a compression ratio of approximately 50% is achievable for lossless\nreplication at the decoder, at an average delay of a few seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 19:42:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-27"}

In this paper, we perform inviscid\nthree-dimensional global hydrodynamic simulations to examine the growth and\nconsequence of this instability operating on the spiral waves driven by a\nJupiter-mass planet in a protoplanetary disk. We find that the spiral waves are\ndestabilized via the spiral wave instability (SWI), generating hydrodynamic\nturbulence and sustained radially-alternating vertical flows that appear to be\nassociated with long wavelength inertial modes. In the interval $0.3~R_p \\leq R\n\\leq 0.7~R_p$, where $R_p$ denotes the semi-major axis of the planetary orbit\n(assumed to be 5~au), the estimated vertical diffusion rate associated with the\nturbulence is characterized by $\\alpha_{\\rm diff} \\sim (0.2-1.2) \\times\n10^{-2}$. For the disk model considered here, the diffusion rate is such that\nparticles with sizes up to several centimeters are vertically mixed within the\nfirst pressure scale height.

A powerful way to test the co-evolution scenario and learn\nabout the feedback processes linking galaxies and nuclear activity is to\nmeasure these correlations as a function of redshift. Unfortunately, currently\nMBH can only be estimated in active galaxies at cosmological distances. At\nthese distances, bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) can outshine the host\ngalaxy, making it extremely difficult to measure the host's luminosity.\nStrongly lensed AGNs provide in principle a great opportunity to improve the\nsensitivity and accuracy of the host galaxy luminosity measurements as the host\ngalaxy is magnified and more easily separated from the point source, provided\nthe lens model is sufficiently accurate. In order to measure the MBH-L\ncorrelation with strong lensing, it is necessary to ensure that the lens\nmodelling is accurate, and that the host galaxy luminosity can be recovered to\nat least a precision and accuracy better than that of the typical MBH\nmeasurement. We carry out extensive and realistic simulations of deep Hubble\nSpace Telescope observations of lensed AGNs obtained by our collaboration. We\nshow that the host galaxy luminosity can be recovered with better accuracy and\nprecision than the typical uncertainty on MBH(~ 0.5 dex) for hosts as faint as\n2-4 magnitudes dimmer than the AGN itself.

Although pulsation spectra are well understood for\nsolar-like oscillators, a substantial fraction of red giant stars observed by\nKepler exhibit abnormally low-amplitude dipole oscillation modes. Fuller et al.\n(2015) suggests this effect is produced by strong core magnetic fields that\nscatter dipole internal gravity waves (IGWs) into higher multipole IGWs or\nmagnetic waves. In this paper, we study the interaction of IGWs with a magnetic\nfield to test this mechanism. We consider two background stellar structures:\none with a uniform magnetic field, and another with a magnetic field that\nvaries both horizontally and vertically. We derive analytic solutions to the\nwave propagation problem and validate them with numerical simulations. In both\ncases, we find perfect conversion from IGWs into magnetic waves when the IGWs\npropagate into a region exceeding a critical magnetic field strength. Downward\npropagating IGWs cannot reflect into upward propagating IGWs because their\nvertical wavenumber never approaches zero. Instead, they are converted into\nupward propagating slow (Alfvenic) waves, and we show they will likely\ndissipate as they propagate back into weakly magnetized regions. Therefore,\nstrong internal magnetic fields can produce dipole mode suppression in red\ngiants, and gravity modes will likely be totally absent from the pulsation\nspectra of sufficiently magnetized stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2016 19:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

Two protostars near the\ncenter of the disk are separated by 61 AU, and a tertiary protostar is\ncoincident with a spiral arm in the outer disk at a 183 AU separation. The\ninferred mass of the central pair of protostellar objects is $\\sim$1 M$_{sun}$,\nwhile the disk surrounding the three protostars has a total mass of $\\sim$0.30\nM$_{\\sun}$. The tertiary protostar itself has a minimum mass of $\\sim$0.085\nM$_{sun}$. We demonstrate that the disk around L1448 IRS3B appears susceptible\nto disk fragmentation at radii between 150~AU and 320~AU, overlapping with the\nlocation of the tertiary protostar. This is consistent with models for a\nprotostellar disk that has recently undergone gravitational instability,\nspawning one or two companion stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-28"}

If it harbours a strong magnetic field of magnetar strength, its\nspin-down could explain several features of short gamma-ray burst afterglows.\nThe magnetorotational instability (MRI) has been proposed as a mechanism to\namplify the magnetic field to the required strength. Previous studies have,\nhowever, neglected neutrinos, which may have an important impact on the MRI by\ninducing a viscosity and drag. We investigate the impact of these neutrino\neffects on the linear growth of the MRI by applying a local stability analysis\nto snapshots of a neutron star merger simulation.

The limitation is that, as\nPEM suffers in general from non-convexity, estimating an unnecessarily large\nnumber of parameters will increase the chances of getting trapped in local\nminima. To avoid this, a high order ARX model can first be estimated by least\nsquares, providing non-parametric estimates of the plant and noise model.

By examining pre-jet\nevolutionary changes in the line-of-sight photospheric magnetic field we\nobserve that each pre-jet minifilament resides over the neutral line between\nmajority-polarity and minority-polarity patches of magnetic flux. In each of\nthe ten cases, the opposite-polarity patches approach and merge with each other\n(flux reduction between 21 and 57%). After several hours, continuous flux\ncancellation at the neutral line apparently destabilizes the field holding the\ncool-plasma minifilament to erupt and undergo internal reconnection, and\nexternal reconnection with the surrounding-coronal field. The external\nreconnection opens the minifilament field allowing the minifilament material to\nescape outwards, forming part of the jet spire. Thus we found that each of the\nten jets resulted from eruption of a minifilament following flux cancellation\nat the neutral line under the minifilament. These observations establish that\nmagnetic flux cancellation is usually the trigger of quiet region coronal jet\neruptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 20:35:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

We utilize regularity properties of the risk\ntolerance function to numerically compute the estimates for our approximations.\nIn order to achieve similar value functions, we illustrate that, compared to a\nconstant volatility model, the investor must deploy a quite different portfolio\nstrategy which depends on the current level of volatility in the stochastic\nvolatility model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 21:58:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-28"}

We consider the setting in which an\ninstitution, called a ranker, evaluates a set of individuals based on\ndemographic, behavioral or other characteristics.

While automatic and\ntherefore seemingly objective, rankers can, and often do, discriminate against\nindividuals and systematically disadvantage members of protected groups. This\nwarrants a careful study of the fairness of a ranking scheme.\n  In this paper we propose fairness measures for ranked outputs. We develop a\ndata generation procedure that allows us to systematically control the degree\nof unfairness in the output, and study the behavior of our measures on these\ndatasets. We then apply our proposed measures to several real datasets, and\ndemonstrate cases of unfairness.

In\nchronic psychotic patients, the representation of verbal reports as word graphs\nprovides automated sorting of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and control\ngroups based on the degree of speech connectedness. Here we aim to use machine\nlearning to verify whether speech connectedness during first clinical contact\ncan predict negative symptoms and Schizophrenia diagnosis six months later.\nMethods: PANSS scores and memory reports were collected from 21 patients\nundergoing first clinical contact for recent-onset psychosis and followed for 6\nmonths to establish DSM-IV diagnosis, and 21 healthy controls. Each report was\nrepresented as a graph in which words corresponded to nodes, and node temporal\nsuccession corresponded to edges. Three connectedness attributes were extracted\nfrom each graph, z-scores to random graph distributions were measured,\ncorrelated with the PANSS negative subscale, combined into a single\nFragmentation Index, and used for predictions. Findings: Random-like speech was\nprevalent among Schizophrenia patients (64% x 5% in Control group, p=0.0002).\nConnectedness explained 92% of the PANSS negative subscale variance (p=0.0001).\nThe Fragmentation Index classified low versus high scores of PANSS negative\nsubscale with 93% accuracy (AUC=1), predicted Schizophrenia diagnosis with 89%\naccuracy (AUC=0.89), and was validated in an independent cohort of chronic\npsychotic patients.

Moreover, existing\nmethods and commonly used substitutes - which include instrumental variable\n(IV), intent-to-treat (ITT), and scaled ATE power analyses - require specifying\ngenerally unknown variance terms and/or rely upon strong and unrealistic\nassumptions, thus providing unreliable guidance on the power of tests of the\nLATE. This study develops a new approach that uses standardized effect sizes to\nplace bounds on the power for the most commonly used estimator of the LATE, the\nWald IV estimator, whereby variance terms and distributional parameters need\nnot be specified nor assumed. Instead, in addition to the effect size, sample\nsize, and error tolerance parameters, the only other parameter that must be\nspecified by the researcher is the compliance rate.

This\nstudy aims at improving both accuracy and efficiency of iterative algorithms\nfor DVF inversion, and advancing our understanding of divergence and latency\nconditions. Method: We introduce a framework of fixed-point iteration\nalgorithms with active feedback control for DVF inversion. Based on rigorous\nconvergence analysis, we design control mechanisms for modulating the inverse\nconsistency (IC) residual of the current iterate, to be used as feedback into\nthe next iterate. The control is designed adaptively to the input DVF with the\nobjective to enlarge the convergence area and expedite convergence. Three\nparticular settings of feedback control are introduced: constant value over the\ndomain throughout the iteration; alternating values between iteration steps;\nand spatially variant values. We also introduce three spectral measures of the\ndisplacement Jacobian for characterizing a DVF. These measures reveal the\ncritical role of what we term the non-translational displacement component\n(NTDC) of the DVF. We carry out inversion experiments with an analytical DVF\npair, and with DVFs associated with thoracic CT images of 6 patients at end of\nexpiration and end of inspiration. Results: NTDC-adaptive iterations are shown\nto attain a larger convergence region at a faster pace compared to previous\nnon-adaptive DVF inversion iteration algorithms. By our numerical experiments,\nalternating control yields smaller IC residuals and inversion errors than\nconstant control. Spatially variant control renders smaller residuals and\nerrors by at least an order of magnitude, compared to other schemes, in no more\nthan 10 steps. Inversion results also show remarkable quantitative agreement\nwith analysis-based predictions. Conclusion: Our analysis captures properties\nof DVF data associated with clinical CT images, and provides new understanding\nof iterative DVF inversion algorithms with a simple residual feedback control.\nAdaptive control is necessary and highly effective in the presence of non-small\nNTDCs. The adaptive iterations or the spectral measures, or both, may\npotentially be incorporated into deformable image registration methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 01:32:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2017 01:01:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 15:42:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2018 23:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-03"}

Similar to\nthe gap magnitude reported from specific heat measurements, the superconducting\ncondensate density is nearly constant in the optimally- and slightly overdoped\nregion, but exhibits a rather pronounced decrease on the underdoped side.\nSeveral of these observations are similar to the phenomenology in the electron\ndoped counterpart Ba(Fe$ _{1-y} $Co$ _{y} $)$ _{2} $As$ _{2} $.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 02:48:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

Based on virial analysis and\nhigher values of self-gravitating pressure, the clumps are found unstable\nagainst gravitational collapse. We find 474 young stellar objects (YSOs) in the\nselected region and $\\sim$72\\% of these YSOs are found in the clusters\ndistributed mainly toward the clumps in the EFS. These YSOs might have\nspontaneously formed due to processes not related to the expanding H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregion. At the edges of BN, four additional clumps are also associated with\nYSOs clusters, which appear to be influenced by the expanding H\\,{\\sc ii}\nregion. The most massive clump in the EFS contains two compact radio sources\ntraced in the GMRT 1.28 GHz map and a massive protostar candidate, IRS~1 prior\nto an ultracompact H\\,{\\sc ii} phase. Using the VLT/NACO near-infrared images,\nIRS~1 is resolved with a jet-like feature within a 4200~AU scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 04:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

Such mechanism, which we call active memory,\nimproved over attention in algorithmic tasks, image processing, and in\ngenerative modelling.\n  So far, however, active memory has not improved over attention for most\nnatural language processing tasks, in particular for machine translation.

A variety of methods have been\nproposed to boost its efficacy, with some recent ones resorting to nonlinear\nkernel technique. Noting that the essence of this feature representation is to\ncharacterise the underlying structure of visual features, this paper argues\nthat an equally, if not more, important approach to boosting its efficacy shall\nbe to improve the quality of this characterisation. Following this idea, we\npropose to exploit the structure sparsity of visual features in skeletal human\naction recognition, and compute sparse inverse covariance estimate (SICE) as\nfeature representation. We discuss the advantage of this new representation on\ndealing with small sample, high dimensionality, and modelling capability.\nFurthermore, utilising the monotonicity property of SICE, we efficiently\ngenerate a hierarchy of SICE matrices to characterise the structure of visual\nfeatures at different sparsity levels, and two discriminative learning\nalgorithms are then developed to adaptively integrate them to perform\nrecognition. As demonstrated by extensive experiments, the proposed\nrepresentation leads to significantly improved recognition performance over the\nstate-of-the-art comparable methods. In particular, as a method fully based on\nlinear technique, it is comparable or even better than those employing\nnonlinear kernel technique.

Their radiative properties\nfollow some general scaling laws which primarily depend on their masses and\naccretion rates. However, it has been suggested that the black hole spin can\nalso strongly influence the power and radio flux of these. Here, we attempt to\nestimate the dependency of the radio luminosity of steady jets launched by\naccretion disks on black hole mass, accretion rate and spin using numerical\nsimulations. We make use of 3D GRMHD simulations of accretion disks around\nlow-luminosity black holes in which the jet radio emission is produced by the\njet sheath. We find that the radio flux increases roughly by a factor of 6 as\nthe back hole spin increases from a~0 to a=0.98. This is comparable to the\nincrease in accretion power with spin, meaning that the ratio between radio jet\nand accretion power is hardly changing. Although our jet spine power scales as\nexpected for the Blandford-Znajek process, the dependency of jet radio\nluminosity on the black hole spin is somewhat weaker. Also weakly rotating\nblack holes can produce visible radio jets. The overall scaling of the radio\nemission with black hole mass and accretion rate is consistent with the\nscale-invariant analytical models used to explain the fundamental plane of\nblack hole activity. Spin does not introduce a significant scatter in this\nmodel. The jet-sheath model can describe well resolved accreting systems, such\nas SgrA* and M87, as well as the general scaling behavior of low-luminosity\nblack holes. Hence the model should be applicable to a wide range of radio jets\nin sub-Eddington black holes. The black hole spin has an effect on the\nproduction of visible radio jet, but it may not be the main driver to produce\nvisible radio jets. An extension of our findings to powerful quasars remains\nspeculative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 08:15:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

Investigations of Lee-Yang zeros ---\ncomplex singularities of the free energy in systems of finite size --- have led\nto a unified understanding of equilibrium phase transitions. The ideas of Lee\nand Yang, however, are not restricted to equilibrium phenomena. Recently,\nLee-Yang zeros have been used to characterize non-equilibrium processes such as\ndynamical phase transitions in quantum systems after a quench or dynamic\norder-disorder transitions in glasses. Here, we experimentally realize a scheme\nfor determining Lee-Yang zeros in such non-equilibrium settings. We extract the\ndynamical Lee-Yang zeros of a stochastic process involving Andreev tunneling\nbetween a normal-state island and two superconducting leads from measurements\nof the dynamical activity along a trajectory. From the short-time behavior of\nthe Lee-Yang zeros, we predict the large-deviation statistics of the activity\nwhich is typically difficult to measure.

This is not from a lack of effort, but instead by\nvirtue of the fact that the foundation that many programming languages are\nbuilt on is not sufficient for the level of expressivity required for parallel\nwork. The result is an implicit trade-off between programmability and\nperformance which is made worse due to the fact that, whilst many scientific\nusers are experts within their own fields, they are not HPC experts.\n  Type oriented programming looks to address this by encoding the complexity of\na language via the type system. Most of the language functionality is contained\nwithin a loosely coupled type library that can be flexibly used to control many\naspects such as parallelism. Due to the high level nature of this approach\nthere is much information available during compilation which can be used for\noptimisation and, in the absence of type information, the compiler can apply\nsensible default options thus supporting both the expert programmer and novice\nalike.\n  We demonstrate that, at no performance or scalability penalty when running on\nup to 8196 cores of a Cray XE6 system, codes written in this type oriented\nmanner provide improved programmability. The programmer is able to write\nsimple, implicit parallel, HPC code at a high level and then explicitly tune by\nadding additional type information if required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 10:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-31"}

The number of current\ndetections used for statistical purposes is still quite modest and different\nsurveys, using both photometry and precise radial velocities, are searching for\nplanets around M dwarfs. Our HARPS-N red dwarf exoplanet survey is aimed at the\ndetection of new planets around a sample of 78 selected stars, together with\nthe subsequent characterization of their activity properties. Here we\ninvestigate the survey performance and strategy. From 2700 observed spectra, we\ncompare the radial velocity determinations of the HARPS-N DRS pipeline and the\nHARPS-TERRA code, we calculate the mean activity jitter level, we evaluate the\nplanet detection expectations, and we address the general question of how to\ndefine the strategy of spectroscopic surveys in order to be most efficient in\nthe detection of planets.

At the classical level\ncosmological and black hole singularities are examples of problems which let us\nnotice that GR is incomplete at short distances (high energy). Furthermore, at\nthe quantum level GR is not ultraviolet (UV) complete, namely it is not\nperturbatively renormalizable. Most of the work try to solve these problems\nmodifying GR by considering finite higher order derivative terms. Fourth\nDerivative Gravity, for example, turns out to be renormalizable, but at the\nsame time it introduces ghost. To avoid both UV divergence and presence of\nghost one could consider sets of infinite higher derivative terms that can be\nexpressed in the form of entire functions satisfying the special property do\nnot introduce new poles other than GR graviton one. By making a special choice\nfor these entire functions, one could show that such a theory describes a\ngravity that, at least in the linear regime, can avoid both the presence of\nghost and classical singularities (both black hole and cosmological\nsingularities).

Extending previous work, we show that these quantities are described\nby a set of second-order perturbation equations featuring cross-terms scaling\nwith the product of the magnetic and centrifugal distortions to the star. For\nthe case of a background toroidal field, we reduce these to a set of\ndifferential equations in radial functions, and find a method for their\nsolution. The resulting magnetic-field and velocity perturbations show complex\nmultipolar structure and are strongest towards the centre of the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 12:23:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2017 14:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-23"}

Traditionally, systems of\nentity relation extraction have relied on human-annotated corpora for training\nand adopted an incremental pipeline. Such systems require additional human\nexpertise to be ported to a new domain, and are vulnerable to errors cascading\ndown the pipeline. In this paper, we investigate joint extraction of typed\nentities and relations with labeled data heuristically obtained from knowledge\nbases (i.e., distant supervision). As our algorithm for type labeling via\ndistant supervision is context-agnostic, noisy training data poses unique\nchallenges for the task. We propose a novel domain-independent framework,\ncalled CoType, that runs a data-driven text segmentation algorithm to extract\nentity mentions, and jointly embeds entity mentions, relation mentions, text\nfeatures and type labels into two low-dimensional spaces (for entity and\nrelation mentions respectively), where, in each space, objects whose types are\nclose will also have similar representations. CoType, then using these learned\nembeddings, estimates the types of test (unlinkable) mentions.

This provided compelling, although indirect, evidence\nfor GWs carrying away energy--as predicted by the quadrupole formula. On the\ndirect detection experimental side, Weber started more than 50 years ago. In\n1966, his bar for GW detection reached a strain sensitivity of a few times\n10^-16. His announcement of coincident signals (now considered spurious)\nstimulated many experimental efforts from room temperature resonant masses to\ncryogenic detectors and laser-interferometers. Now there are km-sized\ninterferometric detectors (LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, Virgo and KAGRA).\nAdvanced LIGO first reached a strain sensitivity of the order of 10^-22.

Besides earth-based GW detectors, the\ndrag-free sensitivity of the LISA Pathfinder has already reached to the LISA\ngoal level, paving the road for space GW detectors.

We examined a sample of 500 cluster\nmembers whose photometric variations were monitored in the optical for 38\nconsecutive days with CoRoT. Light curves were analyzed for periodicity using\nthe Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the autocorrelation function and the\nstring-length method. The period distribution obtained for the cluster consists\nof a smooth distribution centered around P=5.2 d with two peaks at P=1-2 d and\n3-4 d. A separate analysis of CTTS and WTTS indicates that the P=1-2 d peak is\nassociated with the latter, while both groups contribute to the P=3-4 d peak.\nThe comparison between CTTS and WTTS supports the idea of a rotation-accretion\nconnection: their respective rotational properties are statistically different,\nand CTTS rotate on average more slowly than WTTS. We also observe a clear\ndearth of fast rotators with strong accretion signatures (large UV flux\nexcess). This is consistent with earlier findings that fast rotators in young\nstar clusters are typically devoid of dusty disks. Our sample shows some\nevidence of a mass dependence in the rotation properties of NGC 2264 members,\nlower-mass stars spinning on average faster.

However, the former comprises simpler, more\nlocalized motion, and thus has perhaps a more straightforward connection to\nstructure. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on a\ntwo-dimensional, rigid diatomic molecule (the simplest structure exhibiting a\ndistinct beta process) to assess the role of the local liquid structure on both\nthe Johari-Goldstein beta and the alpha relaxation. Although the average\nproperties for these two relaxations are correlated, there is no connection\nbetween the beta and alpha properties of a given (single) molecule. The\npropensity for motion at long times is independent of the rate or strength of a\nmolecule's beta relaxation.

This is\nachieved by coupling the SM to a monodromy axion field through Minkowski\n3-forms. The Higgs mass scans with steps given by delta(m_H^2)= eta mu f, where\nmu and f are the axion mass and periodicity respectively, and eta measures the\ncoupling of the Higgs to the associated 3-form. The observed Higgs mass scale\ncould then be selected on anthropic grounds. The monodromy axion may have a\nmass mu in a very wide range depending on the value of eta, and the axion\nperiodity f. For eta=1 and f = 10^10 GeV, one has 10^{-3}eV < mu < 10^3 eV, but\nultralight axions with e.g. mu = 10^{-17} eV are also possible. In a different\nrealization we consider landscape models coupled to the MSSM. In the context of\nSUSY, 4-forms appear as being part of the auxiliary fields of SUSY multiplets.\nThe scanning in the 4-forms thus translate into a landscape of vevs for the N=1\nauxiliary fields and hence as a landscape for the soft terms. This could\nprovide a rationale for the MSSM fine-tuning suggested by LHC data. In all\nthese models there are 3-forms coupling to membranes which induce transitions\nbetween different vacua through bubble nucleation. The Weak Gravity Conjecture\n(WGC) set limits on the tension of these membranes and implies new physics\nthresholds well below the Planck scale. More generaly, we argue that in the\ncase of string SUSY vacua in which the Goldstino multiplet contains a monodromy\naxion the WGC suggests a lower bound on the SUSY breaking scale m_{3/2} >\nM_s^2/M_p.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 15:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

Go can only detect global deadlocks at runtime, but provides no\ncompile-time protection against all too common communication mismatches or\npartial deadlocks. This work develops a static verification framework for\nliveness and safety in Go programs, able to detect communication errors and\npartial deadlocks in a general class of realistic concurrent programs,\nincluding those with dynamic channel creation, unbounded thread creation and\nrecursion. Our approach infers from a Go program a faithful representation of\nits communication patterns as a behavioural type. By checking a syntactic\nrestriction on channel usage, dubbed fencing, we ensure that programs are made\nup of finitely many different communication patterns that may be repeated\ninfinitely many times. This restriction allows us to implement procedures to\ncheck for liveness and safety in types which in turn approximates liveness and\nsafety in Go programs.

Low-rank data representation\n(achieved by finding the k-dominant singular values of a Casorati Matrix\narranged from the data sequence) speeds up the global solution and achieves\nnoise reduction. On the other hand, topology preservation (achieved by\nmonitoring the Jacobian determinant) allows to radically rule out distortions\nwhile carefully controlling the size of allowed expansions and contractions.\nOur variational approach is carried out on a realistic dataset as well as on a\nsimulated one. We demonstrate how our proposed variational solution deals with\ncomplex deformations through careful numerical experiments. While maintaining\nthe accuracy of the solution, the low-rank preprocessing is shown to speed up\nthe convergence of the variational problem.
