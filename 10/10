When\nthe desired structure is composed of modules or \"communities\", a suitable\nchoice for this task is the stochastic block model (SBM), where nodes are\ndivided into groups, and the placement of edges is conditioned on the group\nmemberships. Here, we present a nonparametric Bayesian method to infer the\nmodular structure of empirical networks, including the number of modules and\ntheir hierarchical organization. We focus on a microcanonical variant of the\nSBM, where the structure is imposed via hard constraints, i.e. the generated\nnetworks are not allowed to violate the patterns imposed by the model. We show\nhow this simple model variation allows simultaneously for two important\nimprovements over more traditional inference approaches: 1. Deeper Bayesian\nhierarchies, with noninformative priors replaced by sequences of priors and\nhyperpriors, that not only remove limitations that seriously degrade the\ninference on large networks, but also reveal structures at multiple scales; 2.\nA very efficient inference algorithm that scales well not only for networks\nwith a large number of nodes and edges, but also with an unlimited number of\nmodules. We show also how this approach can be used to sample modular\nhierarchies from the posterior distribution, as well as to perform model\nselection. We discuss and analyze the differences between sampling from the\nposterior and simply finding the single parameter estimate that maximizes it.\nFurthermore, we expose a direct equivalence between our microcanonical approach\nand alternative derivations based on the canonical SBM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2016 18:07:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 09:44:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2018 04:23:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2018 16:53:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-23"}

The evolution of such counterrotating galaxies remains far\nfrom being well understood. In this paper we study the dynamics of\ncounterrotating collisionless stellar disks by means of $N$-body simulations.\nWe show that, in the presence of counterrotation, an otherwise gravitationally\nstable disk can naturally generate bending waves accompanied by strong disk\nheating across the disk plane, that is in the vertical direction. Such\nconclusion is found to hold even for dynamically warm systems with typical\nvalues of the initial vertical-to-radial velocity dispersion ratio $\\sigma_{\\rm\nz}/\\sigma_{\\rm R} \\approx 0.5$, for which the role of pressure anisotropy\nshould be unimportant. We note that, during evolution, the $\\sigma_{\\rm\nz}/\\sigma_{\\rm R}$ ratio tends to rise up to values close to unity in the case\nof locally Jeans-stable disks, whereas in disks that are initially\nJeans-unstable it may reach even higher values, especially in the innermost\nregions. This unusual behavior of the $\\sigma_{\\rm z}/\\sigma_{\\rm R}$ ratio in\ngalaxies with counterrotation appears not to have been noticed earlier. Our\ninvestigations of systems made of two counterrotating components with different\nmass-ratios suggest that even apparently normal disk galaxies (i.e., with a\nminor counterrotating component so as to escape detection in current\nobservations) might be subject to significant disk heating especially in the\nvertical direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2016 18:23:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 10:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

To handle these situations, we devise a\nPartially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) formulation of the problem\nand illustrate properties of its solution. We further model the system under\ngiven decision rules, using Quasi-Birth-and-Death (QBD) structure to find a\nmatrix analytic expression for the stability bound. We use this formulation to\nillustrate how the stability region grows as the number of controller belief\nstates increases.\n  Our focus in this paper is on the simple case of two servers where the\nenvironment of each is modulated according to a two-state Markov chain. As\nsimple as this case seems, there appear to be no closed form descriptions of\nthe stability region under the various regimes considered. Our numerical\napproximations to the POMDP Bellman equations and the numerical solutions of\nthe QBDs hint at a variety of structural results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2016 06:39:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-11"}

Currently, WMTI is\nmostly used in dedicated animal studies and clinical studies of slowly\nprogressing diseases but has not yet emerged as a routine clinical tool. To\nthis end, a less data intensive experimental method would be beneficial by\nenabling high resolution validation studies, and ease clinical applications by\nspeeding up data acquisition compared to typical diffusion kurtosis imaging\n(DKI) protocols utilized as part of WMTI imaging. Here, we evaluate WMTI based\non recently introduced axially symmetric DKI which has lower data demand than\nconventional DKI. We compare WMTI parameters derived from conventional DKI to\nthose calculated analytically from axially symmetric DKI. We employ numerical\nsimulations, as well as data from fixed rat spinal cord (1) and in vivo human\n(3) and rat brain (4). Our analysis shows that analytical WMTI based on axially\nsymmetric DKI with sparse data sets (19 images) produces WMTI metrics that\ncorrelate strongly with estimates based on traditional DKI data sets (60 images\nor more). We demonstrate the preclinical potential of the proposed WMTI\ntechnique in in vivo rat brain (300 {\\mu}m isotropic resolution with whole\nbrain coverage). WMTI parameter estimates are subject to a duality leading to\ntwo solution branches dependent on a sign choice which is currently debated.\nResults from both of these branches are presented and discussed throughout our\nanalysis.

The method which is generally used to derive these parameters is the\nlightcurve inversion. However, for most asteroids their sparse data are not\naccurate enough to derive a unique model and the lightcurve inversion method is\nthus not very efficient.\n  Aims: To fully utilize photometry sparse in time, we developed a new\nsimplified model and applied it on the data from the Lowell photometric\ndatabase. Our aim was to derive spin axis orientations and shape elongations of\nasteroids and to reconstruct distributions of these parameters for selected\nsubpopulations to find if there are some differences.\n  Methods: We model asteroids as geometrically scattering triaxial ellipsoids.\nObserved values of mean brightness and the dispersion of brightness are\ncompared with computed values obtained from the parameters of the model --\necliptical longitude $\\lambda$ and latitude $\\beta$ of the pole and the ratios\n$a/b$, $b/c$ of axes of the ellipsoid. These parameters are optimized to get\nthe best agreement with the observation.\n  Results: We found that the distribution of $\\lambda$ for main-belt asteroids\nis not uniform (in agreement with findings of Bowell et al., 2014, M&PS, 49,\n95) and is dependent on the inclination of orbit. Surprisingly, the\nnon-uniformity of $\\lambda$ distribution is larger for asteroids residing on\nlow-inclination orbits.

We show that the\nrequired transmit power becomes unbounded when the allowed maximal queueing\ndelay is shorter than the channel coherence time. To satisfy quality-of-service\nrequirement with finite transmit power, we introduce a proactive packet\ndropping mechanism, and optimize a queue state information and channel state\ninformation dependent transmission policy.

The\nmajority of TA implementations rely on the received signal strength as an\nindicator for the proximity of a user device (prover). However, such implicit\nproximity verification is not secure against an adversary who can relay\nmessages over a larger distance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for\nthwarting relay attacks in TA schemes: the prover permits access to\nauthentication credentials only if it can confirm that it is near the verifier.\nWe present STASH, a system for relay-resilient transparent authentication in\nwhich the prover does proximity verification by comparing its approach\ntrajectory towards the intended verifier with known authorized reference\ntrajectories. Trajectories are measured using low-cost sensors commonly\navailable on personal devices. We demonstrate the security of STASH against a\nclass of adversaries and its ease-of-use by analyzing empirical data, collected\nusing a STASH prototype.

A bidding language is designed to\ngeneralize secondary users' heterogeneous demands for multiple resources and\nwillingness to pay.

In this paper,\nwe investigate whether current retrieval methods will still be valid in the era\nof JWST, exploring common approximations used when retrieving transmission\nspectra of hot Jupiters. To assess biases, we use 1D photochemical models to\nsimulate typical hot Jupiter cloud-free atmospheres and generate synthetic\nobservations for a range of carbon-to-oxygen ratios. Then, we retrieve these\nspectra using TauREx, a Bayesian retrieval tool, using two methodologies: one\nassuming an isothermal atmosphere, and one assuming a parametrized temperature\nprofile. Both methods assume constant-with-altitude abundances. We found that\nthe isothermal approximation biases the retrieved parameters considerably,\noverestimating the abundances by about one order of magnitude. The retrieved\nabundances using the parametrized profile are usually within one sigma of the\ntrue state, and we found the retrieved uncertainties to be generally larger\ncompared to the isothermal approximation. Interestingly, we found that using\nthe parametrized temperature profile we could place tight constraints on the\ntemperature structure. This opens the possibility to characterize the\ntemperature profile of the terminator region of hot Jupiters. Lastly, we found\nthat assuming a constant-with-altitude mixing ratio profile is a good\napproximation for most of the atmospheres under study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2016 11:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

In this paper, we explore three heuristics to discover subsets of\nactivities that lead to useful log projections with the goal of speeding up LPM\ndiscovery considerably while still finding high-quality LPMs. We found that a\nMarkov clustering approach to create projection sets results in the largest\nimprovement of execution time, with discovered LPMs still being better than\nwith the use of randomly generated activity sets of the same size. Another\nheuristic, based on log entropy, yields a more moderate speedup, but enables\nthe discovery of higher quality LPMs. The third heuristic, based on the\nrelative information gain, shows unstable performance: for some data sets the\nspeedup and LPM quality are higher than with the log entropy based method,\nwhile for other data sets there is no speedup at all.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2016 12:12:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

We compared the RM in the line of sight of clusters\nwithin their projected radii of r_500 with those outside and found a\nsignificant excess of the dispersion of the RM in the cluster regions.

Therefore the interesting quantity is the standard deviation of the\nRM for an ensemble of clusters. We found a standard deviation of the RM inside\nr_500 of about 120 +- 21 rad m^-2.

Recently, a\ndifferent theory was proposed: The boson peak was attributed to the first van\nHove singularity of crystal lattices which is only smeared out by the disorder.\nThis new viewpoint assumes that the van Hove singularity is simply shifted by\nthe decreased density of the amorphous state and is therefore not a\nglass-specific anomaly.

Generally, deep neural network\narchitectures are stacks consisting of a large number of convolutional layers,\nand they perform downsampling along the spatial dimension via pooling to reduce\nmemory usage. Concurrently, the feature map dimension (i.e., the number of\nchannels) is sharply increased at downsampling locations, which is essential to\nensure effective performance because it increases the diversity of high-level\nattributes. This also applies to residual networks and is very closely related\nto their performance. In this research, instead of sharply increasing the\nfeature map dimension at units that perform downsampling, we gradually increase\nthe feature map dimension at all units to involve as many locations as\npossible. This design, which is discussed in depth together with our new\ninsights, has proven to be an effective means of improving generalization\nability.

This problem is tackled from two sides: estimates\nusing the resonance exchange model, and positivity constraints from the general\nproperties of the $S$-matrix including analyticity, crossing symmetry and\nunitarity. These estimates and constraints are compared with the values\ndetermined from fits to lattice data of the scattering lengths. Tensions are\nfound, and possible reasons are discussed. We conclude that more data from\nlattice calculations and experiments are necessary to fix these constants\nbetter. As a by-product, we also estimate the coupling constant $g_{DDa_2}$,\nwith $a_2$ the light tensor meson, via the QCD sum rule approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2016 15:39:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

We\nsummarize work on the central parsec of the Galactic center based on imaging\nand spectroscopic observations at the Keck and Gemini telescopes. These\nobservations include stellar positions in two dimension and the velocity in\nthree dimensions. Spectroscopic observations also enable measurements of the\nphysical properties of individual stars, such as the spectral type and in some\ncases the effective temperature, metallicity, and surface gravity. We present a\nreview of our latest measurements of the density profiles and luminosity\nfunctions of the young and old stars in this region. These observations show a\ncomplex stellar population with a young (4-6 Myr) compact star cluster in the\ncentral 0.5 pc embedded in an older and much more massive nuclear star cluster.\nSurprisingly, the old late-type giants do not show a cusp profile as long been\nexpected from theoretical work. The solution to the missing cusp problem may\noffer us insight into the dynamical evolution of the cluster. Finally, we also\ndiscuss recent work on the metallicity of stars in this region and how they\nmight be used to trace their origin. The nuclear star cluster shows a large\nvariation in metallicity ([M/Fe]). The majority of the stars have higher than\nsolar metallicity, with about 6\\% having [M/Fe] $< -0.5$. These observations\nindicate that the NSC was not built from the globular clusters that we see\ntoday. The formation of the nuclear star cluster is more likely from the inward\nmigration of gas originating in the disk of the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2016 15:40:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

To study the interplay between normal and mutant as well as immortal\ncells in the human colon or intestinal crypt, we developed a 4-compartmental\nstochastic model for cell dynamics based on current discoveries. Recent studies\nof the intestinal crypt have revealed the existence of two stem cell groups.\nTherefore, our model incorporates two stem cell groups (central stem cells\n(CeSCs) and border stem cells (BSCs)), plus one compartment for transit\namplifying (TA) cells and one compartment of fully differentiated (FD) cells.\nHowever, it can be easily modified to have only one stem cell group. We find\nthat the worst-case scenario occurs when CeSCs are mutated, or an immortal cell\narises in the TA or FD compartments. The probability that the progeny of a\nsingle advantageous CeSC mutant will take over the entire crypt is more than\n$0.2$, and one immortal cell always causes all FD cells to become\nimmortals.Moreover, when CeSCs are either mutants or wild-type (w.t.)\nindividuals, their progeny will take over the entire crypt in less than 100\ndays if there is no immortal cell. Unexpectedly, if the CeSCs are wild-type,\nthen non-immortal mutants with higher fitness are washed out faster than those\nwith lower fitness. Therefore, we suggest one potential treatment for colon\ncancer might be replacing or altering the CeSCs with the normal stem cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2016 17:56:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 18:38:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}
