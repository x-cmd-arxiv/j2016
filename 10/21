Gravitational field modeling typically approximates the target body\nwith a sphere, leading to a representation in spherical harmonics. However,\nsmall celestial bodies are often irregular in shape, and hence poorly\napproximated by a sphere. A much better suited geometrical fit is achieved by a\ntri-axial ellipsoid. This is also mirrored in the fact that the associated\nharmonic expansion (ellipsoidal harmonics) shows a significantly better\nconvergence behavior as opposed to spherical harmonics. Unfortunately, complex\nmathematics and numerical problems (arithmetic overflow) so far severely\nlimited the applicability of ellipsoidal harmonics. In this paper, we present a\nmethod that allows expanding ellipsoidal harmonics to a considerably higher\ndegree compared to existing techniques. We apply this novel approach to model\nthe gravitational field of comet 67P, the final target of the Rosetta mission.\nThe comparison of results based on the ellipsoidal parameterization with those\nbased on the spheroidal and spherical approximations reveals that the latter is\nclearly inferior; the spheroidal solution, on the other hand, is virtually just\nas accurate as the ellipsoidal one. Finally, in order to generalize our\nfindings, we assess the gravitational field modeling performance for some 400\nsmall bodies in the solar system. From this investigation we generally conclude\nthat the spheroidal representation is an attractive alternative to the complex\nellipsoidal parameterization on the one hand, and the inadequate spherical\nrepresentation on the other hand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 16:32:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-21"}

(FOCS 2004) that introduced network design\ngames, the main open problem in this field has been the price of stability\n(PoS) of multicast games. For the special case of broadcast games (every vertex\nis a terminal, i.e., has an agent), a series of works has culminated in a\nconstant upper bound on the PoS (Bilo` et al., FOCS 2013). However, no\nsignificantly sub-logarithmic bound is known for multicast games. In this\npaper, we make progress toward resolving this question by showing a constant\nupper bound on the PoS of multicast games for quasi-bipartite graphs. These are\ngraphs where all edges are between two terminals (as in broadcast games) or\nbetween a terminal and a nonterminal, but there is no edge between\nnonterminals. This represents a natural class of intermediate generality\nbetween broadcast and multicast games. In addition to the result itself, our\ntechniques overcome some of the fundamental difficulties of analyzing the PoS\nof general multicast games, and are a promising step toward resolving this\nmajor open problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 17:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-21"}

In this paper, kinetic studies of classical sheaths are\nperformed with the continuum code, Gkeyll, that directly solves the\nVlasov-Poisson/Maxwell equations. The code uses a novel version of the\nfinite-element discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme that conserves energy in the\ncontinuous-time limit.

The aim of this work is to introduce the\ncontinuum-kinetic method and compare its results to those obtained from an\nalready established finite-volume multi-fluid model also implemented in Gkeyll.\nNovel boundary conditions on the fluids allow the sheath to form without\nspecifying wall fluxes, so the fluids and fields adjust self-consistently at\nthe wall. The work presented here demonstrates that the kinetic and fluid\nresults are in agreement for the momentum flux, showing that in certain\nregimes, a multi-fluid model can be a useful approximation for simulating the\nplasma boundary.

Thereby, we show analytically that at the first\norder in SOI DMI is given by the ground-state spin current. We verify this\nfinding numerically by ab-initio calculations in Mn/W(001) and Co/Pt(111)\nmagnetic bilayers. We show that despite the strong SOI from the 5$d$ heavy\nmetals DMI is well-approximated by the first order in SOI, while the\nground-state spin current is not. We decompose the SOI-linear contribution to\nDMI into two parts. One part has a simple interpretation in terms of the Zeeman\ninteraction between the spin-orbit field and the spin misalignment that\nelectrons acquire in magnetically noncollinear textures.

These protons\nare within a few atomic monolayers of the silicon surface. The high sensitivity\nNMR detection of surface protons from low surface area ($0.26 - 1.3 \\: m^2/g$)\nparticles is enabled by an overall signal enhancement of 4150 over the room\ntemperature NMR signal at the same field. When the particles were suspended in\na solvent with 80% H2O and 20% D2O, the narrow peak was observed to grow in\nintensity over time, indicating growth of the sparse surface proton layer.\nHowever, when the particles were suspended in a solvent with 20% H2O and 80%\nD2O, the narrow bound-proton peak was observed to shrink due to exchange\nbetween the surface protons and the deuterium in solution. This decrease was\naccompanied by a concomitant growth in the intensity of the frozen solvent\npeak, as the relative proton concentration of the solvent increased. When the\nparticles were suspended in the organic solvent hexane, the proton NMR spectra\nremained unchanged over time.

While VARMs postulate that a given region of\ninterest in the brain is directionally connected to another one by virtue of\ntime-lagged influences, SEMs assert that causal dependencies arise due to\ncontemporaneous effects, and may even be adopted when nodal measurements are\nnot necessarily multivariate time series. To unify these complementary\nperspectives, linear structural vector autoregressive models (SVARMs) that\nleverage both contemporaneous and time-lagged nodal data have recently been put\nforth. Albeit simple and tractable, linear SVARMs are quite limited since they\nare incapable of modeling nonlinear dependencies between neuronal time series.\nTo this end, the overarching goal of the present paper is to considerably\nbroaden the span of linear SVARMs by capturing nonlinearities through kernels,\nwhich have recently emerged as a powerful nonlinear modeling framework in\ncanonical machine learning tasks, e.g., regression, classification, and\ndimensionality reduction. The merits of kernel-based methods are extended here\nto the task of learning the effective brain connectivity, and an efficient\nregularized estimator is put forth to leverage the edge sparsity inherent to\nreal-world complex networks. Judicious kernel choice from a preselected\ndictionary of kernels is also addressed using a data-driven approach.

RTMs are used to define the\nnotion of executable transition system in the same way as Turing machines are\nused to define the notion of computable function on natural numbers. RTMs\ninherited finiteness of all sets involved from Turing machines, and as a\nconsequence, in a single step, an RTM can only communicate elements from a\nfinite set of data. Some process calculi, such as the pi-calculus, essentially\ndepend on an infinite alphabet of actions, and hence it immediately follows\nthat transition systems specified in these calculi are not executable. On\ncloser inspection, however, the pi-calculus does not appear to use the infinite\ndata in a non-computable manner.\n  In this paper, we investigate several ways to relax the finiteness\nrequirement. We start by considering a variant of RTMs in which all sets are\nallowed to be countable, and we get a notion of infinitary RTM. Infinitary RTMs\nare extremely expressive such that we can hardly use them as a expressiveness\ncriterion. Then, we refine the model by adding extra restrictions. As a result,\nwe define a notion of RTM with atoms. It is a more restricted variant of RTMs\nin which the sets of actions and data symbols are still allowed to be infinite.\nWe propose a notion of of nominal executability based on RTMs with atoms, and\nshow that every effective transition system with atoms is nominally executable.\nIt will follow that processes definable in the pi-calculus are nominally\nexecutable. In contrast, in the process specification language mCRL2 it is\npossible to specify processes that are not nominally executable. Thus, nominal\nexecutability provides a new expressiveness criterion for process calculi.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 19:38:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 16:52:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 10:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

We\nshow that initial stress stiffening arises from acceleration of strained\nfilaments due to molecular extension along the strain, while softening and\nyielding is coupled to filament deceleration, halting and recoil. We\ndemonstrate a surprising non-monotonic dependence of velocity profiles on\ncrosslinker concentration. Namely, networks with no crosslinks or substantial\ncrosslinks both exhibit fast initial filament velocities and reduced molecular\nrecoil while intermediate crosslinker concentrations display reduced velocities\nand increased recoil. We show that these collective results are due to a\nbalance of network elasticity and transient crosslinker unbinding and\nrebinding. We further show that elasticity and relaxation timescales display an\nexponential dependence on crosslinker concentration that reveal that crosslinks\ndominate entanglement dynamics when the length between crosslinkers becomes\nsmaller than the length between entanglements. In accord with recent\nsimulations, our relaxation dynamics demonstrate that post-strain stress can be\nlong-lived in crosslinked networks by distributing stress to a small fraction\nof highly-strained connected filaments that span the network and sustain the\nload, thereby allowing the rest of the network to recoil and relax.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 20:11:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-24"}

One observation frequently made in experiments, is that\ncorrelations can increase systematically with firing rate. Theoretical studies\nhave determined that stimulus-dependent correlations that increase with firing\nrate can have beneficial effects on information coding; however, we still have\nan incomplete understanding of what circuit mechanisms do, or do not, produce\nthis correlation-firing rate relationship.\n  Here, we study the relationship between pairwise correlations and firing\nrates in recurrently coupled excitatory-inhibitory spiking networks with\nconductance-based synapses. We found that with stronger excitatory coupling, a\npositive relationship emerges between pairwise correlations and firing rates.\nTo explain these findings, we used linear response theory to predict the full\ncorrelation matrix and to decompose correlations in terms of graph motifs. We\nthen used this decomposition to explain why covariation of correlations with\nfiring rate -- a relationship previously explained in feedforward networks\ndriven by correlated input -- emerges in some recurrent networks but not in\nothers. Furthermore, when correlations covary with firing rate, this\nrelationship is reflected in low-rank structure in the correlation matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 20:32:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 20:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-29"}

From a symmetry point of view, nematic order can be\ndescribed as a coherent locking of spin fluctuations in two interpenetrating\nN\\'eel sublattices with ensuing nearest-neighbor bond order and an absence of\nstatic magnetism. Here, we argue that the low-temperature state of the recently\ndiscovered superconductor BaTi$_2$Sb$_2$O is a strong candidate for a more\nexotic form of spin-driven nematic order, in which fluctuations occurring in\nfour N\\'eel sublattices promote both nearest- and next-nearest neighbor bond\norder.

For the understanding of the emission mechanisms, simultaneous\nmulti-wavelength observations are crucial. Various models for flares predict\nsimultaneous flux increases in the X-ray and gamma-ray band or more complex\nvariability patterns, depending on the dominant process responsible for the\ngamma-ray emission. Monitoring at TeV energies is providing important\ninformation to distinguish between different models. To study duty cycle and\nvariability time scales of an object, an unbiased data sample is essential, and\ngood sensitivity and continuous monitoring are needed to resolve smaller time\nscales. A dedicated long-term monitoring program at TeV energies has been\nstarted by the FACT project. Its success clearly illustrated that the usage of\nsilicon based photo sensors (SIPMs) is ideal for long-term monitoring. They\nprovide not only an excellent and stable detector performance, but also allow\nfor observations during bright ambient light minimizing observational gaps and\nincreasing the instrument's duty cycle. The observation time in a single\nlongitude is limited to 6 hours.

At TeV energies, the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC)\nobservatory monitors approximately two thirds of the sky every day. It uses the\nwater Cherenkov technique, which provides an excellent duty cycle independent\nof weather and season. The First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope (FACT) monitors a\nsmall sample of sources with better sensitivity, using the imaging air\nCherenkov technique. Thanks to its camera with silicon-based photosensors, FACT\nfeatures an excellent detector performance and stability and extends its\nobservations to times with strong moonlight, increasing the duty cycle compared\nto other imaging air Cherenkov telescopes. As FACT and HAWC have overlapping\nenergy ranges, a joint study can exploit the longer daily coverage given that\nthe observatories' locations are offset by 5.3 hours. Furthermore, the better\nsensitivity of FACT adds a finer resolution of features on hour-long time\nscales, while the continuous duty cycle of HAWC ensures evenly sampled\nlong-term coverage. Thus, the two instruments complement each other to provide\na more complete picture of blazar variability.

The characteristics of self-assembly\nbuilding blocks determine the structures that they form. Two crucial properties\nare the determinism and boundedness of the self-assembly. The former tells us\nwhether the same set of building blocks always generates the same structure,\nand the latter whether it grows indefinitely. These properties are highly\nrelevant in the context of protein structures, as the difference between\ndeterministic protein self-assembly and nondeterministic protein aggregation is\ncentral to a number of diseases. Here we introduce a graph theoretical approach\nthat can determine the determinism and boundedness for several geometries and\ndimensionalities of self-assembly more accurately and quickly than conventional\nmethods. We apply this methodology to a previously studied lattice\nself-assembly model and discuss generalizations to a wide range of other\nself-assembling systems\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 23:28:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Sep 2018 15:55:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}

Furthermore, we consider\na restricted version of this model based on an integrable scattering problem in\n1+1 dimensions. We show it is universal under postselection, if we allow\nintermediate destructive measurements and specific input states. Therefore, the\nexistence of any classical procedure to sample from the output distribution of\nthis model within multiplicative error implies collapse of polynomial hierarchy\nto its third level. Finally, we define a classical version of this model in\nwhich one can probabilistically permute balls. We find this yields a complexity\nclass which is intermediate between L and BPP. Moreover, we find a\nnondeterministic version of this model is NP-complete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 02:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-24"}

This has been an incentive to\nlook for high-energy descriptions in which $CP$ violation is increased, thus\nenhancing effects that are suppressed in the SM, such as the electric dipole\nmoments (EDMs) of elementary particles. In the present investigation, we point\nout that charged currents in which axial couplings are different from vector\ncouplings are able to produce one-loop contributions to EDMs of charged leptons\nif neutrinos are massive and if these currents violate $CP$. We develop our\ndiscussion around charged currents involving heavy neutrinos and a $W'$ gauge\nboson coupling to SM charged leptons. Using the most stringent bound on the\nelectron EDM, provided by the ACME Collaboration, we determine that the upper\nbound on the difference between axial and vector currents lies within\n$\\sim10^{-10}$ and $\\sim10^{-7}$ for heavy-neutrino masses between $0.5\\,{\\rm\nTeV}$ and $6\\,{\\rm TeV}$ and if the $W'$ mass is within $0.45\\,{\\rm\nTeV}-7\\,{\\rm TeV}$. This possibility is analyzed altogether with the anomalous\nmagnetic moments of charged leptons, among which we estimate, for the $\\tau$\nlepton, an anomalous magnetic moment contribution between $\\sim10^{-8}$ and\n$\\sim10^{-10}$ for neutrino masses ranging from $0.5\\,{\\rm TeV}$ to $6\\,{\\rm\nTeV}$ and a $W'$ mass between $0.45\\,{\\rm TeV}$ and $7\\,{\\rm TeV}$. The general\ncharged currents are also used to calculate the branching ratio for $\\mu\\to\ne\\gamma$, which gets suppressed if the set of masses of heavy neutrinos is\nquasidegenerate. In a scenario of nondegenerate neutrino masses, we find that\nregions of neutrino and $W'$ masses in which the contributions to this flavor\nchanging branching ratio are lower than the current upper bound exist. We show\nthat such regions can be widened if the $W'$ gauge boson mass is larger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 02:15:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 22:17:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

Membranes assembled\nfrom single-component chiral rods form flat disks with uniform edge twist. In\ncomparison, membranes comprised of mixture of rods with opposite chiralities\ncan have the edge twist of either handedness.

In this paper we develop\ntheory to show that while the bias and MSE of an SG-MCMC algorithm depend on\nthe staleness of stochastic gradients, its estimation variance (relative to the\nexpected estimate, based on a prescribed number of samples) is independent of\nit. In a simple Bayesian distributed system with SG-MCMC, where stale gradients\nare computed asynchronously by a set of workers, our theory indicates a linear\nspeedup on the decrease of estimation variance w.r.t. the number of workers.\nExperiments on synthetic data and deep neural networks validate our theory,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of SG-MCMC with stale\ngradients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 04:18:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-24"}

While finite-time convergence\nproperties of the SGLD with a 1st-order Euler integrator have recently been\nstudied, corresponding theory for general SG-MCMCs has not been explored. In\nthis paper we consider general SG-MCMCs with high-order integrators, and\ndevelop theory to analyze finite-time convergence properties and their\nasymptotic invariant measures. Our theoretical results show faster convergence\nrates and more accurate invariant measures for SG-MCMCs with higher-order\nintegrators. For example, with the proposed efficient 2nd-order symmetric\nsplitting integrator, the {\\em mean square error} (MSE) of the posterior\naverage for the SGHMC achieves an optimal convergence rate of $L^{-4/5}$ at $L$\niterations, compared to $L^{-2/3}$ for the SGHMC and SGLD with 1st-order Euler\nintegrators. Furthermore, convergence results of decreasing-step-size SG-MCMCs\nare also developed, with the same convergence rates as their fixed-step-size\ncounterparts for a specific decreasing sequence. Experiments on both synthetic\nand real datasets verify our theory, and show advantages of the proposed method\nin two large-scale real applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 04:28:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-24"}

First, visual features\nwith bag-of-words representation, not single vector, are extracted to\ncharacterize the image. To improve the performance, the idea of multi-view\nlearning is implemented and three kinds of features are provided, each one\ncorresponds to a single view. The information from three views is complementary\nto each other, which can be unified together. Then a new distance function is\ndesigned for bags by computing the weighted sum of the distances between\ninstances. The technique of metric learning is explored to construct a\ndata-dependent distance metric to measure the relationships between instances,\nmeanwhile between bags and images, more accurately. Last, a novel approach,\ncalled MVML, is proposed, which optimizes the joint probability that every\nimage is similar with its nearest image. MVML learns multiple distance metrics,\neach one models a single view, to unifies the information from multiple views.\nThe method can be solved by alternate optimization iteratively. Gradient ascent\nand positive semi-definite projection are utilized in the iterations. Distance\ncomparisons verified that the new bag distance function is prior to previous\nfunctions. In model evaluation, numerical experiments show that MVML with\nmultiple views performs better than single view condition, which demonstrates\nthat our model can assemble the complementary information efficiently and\nmeasure the distance between images more precisely. Experiments on influence of\nparameters and instance number validate the consistency of the method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 04:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-24"}

We use simulations to explore how these estimators,\noriginally developed for random walk samples of computer networks, perform when\napplied to RDS samples with characteristics encountered in realistic field\nsettings that depart from random walks. In particular, we explore the effects\nof multiple seeds, without vs. with replacement, branching chains, imperfect\nresponse rates, preferential recruitment, and misreporting of ties. We find\nthat clustering coefficient estimators retain desirable properties in RDS\nsamples. This paper takes an important step towards calculating network\ncharacteristics using non-traditional sampling methods, and it expands RDS's\npotential to tell researchers more about hidden populations and the social\nfactors driving disease prevalence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 07:06:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-24"}

Sensors and smart devices\ngenerate large amount of measurement data from sensing the environment, which\nis used to enable services, such as control power consumption or traffic\ndensity. To deal with such a large amount of information, and provide accurate\nmeasurements, service providers can adopt information fusion, which, given the\ndecentralized nature of urban deployments, can be performed by means of\nconsensus algorithms.

In fact, we will develop an LP rounding\nscheme for some cover problems and show that they can be solved using this\nscheme and an adaptation of the rounding approach for the deterministic\ncounterpart, provided the polynomial scenario assumption. Stochastic\nuncapacitated facility location problem will also be studied to show that the\napproximation algorithm that worked for the two-stage with recourse model\nworked for this model as well. In addition, we will use other methods to study\nthe model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 08:46:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-24"}

Evidence of a second phase transition\nwas observed at 10-13 GPa. The crystal structures of the high-pressure phases\nwere assigned to the tetragonal scheelite-type and monoclinic AgMnO4-type\nstructures. Both transitions produce drastic changes in the electronic band gap\nand phonon spectrum of SrCrO4. We determined the pressure evolution of the band\ngap for the low-pressure and high-pressure phases as well as the frequencies\nand pressure dependences of the Raman-active modes. In all three phases most\nRaman modes harden under compression; however the presence of low-frequency\nmodes which gradually soften is also detected. In monazite-type SrCrO4, the\nband gap blue-shifts under compression, but the transition to the scheelite\nphase causes an abrupt decrease of the band gap in SrCrO4.

IonTracks uses track\nstructure theory to distribute the charge carriers in ion tracks.

To answer the first question, we\nprovide an extensive empirical sensitivity analysis of commonly used CNN\narchitectures (AlexNet, VGG19, GoogleNet) across various types of image\ndegradations. This allows for predicting CNN performance for new domains\ncomprised by images of lower quality or captured from a different viewpoint. We\nalso show how the sensitivity of CNN outputs can be predicted for single\nimages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that input layer dropout or pre-filtering\nduring test time only reduces CNN sensitivity for high levels of degradation.\n  Experiments for fine-grained recognition tasks reveal that VGG19 is more\nrobust to severe image degradations than AlexNet and GoogleNet.

Therefore, the Amsterdam IADL\nQuestionnaire (A-IADL-Q) was developed: a 70-item proxy-based tool with good\npsychometric properties. We aimed to design a short version whilst preserving\nits psychometric quality. METHODS: Study partners of subjects (n=1355), ranging\nfrom cognitively normal to dementia subjects, completed the original A-IADL-Q.\nWe selected the short version items using a stepwise procedure combining\nmissing data, Item Response Theory and input from respondents and experts. We\ninvestigated internal consistency of the short version as well as concordance\nwith the original version. To assess its construct validity, we additionally\ninvestigated concordance between the short version and the Mini-Mental State\nExamination (MMSE) and Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD). Lastly, we\ninvestigated differences in IADL scores between diagnostic groups across the\ndementia spectrum. RESULTS: We selected 30 items covering the entire spectrum\nof IADL functioning. Internal consistency (.98) and concordance with the\noriginal version (.97) were very high. Concordance with the MMSE (.72) and DAD\n(.87) scores was high.

In\nthis work, we use the high resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic data\nfrom APOGEE to study the chemical abundances of NGC 6553, which is one of the\nmost metal-rich bulge GCs. We identify ten red giants as cluster members using\ntheir positions, radial velocities, iron abundances, and NIR photometry. Our\nsample stars show a mean radial velocity of $-0.14\\pm5.47$ km s$^{-1}$, and a\nmean [Fe/H] of $-0.15\\pm 0.05$. We clearly separate two populations of stars in\nC and N in this GC for the first time. NGC 6553 is the most metal-rich GC where\nthe multiple stellar population phenomenon is found until now. Substantial\nchemical variations are also found in Na, O, and Al. However, the two\npopulations show similar Si, Ca, and iron-peak element abundances. Therefore,\nwe infer that the CNO, NeNa, and MgAl cycles have been activated, but the MgAl\ncycle is too weak to show its effect on Mg. Type Ia and Type II supernovae do\nnot seem to have significantly polluted the second generation stars.

Recently, a powerful generalization of MSMs has been introduced,\nthe variational approach (VA) of molecular kinetics and its special case the\ntime-lagged independent component analysis (TICA), which allow us to\napproximate slow collective variables and molecular kinetics by linear\ncombinations of smooth basis functions or order parameters. While it is known\nhow to estimate MSMs from trajectories whose starting points are not sampled\nfrom an equilibrium ensemble, this has not yet been the case for TICA and the\nVA. Previous estimates from short trajectories, have been strongly biased and\nthus not variationally optimal. Here, we employ Koopman operator theory and\nideas from dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to extend the VA and TICA to\nnon-equilibrium data. The main insight is that the VA and TICA provide a\ncoefficient matrix that we call Koopman model, as it approximates the\nunderlying dynamical (Koopman) operator in conjunction with the basis set used.\nThis Koopman model can be used to compute a stationary vector to reweight the\ndata to equilibrium. From such a Koopman-reweighted sample, equilibrium\nexpectation values and variationally optimal reversible Koopman models can be\nconstructed even with short simulations. The Koopman model can be used to\npropagate densities, and its eigenvalue decomposition provide estimates of\nrelaxation timescales and slow collective variables for dimension reduction.\nKoopman models are generalizations of Markov state models, TICA and the linear\nVA and allow molecular kinetics to be described without a cluster\ndiscretization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 16:15:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2017 16:46:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

N2H+ is considered to be\na good tracer of the CO snowline based on astrochemical considerations\npredicting an anti-correlation between N2H+ and gas-phase CO. In this work, the\nrobustness of N2H+ as a tracer of the CO snowline is investigated.

The assumed CO and N2 abundances, corresponding binding energies, cosmic\nray ionization rate, and degree of large-grain settling are varied to determine\nthe effects on the N2H+ emission and its relation to the CO snowline. For the\nadopted physical structure of the TW Hya disk and molecular binding energies\nfor pure ices, the balance between freeze-out and thermal desorption predicts a\nCO snowline at 19 AU, corresponding to a CO midplane freeze-out temperature of\n20 K.

Similarly, in stationary\nbackgrounds, one can demand time-translation invariance plus positivity of the\nenergy. However, in more general situations, additional criteria are needed.\nFor the case of free (test) fields minimally coupled to a homogeneous and\nisotropic cosmology, it has been proven that the ambiguity is resolved by\nintroducing the criterion of unitary implementability of the quantum dynamics,\nas an endomorphism in Fock space. This condition determines a specific\nseparation of the time dependence of the field, so that this splits into a very\nprecise background dependence and a genuine quantum evolution. Furthermore,\ntogether with the condition of vacuum invariance under the spatial Killing\nsymmetries, unitarity of the dynamics selects a unique Fock representation for\nthe canonical commutation relations, up to unitary equivalence.

Actually, there is a constrained convex problem for each\nprincipal component, so that the constraints guarantee that the principal\ncomponent is indeed a solution, and not a mere saddle point. Although these\ninsights do not imply any algorithmic improvement, they can be used to further\nunderstand the method, formulate possible extensions and properly address them.\nAs an example, a new convex optimization problem for semi-supervised\nclassification is proposed, which seems particularly well-suited whenever the\nnumber of known labels is small. Our formulation resembles a Least Squares SVM\nproblem with a regularization parameter multiplied by a negative sign, combined\nwith a variational principle for Kernel PCA. Our primal optimization principle\nfor semi-supervised learning is solved in terms of the Lagrange multipliers.\nNumerical experiments in several classification tasks illustrate the\nperformance of the proposed model in problems with only a few labeled data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 14:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

The as-grown CVD\nmaterials (as-WS2) exhibit distinctly different optical properties than\ntransferred WS2 (x-WS2).

In this paper, we proposed two deep models (i.e.,\na deep classifier and a deep autoencoder) for engagement assessment with scarce\nlabel information. We recruited 15 pilots to conduct a 4-h flight simulation\nfrom Seattle to Chicago and recorded their electroencephalograph (EEG) signals\nduring the simulation.

However, flexible but uncoordinated travel\nbehaviors exacerbate traffic congestion. Mobile phone records not only reveal\nhuman mobility patterns, but also enable us to manage travel demand for system\nefficiency. In this paper, we propose a location recommendation system that\ninfers personal preferences while accounting for constraints imposed by road\ncapacity in order to manage travel demand. We first infer unobserved\npreferences using a machine learning technique from phone records. We then\nformulate an optimization method to improve system efficiency. Coupling mobile\nphone data with traffic counts and road network infrastructures collected in\nAndorra, this study shows that uncoordinated travel behaviors lead to longer\naverage travel delay, implying the opportunities in managing travel demand by\ncollective decisions. The interplay between congestion relief and overall\nsatisfied location preferences observed in extensive simulations indicate that\nmoderate sacrifices of individual utility lead to significant travel time\nsavings. Specifically, the results show that under full compliance rate, travel\ndelay fell by 52% at a cost of 31% less satisfaction. Under 60% compliance\nrate, 41% travel delay is saved with a 17% reduction in satisfaction. This\npaper highlights the effectiveness of the synergy among collective behaviors in\nincreasing system efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 15:36:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-24"}

Chem. Chem. Phys., 2012, 14, 60446053) a\nconvergence problem resulted in an averaging error in computing the entropy\nfrom a set of Wang-Landau Monte-Carlo simulations. Here we report corrected\nresults for the freezing temperature of the homopolymer chain as a function of\nthe range of the non-bonded interaction. We find that the previously reported\nforward-flux sampling (FFS) and brute-force (BF) simulation results are in\nagreement with the revised Wang-Landau (WL) calculations. This confirms the\nutility of FFS for computing crystallisation rates in systems of this kind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Oct 2016 16:13:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

Subspaces, tensor product\nand quotient spaces are considered as well as homomorphisms to end with a\nclassification theorem of these structures. The new structure provides an\naxiomatic foundation for quantity calculus and gives complete justification\nwithin its framework of the way that quantity calculus is actually performed.\nIt is hoped that this exposition helps to clarify the role of the interviening\nconcepts of quantity, quantity value, quantity dimension and their relation\nwith a system of units, particularly, the SI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 10:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-07"}
