Observational surveys\nalso indicate a deficit in the number of small ($ \\le 50$~km size) asteroids\nthat is two orders of magnitude lower than what is expected from the single\npower-law distribution that results from a collisional coagulation and\nfragmentation equilibrium. Here, we consider the possibility that a major\nfraction of the original asteroid population may have been cleared out by\nJupiter's secular resonance, as it swept through the main asteroid belt during\nthe depletion of the solar nebula. This effect leads to the excitation of the\nasteroids' orbital eccentricities. Concurrently, hydrodynamic drag and\nplanet-disk tidal interaction effectively damp the eccentricities of sub-100\nkm-size and of super-lunar-size planetesimals, respectively. These combined\neffects lead to the asteroids' orbital decay and clearing from the present-day\nmain belt region ($\\sim 2.1-3.3$~AU). The intermediate-size (50 to several\nhundreds of kilometers) planetesimals therefore preferentially remain as main\nbelt asteroids near their birthplaces, with modest asymptotic eccentricities.\nThe smaller asteroids are the fragments of subsequent disruptive collisions at\nlater times as suggested by the present-day asteroid families. This scenario\nprovides a natural explanation for both the observed low surface density and\nthe size distribution of asteroids in the main belt. It also offers an\nexplanation for the confined spatial extent of the terrestrial planet building\nblocks without the requirement of extensive migration of Jupiter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2016 16:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

Considering\nunderlay transmission, where spectrum-efficiency (SE) is fully exploited, the\nEE solution involves tackling a complex mixed-combinatorial and non-convex\noptimization problem.

That is, in the well-known $L^1 \\cap\nL^\\infty$ theory of Yudovich, the $L^1$ assumption can be dropped upon having\nan appropriate symmetry condition. This contains a class of radially\nhomogeneous solutions to the 2D Euler equation, which gives rise to a new 1D\nfluid model. We discuss several interesting properties of this 1D system. Using\nthis framework, we construct time quasi-periodic solutions to the 2D Euler\nequation exhibiting pendulum-like behavior. We also exhibit solutions with\ncompact support for which angular derivatives grow linearly in time or\nexponential in time (the latter being in the presence of a boundary). A similar\nstudy can be done for the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation. Using the\nsame symmetry condition, we prove local existence and uniqueness of solutions\nwhich are merely Lipschitz continuous near the origin - though, without the\nsymmetry, Lipschitz initial data is expected to lose its Lipschitz continuity\nimmediately. Once more, a special class of radially homogeneous solutions is\nconsidered and we extract a 1D model which bears great resemblance to the\nso-called De Gregorio model. We then show that finite-time singularity\nformation for the 1D model implies finite-time singularity formation in the\nclass of Lipschitz solutions to the SQG equation which are compact support.\nWhile the study of special infinite energy solutions to fluid models is\nclassical, this appears to be the first case where they can be embedded into a\nnatural existence/uniqueness class for the equation. Moreover, these special\nsolutions approximate finite-energy solutions for long time and have a direct\nbearing on the global regularity problem for finite-energy solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2016 19:47:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2016 03:00:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Sep 2018 09:07:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-05"}

Conventional model-based denoising approaches are, however,\ncomputationally very expensive, and image domain denoising approaches hardly\ndeal with CT specific noise patterns. To address these issues, we propose an\nalgorithm using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), which is applied to\nwavelet transform coefficients of low-dose CT images.

However, many design issues related to the complex interaction\nbetween general-purpose cores, accelerators, customized on-chip interconnects,\nand memory systems remain unclear and difficult to evaluate.\n  In this paper we design and implement the ARAPrototyper to enable rapid\ndesign space explorations for ARAs in real silicons and reduce the tedious\nprototyping efforts far down to manageable efforts. First, ARAPrototyper\nprovides a reusable baseline prototype with a highly customizable memory\nsystem, including interconnect between accelerators and buffers, interconnect\nbetween buffers and last-level cache (LLC) or DRAM, coherency choice at LLC or\nDRAM, and address translation support. Second, ARAPrototyper provides a clean\ninterface to quickly integrate users' own accelerators written in high-level\nsynthesis (HLS) code. The whole design flow is highly automated to generate a\nprototype of ARA on an FPGA system-on-chip (SoC). Third, to quickly develop\napplications that run seamlessly on the ARA prototype, ARAPrototyper provides a\nsystem software stack, abstracts the accelerators as software libraries, and\nprovides APIs for software developers. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat ARAPrototyper enables a wide range of design space explorations for ARAs\nat manageable prototyping efforts, which has 4,000X to 10,000X faster\nevaluation time than full-system simulations.

In order to obtain unbiased measurements of its spin and the\nrelated relativistic effects, a comprehensive understanding of the\ngravitational perturbations of the stars and stellar remnants around the MBH is\nquite essential. Here, we study the perturbations on the observables of a\ntypical target star, i.e., the apparent orbital motion and the redshift, due to\nboth the spin-induced relativistic effects and the Newtonian attractions of a\nsingle or a cluster of disturbing object(s). We find that, in most cases, the\nNewtonian perturbations on the observables are mainly attributed to the\nperturbed orbital period of the target star, rather than the Newtonian orbital\nprecessions. The Newtonian perturbations have their unique features when they\npeak around the pericenter passage in each revolution, which is quite different\nfrom those of the spin-induced effects. Looking at the currently detected star\nS2/S0-2, we find that its spin-induced effects on both the image position and\nredshift are very likely obscured by the gravitational perturbations from the\nstar S0-102 alone. We also investigate and discuss the Newtonian perturbations\non a hypothetical S-star located inside the orbits of the currently detected\nones. By considering a number of possible stellar distributions near the\ncentral MBH, we find that the spin-induced effects on the apparent position and\nthe redshift dominate over the stellar perturbations for target stars with\norbital semimajor axis smaller than $100-400$AU if the MBH is maximally\nspinning. Our results suggest that, in principle, the stellar perturbations can\nbe removed as they have distinctive morphologies comparing to those of the\nrelativistic Kerr-type signatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 04:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

The pressure generation mechanism is a cellular-level\nprocess that is governed by differential equations for sap transport through\nporous cell membranes, phase change, heat transport, and generation of osmotic\npressure. By assuming a periodic cellular structure based on an appropriate\nreference cell, we derive an homogenized heat equation governing the global\ntemperature on the scale of the tree stem, with all the remaining physics\nrelegated to equations defined on the reference cell.

Using the scaling law provided by Shibata & Yokoyama (1999,\n2002), $B$ and $L$ are obtained as functions of the emission measure\n($EM=n^2L^3$) and temperature ($T$) at the flare peak.

To\napply this scaling law to stellar flares, we discuss its validity for spatially\nresolved solar flares. $EM$ and $T$ were calculated from GOES soft X-ray flux\ndata, and $B$ and $L$ are theoretically estimated using the scaling law.

Traditionally, gait data are collected using either color\nsensors, such as a CCD camera, depth sensors, such as a Microsoft Kinect, or\ninertial sensors, such as an accelerometer. However, a single type of sensors\nmay only capture part of the dynamic gait features and make the gait\nrecognition sensitive to complex covariate conditions, leading to fragile\ngait-based person identification systems. In this paper, we propose to combine\nall three types of sensors for gait data collection and gait recognition, which\ncan be used for important identification applications, such as identity\nrecognition to access a restricted building or area. We propose two new\nalgorithms, namely EigenGait and TrajGait, to extract gait features from the\ninertial data and the RGBD (color and depth) data, respectively. Specifically,\nEigenGait extracts general gait dynamics from the accelerometer readings in the\neigenspace and TrajGait extracts more detailed sub-dynamics by analyzing 3D\ndense trajectories. Finally, both extracted features are fed into a supervised\nclassifier for gait recognition and person identification.

When the crystal structure is changed from sp3 of cubic-BN (c-BN)\nto sp2 of h-BN, EBD+c for h-BN becomes smaller than that for c-BN, while EBD//c\nfor h-BN drastically increases. Therefore, h-BN can possess a relatively high\nEBD concentrated only in the direction parallel to the c axis by conceding a\nweak bonding direction in the highly anisotropic crystal structure. This\nexplains why the EBD//c for h-BN is higher than that for diamond. Moreover, the\npresented EBD value obtained from the high quality bulk h-BN crystal can be\nregarded as the standard for qualifying the crystallinity of h-BN layers grown\nvia chemical vapor deposition for future electronic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 09:42:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-01"}

A comparison with the Herschel Reference Survey shows\nthat, when binning galaxies in Star Formation Rate (SFR), average SEDs are\nreproduced to within a factor of $\\sim2$ even in normalization, while binning\nin stellar mass highlights the same tension that is present in the stellar mass\n-- SFR plane.

We identify the degree of freedom which tracks the Lifshitz\ntransition via changes in topological quantum numbers (e.g., Chern number,\nBerry phase etc.). An emergent $SU(2)$ symmetry at criticality is observed to\nlead to a topological quantum number different from that which characterises\nthe ordered phase. The topological transition is also understood via a spectral\nflow thought-experiment in a Thouless charge pump, revealing the bulk-boundary\ncorrespondence across the transition.

However, the ever-present dynamics, i.e., the temporal evolution of\nheatings and macroscopic motions, has been widely disregarded when modeling and\ninterpreting the scattering polarization. This has hindered a consistent\ntheoretical solution to the puzzle while falsifying the Hanle diagnosis. Here,\nwe show that the dynamical evolution is a keystone for solving both problems\nbecause its systematic impact allows an explanation of the observations from\n'anomalous' instantaneous polarization signals.

We find that for the model with radial\nmigration, the [alpha/Fe] ratios of stars in outer disk regions decrease more\nrapidly with time than the model without radial migration, because the\nassociated net transfer of intermediate and old disk stars from inner to outer\ndisk regions increases the rate of Type Ia relative to that of Type II\nsupernovae in the latter regions.

As a\nresult we obtain the bimodal distribution of disk stars on the\n[alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane as observed in the Galactic stellar disk, thereby\nimplying that the event of discontinuous radial migration may play a key role\nin reproducing the observed bimodality of stars on this abundance-ratio\ndiagram.

Moreover, sample\nsize re-estimation based on unbiased variance estimators such as the Xing-Ganju\nvariance estimator results in underpowered trials, as it is expected since an\noverestimation of the variance and thus the sample size is in general required\nfor the re-estimation procedure to eventually meet the target power. Moreover,\nwe propose an inflation factor for the sample size re-estimation with the\nXing-Ganju variance estimator and show that this approach results in adequately\npowered trials. Due to favorable features of Xing-Ganju variance estimator such\nas unbiasedness and a distribution independent of the group means, the\ninflation factor does not depend on the nuisance parameter and, therefore, can\nbe calculated prior to a trial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 11:47:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jul 2017 18:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

In this work, we propose a novel\ntechnique to tackle this challenge. The key idea is to use 2-Component (2C)\nshared embedding for word representations. We allocate every word in the\nvocabulary into a table, each row of which is associated with a vector, and\neach column associated with another vector. Depending on its position in the\ntable, a word is jointly represented by two components: a row vector and a\ncolumn vector. Since the words in the same row share the row vector and the\nwords in the same column share the column vector, we only need $2 \\sqrt{|V|}$\nvectors to represent a vocabulary of $|V|$ unique words, which are far less\nthan the $|V|$ vectors required by existing approaches.

In\nthis review, we present an overview of the progress achieved so far in the\nfield of hyperentanglement in photon systems and some of its important\napplications in quantum information processing, including hyperentanglement\ngeneration, complete hyperentangled-Bell-state analysis, hyperentanglement\nconcentration, and hyperentanglement purification for high-capacity\nlong-distance quantum communication. Also, a scheme for hyper-controlled-not\ngate is introduced for hyperparallel photonic quantum computation, which can\nperform two controlled-not gate operations on both the polarization and\nspatial-mode DOFs and depress the resources consumed and the photonic\ndissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 12:26:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 01:11:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2016 15:14:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 00:56:10 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2017 13:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-03"}

In 2005, several new\nphenomena such as the spin Hall effect and the quantum spin Hall effect were\npredicted in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling and vanishing external\nmagnetic field. More recently, the Zeeman spin Hall effect and the formation of\nvalley Hall topological currents have been introduced for graphene-based\nsystems, under time-reversal or inversion symmetry-breaking conditions,\nrespectively.

Our interferometric survey\nwas performed with the MIDI instrument on the VLTI. In total 19 different\nsystems were observed using variable baseline configurations.

However, even if the series expansion continues to\nhigher-orders, there is always the possibility to miss the critical point\nbehavior due to truncation errors. An alternative approach is to use a black\nhole engineered holographic model, which displays a critical point at large\ndensities and matches lattice susceptibilities at $\\mu_{_B}\\!=\\!0$. Using the\nthermodynamic data from this black hole model, we obtain the freeze-out points\nextracted from the net-protons distribution measured at STAR and explore higher\norder fluctuations at the lowest energies at the beam energy scan to\ninvestigate signatures of the critical point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 15:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

In this work, we\nstudy this question in the context of data streams, where elements arrive one\nat a time, and we want to design low-memory and fast update-time algorithms\nthat maintain a good solution. Specifically, we focus on the sliding window\nmodel, where we are asked to maintain a solution that considers only the last\n$W$ items.\n  In this context, we provide the first non-trivial algorithm that maintains a\nprovable approximation of the optimum using space sublinear in the size of the\nwindow. In particular we give a $\\frac{1}{3} - \\epsilon$ approximation\nalgorithm that uses space polylogarithmic in the spread of the values of the\nelements, $\\Phi$, and linear in the solution size $k$ for any constant\n$\\epsilon > 0$ . At the same time, processing each element only requires a\npolylogarithmic number of evaluations of the function itself. When a better\napproximation is desired, we show a different algorithm that, at the cost of\nusing more memory, provides a $\\frac{1}{2} - \\epsilon$ approximation and allows\na tunable trade-off between average update time and space. This algorithm\nmatches the best known approximation guarantees for submodular optimization in\ninsertion-only streams, a less general formulation of the problem.\n  We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithms on a number of real world\ndatasets, showing that their practical performance far exceeds the theoretical\nbounds.

First, we show\nconsiderable speedups attained by minor and relatively straightforward code\nchanges to off-load parts of the computation to the GPUs. Then, we identify\nfurther possible improvements to achieve even higher performance and\nscalability. On a system consisting of 16-cores and 2 GPUs, we observe speedups\nof up to 5x with respect to our optimized shared-memory code, which in turn\nmeans between 7.5x and 12.5x speedup with respect to the original FLEUR code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 13:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

There are\nseveral perspectives on complexity and what constitutes complex behaviour or\ncomplex systems, as opposed to regular, predictable behaviour and simple\nsystems. In this paper, we explore the following perspectives on complexity:\n\"effort-to-describe\" (Shannon entropy $H$, Lempel-Ziv complexity $LZ$),\n\"effort-to-compress\" ($ETC$ complexity) and \"degree-of-order\" (Subsymmetry or\n$SubSym$). While Shannon entropy and $LZ$ are very popular and widely used,\n$ETC$ is a recently proposed measure for time series. In this paper, we also\npropose a novel normalized measure $SubSym$ based on the existing idea of\ncounting the number of subsymmetries or palindromes within a sequence. We\ncompare the performance of these complexity measures on the following tasks: a)\ncharacterizing complexity of short binary sequences of lengths 4 to 16, b)\ndistinguishing periodic and chaotic time series from 1D logistic map and 2D\nH\\'{e}non map, and c) distinguishing between tonic and irregular spiking\npatterns generated from the \"Adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire\" neuron\nmodel. Our study reveals that each perspective has its own advantages and\nuniqueness while also having an overlap with each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 13:45:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-17"}

The informational\ncompleteness demands that matter fermions must appear in three families, each\nhaving 16 independent matter fermions.
