However, tensor network\nrepresentations may be vulnerable to instabilities caused by small\nperturbations of the local tensor, especially when the local tensor is not\ninjective. For example, the topological order in tensor network representations\nof the toric code ground state has been shown to be unstable under certain\nsmall variations of the local tensor, if these small variations do not obey a\nlocal $Z_2$ symmetry of the tensor. In this paper, we ask the questions of\nwhether other types of topological orders suffer from similar kinds of\ninstability and if so, what is the underlying physical mechanism and whether we\ncan protect the order by enforcing certain symmetries on the tensor. We answer\nthese questions by showing that the tensor network representation of all\nstring-net models are indeed unstable, but the matrix product operator (MPO)\nsymmetries of the local tensor can help to protect the order. We find that,\n`stand-alone' variations that break the MPO symmetries lead to instability\nbecause they induce the condensation of bosonic quasi-particles and destroy the\ntopological order in the system. Therefore, such variations must be forbidden\nfor the encoded topological order to be reliably extracted from the local\ntensor. On the other hand, if a tensor network based variational algorithm is\nused to simulate the phase transition due to boson condensation, then such\nvariation directions must be allowed in order to access the continuous phase\ntransition process correctly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2016 16:03:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 19:42:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-12"}

Deep\nreinforcement learning alleviates this limitation by training general-purpose\nneural network policies, but applications of direct deep reinforcement learning\nalgorithms have so far been restricted to simulated settings and relatively\nsimple tasks, due to their apparent high sample complexity.

Three aspects are notable: the variables\nare usually associated with the nodes of a graph with limited communication\nresources, hindering centralized control; the communication is subjected to\nnoise; and the number of variables can be very large. These three aspects make\ntools and techniques from statistical physics particularly suitable for the\nperformance analysis of such networked systems in the limit of many variables\n(analogous to the thermodynamic limit in statistical physics). Perhaps not\nsurprisingly, phase-transition like phenomena appear in these systems, where a\nsharp change in performance can be observed with a smooth parameter variation,\nwith the change becoming discontinuous or singular in the limit of infinite\nsystem size. In this paper we analyze the so called network consensus problem,\nprototypical of the above considerations, that has been previously analyzed\nmostly in the context of additive noise. We show that qualitatively new\nphase-transition like phenomena appear for this problem in the presence of\nmultiplicative noise.

In the absence of the\nconservation law, and for graph spectral dimension less than two, the\nmultiplicative noise threshold (the stability margin of the control problem) is\nzero. This is reminiscent of the absence of robust controllers for certain\nclasses of centralized control problems.

Parameter\nsensitivity analyses reveal significant changes in network size and morphology\non varying the chemotactic sensitivity of tip cells, and the sensitivities of\nthe proliferation rate and sprouting probability to mechanical stretch. Varying\nchemotactic sensitivity also affects network directionality. Branching and\nnetwork density are influenced by the sprouting probability. Glyphs depicting\nmultiple network properties show how network quantities change over time and as\nmodel parameters vary. We also show how glyphs constructed from in vivo data\ncould be used to discriminate between normal and tumour vasculature and,\nultimately, for model validation. We conclude that our biomechanical hybrid\nmodel generates vascular networks similar to those generated from in vitro and\nin vivo experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2016 18:25:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

The agents\nalternately share data with one another for a total of K rounds such that each\nagent initiates sharing over K/2 rounds. The interactions are modeled as a\ncollection of K random mechanisms (mappings), one for each round. The goal is\nto jointly design the K private mechanisms to determine the set of all\nachievable distortion-leakage pairs at each agent. Arguing that a mutual\ninformation-based leakage metric can be appropriate for streaming data\nsettings, this paper: (i) determines the set of all achievable distortion-\nleakage tuples ; (ii) shows that the K mechanisms allow for precisely composing\nthe total privacy budget over K rounds without loss; and (ii) develops\nconditions under which interaction reduces the net leakage at both agents and\nillustrates it for a specific class of sources. The paper then focuses on\nlog-loss distortion to better understand the effect on leakage of using a\ncommonly used utility metric in learning theory. The resulting interaction\nproblem leads to a non-convex sum-leakage-distortion optimization problem that\ncan be viewed as an interactive version of the information bottleneck problem.\nA new merge-and-search algorithm that extends the classical agglomerative\ninformation bottleneck algorithm to the interactive setting is introduced to\ndetermine a provable locally optimal solution. Finally, the benefit of\ninteraction under log-loss is illustrated for specific source classes and the\noptimality of one-shot is proved for Gaussian sources under both mean-square\nand log-loss distortions constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2016 18:26:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

These agents observe noisy samples of a desired state through a\nlinear model and seek to learn this state by interacting with each other.\nAlthough this problem has attracted significant attention and been studied\nextensively in fields including machine learning and signal processing, all the\nwell-known strategies do not achieve team-optimal learning performance in the\nfinite-horizon MSE sense. To this end, we formulate the finite-horizon\ndistributed minimum MSE (MMSE) when there is no restriction on the size of the\ndisclosed information, i.e., oracle performance, over an arbitrary network\ntopology. Subsequently, we show that exchange of local estimates is sufficient\nto achieve the oracle performance only over certain network topologies. By\ninspecting these network structures, we propose recursive algorithms achieving\nthe oracle performance through the disclosure of local estimates. For practical\nimplementations we also provide approaches to reduce the complexity of the\nalgorithms through the time-windowing of the observations. Finally, in the\nnumerical examples, we demonstrate the superior performance of the introduced\nalgorithms in the finite-horizon MSE sense due to optimal estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2016 19:09:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Jan 2017 19:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-10"}

Accounting for its full reionization information\ncontent, we reconsider the interpretation of Planck 2015 Low Frequency\nInstrument (LFI) polarization data using simple, yet physically-motivated\nreionization models.

From the optical design of the\ninstrument, reliable ray-tracing routines allow computing and display of the\nPSF based on geometrical optics. However, such an approach does not directly\naccount for the scattering caused by surface microroughness, which is\ninterferential in nature. Although the scattering effect can be separately\nmodeled, its inclusion in the ray-tracing routine requires assumptions that are\ndifficult to verify. In that context, a purely physical optics approach is more\nappropriate as it remains valid regardless of the shape and size of the defects\nappearing on the optical surface. Such a computation, when performed in\ntwo-dimensional consideration, is memory and time consuming because it requires\none to process a surface map with a few micron resolution, and the situation\nbecomes even more complicated in case of optical systems characterized by more\nthan one reflection.

The gas inside\nthe TPCs can be used as an active target to study the neutrino interactions in\ngreat detail. The low density of the gas leads to very low track energy\nthresholds, allowing the reconstruction of very low momentum tracks, e.g.\nprotons with kinetic energies down to $\\mathcal{O}$(1 MeV). Since different\nnuclear interaction models vary considerably in their predictions of those low\nmomentum track multiplicities, this makes neutrino interactions on gases a\npowerful probe to test those models. The TPCs operate with an argon-based gas\nmixture (95% by volume) and have been exposed to the T2K neutrino beam since\nthe beginning of the experiment in 2010. Due to the low total mass of the gas,\nneutrino argon interactions happen only rarely, compared to the surrounding\nscintillator-based detectors. We expect about 600 such events in the recorded\ndata so far (about 200 in the fiducial volume). We are able to separate those\nevents from the background and thus demonstrate the viability of using gaseous\nargon as a target for a neutrino beam. This enables us to do a cross- section\nmeasurement on gaseous argon, the first measurement of this kind. All previous\nneutrino cross-section measurements on argon were performed in liquid argon\nTPCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2016 17:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

GSWLC\ncontains galaxies within the GALEX footprint, regardless of a UV detection,\ncovering 90% of SDSS. The physical properties were obtained from UV/optical SED\nfitting following Bayesian methodology of Salim et al.

GSWLC includes\nmid-IR SFRs derived from IR templates based upon 22 micron WISE observations.\nThese estimates are independent of UV/optical SED fitting, in order to separate\npossible systematics. The paper argues that the comparison of specific SFRs\n(SSFRs) is more informative and physically motivated than the comparison of\nSFRs. SSFRs resulting from the UV/optical SED fitting are compared to the\nmid-IR SSFRs, and to SSFRs from three published catalogs.

For galaxies below the main sequence (log\nSSFR<-11), mid-IR (S)SFRs based on fixed luminosity-SFR conversion are severely\nbiased (up to 2 dex) because the dust is primarily heated by old stars.\nFurthermore, mid-IR (S)SFRs are overestimated by up to 0.6 dex for galaxies\nwith AGN, presumably due to non-stellar dust heating.

We use these outcomes to consider which planetary\nsystem architectures maximise the observability of specific signatures, given\nthat signatures should be detected first around systems with optimal\narchitectures (if such systems exist in nature). Giant impact debris is most\nreadily detectable for 0.1-10Mearth planets at 1-5au, depending on detection\nmethod and spectral type. While A stars have putative giant impact debris at\n4-6au consistent with this sweet spot, that of FGK stars is typically <<1au\ncontrary to expectations; an absence of 1-3au giant impact debris could\nindicate a low frequency of terrestrial planets there. Three principles\nmaximise cometary influx from exo-Kuiper belts: a chain of closely separated\nplanets interior to the belt, none of which is a Jupiter-like ejector; planet\nmasses not increasing strongly with distance (for a net inward torque on\ncomets); ongoing replenishment of comets, possibly by embedded low-mass\nplanets. A high Oort Cloud comet influx requires no ejector and architectures\nthat maximise the Oort Cloud population. Cold debris disks are usually\nconsidered classical Kuiper belt analogues.

To achieve this goal, an array of about\n100 telescopes is required, meaning a total reflective surface of several\nthousands of square meters.

The PGT is obtained by\npropagating the labels of a GT frame to its subsequent frames in the video\nusing a simple CRF-based, cue integration framework. Our main contribution is\nto demonstrate the use of noisy PGT along with GT to improve the performance of\na CNN. We perform a systematic analysis to find the right kind of PGT that\nneeds to be added along with the GT for training a CNN. In this regard, we\nexplore three aspects of PGT which influence the learning of a CNN: i) the PGT\nlabeling has to be of good quality; ii) the PGT images have to be different\ncompared to the GT images; iii) the PGT has to be trusted differently than GT.\nWe conclude that PGT which is diverse from GT images and has good quality of\nlabeling can indeed help improve the performance of a CNN. Also, when PGT is\nmultiple folds larger than GT, weighing down the trust on PGT helps in\nimproving the accuracy.

Previous studies of this type\ntreated the NS core as a normal fluid and thus did not account for its expected\nsuperfluidity. The source of buoyancy that supports the g modes is\nfundamentally different in the two cases: in a normal fluid core the buoyancy\nis due to gradients in the proton-to-neutron fraction whereas in a superfluid\ncore it is due to gradients in the muon-to-electron fraction. The latter yields\na stronger stratification and a superfluid NS therefore has a denser spectrum\nof g modes with frequencies above 10 Hz. As a result, many more g modes undergo\nresonant tidal excitation as the binary sweeps through the bandwidth of GW\ndetectors such as LIGO. We find that roughly 10 times more orbital energy is\ntransferred into g mode oscillations if the NS has a superfluid core rather\nthan a normal fluid core. However, because this energy is transferred later in\nthe inspiral when the orbital decay is faster, the accumulated phase error in\nthe gravitational waveform is comparable for a superfluid and a normal fluid NS\n(about 0.001-0.01 rad).

In\nthis project, we look at how models for the limits on the range of movement can\nbe derived in a principled manner from a model of the movement. Using the\nexample of normal walking gaits, we develop a lower limit on the avg. walking\nspeed by examining the process by which the body restores mechanical energy\nlost during walking, and we develop an upper limit on the avg. step length by\nexamining the forces the body can exert doing external mechanical work, in this\ncase, pulling a cart.

Since\nthe latter are usually weak the onset temperatures for multiferroism via this\nmechanism are typically low.

In the presence of a single impurity bond, once the absolute value of the\nfrustrating coupling J_imp < 0 exceeds a threshold J_c > 0, the ground state\nbecomes two-fold degenerate, corresponding to either clockwise or anticlockwise\ncanting of the spins in the vicinity of the impurity bond.

Those degrees of freedom interact through a dipolar\ninteraction mediated by spin waves. A ferromagnetic Ising ground state\nindicates the instability of the XY ferromagnet towards a spiral state with a\nwave vector proportional to the concentration of impurity bonds. To analyze\nunder which circumstances such a ground state arises, we study first impurities\nforming superlattices. For a subclass of those, we can rigorously establish the\nexistence of spiral order. For another class of superlattices, the Ising\nvariables order ferromagnetically in planes perpendicular to the orientation of\nimpurity bonds, but antiferromagnetically parallel to it, which results in a\nfan-like XY ground state. Second, we consider the case when the impurity bonds\nare randomly distributed on the three-dimensional host lattice according to a\nPoisson process.

As was already suggested by Marumori and Watanabe, the internal\nrotational motion, i.e., the vortex motion, however, may exist also in nuclei.\nSo, we have a necessity of taking the vortex motion into consideration. In a\nclassical fluid dynamics, there are various ways to treat the internal\nrotational velocity. The Clebsch representation, v(x) = -\\nabla \\phi(x) +\n\\lambda(x) \\nabla \\psi(x) (\\phi ; velocity potential, \\lambda and \\psi: Clebsch\nparameters) is very powerful and has an advantage deriving equations of fluid\nmotion from a Lagransian. Making the best use of the advantage,\nKronig-Thellung, Ziman and Ito obtained a Hamiltonian including the internal\nrotational motion, the vortex motion, through the term \\lambda(x) \\nabla\n\\psi(x). Going to quantum fluid dynamics, Ziman and Thellung finally derived a\nroton spectrum of liquid Helium II postulated by Landau. Is it possible to\napply such the manner to a description of the collective vortex motion in\nnuclei? The description of such a collective motion has never been treated in\nthe Bohr-Mottelson model (BMM) for a long time.

In one\npopular scenario, supermassive black hole binaries --- established during dry\n(i.e. gas-poor) galaxy mergers --- kick out the stars from a galaxy's central\nregion via three-body interactions. Here, this \"binary black hole scouring\nscenario\" is probed at its extremes by investigating the two galaxies reported\nto have the largest partially-depleted cores found to date:\n2MASX~J09194427+5622012 and 2MASX~J17222717+3207571 (the brightest galaxy in\nAbell~2261). We have fit these galaxy's two-dimensional light distribution\nusing the core-S\\'{e}rsic model, and found that the former galaxy has a\ncore-S\\'{e}rsic break radius $R_{b,cS}=0.55$~kpc, three times smaller than the\npublished value. We use this galaxy to caution that other reportedly large\nbreak radii may too have been over-estimated if they were derived using the\n\"sharp-transition\" (inner core)-to-(outer S\\'{e}rsic) model. In the case of\n2MASX~J17222717+3207571, we obtain $R_{b,cS}=3.6$~kpc.

Dusts are made of small\nparticles which are characterised by their size (radius), composition (matter),\nand structure (morphology, including porosity). In the present work, we address\nthe question of the role of the dust particle porosity on light polarization\nand color, using Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) light scattering code. To\nanswer this question, we developed an algorithm to generate solid particles of\narbitrary values of porosity. In brief, the model considers a given homogeneous\nstructure made of touching dipoles. The dipoles are randomly removed one by\none, such that the remaining structure remains connected. We stop the removal\nprocess when the desired poros- ity is obtained. Then we study the optical\nproperties of the porous particle. That way, we show how the proper value of\nthe porosity affects the polarization and color of the light scattered by these\nporous particles. In addition to polarization, porosity has important effects\non photometric color. Considering an important application, we emphasize the\npossible role of the porosity of the cometary dust particles on polarization\nand color of the light scattered by cometary coma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2016 05:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

RC sampling can\nbe challenging for human supervisors and prone to mislabeling. RC sampling can\nalso induce error in policy performance because it repeatedly visits areas of\nthe state space that are harder to learn. Although policies learned with RC\nsampling can be superior to HC sampling for standard learning models such as\nlinear SVMs, policies learned with HC sampling may be comparable with\nhighly-expressive learning models such as deep learning and hyper-parametric\ndecision trees, which have little model error. We compare HC and RC using a\ngrid world and a physical robot singulation task, where in the latter the input\nis a binary image of a connected set of objects on a planar worksurface and the\npolicy generates a motion of the gripper to separate one object from the rest.\nWe observe in simulation that for linear SVMs, policies learned with RC\noutperformed those learned with HC but that with deep models this advantage\ndisappears.

We tested the possible redshift dependence of the correlation\nand its effect on the Hubble diagram. Finally, we used the GRB Hubble diagram\nto investigate the dark energy EOS.

A distinguishing feature of NCMA is the joint use of\nphysical-layer network coding (PNC) and multiuser decoding (MUD) to boost\nthroughput of multipacket reception systems. In previous NCMA systems, users\nadopt the same modulation regardless of their individual channel conditions.\nThis leads to suboptimal throughput for many practical scenarios, especially\nwhen different users have widely varying channel conditions. A rate-diverse\nNCMA system allows different users to use modulations that are commensurate\nwith their channel conditions. A key challenge is the design of the PNC mapping\nand decoding mechanisms in NCMA when different users adopt different\nmodulations. While there have been past work on non-channel-coded rate-diverse\nPNC, this paper is the first attempt to design channel-coded rate-diverse PNC\nto ensure the reliability of the overall NCMA system. Specifically, we put\nforth a symbol-splitting channel coding and modulation design so that PNC/NCMA\ncan work over different modulations.

In particular, resonantly exciting phonons leads to a better\nunderstanding of how they couple to other degrees of freedom in the material\n(e.g., ferroelectricity, conductivity and magnetism) while enabling coherent\ncontrol of lattice vibrations and the symmetry changes associated with them.\nHowever, an ultrafast method for observing the resulting structural changes at\nthe atomic scale is essential for studying phonon dynamics. A simple approach\nfor doing this is optical second harmonic generation (SHG), a technique with\nremarkable sensitivity to crystalline symmetry in the bulk of a material as\nwell as at surfaces and interfaces. This makes SHG an ideal method for probing\nphonon dynamics in topological insulators (TI), materials with unique surface\ntransport properties. Here, we resonantly excite a polar phonon mode in the\ncanonical TI Bi$_2$Se$_3$ with intense THz pulses and probe the subsequent\nresponse with SHG. This enables us to separate the photoinduced lattice\ndynamics at the surface from transient inversion symmetry breaking in the bulk.\nFurthermore, we coherently control the phonon oscillations by varying the time\ndelay between a pair of driving THz pulses. Our work thus demonstrates a\nversatile, table-top tool for probing and controlling ultrafast phonon dynamics\nin materials, particularly at surfaces and interfaces, such as that between a\nTI and a magnetic material, where exotic new states of matter are predicted to\nexist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2016 07:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

Fortunately, several powerful solvers\nincluding SDPNAL, SDPNAL+ and QSDPNAL have recently been developed to solve\nlinear and convex quadratic SDP problems to high accuracy successfully. These\nsolvers are based on the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) applied to the dual\nproblems with the subproblems being solved by semismooth Newton-CG methods.\nNoticeably, thanks to Rockafellar's general theory on the proximal point\nalgorithms, the primal iteration sequence generated by the ALM enjoys an\nasymptotic Q-superlinear convergence rate under a second order sufficient\ncondition {for the primal problem}. This second order sufficient condition\nimplies that the primal problem has a unique solution, which can be restrictive\nin many applications. For gaining more insightful interpretations on the high\nefficiency of these solvers, in this paper we conduct an asymptotic superlinear\nconvergence analysis of the ALM for convex SDP when the primal problem has\nmultiple solutions (can be unbounded). Under a fairly mild second order growth\ncondition, we prove that the primal iteration sequence generated by the ALM\nconverges asymptotically Q-superlinearly, while the dual feasibility and the\ndual objective function value converge asymptotically R-superlinearly.\nMoreover, by studying the metric subregularity of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker\nsolution mapping, we also provide sufficient conditions to guarantee the\nasymptotic R-superlinear convergence of the dual iterate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2016 07:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

They are detected almost everywhere in the ISM, as well\nas in comets. In the past, they have been used to constrain the age of some\nmolecular clouds, since their abundance is predicted to be a strong function of\ntime. We present an extensive study of the cyanopolyynes distribution in the\nsolar-type protostar IRAS16293-2422 based on TIMASSS IRAM-30m observations. The\ngoals are (i) to obtain a census of the cyanopolyynes in this source and of\ntheir isotopologues; (ii) to derive how their abundance varies across the\nprotostar envelope; and (iii) to obtain constraints on the history of\nIRAS16293-2422. We detect several lines from HC3N and HC5N, and report the\nfirst detection of DC3N, in a solar-type protostar. We found that the HC3N\nabundance is roughly constant (~1.3x10^(-11)) in the outer cold envelope of\nIRAS16293-2422, and it increases by about a factor 100 in the inner region\nwhere Tdust>80K. The HC5N has an abundance similar to HC3N in the outer\nenvelope and about a factor of ten lower in the inner region. The HC3N\nabundance derived in the inner region, and where the increase occurs, also\nprovide strong constraints on the time taken for the dust to warm up to 80K,\nwhich has to be shorter than ~10^3-10^4yr. Finally, the cyanoacetylene\ndeuteration is about 50\\% in the outer envelope and <5$\\% in the warm inner\nregion. The relatively low deuteration in the warm region suggests that we are\nwitnessing a fossil of the HC3N abundantly formed in the tenuous phase of the\npre-collapse and then frozen into the grain mantles at a later phase. The\naccurate analysis of the cyanopolyynes in IRAS16293-2422 unveils an important\npart of its past story. It tells us that IRAS16293-2422 underwent a relatively\nfast (<10^5yr) collapse and a very fast (<10^3-10^4yr) warming up of the cold\nmaterial to 80K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2016 07:36:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

It is hence of considerable interest to examine\nthe adiabatic following dynamics in periodically driven non-Hermitian systems.\nWe show in this work the possibility of piecewise adiabatic following\ninterrupted by hopping between instantaneous system eigenstates. This\nphenomenon is first observed in a computational model and then theoretically\nexplained, using an exactly solvable model, in terms of the Stokes phenomenon.\nIn the latter case, the piecewise adiabatic following is shown to be a genuine\ncritical behavior and the precise phase boundary in the parameter space is\nlocated. Interestingly, the critical boundary for piecewise adiabatic following\nis found to be unrelated to the domain for exceptional points. To characterize\nthe adiabatic following dynamics, we also advocate a simple definition of the\nAharonov-Anandan (AA) phase for non-unitary cyclic dynamics, which always\nyields real AA phases. In the slow driving limit, the AA phase reduces to the\nBerry phase if adiabatic following persists throughout the driving without\nhopping, but oscillates violently and does not approach any limit in cases of\npiecewise adiabatic following.

They may hold\ncrucial information for our understanding of many key issues (i.e., census of\nbaryonic and dark matter, star formation in the low density regime, mass\nfunction). The most massive examples - the so called giant LSBGs - can be as\nmassive as the Milky Way, but with this mass being distributed in a much larger\ndisk. Malin 1 is an iconic giant LSBG, perhaps the largest disk galaxy known.\nWe attempt to bring new insights on its structure and evolution on the basis of\nnew images covering a wide range in wavelength. We have computed surface\nbrightness profiles (and average surface brightnesses in 16 regions of\ninterest), in six photometric bands (FUV, NUV, u, g, i, z). We compared these\ndata to various models, testing a variety of assumptions concerning the\nformation and evolution of Malin 1. We find that the surface brightness and\ncolor profiles can be reproduced by a long and quiet star-formation history due\nto the low surface density; no significant event, such as a collision, is\nnecessary. Such quiet star formation across the giant disk is obtained in a\ndisk model calibrated for the Milky Way, but with an angular momentum\napproximately 20 times larger. Signs of small variations of the star-formation\nhistory are indicated by the diversity of ages found when different regions\nwithin the galaxy are intercompared.For the first time, panchromatic images of\nMalin 1 are used to constrain the stellar populations and the history of this\niconic example among giant LSBGs. Based on our model, the extreme disk of Malin\n1 is found to have a long history of relatively low star formation (about 2\nMsun/yr). Our model allows us to make predictions on its stellar mass and\nmetallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2016 10:14:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

This central\nproblem of functional data analysis is well known to be ill-posed, thus\nrequiring a regularised estimation procedure. The two most commonly used\napproaches are based on spectral truncation or Tikhonov regularisation of the\nempirical covariance operator. In principle, Tikhonov regularisation is the\nmore canonical choice. Compared to spectral truncation, it is robust to\neigenvalue ties, while it attains the optimal minimax rate of convergence in\nthe mean squared sense, and not just in a concentration probability sense. In\nthis paper, we show that, surprisingly, one can strictly improve upon the\nperformance of the Tikhonov estimator in finite samples by means of a linear\nestimator, while retaining its stability and asymptotic properties by combining\nit with a form of spectral truncation. Specifically, we construct an estimator\nthat additively decomposes the functional covariate by projecting it onto two\northogonal subspaces defined via functional PCA; it then applies Tikhonov\nregularisation to the one component, while leaving the other component\nunregularised. We prove that when the covariate is Gaussian, this hybrid\nestimator uniformly improves upon the MSE of the Tikhonov estimator in a\nnon-asymptotic sense, effectively rendering it inadmissible. This domination is\nshown to also persist under discrete observation of the covariate function. The\nhybrid estimator is linear, straightforward to construct in practice, and with\nno computational overhead relative to the standard regularisation methods. By\nmeans of simulation, it is shown to furnish sizeable gains even for modest\nsample sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2016 12:37:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

We measured their magnetic\nactivity properties using the observations collected by the Kepler satellite\nand the ground-based, high-resolution HERMES spectrograph. The photospheric\n(Sph) and chromospheric (S) magnetic activity proxies of these seismic solar\nanalogs are compared in relation to the solar activity. We show that the\nactivity of the Sun is comparable to the activity of the seismic solar analogs,\nwithin the maximum-to-minimum temporal variations of the 11-year solar activity\ncycle. Furthermore, we report on the discovery of temporal variability in the\nacoustic frequencies of the young (1 Gyr-old) solar analog KIC10644253 with a\nmodulation of about 1.5 years, which agrees with the derived photospheric\nactivity Sph (Salabert et al, 2016b). It could be the signature of the\nshort-period modulation, or quasi-biennal oscillation, of its magnetic activity\nas observed in the Sun and in the 1-Gyr-old solar analog HD30495. In addition,\nthe lithium abundance and the chromospheric activity estimated from HERMES\nconfirms that KIC10644253 is a young and more active star than the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2016 13:44:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

Results: The adaptive filter decreased mean breast dose by a\nfactor of 1.6-2.2 depending on the tube voltage. To maintain image quality, the\ntube output was increased by these factors when adaptive filter was used. The\nadaptive filter provided uniform volume distribution of dose at 40 kVp and 60\nkVp tube voltages, but the distribution was non-uniform at 90 kVp and 120 kVp\ntube voltages. Conclusion: While adaptive filtration helps with detector\ndynamic range, CT number uniformity, and CT noise uniformity, the volume\nnon-uniformity of the dose with adaptive filter depends on tube voltage. On the\nother hand, at the same average breast dose, volume non-uniformity of the dose\nwith adaptive filter was not higher that that without adaptive filter. The\nresults allowed also to determine necessary dose increase factor to compensate\nfor x-ray absorption in the adaptive filter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2016 14:24:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 01:03:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2017 12:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

Through the simplifications, the computational efficiency of\nthe higher-order scheme is increased significantly.

This indicates that, when one suddenly changes the\n$s$-wave pairing interaction to an appropriate $p$-wave one by using a Feshbach\ntechnique in this case, a non-vanishing $p$-wave superfluid order parameter is\nimmediately obtained, which is given by the product of the $p$-wave interaction\nand the $p$-wave pair amplitude that has already been induced in the\nspin-imbalanced $s$-wave superfluid Fermi gas.

The\nresults obtained from the $N/D$ method for the partial-wave amplitude are\nrigorous, since now the discontinuities along the left-hand cut and right-hand\ncut are exactly known. This solves the open question with respect to the $N/D$\nmethod and the effect on the final result of the non-perturbative iterative\ndiagrams in the evaluation of $\\Delta(A)$. A big advantage of the method is\nthat short-range physics (corresponding to integrated out degrees of freedom\nwithin low-energy Effective Field Theory) does not contribute to $\\Delta(A)$\nand it manifests through the extra subtractions that are implemented within the\nmethod. We show the equivalence of the $N/D$ method and the Lippmann-Schwinger\n(LS) equation for a nonsingular $^1S_0$ $NN$ potential (Yukawa potential).

Multiple valence, spin, and coordination states of iron in\nbridgmanite and post-perovskite are difficult to resolve with conventional\nspin-probing techniques. Optical spectroscopy, on the other hand, is sensitive\nto high/low spin ferrous/ferric iron at different sites; thus, it can be a\npowerful probe for spin transitions.

Together with available information on the\nelectronic structure of Fe3+O6-compounds, we constrain the spin-pairing energy\nof Fe3+ in an octahedral field to ~ 20000-23000 cm-1.

However, the\nconvergence of such an iteration scheme arising out of a matrix splitting is\npractically very slow in many cases. Thus, works on improving the speed of the\niteration scheme have attracted great interest. In this direction, comparison\nof the rate of convergence of the iteration schemes produced by two matrix\nsplittings is very useful. But, in the case of matrices having many matrix\nsplittings, this process is time-consuming. The main goal of the current\narticle is to provide a solution to the above issue by using proper\nmultisplittings. To this end, we propose a few comparison theorems for proper\nweak regular splittings and proper nonnegative splittings first. We then derive\nconvergence and comparison theorems for proper multisplittings with the help of\nthe theory of proper weak regular splittings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2016 15:43:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

General observation is that the motion artifacts\nchange the statistics of the acquired PPG signal. Consequently, estimation of\nHR from such a corrupted PPG signal is challenging. However, if an\naccelerometer is also used to acquire the acceleration signal simultaneously,\nit can provide helpful information that can be used to reduce the motion\nartifacts in the PPG signal. By dint of repetitive movements of the subjects\nhands while running, the accelerometer signal is found to be quasi-periodic.\nOver short-time intervals, it can be modeled by a finite harmonic sum (HSUM).\nUsing the harmonic sum (HSUM) model, we obtain an estimate of the instantaneous\nfundamental frequency of the accelerometer signal. Since the PPG signal is a\ncomposite of the heart rate information (that is also quasi-periodic) and the\nmotion artifact, we fit a joint harmonic sum (HSUM) model to the PPG signal.\nOne of the harmonic sums corresponds to the heart-beat component in PPG and the\nother models the motion artifact. However, the fundamental frequency of the\nmotion artifact has already been determined from the accelerometer signal.\nSubsequently, the HR is estimated from the joint HSUM model.
