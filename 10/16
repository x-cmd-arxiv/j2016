This model is referred to as\nthe Union of Polyhedral Cones (UOPC) model. Similar to the Union of Subspaces\n(UOS) model where each data from each subspace is generated from a (unknown)\nbasis, in the UOPC model each data from each cone is assumed to be generated\nfrom a finite number of (unknown) \\emph{extreme rays}.To cluster data under\nthis model, we consider several algorithms - (a) Sparse Subspace Clustering by\nNon-negative constraints Lasso (NCL), (b) Least squares approximation (LSA),\nand (c) K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm to arrive at affinity between data\npoints. Spectral Clustering (SC) is then applied on the resulting affinity\nmatrix to cluster data into different polyhedral cones. We show that on an\naverage KNN outperforms both NCL and LSA and for this algorithm we provide the\ndeterministic conditions for correct clustering. For an affinity measure\nbetween the cones it is shown that as long as the cones are not very coherent\nand as long as the density of data within each cone exceeds a threshold, KNN\nleads to accurate clustering. Finally, simulation results on real datasets\n(MNIST and YaleFace datasets) depict that the proposed algorithm works well on\nreal data indicating the utility of the UOPC model and the proposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2016 16:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-03"}

By comparing hydrodynamical simulations at different resolutions (300,\n30, 3 pc) using a Bondi-Hoyle approximation to sub-parsec runs with\nnon-parameterized accretion, our aim is to probe how well an approximated Bondi\naccretion is able to capture the BH accretion physics and the subsequent\nfeedback on the galaxy.

In managed languages like Java or\nJavaScript, however, this space-time tradeoff is complex. Using more space\ntranslates into higher garbage collection costs, especially at the limit of\navailable memory. Existing runtime systems provide limited support for\nspace-sensitive algorithms, forcing programmers into difficult and often\nbrittle choices about provisioning.\n  This paper presents prioritized garbage collection, a cooperative programming\nlanguage and runtime solution to this problem. Prioritized GC provides an\ninterface similar to soft references, called priority references, which\nidentify objects that the collector can reclaim eagerly if necessary. The key\ndifference is an API for defining the policy that governs when priority\nreferences are cleared and in what order. Application code specifies a priority\nvalue for each reference and a target memory bound. The collector reclaims\nreferences, lowest priority first, until the total memory footprint of the\ncache fits within the bound.

The\npremise behind the latter genre is that the data samples are obtained via\nlinear transformation of latent representations that are easy to cluster; but\nin practice, the transformation from the latent space to the data can be more\ncomplicated. In this work, we assume that this transformation is an unknown and\npossibly nonlinear function. To recover the `clustering-friendly' latent\nrepresentations and to better cluster the data, we propose a joint DR and\nK-means clustering approach in which DR is accomplished via learning a deep\nneural network (DNN). The motivation is to keep the advantages of jointly\noptimizing the two tasks, while exploiting the deep neural network's ability to\napproximate any nonlinear function. This way, the proposed approach can work\nwell for a broad class of generative models.

For slow noise, the correlation time, \\tau_c, of J(t) is\nmuch longer than the characteristic time of the transition. Existing theory for\nthis case suggests that the average transition probability is the result of\naveraging of the conventional Landau-Zener probability, calculated for a given\nconstant J, over the distribution of J. We calculate a finite-\\tau_c correction\nto this classical result. Our main finding is that this correction is dominated\nby sparse realizations of noise for which J(t) passes through zero within a\nnarrow time interval near the level crossing. Two models of noise, random\ntelegraph noise and gaussian noise, are considered. Naturally, in both models\nthe average probability of transition decreases upon decreasing \\tau_c.

Many quantum systems of\nphysical interest can be represented as high-dimensional low rank density\nmatrices. A popular problem in {\\it quantum state tomography} (QST) is to\nestimate the unknown low rank density matrix of a quantum system by conducting\nPauli measurements. Our main contribution is twofold. First, we establish the\nminimax lower bounds in Schatten $p$-norms with $1\\leq p\\leq +\\infty$ for low\nrank density matrices estimation by Pauli measurements.

In our previous papers, we studied the least squares estimator\nand the projection estimator, where we proved the optimal convergence rates for\nthe least squares estimator in Schatten $p$-norms with $1\\leq p\\leq 2$ and,\nunder a stronger condition, the optimal convergence rates for the projection\nestimator in Schatten $p$-norms with $1\\leq p\\leq +\\infty$. In this paper, we\nshow that the results of these two distinct estimators can be simultaneously\nobtained by the Dantzig estimator. Moreover, better convergence rates in\nSchatten norm distances can be proved for Dantzig estimator under conditions\nweaker than those needed in previous papers.

Given the importance of ApoA-I in\nHDL and cholesterol transport, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of\nApoA-I adsorption and the associated structural changes for assessing\nconsequences of ENM exposure. Here, we used a comprehensive array of\nmicroscopic and spectroscopic tools to elucidate the interactions between\nApoA-I and 100 nm Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) with four different surface\nfunctional groups. We found that the protein adsorption and secondary\nstructural changes are highly dependent on the surface functionality. Our\nelectrochemical studies provided new evidence for charge transfer interactions\nthat influence ApoA-I unfolding. While the unfolding of ApoA-I on AgNPs did not\nsignificantly modify their cellular uptake and short-term cytotoxicity, we\nobserved that it strongly altered the ability of only some AgNPs to generate\nreactive oxygen species in macrophages. Our results shed new light on the\nimportance of surface functionality and charge transfer interactions in\nbiocorona formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2016 11:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-18"}

Then by using image\nmatting algorithms, the system extracts the semantic information such as faces,\nlips, teeth, eyes, eyebrows, etc., from the extracted foregrounds of the source\nimage. And, then the color is transferred between corresponding parts with the\nsame semantic information. Next we get the color transferred result by\nseamlessly compositing different parts together using alpha blending. In the\nfinal step, we present an efficient method of color consistency to optimize the\ncolor of a collection of images showing the common scene. The main advantage of\nour method over existing techniques is that it does not need face matching, as\none could use more than one target images.

Moreover, our\nalgorithm does not require to choose the same color style, same pose and image\nsize between source and target images.
