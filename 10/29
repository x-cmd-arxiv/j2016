In the early stages\nof growth (lag phase), and when subjected to a constant stationary shear, the\nviscosity slowly increases with the cell's population. As the bacteria reach\nthe exponential phase of growth, the viscosity increases rapidly, with sudden\nand temporary abrupt decreases and recoveries. At a certain stage,\ncorresponding grossly to the late phase of growth, when the population\nstabilises, the viscosity also keeps its maximum constant value, with drops and\nrecoveries, for a long period of time. This complex rheological behaviour,\nwhich was observed to be shear strain dependent, is a consequence of two\ncoupled effects: the cell density continuous increase and its changing\ninteracting properties. Particular attention was given to the late phase of\ngrowth of E. coli populations under shear. Rheo-imaging measurements revealed,\nnear the static plate, a rotational motion of E. coli aggregates, collectively\ntumbling and flowing in the shear direction. To explain this behaviour, we\nintroduce a simple theoretical model, in which the individual cells are\ntransported by the flow, but remain rigidly attached to the other cells of the\naggregate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 16:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

However,\nneither hydrodynamics nor friction has successfully explained the full range of\nflow phenomena in concentrated suspensions. Particles with asperities represent\na case in point. Lubrication hydrodynamics fail to completely capture two key\nrheological properties - namely, that the viscosity increases drastically and\nthe first normal stress difference can switch signs as volume fraction\nincreases. Yet, simulations that account for interparticle friction are also\nunable to fully predict these properties. Furthermore, experiments show that\nrheological behavior can vary depending on particle roughness and\ndeformability. We seek to resolve these apparent contradictions by\nsystematically tuning the roughness of model colloids, investigating their\nviscosity and first normal stress differences under steady shear, and finally\ngenerating a rheological state diagram that demonstrates how surface roughness\ninfluences the transition between shear thickening and dilatancy. Our\nsimulations, which are in good agreement with the experiments, suggest that\nfriction between rough particles is significant. In addition, we find that\nroughness progressively lowers the critical conditions required for the onset\nof shear thickening and dilatancy. Our results thus provides a major\ncontribution in the field of suspension rheology with broad relevance to\ngranular and particulate materials. For instance, particle geometry can be\ntuned to increase the efficacy of materials that turn solid-like on the\napplication of stimuli. On the other hand, engineers who work with concentrated\nslurries can now use images of the constituent particles to estimate optimal\nflow processing conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 17:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

This result implies among other things that a phase\ntransition occurs at c = 14/15 for the connectedness of the loops that touch\n$l$.\n  Our results can be viewed as an extension of some of the results in our\nearlier paper in the following two directions: There, a loop-soup cluster was\nconditioned on its entire outer boundary while we discover here only part of\nthis boundary. And, while it was explained there that the strong decomposition\nusing a Poisson point process of excursions that we derived there should be\nspecific to the case of the critical loop-soup, we show here that in the\nsubcritical cases, a weaker property involving the conformal restriction\nproperty nevertheless holds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 18:42:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2016 22:27:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 11 Nov 2018 22:38:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-13"}

We focus on the role of the viscosity ratio U (between\nthe ambient fluid and the plume fluid) in determining the plume structure and\ndynamics. In our experiments, we are able to capture geophysical convection\nregimes relevant to mantle convection both for hot spots (when U > 1) and\nplate-subduction (when U < 1) regimes. The planar laser induced fluorescence\n(PLIF) technique is used for flow visualization and characterizing the plume\nstructures. The convection is driven by compositional buoyancy generated by the\nperfusion of lighter fluid across a permeable mesh and the viscosity ratio U is\nsystematically varied over a range from 1/300 to 2500. The planform, near the\nbottom boundary for U=1, exhibits a well-known dendritic line plume structure.\nAs the value of U is increased, a progressive morphological transition is\nobserved from the dendritic-plume structure to discrete spherical plumes,\naccompanied with thickening of the plumes and an increase in the plume spacing.\nIn the vertical section, mushroom-shaped plume heads at U=1 change into\nintermittent spherical-blob shaped plumes at high U, resembling mantle plume\nhot spots in mantle convection. In contrast, for low values of U (~1/300), the\nregime corresponds to subduction of plates in the mantle. In this regime, we\nobserve for the first time that plumes arise from a thick boundary with\ncellular structure and develop into sheet-plumes.

This requires a good\nunderstanding of the obscurer and biases introduced by incomplete follow-up\nobservations.

Subsequent analysis showed that at ~1.5\nEarth radii there is a transition from a population of predominantly rocky\nsuper-Earths to non-rocky sub-Neptunes, which must have substantial volatile\nenvelopes. Determining the origin of these highly irradiated rocky planets will\nbe critical to our understanding of low-mass planet formation and the frequency\nof potentially habitable Earth-like planets.

Using models of atmospheric\nphoto-evaporation, we show that if most bare rocky planets are the evaporated\ncores of sub-Neptunes then the transition radius should decrease as surveys\npush to longer orbital periods, since on wider orbits only planets with smaller\nless massive cores can be stripped. On the other hand, if most rocky planets\nformed after their disks dissipate then these planets will have formed without\ninitial gaseous envelopes. In this case, we use N-body simulations of planet\nformation to show that the transition radius should increase with orbital\nperiod, due to the increasing solid mass available in their disks.

In\nthis article, we analyze the tracking performance of commodity leveraged ETFs\nand discuss the associated trading strategies. It is known that leveraged ETF\nreturns typically deviate from their tracking target over longer holding\nhorizons due to the so-called volatility decay. This motivates us to construct\na benchmark process that accounts for the volatility decay, and use it to\nexamine the tracking performance of commodity leveraged ETFs. From empirical\ndata, we find that many commodity leveraged ETFs underperform significantly\nagainst the benchmark, and we quantify such a discrepancy via the novel idea of\n\\emph{realized effective fee}.

Why are two different mechanisms used to perform the same\nfunction? Systematic analysis, without parameter fitting, of kinetic models of\nthe rotary, alternating access and other possible mechanisms suggest that, when\nthe ratio of protons transported per ATP hydrolyzed exceeds one, the\none-at-a-time proton transport by the rotary mechanism is faster than other\npossible mechanisms across a wide range of driving conditions. When the ratio\nis one, there is no intrinsic difference in the free energy landscape between\nmechanisms, and therefore all mechanisms can exhibit the same kinetic\nperformance.

Our analysis suggests a possible explanation for this apparent\nrelationship between coupling ratio and mechanism. When the conditions under\nwhich the pump must operate permit a coupling ratio greater than one, the\nrotary mechanism may have been selected for its kinetic advantage.

The special case of triangle counting has received much\nattention. Getting results for 4-vertex or 5-vertex patterns is highly\nchallenging, and there are few practical results known that can scale to\nmassive sizes.\n  We introduce an algorithmic framework that can be adopted to count any small\npattern in a graph and apply this framework to compute exact counts for\n\\emph{all} 5-vertex subgraphs. Our framework is built on cutting a pattern into\nsmaller ones, and using counts of smaller patterns to get larger counts.\nFurthermore, we exploit degree orientations of the graph to reduce runtimes\neven further. These methods avoid the combinatorial explosion that typical\nsubgraph counting algorithms face. We prove that it suffices to enumerate only\nfour specific subgraphs (three of them have less than 5 vertices) to exactly\ncount all 5-vertex patterns.\n  We perform extensive empirical experiments on a variety of real-world graphs.\nWe are able to compute counts of graphs with tens of millions of edges in\nminutes on a commodity machine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\npractical algorithm for $5$-vertex pattern counting that runs at this scale.

PKS 1510-089 is one of only a few flat spectrum radio quasars\ndetected in the VHE (very-high-energy, > 100 GeV) gamma-ray band. Aims. We\nstudy the broadband spectral and temporal properties of the PKS 1510-089\nemission during a high gamma-ray state. Methods. We performed VHE gamma-ray\nobservations of PKS 1510-089 with the MAGIC telescopes during a long high\ngamma-ray state in May 2015. In order to perform broadband modelling of the\nsource, we have also gathered contemporaneous multiwavelength data in radio,\nIR, optical photometry and polarization, UV, X-ray and GeV gamma-ray ranges. We\nconstruct a broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) in two periods,\nselected according to VHE gamma-ray state. Results. PKS 1510-089 has been\ndetected by MAGIC during a few day-long observations performed in the middle of\na long, high optical and gamma-ray state, showing for the first time a\nsignificant VHE gamma-ray variability. Similarly to the optical and gamma-ray\nhigh state of the source detected in 2012, it was accompanied by a rotation of\nthe optical polarization angle and the emission of a new jet component observed\nin radio. However, due to large uncertainty on the knot separation time, the\nassociation with the VHE gamma-ray emission cannot be firmly established. The\nspectral shape in the VHE band during the flare is similar to the ones obtained\nduring previous measurements of the source. The observed flux variability sets\nfor the first time constraints on the size of the region from which VHE gamma\nrays are emitted. We model the broadband SED in the framework of the external\nCompton scenario and discuss the possible emission site in view of\nmultiwavelength data and alternative emission models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 22:05:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 15:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-09"}

In this paper we aim\nto address this gap by studying the problem of recovering a dynamically\nevolving low-rank matrix from incomplete observations. First, we propose the\nlocally weighted matrix smoothing (LOWEMS) framework as one possible approach\nto dynamic matrix recovery. We then establish error bounds for LOWEMS in both\nthe {\\em matrix sensing} and {\\em matrix completion} observation models. Our\nresults quantify the potential benefits of exploiting dynamic constraints both\nin terms of recovery accuracy and sample complexity.

The first method is an\ninteractive protocol (TQA') based on teleportation. The second method is a\nnoninteractive protocol (QA) in which the sender first encrypts the message\nusing a protocol QEnc and then encodes the quantum ciphertext with an error\ncorrecting code chosen secretly from a set (a purity test code (PTC)).\nEncryption was shown to be necessary for authentication.\n  We augment the protocol QA with an extra step which recycles the entire\nencryption key provided QA accepts the message. We analyze the resulting\nintegrated protocol for quantum authentication and key generation, which we\ncall QA+KG. Our main result is a proof that QA+KG is universal composably (UC)\nsecure in the Ben-Or-Mayers model (quant-ph/0409062). More specifically, this\nimplies the UC-security of (a) QA, (b) recycling of the encryption key in QA,\nand (c) key-recycling of the encryption scheme QEnc by appending PTC. For an\nm-qubit message, encryption requires 2m bits of key; but PTC can be performed\nusing only O(log m) + O(log e) bits of key for probability of failure e. Thus,\nwe reduce the key required for both QA and QEnc, from linear to logarithmic net\nconsumption, at the expense of one bit of back communication which can happen\nany time after the conclusion of QA and before reusing the key. UC-security of\nQA also extends security to settings not obvious from quant-ph/0205128.\n  Our security proof structure is inspired by and similar to that of\nquant-ph/0205128, reducing the security of QA to that of TQA'. In the process,\nwe define UC-secure entanglement, and prove the UC-security of the entanglement\ngenerating protocol given in quant-ph/0205128, which could be of independent\ninterest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2016 01:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-01"}

More precisely, we\nfocus on two features related to the power of interactions: omission failures\nand one-way communications. An omission failure, a notion that this paper\nintroduces for the first time in the context of PP, is the loss by one or both\nparties of the information transmitted in an interaction. The failure may or\nmay not be detected by either party. On the other hand, in one-way models,\ncommunication happens only in one direction: only one of the two agents can\nchange its state depending on both agents' states, and the other agent may or\nmay not be aware of the interaction. These notions can be combined, obtaining\none-way protocols with (possibly detectable) omission failures.\n  A general question is what additional power is necessary and sufficient to\ncompletely overcome the weakness of one-way protocols and enable them to\nsimulate two-way protocols, with and without omission failures. As a basic\nfeature, a simulator needs to implement an atomic communication of states\nbetween two agents; this task is further complicated by the anonymity of the\nagents, their lack of knowledge of the system, and the limited amount of memory\nthat they may have.\n  We provide the first answers to these questions by presenting and analyzing\nseveral simulators, i.e., wrapper protocols converting any protocol for the\nstandard two-way model into one running on a weaker one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2016 01:25:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 20:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

The\ndevelopment of energy gaps were clearly observed below the phase transition\ntemperatures in optical conductivity, which removes most part of the free\ncarrier spectral weight. Time resolved measurement demonstrated the emergence\nof strong oscillations upon entering the CDW states, which were illuminated to\ncome from the amplitude mode of CDW collective excitations. The frequencies of\nthem are surprisingly low: only 0.12 THz for the CDW order with higher\ntransition temperature and 0.34 THz for the lower one, which shall be caused by\ntheir small modulation wave vectors. Furthermore, the amplitude and relaxation\ntime of photoinduced reflectivity stayed unchanged across the two phase\ntransitions, which might be connected to the extremely low energy scales of\namplitude modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2016 07:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-16"}

Hence, authors limit themselves to\nmodelling of one half of the fracture. In our work we demonstrate that the case\nof a symmetrical fracture occurs only in a homogeneous reservoir with constant\nphysical parameters and confining {\\it in situ} stress. Otherwise,\ninhomogeneity in the stress or the rock permeability can significantly change\nthe dynamics of the fracture propagation. The mathematical model of the\nhydraulic fracturing used in the paper is adopted from our earlier work\n\\cite{Golovin_Baykin_2016_Pore}. In present paper we perform numerical\nexperiments demonstrating that in case of non-constant confining stress or\nreservoir permeability the fracture is developing non-symmetrically. An\nimportant role is played by the action of the backstress that is formed near\nthe fracture due to the pore pressure. To support this observation we give a\nformal definition of the backstress and compare the values of the backstress\nacting on the two different fracture wings. These numerical experiments\nunderline the importance of the proper modelling of the interaction between\npore and fracturing fluids for the correct simulation of the hydraulic\nfracturing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2016 07:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-01"}

The channel energy functions are obtained as\nfunctions of local image intensities, first or second order clique phase\ndifference and a threshold scaling parameter dependent on the input noise\nlevel. Whereas the expectation of the individual energy functions with respect\nto the noise distribution in clique phase differences is to be maximized for\noptimal filtering, the expectation of tissue energy function decreases and\nnoise energy function increases with increase in threshold scale parameter.

They\npromised enormous rewards to the last survivors at the expense of those died\nearly. And, while this design appealed to the gambling instinc}, it is a\nsuboptimal way to generate retirement income. Indeed, actuarially-fair life\nannuities making constant payments -- where the insurance company is exposed to\nlongevity risk -- induce greater lifetime utility. However, tontines do not\nhave to be structured the historical way, i.e. with a constant cash flow shared\namongst a shrinking group of survivors. Moreover, insurance companies do not\nsell actuarially-fair life annuities, in part due to aggregate longevity risk.\n  We derive the tontine structure that maximizes lifetime utility. Technically\nspeaking we solve the Euler-Lagrange equation and examine its sensitivity to\n(i.) the size of the tontine pool $n$, and (ii.) individual longevity risk\naversion $\\gamma$. We examine how the optimal tontine varies with $\\gamma$ and\n$n$, and prove some qualitative theorems about the optimal payout.\nInterestingly, Lorenzo de Tonti's original structure is optimal in the limit as\nlongevity risk aversion $\\gamma \\to \\infty$. We define the natural tontine as\nthe function for which the payout declines in exact proportion to the survival\nprobabilities, which we show is near-optimal for all $\\gamma$ and $n$. We\nconclude by comparing the utility of optimal tontines to the utility of loaded\nlife annuities under reasonable demographic and economic conditions and find\nthat the life annuity's advantage over the optimal tontine is minimal.\n  In sum, this paper's contribution is to (i.) rekindle a discussion about a\nretirement income product that has been long neglected, and (ii.) leverage\neconomic theory as well as tools from mathematical finance to design the next\ngeneration of tontine annuities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Oct 2016 19:51:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-01"}

Two kinds\nof evolutionary models are constructed, which describe local and global\nredistribution of income respectively. In the local model, players have to pay\npart of their income after each PGG and the accumulated income is redistributed\nto the members. While in the global model, all the players pay part of their\nincome after engaging in all the local PGGs, which are centered on himself and\nhis nearest neighbours, and the accumulated income is redistributed to the\nwhole population. We show that the cooperation prospers significantly with\nincreasing income expenditure proportion in the local redistribution of income,\nwhile in the global model the situation is opposite.
