We support this speculation by considering scalar-tensor\ntheories, for which we find two new types of memory: the T memory and the S\nmemory, which contribute to the tensor and scalar components of gravitational\nwave, respectively.

Our methods are easy to\nimplement and widely applicable so they should be of interest to the broader\nsports community. We demonstrate our methods in analyses of both NBA and NHL\nmetrics. Our results indicate the most reliable metrics and highlight how they\nshould be used by sports analysts. The meta-metrics also provide useful\ninsights about how to best construct new metrics which provide independent and\nreliable information about athletes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 17:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-03"}

Profiles of metallicity and surface-brightness in the stellar halo\ntypically flatten from z = 1 to the present.

However, if we simply add the univalence axiom to type theory,\nthen we lose the property of canonicity - that every closed term computes to a\ncanonical form. A computation becomes `stuck' when it reaches the point that it\nneeds to evaluate a proof term that is an application of the univalence axiom.\nSo we wish to find a way to compute with the univalence axiom. While this\nproblem has been solved with the formulation of cubical type theory, where the\ncomputations are expressed using a nominal extension of lambda-calculus, it may\nbe interesting to explore alternative solutions, which do not require such an\nextension.\n  As a first step, we present here a system of propositional higher-order\nminimal logic (PHOML). There are three kinds of typing judgement in PHOML.\nThere are terms which inhabit types, which are the simple types over $\\Omega$.\nThere are proofs which inhabit propositions, which are the terms of type\n$\\Omega$. The canonical propositions are those constructed from $\\bot$ by\nimplication $\\supset$. Thirdly, there are paths which inhabit equations $M =_A\nN$, where $M$ and $N$ are terms of type $A$. There are two ways to prove an\nequality: reflexivity, and propositional extensionality - logically equivalent\npropositions are equal. This system allows for some definitional equalities\nthat are not present in cubical type theory, namely that transport along the\ntrivial path is identity.\n  We present a call-by-name reduction relation for this system, and prove that\nthe system satisfies canonicity: every closed typable term head-reduces to a\ncanonical form.

Foreign substances\nalmost always aid water freezing through heterogeneous ice nucleation, but the\nmolecular details of this process remain largely unknown. In fact, insight into\nthe microscopic mechanism of ice formation on different substrates is difficult\nto obtain even via state-of-the-art experimental techniques. At the same time,\natomistic simulations of heterogeneous ice nucleation frequently face\nextraordinary challenges due to the complexity of the water-substrate\ninteraction and the long timescales that characterize nucleation events. Here,\nwe have investigated several aspects of molecular dynamics simulations of\nheterogeneous ice nucleation considering as a prototypical ice nucleating\nmaterial the clay mineral kaolinite, which is of relevance in atmospheric\nscience. We show via seeded molecular dynamics simulations that ice nucleation\non the hydroxylated (001) face of kaolinite proceeds exclusively via the\nformation of the hexagonal ice polytype. The critical nucleus size is two times\nsmaller than that obtained for homogeneous nucleation at the same supercooling.\nPrevious findings suggested that the flexibility of the kaolinite surface can\nalter the time scale for ice nucleation within molecular dynamics simulations.\nHowever, we here demonstrate that equally flexible (or non flexible) kaolinite\nsurfaces can lead to very different outcomes in terms of ice formation,\naccording to whether or not the surface relaxation of the clay is taken into\naccount.

Additionally, one CVD-grown WSe2 monolayer on sapphire is\nincluded in this study for direct comparison with its exfoliated counterpart.\nTime-resolved micro-photoluminescence shows how radiative decay times strongly\ndiffer for different substrate materials. Our data indicates exciton-exciton\nannihilation as a shortening mechanism at room temperature, and subtle trends\nin the decay rates in correlation to the dielectric environment at cryogenic\ntemperatures. On the measureable time scales, trends are also related to the\nextent of the respective 2D-excitonic modes' appearance. This result highlights\nthe importance of further detailed characterization of exciton features in 2D\nmaterials, particularly with respect to the choice of substrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2016 00:15:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

More specifically, we employ the framework of the\nresidual neural networks to model the temporal closeness, period, and trend\nproperties of the crowd traffic, respectively. For each property, we design a\nbranch of residual convolutional units, each of which models the spatial\nproperties of the crowd traffic. ST-ResNet learns to dynamically aggregate the\noutput of the three residual neural networks based on data, assigning different\nweights to different branches and regions. The aggregation is further combined\nwith external factors, such as weather and day of the week, to predict the\nfinal traffic of crowds in each and every region. We evaluate ST-ResNet based\non two types of crowd flows in Beijing and NYC, finding that its performance\nexceeds six well-know methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2016 03:56:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 09:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

Recently a similar\nphenomenon has been observed in some electronic phases of quantum materials\nrelated to high temperature superconductivity, particularly in the Fe-based\nsuperconductors. While several experiments have probed nematic fluctuations,\nthey have been primarily restricted to the uniform nematic susceptibility, i.e.\nq = 0 fluctuations. Here, we investigate the behavior of finite-momentum\nnematic fluctuations by measuring transverse acoustic phonon modes with\nwavelengths of up to 25 unit cells in the prototypical Fe-based compound\nBa(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$. While the slope of the phonon dispersion gives\ninformation about the uniform nematic susceptibility, deviations from this\nlinear behavior at finite but small wave-vectors are attributed to\nfinite-momentum nematic fluctuations. Surprisingly, these non-zero q\nfluctuations lead to a softening of the phonon mode below the superconducting\ntransition temperature, in contrast to the behavior of the phonon velocity at q\n= 0, which increases below $T_c$.

In\nthis paper we utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze sequence\ncharacteristics of prokaryotic and eukaryotic promoters and build their\npredictive models. We trained the same CNN architecture on promoters of four\nvery distant organisms: human, plant (Arabidopsis), and two bacteria\n(Escherichia coli and Mycoplasma pneumonia). We found that CNN trained on\nsigma70 subclass of Escherichia coli promoter gives an excellent classification\nof promoters and non-promoter sequences (Sn=0.90, Sp=0.96, CC=0.84). The\nBacillus subtilis promoters identification CNN model achieves Sn=0.91, Sp=0.95,\nand CC=0.86. For human and Arabidopsis promoters we employ CNNs for\nidentification of two well-known promoter classes (TATA and non-TATA\npromoters). CNNs models nicely recognize these complex functional regions. For\nhuman Sn/Sp/CC accuracy of prediction reached 0.95/0.98/0,90 on TATA and\n0.90/0.98/0.89 for non-TATA promoter sequences, respectively. For Arabidopsis\nwe observed Sn/Sp/CC 0.95/0.97/0.91 (TATA) and 0.94/0.94/0.86 (non-TATA)\npromoters. Thus, the developed CNN models (implemented in CNNProm program)\ndemonstrated the ability of deep learning with grasping complex promoter\nsequence characteristics and achieve significantly higher accuracy compared to\nthe previously developed promoter prediction programs. As the suggested\napproach does not require knowledge of any specific promoter features, it can\nbe easily extended to identify promoters and other complex functional regions\nin sequences of many other and especially newly sequenced genomes.

The poems, which purported to have been composed by a third-century\nbard named Ossian, quickly achieved wide international acclaim. They invited\ncomparisons with major works of the epic tradition, including Homer's Iliad and\nOdyssey, and effected a profound influence on the emergent Romantic period in\nliterature and the arts. However, the work also provoked one of the most famous\nliterary controversies of all time, colouring the reception of the poetry to\nthis day. The authenticity of the poems was questioned by some scholars, while\nothers protested that they misappropriated material from Irish mythological\nsources. Recent years have seen a growing critical interest in Ossian,\ninitiated by revisionist and counter-revisionist scholarship and by the\ntwo-hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of the first collected edition of the\npoems in 1765. Here we investigate Ossian from a networks-science point of\nview. We compare the connectivity structures underlying the societies described\nin the Ossianic narratives with those of ancient Greek and Irish sources.\nDespite attempts, from the outset, to position Ossian alongside the Homeric\nepics and to distance it from Irish sources, our results indicate significant\nnetwork-structural differences between Macpherson's text and those of Homer.\nThey also show a strong similarity between Ossianic networks and those of the\nnarratives known as Acallam na Sen\\'orach (Colloquy of the Ancients) from the\nFenian Cycle of Irish mythology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2016 14:50:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}
