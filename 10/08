To each $\\theta \\in (0,1)$, we associate the appropriate analogue\nof the Assouad dimension with the restriction that the two scales $r$ and $R$\nused in the definition satisfy $\\log R/\\log r = \\theta$. The resulting\n`dimension spectrum' (as a function of $\\theta$) thus gives finer geometric\ninformation regarding the scaling structure of the space and, in some precise\nsense, interpolates between the upper box dimension and the Assouad dimension.\nThis latter point is particularly useful because the spectrum is generally\nbetter behaved than the Assouad dimension. We also consider the corresponding\n`lower spectrum', motivated by the lower dimension, which acts as a dual to the\nAssouad spectrum.\n  We conduct a detailed study of these dimension spectra; including analytic,\ngeometric, and measureability properties.

Although this modeling problem\nhas been extensively studied, it remains unclear how to effectively control the\nfraction of false discoveries even in high-dimensional logistic regression, not\nto mention general high-dimensional nonlinear models. To address such a\npractical problem, we propose a new framework of $model$-$X$ knockoffs, which\nreads from a different perspective the knockoff procedure (Barber and Cand\\`es,\n2015) originally designed for controlling the false discovery rate in linear\nmodels. Whereas the knockoffs procedure is constrained to homoscedastic linear\nmodels with $n\\ge p$, the key innovation here is that model-X knockoffs provide\nvalid inference from finite samples in settings in which the conditional\ndistribution of the response is arbitrary and completely unknown. Furthermore,\nthis holds no matter the number of covariates. Correct inference in such a\nbroad setting is achieved by constructing knockoff variables probabilistically\ninstead of geometrically. To do this, our approach requires the covariates be\nrandom (independent and identically distributed rows) with a distribution that\nis known, although we provide preliminary experimental evidence that our\nprocedure is robust to unknown/estimated distributions. To our knowledge, no\nother procedure solves the $controlled$ variable selection problem in such\ngenerality, but in the restricted settings where competitors exist, we\ndemonstrate the superior power of knockoffs through simulations. Finally, we\napply our procedure to data from a case-control study of Crohn's disease in the\nUnited Kingdom, making twice as many discoveries as the original analysis of\nthe same data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 17:18:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2016 18:25:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2017 05:37:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2017 14:57:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

Unbarred galaxies evolve very smoothly, with a star\nformation rate (SFR) that varies by at most a factor of three over a period of\n2 Gyr. The evolution of barred galaxies is much more irregular, especially at\nhigh stellar masses. In these galaxies, the bar drives a substantial amount of\ngas toward the centre, resulting in a high SFR, and producing a starburst in\nthe most massive galaxies. Most of the gas is converted into stars, and gas\nexhaustion leads to a rapid drop of star formation after the starburst. In\nmassive barred galaxies (stellar mass M* > 2x10^10 Msun) the large amount of\ngas funnelled toward the centre is completely consumed by the starburst, while\nin lower-mass barred galaxies it is only partially consumed. Gas concentration\nis thus higher in lower-mass barred galaxies than it is in higher-mass ones.\nEven though unbarred galaxies funnelled less gas toward their centre, the lower\nSFR allows this gas to accumulate. At late times, the star formation efficiency\nis higher in barred galaxies than unbarred ones, enabling these galaxies to\nmaintain a higher SFR with a smaller gas supply. Several properties, such as\nthe global SFR, central SFR, or central gas concentration, vary monotonically\nwith time for unbarred galaxies, but not for barred galaxies.

It turns out that the strong energy\ncondition for the disk stress-energy content is sufficient for vertical\nstability of these orbits. Moreover, adiabatic invariance of the vertical\naction variable gives us an approximate third integral of motion for oblique\norbits which deviate slightly from the equatorial plane. Such new approximate\nthird integral certainly points to a better understanding of the analytical\nproperties of these orbits. The results presented here, derived for static\nspacetimes, may be a starting point to study the motion around rotating,\nstationary razor-thin disks.

However, step duration adaptation is often neglected in control\nstrategies. In this paper, we propose an approach that combines both step\nlocation and timing adjustment for generating robust gaits. In this approach,\nstep location and step timing are decided, based on feedback from the current\nstate of the robot. The proposed approach is comprised of two stages. In the\nfirst stage, the nominal step location and step duration for the next step or a\npreviewed number of steps are specified. In this stage which is done at the\nstart of each step, the main goal is to specify the best step length and step\nduration for a desired walking speed. The second stage deals with finding the\nbest landing point and landing time of the swing foot at each control cycle. In\nthis stage, stability of the gaits is preserved by specifying a desired offset\nbetween the swing foot landing point and the Divergent Component of Motion\n(DCM) at the end of current step. After specifying the landing point of the\nswing foot at a desired time, the swing foot trajectory is regenerated at each\ncontrol cycle to realize desired landing properties. Simulation on different\nscenarios shows the robustness of the generated gaits from our proposed\napproach compared to the case where no timing adjustment is employed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 19:06:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 06:37:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-13"}

Sets of\napproximate kinetic equations can be consistently obtained by breaking this\nchain at a particular point (i.e. approximating all higher-order distribution\nfunctions by the products of the lower-order ones). When complemented by the\nequations for the level occupation numbers and inter-level transition\namplitudes, they allow to describe the nonequilibrium evolution of the quantum\nstate of the system, which can describe better a large quantum coherent system\nthan the currently used approaches.

Using a combination of\nN-body simulations and a semi-analytical model, we investigate the variance in\nsubhalo mass fractions and subhalo occupation numbers, with an emphasis on how\nthese statistics scale with halo formation time. We demonstrate that the\nsubhalo mass fraction, f_sub, is mainly a function of halo formation time, with\nearlier forming haloes having less substructure. At fixed formation redshift,\nthe average f_sub is virtually independent of halo mass, and the mass\ndependence of f_sub is therefore mainly a manifestation of more massive haloes\nassembling later. We compare observational constraints on f_sub from\ngravitational lensing to our model predictions and simulation results. Although\nthe inferred f_sub are substantially higher than the median LCDM predictions,\nthey fall within the 95th percentile due to halo-to-halo variance. We show that\nwhile the halo occupation distribution of subhaloes, P(N|M), is\nsuper-Poissonian for large <N>, a well established result, it becomes\nsub-Poissonian for <N> < 2. Ignoring the non-Poissonity results in systematic\nerrors of the clustering of galaxies of a few percent, and with a complicated\nscale- and luminosity-dependence. Earlier-formed haloes have P(N|M) closer to a\nPoisson distribution, suggesting that the dynamical evolution of subhaloes\ndrives the statistics towards Poissonian. Contrary to a recent claim, the\nnon-Poissonity of subhalo occupation statistics does not vanish by selecting\nhaloes with fixed mass and fixed formation redshift. Finally, we use subhalo\noccupation statistics to put loose constraints on the mass and formation\nredshift of the Milky Way halo.

However, it is unclear how molecules and grains are able to\ncondense within the ejecta, given the potentially harsh environment created by\nionizing radiation from the white dwarf. Motivated by the evidence for powerful\nradiative shocks within nova outflows, we propose that dust formation occurs\nwithin the cool, dense shell behind these shocks. We incorporate a simple\nmolecular chemistry network and classical nucleation theory with a model for\nthe thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas, in order to demonstrate the\nformation of both carbon and forsterite ($\\rm Mg_2SiO_4$) grains. The high\ndensities due to radiative shock compression ($n \\sim 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$)\nresult in CO saturation and rapid dust nucleation. Grains grow efficiently to\nlarge sizes $\\gtrsim 0.1\\mu$m, in agreement with IR observations of\ndust-producing novae, and with total dust masses sufficient to explain massive\nextinction events such as V705 Cas. As in dense stellar winds, dust formation\nis CO-regulated, with carbon-rich flows producing carbon-rich grains and\noxygen-rich flows primarily forming silicates. CO is destroyed by non-thermal\nparticles accelerated at the shock, allowing additional grain formation at late\ntimes, but the efficiency of this process appears to be low. Given observations\nshowing that individual novae produce both carbonaceous and silicate grains, we\nconcur with previous works attributing this bimodality to chemical\nheterogeneity of the ejecta. Nova outflows are diverse and inhomogeneous, and\nthe observed variety of dust formation events can be reconciled by different\nabundances, the range of shock properties, and the observer viewing angle.

A\nvariety of criteria have been shown for the LLLL; the strongest possible\ncriterion was shown by Shearer, and other criteria which are easier to use\ncomputationally have been shown by Bissacot et al (2011), Pegden (2014),\nKolipaka & Szegedy (2011), and Kolipaka, Szegedy, Xu (2012).\n  We show a new criterion for the Moser-Tardos algorithm to converge. This\ncriterion is stronger than the LLLL criterion; this is possible because it does\nnot apply in the same generality as the original LLLL; yet, it is strong enough\nto cover many applications of the LLLL in combinatorics. We show a variety of\nnew bounds and algorithms. A noteworthy application is for $k$-SAT, with\nbounded occurrences of variables. As shown in Gebauer, Sz\\'{a}bo, and Tardos\n(2011), a $k$-SAT instance in which every variable appears $L \\leq\n\\frac{2^{k+1}}{e (k+1)}$ times, is satisfiable. Although this bound is\nasymptotically tight (in $k$), we improve it to $L \\leq \\frac{2^{k+1} (1 -\n1/k)^k}{k-1} - \\frac{2}{k}$ which can be significantly stronger when $k$ is\nsmall.\n  We introduce a new parallel algorithm for the LLLL. While Moser & Tardos\ndescribed a simple parallel algorithm for the Lov\\'{a}sz Local Lemma, and\ndescribed a simple sequential algorithm for a form of the Lopsided Lemma, they\nwere not able to combine the two. Our new algorithm applies in nearly all\nsettings in which the sequential algorithm works --- this includes settings\ncovered by our new stronger LLLL criterion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 20:43:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 12:45:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 13:59:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 15:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-02"}

In these high dimensional\ndatasets, the number of variables p is typically larger than the sample size n.\nA popular way of tackling this challenge is to induce sparsity in the\ncovariance matrix, its inverse or a relevant transformation. In particular,\nmethods inducing sparsity in the Cholesky pa- rameter of the inverse covariance\nmatrix can be useful as they are guaranteed to give a positive definite\nestimate of the covariance matrix. Also, the estimated sparsity pattern\ncorresponds to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) model for Gaussian data. In\nrecent years, two useful penalized likelihood methods for sparse estimation of\nthis Cholesky parameter (with no restrictions on the sparsity pattern) have\nbeen developed.

Digital watermarking has emerged as a deterrent measure towards such\nmalicious activities. Several methods have been proposed for copyright\nprotection and fingerprinting of digital images. However, these methods are not\napplicable to text documents as these documents lack rich texture information\nwhich is abundantly available in digital images.

The proposed method divides a text document into\ntexture and non-texture blocks using an energy-based approach. After\nclassification, a watermark is embedded inside the texture blocks in a content\nadaptive manner. The proposed method is integrated with five known image\nwatermarking methods and its performance is studied in terms of quality and\nrobustness.

Several conceptions such as weak, strong and\nrobust emergence have been proposed to emphasize different epistemological and\nontological aspects of the problem. One of the most important concerns is\nwhether emergence is an intrinsic property of the reality we observe, or it is\nrather a consequence of epistemological limitations. To elucidate this\nquestion, we propose a novel approximation through constructive topology, a\nframework that allow us to map the space of observed objects (ontology) with\nthe knowledge subject conceptual apparatus (epistemology). Focusing in a\nparticular type of emergent processes, namely those accessible through\nexperiments and from which we have still no clue on the mechanistic processes\nyielding its formation, we analyse how a knowledge subject would build a\nconceptual explanatory framework. Working on these systems, we identify concept\ndisjunction as a critical logical operation needed to identify the constraints\nof the system. Next, focusing on a three-bits synthetic system, we show how the\nnumber and scope of the constraints hinder the development of such scheme.\nInterestingly, we observe that our framework is unable to identify global\nconstraints, clearly linking the epistemological limits of the framework with\nan ontological feature of the system. This allows us to propose a definition of\nemergence strength which we make compatible with the scientific method through\nthe active intervention of the observer on the system. We think that this\ndefinition reconciles previous attempts to classify emergent processes, at\nleast for the specific kind we discuss here. The paper finishes discussing the\nrelevance of global constraints in biological systems, understood as a downward\ncausal influence exerted by natural selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 23:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-11"}

With properly\nchosen impedance ratio, SIRs can be 27% shorter than UIRs. As a result, the\narea occupied by SIRs can be reduced. Two kinds of designs containing both SIRs\nand UIRs are fabricated and measured. The power dependence of the extracted\ninternal quality factors (Qi) for all the resonators showed that SIRs and UIRs\nhave comparable performance with Qi around half-million under single-photon\nlevel excitation. These results indicate that SIRs could be used in\nsuperconducting quantum circuits. The reduced size of SIRs may also lead to\nreduced overall circuit area and increased integration level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2016 03:36:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 16:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-30"}

NW was inspired by the Honing Theory of\ncreativity, according to which human-like creativity hinges on (1) the ability\nto self-organize and maintain dynamics at the 'edge of chaos' using something\nakin to 'psychological entropy', and (2) the capacity to shift between analytic\nand associative processing modes. At the 'edge of chaos', NW generates patterns\nthat exhibit emergent complexity through coherent development at low, mid, and\nhigh levels of musical organization, and often suggests goal seeking behaviour.\nThe architecture consists of four 16-node modules: one each for pitch,\nvelocity, duration, and entry delay. The Core allows users to define how nodes\nare connected, and rules that determine when and how nodes respond to their\ninputs. The Mapping Layer allows users to map node output values to MIDI data\nthat is routed to software instruments in a digital audio workstation. By\nshifting between bottom-up and top-down NW shifts between analytic and\nassociative processing modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2016 03:42:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 21:07:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

The memory can distinguish a single infection from a polyinfection.\nOur model is a combination of the improved versions of the original linear\nquantum retrieving algorithm proposed by Ventura and the non-linear quantum\nsearch algorithm of Abrams and Lloyd. From the given simulation results, it\nappears that the efficiency of recognition is good when particular signs and\nsymptoms of a disease are inserted given that the linear algorithm is the main\nalgorithm. The non-linear algorithm helps confirm or correct the diagnosis or\ngive some advice to the medical staff for the treatment. So, our QAMDiagnos\nthat has a friendly graphical user interface for desktop and smart-phone is a\nsensitive and a low-cost diagnostic tool that enables rapid and accurate\ndiagnosis of four tropical diseases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2016 03:48:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 07:45:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2017 11:41:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 04:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

According to honing theory, minds, like other selforganizing\nsystems, modify their contents and adapt to their environments to minimize\nentropy. Creativity begins with detection of high psychological entropy\nmaterial, which provokes uncertainty and is arousalinducing. The creative\nprocess involves recursively considering this material from new contexts until\nit is sufficiently restructured that arousal dissipates. Restructuring involves\nneural synchrony and dynamic binding, and may be facilitated by temporarily\nshifting to a more associative mode of thought. A creative work may similarly\ninduce restructuring in others, and thereby contribute to the cultural\nevolution of more nuanced worldviews. Since lines of cultural descent\nconnecting creative outputs may exhibit little continuity, it is proposed that\ncultural evolution occurs at the level of self-organizing minds, outputs\nreflect their evolutionary state. Honing theory addresses challenges not\naddressed by other theories of creativity, such as the factors that guide\nrestructuring, and in what sense creative works evolve. Evidence comes from\nempirical studies, an agent-based computational model of cultural evolution,\nand a model of concept combination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2016 04:40:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2019 20:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-17"}

We show that even the simplest of such order statistics models -- one\nin which this luminosity function $p(L)$ is universal -- naturally produces a\nnumber of features associated with previous analyses based on the `central plus\nPoisson satellites' hypothesis. These include the monotonic relation of mean\ncentral luminosity with halo mass, the Lognormal distribution around this mean,\nand the tight relation between the central and satellite mass scales. In stark\ncontrast to observations of galaxy clustering, however, this model predicts\n$\\textit{no}$ luminosity dependence of large scale clustering. We then show\nthat an extended version of this model, based on the order statistics of a\n$\\textit{halo mass dependent}$ luminosity function $p(L|m)$, is in much better\nagreement with the clustering data as well as satellite luminosities, but\nsystematically under-predicts central luminosities. This brings into focus the\nidea that central galaxies constitute a distinct population that is affected by\ndifferent physical processes than are the satellites. We model this physical\ndifference as a statistical brightening of the central luminosities, over and\nabove the order statistics prediction. The magnitude gap between the brightest\nand second brightest group galaxy is predicted as a by-product, and is also in\ngood agreement with observations.

In such an architecture, the\nquality of the final ranked list may not be sensitive to the quality of initial\ncandidate pool, especially in terms of early precision. This provides several\nopportunities to increase retrieval efficiency without significantly\nsacrificing effectiveness. In this paper, we explore a new approach to\ndynamically predicting two different parameters in the candidate generation\nstage which can directly affect the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the\nentire system. Previous work exploring this tradeoff has focused on global\nparameter settings that apply to all queries, even though optimal settings vary\nacross queries. In contrast, we propose a technique which makes a parameter\nprediction that maximizes efficiency within a effectiveness envelope on a per\nquery basis, using only static pre-retrieval features. The query-specific\ntradeoff point between effectiveness and efficiency is decided using a\nclassifier cascade that weighs possible efficiency gains against effectiveness\nlosses over a range of possible parameter cutoffs to make the prediction. The\ninteresting twist in our new approach is to train classifiers without requiring\nexplicit relevance judgments. We show that our framework is generalizable by\napplying it to two different retrieval parameters - selecting k in common top-k\nquery retrieval algorithms, and setting a quality threshold, $\\rho$, for\nscore-at-a-time approximate query evaluation algorithms. Experimental results\nshow that substantial efficiency gains are achievable depending on the dynamic\nparameter choice. In addition, our framework provides a versatile tool that can\nbe used to estimate the effectiveness-efficiency tradeoffs that are possible\nbefore selecting and tuning algorithms to make machine learned predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2016 08:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-11"}

For each gene, we define a Spatial Expression Network\n(SEN), a network quantifying co-expression patterns amongst several anatomical\nlocations. Network similarity measures are then employed to quantify the\ntopological resemblance between pairs of SENs and identify naturally occurring\nclusters. Using network-theoretical measures, three large clusters have been\ndetected featuring distinct topological properties. We then evaluate whether\ntopological diversity of the SENs reflects significant differences in\nbiological function through a gene ontology analysis. We report on evidence\nsuggesting that one of the three SEN clusters consists of genes specifically\ninvolved in the nervous system, including genes related to brain disorders,\nwhile the remaining two clusters are representative of immunity, transcription\nand translation. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing\nthat brain gene clusters are generally associated with one of these three major\nbiological processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2016 15:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-11"}

Here we calculate the rate at which a\ngravitational wave creates a massless, scalar field. This is done by placing\nthe scalar field in the background of a plane gravitational wave and\ncalculating the 4-current of the scalar field. Even in the vacuum limit of the\nscalar field it has a non-zero vacuum expectation value (similar to what occurs\nin the Higgs mechanism) and a non-zero current. We associate this with the\nproduction of scalar field quanta by the gravitational field. This effect has\npotential consequences for the attenuation of gravitational waves since the\nmassless field is being produced at the expense of the gravitational field.\nThis is related to the time-dependent Schwinger effect, but with the electric\nfield replaced by the the gravitational wave background and the\nelectron/positron field quanta replaced by massless scalar \"photons\". Since the\nproduced scalar quanta are massless there is no exponential suppression as\noccurs in the Schwinger effect due to the electron mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 18:55:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 22:44:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

A problematic\nbackground in such large granular detector arrays is posed by alpha particles.\nIn the Majorana Demonstrator, events have been observed that are consistent\nwith energy- degraded alphas originating on the passivated surface, leading to\na potential background contribution in the region-of-interest for neutrinoless\ndouble-beta decay. However, it is also observed that when energy deposition\noccurs very close to the passivated surface, charges drift through the bulk\nonto that surface, and then drift along it with greatly reduced mobility. This\nleads to both a reduced prompt signal and a measurable change in slope of the\ntail of a recorded pulse.
