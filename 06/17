A common approach is to\nidentify yield via the first critical point of stress-strain curves produced by\nmolecular dynamics simulations. However, the simulated data can be excessively\nnoisy, making it difficult to extract meaningful results. In this work, we\ndiscuss an alternate method for identifying yield on the basis of residual\nstrain computations. Notably, the associated raw data produce a sharper signal\nfor yield through a transition in their global behavior. As we show, this\ntransition can be analyzed in terms of simple functions (e.g. hyperbolas) that\nadmit straightforward uncertainty quantification techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 16:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-17"}

The separation between\nfirst-class and second-class constraints is performed explicitly, and both the\nfield equations and gauge symmetries of the Lagrangian formalism are fully\nrecovered. The degrees of freedom of the theory in generic sectors shows that\nthe propagating states correspond to fermionic modes in the background\ndetermined by the geometry of the graphene sheet and the nondynamical\nelectromagnetic field. This is shown for the following canonical sectors: i) a\nconformally invariant generic description where the spinor field and the\ndreibein are locally rescaled; ii) a specific configuration for the Dirac\nfermion consistent with its spin, where Weyl symmetry is exchanged by time\nreparametrizations; iii) the vacuum sector $\\psi=0$, which is of interest for\nperturbation theory.

In an end-to-end\ndialog system, the aim of dialog state tracking is to accurately estimate the\ntrue dialog state from noisy observations produced by the speech recognition\nand the natural language understanding modules. The state tracking task is\nprimarily meant to support a dialog policy. From a probabilistic perspective,\nthis is achieved by maintaining a posterior distribution over hidden dialog\nstates composed of a set of context dependent variables. Once a dialog policy\nis learned, it strives to select an optimal dialog act given the estimated\ndialog state and a defined reward function. This paper introduces a novel\nmethod of dialog state tracking based on a bilinear algebric decomposition\nmodel that provides an efficient inference schema through collective matrix\nfactorization. We evaluate the proposed approach on the second Dialog State\nTracking Challenge (DSTC-2) dataset and we show that the proposed tracker gives\nencouraging results compared to the state-of-the-art trackers that participated\nin this standard benchmark. Finally, we show that the prediction schema is\ncomputationally efficient in comparison to the previous approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 17:31:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-17"}

We now present a significant update, sampling seven\ngravitationally-lensed sources at $4<z<5$. We show that the absorbing gas in\nour sources is spatially inhomogeneous with a median covering fraction of 66\\%.\nCorrecting for reddening according to a dust-in-cloud model, this implies an\nestimated absolute escape fraction of $\\simeq19\\pm6$\\%.

Our analysis demonstrates considerable variations in the escape\nfraction consistent with being governed by the small-scale behavior of\nstar-forming regions, whose activities fluctuate over short timescales.

The selected galactic disc region has a size of (500 pc)$^2$ x\n$\\pm$ 5 kpc and a gas surface density of 10 M$_{\\odot}$/pc$^2$. The simulations\ninclude an external stellar potential and gas self-gravity, radiative cooling\nand diffuse heating, sink particles representing star clusters, stellar winds\nfrom these clusters which combine the winds from indi- vidual massive stars by\nfollowing their evolution tracks, and subsequent supernova explosions. Dust and\ngas (self-)shielding is followed to compute the chemical state of the gas with\na chemical network. We find that stellar winds can regulate star (cluster)\nformation. Since the winds suppress the accretion of fresh gas soon after the\ncluster has formed, they lead to clusters which have lower average masses\n(10$^2$ - 10$^{4.3}$ M$_{\\odot}$) and form on shorter timescales (10$^{-3}$ -\n10 Myr). In particular we find an anti-correlation of cluster mass and\naccretion time scale. Without winds the star clusters easily grow to larger\nmasses for ~5 Myr until the first supernova explodes. Overall the most massive\nstars provide the most wind energy input, while objects beginning their\nevolution as B-type stars contribute most of the supernova energy input.

The optimality\ncriterion may be the maximisation of the profit of the storage itself, where\nthis profit results from the exploitation of the differences in market clearing\nprices at different times. Alternatively it may be the minimisation of the cost\nof generation, or the maximisation of consumer surplus or social welfare. In\nall cases there is calculated for each successive time-step the cost function\nmeasuring the total impact of whatever action is taken by the storage. The\nsuccession of such cost functions provides the information for the storage to\ndetermine how to behave over time, forming the basis of the appropriate\noptimisation problem. Further, optimal decision making, even over a very long\nor indefinite time period, usually depends on a knowledge of costs over a\nrelatively short running time horizon -- for storage of electrical energy\ntypically of the order of a day or so.\n  We study particularly competition between multiple stores, where the\nobjective of each store is to maximise its own income given the activities of\nthe remainder. We show that, at the Cournot Nash equilibrium, multiple large\nstores collectively erode their own abilities to make profits: essentially each\nstore attempts to increase its own profit over time by overcompeting at the\nexpense of the remainder. We quantify this for linear price functions\n  We give examples throughout based on Great Britain spot-price market data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 20:21:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-20"}

A sequence of four schematic cartoons lays out\nthe proposed evolution of the global configuration of the magnetic field above,\nin, and at the bottom of the convection zone through sunspot Cycle 23 and into\nCycle 24. Three key elements of the amended scenario are: (1) as the net\nfollowing-polarity field from the sunspot-region omega-loop fields of an\nongoing sunspot cycle is swept poleward to cancel and replace the\nopposite-polarity polar-cap field from the previous sunspot cycle, it remains\nconnected to the ongoing sunspot cycle's toroidal source-field band at the\nbottom of the convection zone; (2) topological pumping by the convection zone's\nfree convection keeps the horizontal extent of the poleward-migrating\nfollowing-polarity field pushed to the bottom, forcing it to gradually cancel\nand replace old horizontal field below it that connects the ongoing-cycle\nsource-field band to the previous-cycle polar-cap field; (3) in each polar\nhemisphere, by continually shearing the poloidal component of the settling new\nhorizontal field, the latitudinal differential rotation low in the convection\nzone generates the next-cycle source-field band poleward of the ongoing-cycle\nband. The amended scenario is a more-plausible version of Babcock's scenario,\nand its viability can be explored by appropriate kinematic flux-transport\nsolar-dynamo simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 21:23:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-20"}

This strongly conflicts with the traditional view of\nthe dominant star-formation mode in stellar clusters, which are thought of as\nsingle-aged stellar populations. Here we present a test of this interpretation\nby exploring the morphology of the subgiant branch (SGB) of NGC 411, which\nhosts possibly the most extended eMSTO among all known intermediate-age star\nclusters.

Reversible spreading\ndynamics are ubiquitous but their interplay with synergy has remained unknown.\nTo fill this knowledge gap, we articulate a model to incorporate local\nsynergistic effect into the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible process,\nin which the probability for a susceptible node to become infected through an\ninfected neighbor is enhanced when the neighborhood of the latter contains a\nnumber of infected nodes. We derive master equations incorporating the\nsynergistic effect, with predictions that agree well with the numerical\nresults. A striking finding is that, when a parameter characterizing the\nstrength of the synergy reinforcement effect is above a critical value, the\nsteady state density of the infected nodes versus the basic transmission rate\nexhibits an explosively increasing behavior and a hysteresis loop emerges. In\nfact, increasing the synergy strength can promote the spreading and reduce the\ninvasion and persistence thresholds of the hysteresis loop. A physical\nunderstanding of the synergy promoting explosive spreading and the associated\nhysteresis behavior can be obtained through a mean-field analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 02:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

However, far apart of that\nnetwork, there are two main contributions in our proposed network that play a\nsignificant role to achieve the state-of-the-art performance in face detection.\nFirstly, the multi-scale information is grouped both in region proposal and RoI\ndetection to deal with tiny face regions. Secondly, our proposed network allows\nexplicit body contextual reasoning in the network inspired from the intuition\nof human vision system. The proposed approach is benchmarked on two recent\nchallenging face detection databases, i.e. the WIDER FACE Dataset which\ncontains high degree of variability, as well as the Face Detection Dataset and\nBenchmark (FDDB). The experimental results show that our proposed approach\ntrained on WIDER FACE Dataset outperforms strong baselines on WIDER FACE\nDataset by a large margin, and consistently achieves competitive results on\nFDDB against the recent state-of-the-art face detection methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 03:19:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-20"}

The advantages of the high temporal-spatial\nresolution and the wide field of view make the GF-1 WFV imagery very popular.\nHowever, cloud cover is an inevitable problem in GF-1 WFV imagery, which\ninfluences its precise application. Accurate cloud and cloud shadow detection\nin GF-1 WFV imagery is quite difficult due to the fact that there are only\nthree visible bands and one near-infrared band. In this paper, an automatic\nmulti-feature combined (MFC) method is proposed for cloud and cloud shadow\ndetection in GF-1 WFV imagery. The MFC algorithm first implements threshold\nsegmentation based on the spectral features and mask refinement based on guided\nfiltering to generate a preliminary cloud mask. The geometric features are then\nused in combination with the texture features to improve the cloud detection\nresults and produce the final cloud mask. Finally, the cloud shadow mask can be\nacquired by means of the cloud and shadow matching and follow-up correction\nprocess. The method was validated using 108 globally distributed scenes. The\nresults indicate that MFC performs well under most conditions, and the average\noverall accuracy of MFC cloud detection is as high as 96.8%. In the contrastive\nanalysis with the official provided cloud fractions, MFC shows a significant\nimprovement in cloud fraction estimation, and achieves a high accuracy for the\ncloud and cloud shadow detection in the GF-1 WFV imagery with fewer spectral\nbands. The proposed method could be used as a preprocessing step in the future\nto monitor land-cover change, and it could also be easily extended to other\noptical satellite imagery which has a similar spectral setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 03:26:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2016 10:51:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2016 09:12:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2017 04:59:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

FVQA\nonly contains questions which require external information to answer.\n  We thus extend a conventional visual question answering dataset, which\ncontains image-question-answerg triplets, through additional\nimage-question-answer-supporting fact tuples. The supporting fact is\nrepresented as a structural triplet, such as <Cat,CapableOf,ClimbingTrees>.\n  We evaluate several baseline models on the FVQA dataset, and describe a novel\nmodel which is capable of reasoning about an image on the basis of supporting\nfacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 07:37:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2016 03:21:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2016 06:39:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 Aug 2017 05:10:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-09"}

Classical novae are thermonuclear explosions that take place in the\nenvelopes of accreting white dwarfs in stellar binary systems.

In those outbursts, about 10-7 - 10-3 Msun, enriched\nin CNO and, sometimes, other intermediate-mass elements (e.g., Ne, Na, Mg, or\nAl, for ONe novae) are ejected into the interstellar medium. The large\nconcentrations of metals spectroscopically inferred in the nova ejecta reveal\nthat the (solar-like) material transferred from the secondary mixes with the\noutermost layers of the underlying white dwarf.\n  Aims. Most theoretical models of nova outbursts reported to date yield, on\naverage, outflows characterized by O > C, from which only oxidized condensates\n(e.g, O-rich grains) would be expected, in principle.\n  Methods. To specifically address whether CO novae can actually produce C-rich\ndust, six different hydrodynamic nova models have been evolved, from accretion\nto the expansion and ejection stages, with different choices for the\ncomposition of the substrate with which the solar-like accreted material mixes.\nUpdated chemical profiles inside the H-exhausted core have been used, based on\nstellar evolution calculations for a progenitor of 8 Msun through H and\nHe-burning phases.\n  Results.

This can take two forms: either\nthe plasma body greatly expands in radius while containing the same magnetic\nflux, or, if the plasma radius is limited, the plasma distribution across\nflux-tubes changes, so that the same cross-section contains a greatly reduced\nflux. If the magnetic field of the trap is quasi-uniform around its minimum,\nthe bubble can be made roughly cylindrical, with radius much larger than the\nradius of the corresponding vacuum flux-tube, and with non-paraxial ends.

The computational effort of today's CNNs requires power-hungry\nparallel processors or GP-GPUs.

Instead, one\nhas access to multiple corrupted versions of the signal. The available\ncorrupted signals are correlated because they carry information about the\ncommon remote signal. The goal is to reconstruct the original signal from the\ndata collected from its corrupted versions. The information theoretic\nformulation of the remote reconstruction problem assumes that the corrupted\nsignals are uniformly sampled and the focus is on optimal compression of the\nsamples. In this paper we revisit this problem from a sampling perspective. We\nlook at the problem of finding the best sampling locations for each signal to\nminimize the total reconstruction distortion of the remote signal. In finding\nthe sampling locations, one can take advantage of the correlation among the\ncorrupted signals. Our main contribution is a fundamental lower bound on the\nreconstruction distortion for any arbitrary nonuniform sampling strategy. This\nlower bound is valid for any sampling rate. Furthermore, it is tight and\nmatches the optimal reconstruction distortion in low and high sampling rates.\nMoreover, it is shown that in the low sampling rate region, it is optimal to\nuse a certain nonuniform sampling scheme on all the signals. On the other hand,\nin the high sampling rate region, it is optimal to uniformly sample all the\nsignals. We also consider the problem of finding the optimal sampling locations\nto recover the set of corrupted signals, rather than the remote signal.

One of the most popular tensor\nnetwork is tensor train (TT) decomposition that acts as the building blocks for\nthe complicated tensor networks. However, the TT decomposition highly depends\non permutations of tensor dimensions, due to its strictly sequential\nmultilinear products over latent cores, which leads to difficulties in finding\nthe optimal TT representation. In this paper, we introduce a fundamental tensor\ndecomposition model to represent a large dimensional tensor by a circular\nmultilinear products over a sequence of low dimensional cores, which can be\ngraphically interpreted as a cyclic interconnection of 3rd-order tensors, and\nthus termed as tensor ring (TR) decomposition. The key advantage of TR model is\nthe circular dimensional permutation invariance which is gained by employing\nthe trace operation and treating the latent cores equivalently. TR model can be\nviewed as a linear combination of TT decompositions, thus obtaining the\npowerful and generalized representation abilities. For optimization of latent\ncores, we present four different algorithms based on the sequential SVDs, ALS\nscheme, and block-wise ALS techniques. Furthermore, the mathematical properties\nof TR model are investigated, which shows that the basic multilinear algebra\ncan be performed efficiently by using TR representaions and the classical\ntensor decompositions can be conveniently transformed into the TR\nrepresentation. Finally, the experiments on both synthetic signals and\nreal-world datasets were conducted to evaluate the performance of different\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 14:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-20"}

The whole\ndetection setup involves the Advanced Implantation Detection Array (AIDA), two\nHPGe Clover detectors and a large set of 166 counters of 3He embedded in a\nhigh-density polyethylene matrix. This article reports on a novel methodology\ndeveloped for the conceptual design and optimisation of the 3He-tubes array,\naiming at the best possible performance in terms of neutron detection. The\nalgorithm is based on a geometric representation of two selected parameters of\nmerit, namely, average neutron detection efficiency and efficiency flatness, as\na function of a reduced number of geometric variables. The response of the\ndetection system itself, for each configuration, is obtained from a systematic\nMC-simulation implemented realistically in Geant4. This approach has been found\nto be particularly useful. On the one hand, due to the different types and\nlarge number of 3He-tubes involved and, on the other hand, due to the\nadditional constraints introduced by the ancillary detectors for charged\nparticles and gamma-rays. Empowered by the robustness of the algorithm, we have\nbeen able to design a versatile detection system, which can be easily\nre-arranged into a compact mode in order to maximize the neutron detection\nperformance, at the cost of the gamma-ray sensitivity. In summary, we have\ndesigned a system which shows, for neutron energies up to 1(5) MeV, a rather\nflat and high average efficiency of 68.6%(64%) and 75.7%(71%) for the hybrid\nand compact modes, respectively. The performance of the BRIKEN system has been\nalso quantified realistically by means of MC-simulations made with different\nneutron energy distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 17:47:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

Being characterized by an\neccentricity of 0.93 and an orbital period of 111 days, the system's extreme\nvariation in orbital separation makes it a perfect target to test our\nhypothesis.\n  Results: We find no evidence for a variation in the activity level of the\nstar as a function of planetary orbital distance, as measured by all activity\nindicators employed log($R'_{HK}$), H$_\\alpha$, NaI, and HeI.

Both are widely\nbelieved to be second-order accurate, but the present study shows that in fact\nthe common variant of the DT gradient is second-order accurate only on\nstructured meshes whereas it is zeroth-order accurate on general unstructured\nmeshes, and the LS gradient is second-order and first-order accurate,\nrespectively.

The schemes are then used within a FVM to solve a simple\ndiffusion equation on unstructured grids generated by several methods; the\nresults reveal that the zeroth-order accuracy of the DT gradient is inherited\nby the FVM as a whole, and the discretisation error does not decrease with grid\nrefinement.

We\napproach this problem using a surgery obstruction, first developed by Greene,\nwhich combines Donaldson's Diagonalization Theorem with the $d$-invariants of\nOzsv{\\'a}th and Szab{\\'o}'s Heegaard Floer homology. This obstruction shows\nthat if the double branched cover of an alternating knot or link $L$ arises by\nsurgery on $S^3$, then for any alternating diagram the lattice associated to\nthe Goeritz matrix takes the form of a changemaker lattice. By analyzing the\nstructure of changemaker lattices, we show that the double branched cover of\n$L$ arises by non-integer surgery on $S^3$ if and only if $L$ has an\nalternating diagram which can be obtained by rational tangle replacement on an\nalmost-alternating diagram of the unknot. When one considers half-integer\nsurgery the resulting tangle replacement is simply a crossing change. This\nallows us to show that an alternating knot has unknotting number one if and\nonly if it has an unknotting crossing in every alternating diagram.\n  These techniques also produce several other interesting results: they have\napplications to characterizing slopes of torus knots; they produce a new proof\nfor a theorem of Tsukamoto on the structure of almost-alternating diagrams of\nthe unknot; and they provide several bounds on surgeries producing the double\nbranched covers of alternating knots which are direct generalizations of\nresults previously known for lens space surgeries.\n  The thesis begins with an exposition of the changemaker surgery obstruction,\ngiving an amalgamation of results due to Gibbons, Greene and the author. It\nthen gives background material on alternating knots and changemaker lattices.\nThe latter part of the thesis is then taken up with the applications of this\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 15:31:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-20"}

In contrast, no such uncertainty exists in\nthe classical domain, where all uncertainty results from ignorance about the\nexact state of the physical system. Here, we critically examine the concept of\npreparation uncertainty and ask whether similarly in the quantum regime, some\nof the uncertainty that we observe can actually also be understood as a lack of\ninformation (LOI), albeit a lack of quantum information. We answer this\nquestion affirmatively by showing that for the well known measurements employed\nin BB84 quantum key distribution, the amount of uncertainty can indeed be\nrelated to the amount of available information about additional registers\ndetermining the choice of the measurement. We proceed to show that also for\nother measurements the amount of uncertainty is in part connected to a LOI.\nFinally, we discuss the conceptual implications of our observation to the\nsecurity of cryptographic protocols that make use of BB84 states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 15:41:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2017 21:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-27"}

The osmotic pressure is a\nconsequence of differences in gas permeation rates into a graphene enclosed\ncavity. The deflection of the few layer graphene membranes is detected by an\ninterferometric technique for measuring their tension-induced resonance\nfrequency. Using a calibration measurement of the relation between resonance\nfrequency and pressure, the time dependent osmotic pressure on the graphene is\nextracted. The osmotic pressure for different combinations of gases shows large\ndifferences that can be accounted for by a model based on the different gas\npermeation rates.
