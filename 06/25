The main tool for building public key encryption schemes in rank\nmetric is the McEliece encryption setting used with the family of Gabidulin\ncodes. Since the original scheme proposed in 1991 by Gabidulin, Paramonov and\nTretjakov, many systems have been proposed based on different masking\ntechniques for Gabidulin codes. Nevertheless, over the years all these systems\nwere attacked essentially by the use of an attack proposed by Overbeck.\n  In 2005 Faure and Loidreau designed a rank-metric encryption scheme which was\nnot in the McEliece setting. The scheme is very efficient, with small public\nkeys of size a few kiloBytes and with security closely related to the\nlinearized polynomial reconstruction problem which corresponds to the decoding\nproblem of Gabidulin codes. The structure of the scheme differs considerably\nfrom the classical McEliece setting and until our work, the scheme had never\nbeen attacked. We show in this article that this scheme like other schemes\nbased on Gabidulin codes, is also vulnerable to a polynomial-time attack that\nrecovers the private key by applying Overbeck's attack on an appropriate public\ncode. As an example we break concrete proposed $80$ bits security parameters in\na few seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2016 16:45:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 08:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-17"}

The average molecular gas depletion\ntimescale in NGC5195 is: tdep=3.08Gyr, a factor of ~2 larger than the depletion\ntimescales in nearby star-forming galaxies, but consistent with the depletion\nseen in CO-detected early-type galaxies. While the radio continuum emission at\ncentimeter and millimeter wavelengths is present in the vicinity of the nucleus\nof NGC5195, we find it is most likely associated with nuclear star formation\nrather than a radio-loud AGN. Thus, despite having a substantial interaction\nwith M51a ~1/2Gyr ago, the molecular gas in NGC5195 has resettled and is\nforming stars at an efficiency consistent with settled early-type galaxies at\nthe present time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2016 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2016 00:31:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

Most popular algorithms in use to remove the effects of a\ntelescope's point spread function (PSF) in radio astronomy are variants of the\nCLEAN algorithm. Most of these algorithms model the sky brightness using the\ndelta-function basis, which results in undesired artefacts when used on image\nextended emission. The adaptive scale pixel decomposition (Asp-Clean) algorithm\nmodels the sky brightness on a scale-sensitive basis and thus gives a\nsignificantly better imaging performance when imaging fields that contain both\nresolved and unresolved emission.\n  Aims. However, the runtime cost of Asp-Clean is higher than that of\nscale-insensitive algorithms. In this paper, we identify the most expensive\nstep in the original Asp-Clean algorithm and present an efficient\nimplementation of it, which significantly reduces the computational cost while\nkeeping the imaging performance comparable to the original algorithm. The PSF\nsidelobe levels of modern wide-band telescopes are significantly reduced,\nallowing us to make approximations to reduce the computing cost, which in turn\nallows for the deconvolution of larger images on reasonable timescales.\n  Methods.

We propose a class of systems called \\emph{progressive\ntimed systems} (PTS), where intuitively only a finite number of actions can be\ncarried out in a bounded time period. We prove that for this class of systems\nboth the realizability and the survivability problems are PSPACE-complete.\nFurthermore, if we impose a bound on time (as in bounded model-checking), we\nshow that for PTS, realizability becomes NP-complete, while survivability is in\nthe $\\Delta_2^p$ class of the polynomial hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat the rewriting logic system Maude can be used to automate time bounded\nverification of PTS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2016 08:55:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 09:45:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

The cosmic evolution of compact binaries is followed using a\npopulation synthesis technique that treats separately neutron stars and black\nhole binaries in different spectral states and is calibrated to reproduce the\nobserved X-ray properties of galaxies at z<4. Together with an updated\nempirical determination of the cosmic history of star formation, recent\nmodeling of the stellar mass-metallicity relation, and a scheme for absorption\nby the IGM that accounts for the presence of ionized HII bubbles during the\nepoch of reionization, our detailed calculations provide refined predictions of\nthe X-ray volume emissivity and filtered radiation background from \"normal\"\ngalaxies at z>6. Radiative transfer effects modulate the background spectrum,\nwhich shows a characteristic peak between 1 and 2 keV. While the filtering of\nX-ray radiation through the IGM slightly increases the mean excess energy per\nphotoionization, it also weakens the radiation intensity below 1 keV, lowering\nthe mean photoionization and heating rates. Numerical integration of the rate\nand energy equations shows that the contribution of X-ray binaries to the\nionization of the bulk IGM is negligible, with the electron fraction never\nexceeding 1%. Direct HeI photoionizations are the main source of IGM heating,\nand the temperature of the largely neutral medium in between HII cavities\nincreases above the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) only\nat z<10, when the volume filling factor of HII bubbles is already >0.1.\nTherefore, in this scenario, it is only at relatively late epochs that the bulk\nof neutral intergalactic hydrogen may be observable in 21-cm emission against\nthe CMB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2016 08:58:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 00:45:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

Arguably, it is\nexactly in such large-scale datasets that capturing any type of dependence is\nof interest, so striking a favourable tradeoff between computational efficiency\nand test performance for kernel independence tests would have a direct impact\non their applicability in practice. In this contribution, we provide an\nextensive study of the use of large-scale kernel approximations in the context\nof independence testing, contrasting block-based, Nystrom and random Fourier\nfeature approaches.

For the former, moreover, we\nobserve that the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) bound is also violated in terms of\nhorizon quantities, even in the static (i.e RN) limit. For the latter, by\ncontrast, the existence of charged matter outside the horizon, allows a curious\ninvariance of the charge to mass ratio, between ADM and horizon quantities.\nRegardless of the Kerr bound violation, we show that in all case, the event\nhorizon linear velocity never exceeds the speed of light. Finally, we suggest a\nnew type of informative parameterization for BH spacetimes where part of the\nasymptotic charges is supported outside the horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2016 12:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

The explanation of the\nsignificantly large cross section for this diphoton resonance requires coloured\nparticles in its loop-induced production via gluon fusion and subsequent decay\nto diphoton.

The fact that the effective index alone is not\nalways sufficient and that one additional effective parameter suffices in the\nquantum optics of metamaterials is both of fundamental and practical interest.\nHere from a Lagrangian description of the quantum electrodynamics of media with\nboth linear gain and loss, we compute the effective noise-photon distribution\nfor quantum light propagation in arbitrary directions in layered metamaterials,\nthereby detailing and generalizing our recent work [ E.

In\nthe case of relatively weak photoexcitation,the ferroelectric and the\nspiral-spin order remains interlocked, both relaxing through spin-lattice\nrelaxation in the non-equilibrium state. When the additional optical pulse\nilluminating sample is intense enough to induced a local phase transition\nthermally, the system creates a metastable state of the bc-spiral-spin order\n(with the electric polarization P//c) via supercooling across the first-order\nphase transition between ab- and bc-spiral. The supercooled state of bc-spiral\nspin is formed in the thermodynamical ground state of ab-spiral (P//a),\ndisplaying a prolonged lifetime with strong dependence on the magnetic field\nalong the a-axis. The observed photo-switching between the two distinct\nmultiferroic states sheds light on novel photoinduced phenomena in spiral-spin\nmultiferroics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2016 15:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-19"}

We developed a model which uses Mie theory and\nthe Hansen particle size distributions to reproduce the extinction due to the\nproposed dust haze.
