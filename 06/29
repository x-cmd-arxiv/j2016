The interface can propagate\nthrough the system depending on the loading rate and disorder present in the\nfailure thresholds of the fibers.

In addition, the energy domain for data\nwas enlarged to include results up to 200 MeV where available.

We find that the convective downdrafts in the\nclose surroundings of a two-dimensional flux slab \"pump\" the plasma inside it\nin the downward direction. This action produces a downflow inside the flux\nslab, which encompasses ever higher layers, causing an upwardly propagating\nrarefaction wave. The slow mode, excited by the adiabatic compression of the\ndownflow near the optical surface, travels along the magnetic field in the\nupward direction at the tube speed. It develops into a shock wave at\nchromospheric heights, where it dissipates, lifts the transition region, and\nproduces an offspring in the form of a compressive wave that propagates further\ninto the corona. In the wake of downflows and propagating shock waves, the\natmosphere inside the flux slab in the chromosphere and higher tends to\noscillate with a period of $\\nu\\approx 4$~mHz.

Items are ranked according to the probability that a\ngiven item beats a randomly chosen item, and ranking refers to partitioning the\nitems into sets of pre-specified sizes according to their scores. This notion\nof ranking includes as special cases the identification of the top-k items and\nthe total ordering of the items. We first analyze a sequential ranking\nalgorithm that counts the number of comparisons won, and uses these counts to\ndecide whether to stop, or to compare another pair of items, chosen based on\nconfidence intervals specified by the data collected up to that point. We prove\nthat this algorithm succeeds in recovering the ranking using a number of\ncomparisons that is optimal up to logarithmic factors. This guarantee does not\nrequire any structural properties of the underlying pairwise probability\nmatrix, unlike a significant body of past work on pairwise ranking based on\nparametric models such as the Thurstone or Bradley-Terry-Luce models. It has\nbeen a long-standing open question as to whether or not imposing these\nparametric assumptions allows for improved ranking algorithms. For stochastic\ncomparison models, in which the pairwise probabilities are bounded away from\nzero, our second contribution is to resolve this issue by proving a lower bound\nfor parametric models. This shows, perhaps surprisingly, that these popular\nparametric modeling choices offer at most logarithmic gains for stochastic\ncomparisons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2016 19:59:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 15:55:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-26"}

These data identify a\nperiodic pattern of excess blue and redshifted emission that is responsible for\nthe striations. For both 12CO and 13CO, spatial variations of the J=2-1 to\nJ=1-0 line ratio are small and are not spatially correlated with the striation\nlocations. A medium comprised of unresolved CO emitting substructures (cells)\nwith a beam area filling factor less than unity at any velocity is required to\nexplain the average line ratios and brightness temperatures. We propose that\nthe striations result from the modulation of velocities and the beam filling\nfactor of the cells as a result of either the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability or\nmagnetosonic waves propagating through the envelope of the Taurus molecular\ncloud. Both processes are likely common features in molecular clouds that are\nsub-Alfvenic and may explain low column density, cirrus-like features similarly\naligned with the magnetic field observed throughout the interstellar medium in\nfar-infrared surveys of dust emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2016 20:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

At a given cutoff scale the model parameters are fixed by fitting\nvacuum quantities, typically including the sigma-meson mass $m_\\sigma$ and the\npion decay constant $f_\\pi$. In most publications the latter is identified with\nthe expectation value of the sigma field, while for $m_\\sigma$ the curvature\nmass is taken. When quark loops are included, this prescription is however\ninconsistent, and the correct identification involves the renormalized pion\ndecay constant and the sigma pole mass. In the present article we investigate\nthe influence of the parameter-fixing scheme on the phase structure of the\nmodel at finite temperature and chemical potential. Despite large differences\nbetween the model parameters in the two schemes, we find that in homogeneous\nmatter the effect on the phase diagram is relatively small. For inhomogeneous\nphases, on the other hand, the choice of the proper renormalization\nprescription is crucial. In particular, we show that if renormalization effects\non the pion decay constant are not considered, the model does not even present\na well-defined renormalized limit when the cutoff is sent to infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2016 20:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

Estimates\nare found by maximizing a log-likelihood function based on single order\nstatistics after transforming through a sequence of trial cumulative\ndistribution functions that iteratively improve using a Monte Carlo random\nsearch method. Improvement is quantified by assessing the random variables\nagainst the statistical properties of sampled uniform random data. Quality is\ndetermined using an empirically derived scoring function that is scaled to be\nsample size invariant. The scoring function identifies atypical fluctuations,\nfor which threshold values are set to define objective criteria that prevent\nunder-fitting as trial iterations continue to improve the model pdf, and,\nstopping the iteration cycle before over-fitting occurs. No prior knowledge\nabout the data is required. An ensemble of pdf models is used to reflect\nuncertainties due to statistical fluctuations in random samples, and the\nquality of the estimates is visualized using scaled residual quantile plots\nthat show deviations from size-invariant statistics.

Large scale hydrodynamical cosmological\nsimulations of structure formation allow us to explore the conditions conducive\nto the growth of the earliest supermassive black holes. We use the cosmological\nhydrodynamic simulation BlueTides, which incorporates a variety of baryon\nphysics in a (400 Mpc/h)^3 volume with 0.7 trillion particles to follow the\nearliest phases of black hole critical growth.

In large scale-out data architectures, data are distributed and\nreplicated across several machines. Queries/tasks to such data architectures,\nare sent to a router which determines the machines containing the requested\ndata. Ideally, to reduce the overall cost of analytics, the smallest set of\nmachines required to satisfy the query should be returned by the router.\nMathematically, this can be modeled as the set cover problem, which is NP-hard,\nthus making the routing process a balance between optimality and performance.\nEven though an efficient greedy approximation algorithm for routing a single\nquery exists, there is currently no better method for processing multiple\nqueries than running the greedy set cover algorithm repeatedly for each query.\nThis method is impractical for Big Data systems and the state-of-the-art\ntechniques route a query to all machines and choose as a cover the machines\nthat respond fastest. In this paper, we propose an efficient technique to\nspeedup the routing of a large number of real-time queries while minimizing the\nnumber of machines that each query touches (query span). We demonstrate that by\nanalyzing the correlation between known queries and performing query\nclustering, we can reduce the set cover computation time, thereby significantly\nspeeding up routing of unknown queries. Experiments show that our incremental\nset cover-based routing is 2.5 times faster and can return on average 50% fewer\nmachines per query when compared to repeated greedy set cover and baseline\nrouting techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2016 20:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-30"}

These complex\ndependencies could not be explained by a linear coupling between the cell and\nthe population rate.

In\nthis model, baryogenesis occurs without $(B-L)$-violation, since the $(B+L)$\nasymmetry generated by the hypermagnetic field counteracts the washout by\nelectroweak sphalerons. At the electroweak crossover, the hypermagnetic field\nbecomes an electromagnetic field, which does not source $(B+L)$.

We observe that the\nrelationship between PSL and MLN is analogous to the known relationship between\nfuzzy logic and Boolean logic, and furthermore the weight scheme of PSL is\nessentially a generalization of the weight scheme of MLN for the many-valued\nsetting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2016 21:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-30"}

The conventional method used to separate the dust component\nof the signal is to assume that the signal at high frequencies (e.g., 350 GHz)\nis due solely to dust and then extrapolate the signal down to lower frequency\n(e.g., 150 GHz) using the measured scaling of the polarized dust signal\namplitude with frequency. For typical Galactic thermal dust temperatures of\nabout 20K, these frequencies are not fully in the Rayleigh-Jeans limit.\nTherefore, deviations in the dust cloud temperatures from cloud to cloud will\nlead to different scaling factors for clouds of different temperatures. Hence,\nwhen multiple clouds of different temperatures and polarization angles\ncontribute to the integrated line-of-sight polarization signal, the relative\ncontribution of individual clouds to the integrated signal can change between\nfrequencies. This can cause the integrated signal to be decorrelated in both\namplitude and direction when extrapolating in frequency.

Standard approaches to\nitem response data in cognitive assessment adopt the multidimensional item\nresponse theory (IRT) models.

The formulation of QCD in the Minkowski-spacetime allows us to\nsolve a constraint equation and decompose the gauge field propagator in the sum\nof an instantaneous part, which forms a bound state, and a retarded part, which\ncontains the relativistic corrections. In Quantum Field Theory, for a\nLagrangian with unordered operator fields, one can make normal ordering by\nmeans of the operator product expansion, then the gluon condensate appear. This\ngives us a natural way of obtaining a dimensional parameter in QCD, which is\nmissing in the QCD Lagrangian. We derive a Schwinger-Dyson equation for a\nquark, which is studied both numerically and analytically. The critical value\nof the strong coupling constant $\\alpha_s = 4/{\\pi}$, above which a nontrivial\nsolution appears and a spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking occurs, is found.\nFor the sake of simplicity, the considered model describes only one flavor\nmassless quark, but the methods can be used in more general case.

A spatially-resolved spectral analysis was\nused to obtain physical and geometrical parameters of different regions of the\nremnant. Spitzer infrared observations were also used to constrain the\nprogenitor supernova and study the environment in which the SNR evolved. The\nX-ray morphology of the remnant displays a non-uniform structure of\nsemi-circular appearance, with a bright southwest region and very weak or\nalmost negligible X-ray emission in its northern part. These results indicate\nthat the remnant is propagating in a non-uniform environment as the shock\nfronts are encountering a high-density medium, where enhanced infrared emission\nis detected. The X-ray spectral analysis of the selected regions shows distinct\nemission-line features of several metal elements, confirming the thermal origin\nof the emission. The X-ray spectra are well represented by a combination of two\nabsorbed thermal plasma models: one in equilibrium ionization with a mean\ntemperature of ~0.19 keV, and another out of equilibrium ionization at a higher\ntemperature of ~1.1 or 1.6-1.9 keV.

For one, `local' features (such as an individual's demographic\ninformation) may lack sufficient information to make informative predictions;\nthis is especially problematic when predicting `risk,' as the relevant features\nmay be precisely those that an individual is disinclined to reveal in a survey.\nSecondly, even if such features are available, they still may miss crucial\ninformation, as `risk' may be a function not just of an individual's features\nbut also those of their friends and social communities. Here, we predict\nindividual's risk profiles as a function of both their local features and those\nof their friends. Instead of modeling influence from the social network\ndirectly (which proved difficult as friendship links may be sparse and\npartially observed), we instead model influence by discovering social\ncommunities in the network that may be related to risky behavior. The result is\na model that predicts risk as a function of local features, while making up for\ntheir deficiencies and accounting for social influence by uncovering community\nstructure in the network. We test our model by predicting risky behavior among\nadolescents from the Add health data set, and hometowns among users in a\nFacebook ego net.

Unfortunately,\nefficient detectors to detect faults during address generation (to index large\narrays) have not been widely researched. We present a novel lightweight\ncompiler-driven technique called PRESAGE for detecting bit-flips affecting\nstructured address computations. A key insight underlying PRESAGE is that any\naddress computation scheme that flows an already incurred error is better than\na scheme that corrupts one particular array access but otherwise (falsely)\nappears to compute perfectly. Enabling the flow of errors allows one to situate\ndetectors at loop exit points, and helps turn silent corruptions into easily\ndetectable error situations.

This\npaper, on the other hand, point s out that in a C-RAN model where the RRHs are\nconnected to the CP via multi-hop routers, data-sharing can be superior to\ncompression if the network coding technique is adopted for multicasting user\nmessages to the cooperating RRHs, and the RRH's beamforming vectors, the\nuser-RRH association, and the network coding design over the fronthaul network\nare jointly optimized based on the techniques of sparse optimization an d\nsuccessive convex approximation. This is in comparison to the compression-based\nstrategy, where information is unicast over the fronthaul network by simple\nrouting, and the RRH's compression noise covariance and beamforming vectors, as\nwell as the routing strategy over the fronthaul network are jointly optimized\nbased on the successive convex approximation technique. The observed gain in\noverall network throughput is due to that information multicast is more\nefficient than information unicast over the multi-hop fronthaul of a C-RAN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2016 04:40:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

Our first main result is to show that for\npacking and covering IPs, the CG and aggregation closures can be 2-approximated\nby simply generating the respective closures for each of the original\nformulation constraints, without using any aggregations.

Finally, we examine the strength of cuts based on k different\naggregation inequalities simultaneously, the so-called multi-row cuts, and show\nthat every packing or covering IP with a large integrality gap also has a large\nk-aggregation closure rank.

The scheduling\nproblem is formulated as an optimization with minimum unsatisfied relations\n(min-UR) problem which is shown to be challenging to solve. Consequently, a\nlong-term scheduling framework, consisting of two stages, is proposed. Within\nthis framework, first, the scheduling over $\\mu$W band is formulated as a\nmatching game and to solve this problem, a novel algorithm is proposed and\nshown to yield a two-sided stable resource allocation.

Here we present observations\nof a luminous blue variable (LBV) in NGC 2770 in outburst over more than 20\nyears that experienced a possible terminal explosion as type IIn SN in 2015,\nnamed SN 2015bh. This possible SN or \"main event\" was preceded by a precursor\npeaking $\\sim$ 40 days before maximum. The total energy release of the main\nevent is $\\sim$1.8$\\times$10$^{49}$ erg, which can be modeled by a $<$ 0.5\nM$_\\odot$ shell plunging into a dense CSM. All emission lines show a single\nnarrow P-Cygni profile during the LBV phase and a double P-Cygni profile post\nmaximum suggesting an association of this second component with the possible\nSN. Since 1994 the star has been redder than during a typical S-Dor like\noutburst. SN 2015bh lies within a spiral arm of NGC 2770 next to a number of\nsmall star-forming regions with a metallicity of $\\sim$ 0.5 solar and a stellar\npopulation age of 7-10 Myr. SN 2015bh shares many similarities with SN 2009ip,\nwhich, together with other examples may form a new class of objects that\nexhibit outbursts a few decades prior to \"hyper-eruption\" or final\ncore-collapse. If the star survives this event it is undoubtedly altered, and\nwe suggest that these \"zombie stars\" may evolve from an LBV to a Wolf Rayet\nstar over a very short timescale of only a few years. The final fate of these\ntypes of massive stars can only be determined with observations years after the\npossible SN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2016 09:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

But surface roughness in particular makes\nit challenging to produce capillaries with precisely controlled dimensions at\nthis spatial scale.

In many cases, it is not clear if homophily is\nthe result of a socialization process, where individuals change their traits\naccording to the dominance of that trait in their local social networks, or if\nit results from a selection process, in which individuals reshape their social\nnetworks so that their traits match those in the new environment. Here we\ndemonstrate the detailed temporal formation of strong homophily in academic\nachievements of high school and university students. We analyze a unique\ndataset that contains information about the detailed time evolution of a\nfriendship network of 6,000 students across 42 months. Combining the evolving\nsocial network data with the time series of the academic performance (GPA) of\nindividual students, we show that academic homophily is a result of selection:\nstudents prefer to gradually reorganize their social networks according to\ntheir performance levels, rather than adapting their performance to the level\nof their local group. We find no signs for a pull effect, where a social\nenvironment of good performers motivates bad students to improve their\nperformance. We are able to understand the underlying dynamics of grades and\nnetworks with a simple model. The lack of a social pull effect in classical\neducational settings could have important implications for the understanding of\nthe observed persistence of segregation, inequality and social immobility in\nsocieties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2016 13:24:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}

However, in the ultraviolet the flux\nemitted by a secondary with T eff > 5500 ~ 6000 K may prevail over that of the\nprimary, and then it can be used to search for candidates to binary AGB stars.\nIn this work, theoretical atmosphere models are used to calculate the UV excess\nin the GALEX near- and far-UV bands due to a main-sequence companion. After\nanalysing a sample of confirmed binary AGB stars, we propose as a criterium for\nbinarity: (1) the detection of the AGB star in the GALEX far-UV band and/or (2)\na GALEX near-UV observed-to-predicted flux ratio > 20.

The excess in the GALEX near- and\nfar-UV bands cannot be attributed to a single temperature companion star, thus\nsuggesting that the UV emission of the secondary might be absorbed by the\nextended atmosphere and circumstellar envelope of the primary or that UV\nemission is produced in accretion flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2016 13:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-30"}

The classical Kalman filter is no longer computationally feasible in\nsuch a high dimensional context. This problem can often be resolved by\nexploiting the underlying multiscale structure, applying the full Kalman\nfiltering procedures only to the large scale vari- ables, and estimating the\nsmall scale variables with proper statistical strategies, including\nmultiplicative inflation, representation model error in the observations, and\ncrude localization. The resulting two-scale reduced filters can have close to\noptimal numerical filtering skill based on previous numerical evidence. Yet, no\nrigorous explanation exists for this success, because these modifications\ncreate unavoidable bias and model error. This paper contributes to this issue\nby establishing a new error analysis framework for two different reduced random\nKalman filters, valid independent of the large dimension. The first part of our\nresults examines the fidelity of the covariance estimators, which is essential\nfor accurate uncertainty quantification. In a simplified setting, this is\ndemonstrated by showing the true error covariance is dominated by its\nestimators. In general settings, the Mahalanobis error and its intrinsic\ndissipation can indicate covariance fidelity. The second part develops upper\nbounds for the covariance estimators by comparing with proper Kalman filters.\nCombining both results, the classical tools for Kalman filters can be used as\na-priori performance criteria for the reduced filters. In applications, these\ncriteria guarantee the reduced filters are robust, and accurate for small noise\nsystems. They also shed light on how to tune the reduced filters for stochastic\nturbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2016 13:30:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-30"}

This means that 99.7 % of all known modulated\nstars have BL periods between 7.6 and 478 days. We discuss the identification\nof long modulation periods and show, that a significant percentage of stars\nshowing long-term period variations could be classified as BL stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2016 14:22:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

The recently developed\nmathematical framework of multi-layer networks allows to perform an analysis of\nthe human brain where the structural and functional layers are considered\ntogether. In this work we describe how to classify the subgraphs of a multiplex\nnetwork, and we extend motif analysis to networks with an arbitrary number of\nlayers.

The LOD is\nrelated to the limitation of instruments in measuring markers at a relatively\nlow level. As a consequence, the outcome data set from the quantification step\nof proteomic analysis often consists of a reduced list of peaks where any peak\nintensities below the detection limit threshold are reported as missings. In\nthis work, we propose the use of censored data methodology to handle spectral\nmeasurements within the presence of LOD, recognizing that those have been\ncensored due to left-censoring mechanisms on low-abundance proteins.

Assuming merely weak convexity, we show that LALM owns $O(1/t)$\nconvergence if parameters are kept fixed during all the iterations and can be\naccelerated to $O(1/t^2)$ if the parameters are adapted, where $t$ is the\nnumber of total iterations.\n  The second method is the accelerated linearized alternating direction method\nof multipliers (LADMM). In addition to the composite convexity, it further\nassumes two-block structure on the objective. Different from classic ADMM, our\nmethod allows linearization to the objective and also augmented term to make\nthe update simple. Assuming strong convexity on one block variable, we show\nthat LADMM also enjoys $O(1/t^2)$ convergence with adaptive parameters. This\nresult is a significant improvement over that in [Goldstein et. al, SIIMS'14],\nwhich requires strong convexity on both block variables and no linearization to\nthe objective or augmented term.\n  Numerical experiments are performed on quadratic programming, image\ndenoising, and support vector machine. The proposed accelerated methods are\ncompared to nonaccelerated ones and also existing accelerated methods. The\nresults demonstrate the validness of acceleration and superior performance of\nthe proposed methods over existing ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2016 15:26:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-30"}

This alternative mechanism is based on the\nHollands-Wald concept of a minimum wavelength for the emergence of quantum\nfluctuations into the semi-classical universe. A cosmology with zero active\nmass does not have a horizon problem, so it does not need inflation to solve\nthis particular (non) issue.

Under neutron irradiation, rhenium, which is produced by\nnuclear transmutation, has been found to precipitate in elongated precipitates\nforming thermodynamic intermetallic phases at concentrations well below the\nsolubility limit. Recent measurements have shown that Re precipitation can lead\nto substantial hardening, which may have a detrimental effect on the fracture\ntoughness of W alloys. This puzzle of sub-solubility precipitation points to\nthe role played by irradiation induced defects, specifically mixed solute-W\ninterstitials. Here, using first-principles calculations based on density\nfunctional theory, we study the energetics of mixed interstitial defects in\nW-Re, W-V, and W-Ti alloys, as well as the heat of mixing for each\nsubstitutional solute. We find that mixed interstitials in all systems are\nstrongly attracted to each other with binding energies of -2.4 to -3.2 eV and\nform interstitial pairs that are aligned along parallel first-neighbor <111>\nstrings. Low barriers for defect translation and rotation enable defect\nagglomeration and alignment even at moderate temperatures. We propose that\nthese elongated agglomerates of mixed-interstitials may act as precursors for\nthe formation of needle-shaped intermetallic precipitates. This\ninterstitial-based mechanism is not limited to radiation induced segregation\nand precipitation in W-Re alloys but is also applicable to other body-centered\ncubic alloys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2016 14:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}
