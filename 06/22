The former issue can be resolved\nby future observations. But the latter issue can be resolved now, if we pay\nattention to what is expected from theoretical considerations. The question of\nwhether a correlation has been found between the power outputs of few objects\nand the spins of their BHs is moot because BH beam power does not scale with\nthe square of the spin of the BH. We show that the theoretical BH beam power is\na strongly nonlinear function of spin that cannot be approximated by a\nquadratic relation, as is generally stated when the influence of the magnetic\nfield is not accounted for in the \\cite{bla77} model.

We investigated a biophysical\nmodel of gene regulation, where the fractional occupancy of a transcription\nfactor (TF) on the cis-regulated promoter site it binds to is determined by\nbinding energy (-{\\Delta}G) and TF dosage. Transcription and gene expression\nproceed when the TF is bound to the promoter. In diploids, individuals may be\nheterozygous at the cis-site, at the TF's coding region, or at the TF's own\npromoter, which determines allele-specific dosage. We find that when the TF's\ncoding region is heterozygous, TF alleles compete for occupancy at the cis\nsites and the tighter-binding TF is dominant in proportion to the difference in\nbinding strength. When the TF's own promoter is heterozygous, the TF produced\nat the higher dosage is also dominant. Cis-site heterozygotes have additive\nexpression and therefore codominant phenotypes. Binding dominance propagates to\naffect the expression of downstream loci and it is sensitive in both magnitude\nand direction to genetic background, but its detectability often attenuates.\nWhile binding dominance is inevitable at the molecular level, it is difficult\nto detect in the phenotype under some biophysical conditions, more so when TF\ndosage is high and allele-specific binding affinities are similar.

We interpret these features as a result of a charge-Kondo\neffect where hole dopants act as degenerate Kondo impurities by opening\nadditional pseudo-spin scattering channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 17:21:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 18:21:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 14 Oct 2017 11:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

The scalar field responsible for thermal inflation requires a large\nnon-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) and a flat potential.

Manual scoring of IHC images represents a\nlogistical challenge, as the process is labor intensive and time consuming.\nSince the last decade, computational methods have been developed to enable the\napplication of quantitative methods for the analysis and interpretation of\nprotein expression in IHC images. These methods have not yet replaced manual\nscoring for the assessment of IHC in the majority of diagnostic laboratories\nand in many large-scale research studies. An alternative approach is\ncrowdsourcing the quantification of IHC images to an undefined crowd.

In\nthis paper, we classify the M2M uplink data into multiple QoS classes and use\nsigmoidal function to map the delay requirements of each class onto utility\nfunctions. We propose a proportionally fair delay-optimal multiclass packet\nscheduler at AS that maximizes a system utility metric. We note that the\naverage class delay under any work-conserving scheduling policy can be realized\nby appropriately time-sharing between all possible preemptive priority\npolicies. Therefore the optimal scheduler is determined using an iterative\nprocess to determine the optimal time-sharing between all priority scheduling\npolicies, such that it results in maximum system utility. The proposed\nscheduler can be implemented online with reduced complexity due to the\niterative optimization process. We then extend this work to determine jointly\noptimal MA-AS channel allocation and packet scheduling scheme at the MAs and\nAS. We first formulate a joint optimization problem that is solved centrally at\nthe AS and then propose a low complexity distributed optimization problem\nsolved independently at MAs and AS. We show that the distributed optimization\nsolution converges quickly to the centralized optimization result with minimal\ninformation exchange overhead between MAs and AS. Using Monte-Carlo\nsimulations, we verify the optimality of the proposed scheduler and show that\nit outperforms other state-of-the-art packet schedulers such as weighted round\nrobin, max-weight scheduler etc. Another desirable feature of proposed\nscheduler is low delay jitter for delay-sensitive traffic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 18:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

In three dimensions, quasilocal\nmarginal Fermi liquids arise both at the SDW and CDW critical points : the\nspeed of the collective mode along the ordering wavevector is logarithmically\nrenormalized to zero compared to that of Fermi velocity. Below three\ndimensions, however, the SDW and CDW critical points exhibit drastically\ndifferent behaviors. At the SDW critical point, a stable anisotropic non-Fermi\nliquid state is realized for small $\\epsilon$, where not only time but also\ndifferent spatial coordinates develop distinct anomalous dimensions. The\nnon-Fermi liquid exhibits an emergent algebraic nesting as the patches of Fermi\nsurface are deformed into a universal power-law shape near the hot spots. Due\nto the anisotropic scaling, the energy of incoherent spin fluctuations disperse\nwith different power laws in different momentum directions. At the CDW critical\npoint, on the other hand, the perturbative expansion breaks down immediately\nbelow three dimensions as the interaction renormalizes the speed of charge\nfluctuations to zero within a finite renormalization group scale through a\ntwo-loop effect. The difference originates from the fact that the vertex\ncorrection anti-screens the coupling at the SDW critical point whereas it\nscreens at the CDW critical point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 18:25:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 02:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-22"}

To achieve this objective, intrusion detection\nsystems (IDS) that are able to detect malicious behavior can be deployed.\nHowever, practical IDS are imperfect and sometimes they may produce false\nalarms for a normal system behavior. Since alarms need to be investigated for\nany potential damage, a large number of false alarms may increase the\noperational costs significantly. Thus, IDS need to be configured properly, as\noversensitive IDS could detect attacks early but at the cost of a higher number\nof false alarms. Similarly, IDS with low sensitivity could reduce the false\nalarms while increasing the time to detect the attacks.

However, evolution via the slingshot mechanism may\nbe ineffective if the reservoir of interacting stars is not readily\nreplenished, and the binary shrinking may come to a halt at roughly a parsec\nseparation. Recent simulations suggest that the departure from spherical\nsymmetry, naturally produced in merger remnants, leads to efficient loss cone\nrefilling, preventing the binary from stalling. However, current N-body\nsimulations able to accurately follow the evolution of BHBs are limited to very\nmodest particle numbers. Brownian motion may artificially enhance the loss cone\nrefilling rate in low-N simulations, where the binary encounters a larger\npopulation of stars due its random motion. Here we study the significance of\nBrownian motion of BHBs in merger remnants in the context of the final parsec\nproblem. We simulate mergers with various particle numbers (from 8k to 1M) and\nwith several density profiles. Moreover, we compare simulations where the BHB\nis fixed at the centre of the merger remnant with simulations where the BHB is\nfree to random walk. We find that Brownian motion does not significantly affect\nthe evolution of BHBs in simulations with particle numbers in excess of one\nmillion, and that the hardening measured in merger simulations is due to\ncollisionless loss cone refilling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 19:59:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

We\nattribute this effect to the development of preferentially eccentric/radial\norbits in the outer regions of star clusters as they are expanding into their\ntidal limitation.\n  We explore the implications of the evolution of the fraction of prograde and\nretrograde stars for the evolution of the cluster internal rotation, and its\ndependence on the initial structural properties. Although all the systems\nstudied here evolve towards an approximately solid-body internal rotation with\nangular velocity equal to about half of the angular velocity of the cluster\norbital motion around the host galaxy, the evolutionary history of the radial\nprofile of the cluster internal angular velocity depends on the cluster initial\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 20:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

Here, based on ab initio density-functional calculations, we report a\ntheoretical investigation of the SO-driven band inversion in isostructural\nbismuth and antimony chalcogenide TIs from the viewpoint of its interplay with\nthe crystal-field effect. We calculate the SO-induced energy shift of states in\nthe top valence and bottom conduction manifolds and reproduce this behavior\nusing a simple one-atom model adjusted to incorporate the crystal-field effect.\nThe crystal-field splitting is shown to compete with the SO coupling, that is,\nstronger crystal-field splitting leads to weaker SO band shift. We further show\nhow both these effects can be controlled by changing the chemical composition,\nwhereas the crystal-field splitting can be tuned by means of uniaxial strain.\nThese results provide a practical guidance to the rational design of novel TIs\nas well as to controlling the properties of existing materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 20:38:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-23"}

Method: A $^{26}$P fast beam produced using nuclear\nfragmentation was implanted into a planar germanium detector.

Social network\nanalysis, cookie-based advertising, and government surveillance are all\nevidence of the use of data for commercial and national interests.

Frameworks such\nas differential privacy offer machine learning algorithms methods to guarantee\nlimits to information disclosure, but they are seldom implemented. Recently,\nhowever, developers have made significant efforts to undermine tracking through\nobfuscation tools that hide user characteristics in a sea of noise. These\nservices highlight an emerging clash between tracking and data obfuscation. In\nthis paper, we conceptualize this conflict through a dynamic game between users\nand a machine learning algorithm that uses empirical risk minimization. First,\na machine learner declares a privacy protection level, and then users respond\nby choosing their own perturbation amounts. We study the interaction between\nthe users and the learner using a Stackelberg game. The utility functions\nquantify accuracy using expected loss and privacy in terms of the bounds of\ndifferential privacy. In equilibrium, we find selfish users tend to cause\nsignificant utility loss to trackers by perturbing heavily, in a phenomenon\nreminiscent of public good games. Trackers, however, can improve the balance by\nproactively perturbing the data themselves. While other work in this area has\nstudied privacy markets and mechanism design for truthful reporting of user\ninformation, we take a different viewpoint by considering both user and learner\nperturbation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 21:14:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 17:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-11"}

Valley exciton polarization has\nbeen created in the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers using\nexcitation by circularly polarized light and has been detected both optically\nand electrically.

Recent studies show that using image\nfeatures generated by pooling convolutional layer feature maps (CFMs) of a\npretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) leads to promising performance\nfor this task. However, due to the global pooling strategy adopted in those\nworks, the generated image feature is less robust to image clutter and tends to\nbe contaminated by the irrelevant image patterns. In this article, we alleviate\nthis drawback by proposing a novel reranking algorithm using CFMs to refine the\nretrieval result obtained by existing methods. Our key idea, called query\nadaptive matching (QAM), is to first represent the CFMs of each image by a set\nof base regions which can be freely combined into larger regions-of-interest.\nThen the similarity between the query and a candidate image is measured by the\nbest similarity score that can be attained by comparing the query feature and\nthe feature pooled from a combined region.

Finally, we compare our space\ndensity with predictions of quasar activation merger models, whose calibration\nis based on optically luminous AGN.

The key difference between mobile search and desktop\nsearch is that information presentation is limited to the screen space of the\nmobile device. Thus, major search engines have adopted a new type of search\nresult presentation, known as \\textit{information cards}, in which each card\npresents summarized results from one domain/vertical, for a given query, to\naugment the standard blue-links search results. While it has been widely\nacknowledged that information cards are particularly suited to mobile user\nexperience, it is also challenging to optimize such result sets. Typically,\nuser engagement metrics like query reformulation are based on whole ranked list\nof cards for each query and most traditional learning to rank algorithms\nrequire per-item relevance labels. In this paper, we investigate the\npossibility of interpreting query reformulation into effective relevance labels\nfor query-card pairs. We inherit the concept of conventional learning-to-rank,\nand propose pointwise, pairwise and listwise interpretations for query\nreformulation. In addition, we propose a learning-to-label strategy that learns\nthe contribution of each card, with respect to a query, where such\ncontributions can be used as labels for training card ranking models. We\nutilize a state-of-the-art ranking model and demonstrate the effectiveness of\nproposed mechanisms on a large-scale mobile data from a major search engine,\nshowing that models trained from labels derived from user engagement can\nsignificantly outperform ones trained from human judgment labels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2016 04:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-23"}

For these analyses, signatures that mimic such leptons\npresent a `fake lepton' background that must be estimated. Since the magnitude\nof this background depends strongly upon details of the detector response, it\ncan be difficult to estimate with simulation. One data-driven approach is the\n`matrix method', in which two categories of leptons are defined (`loose' and\n`tight'), with the tight category being a subset of the loose category. Using\nthe populations of leptons in each category in the analysis sample, and the\nefficiencies for both real and fake leptons in the loose category to satisfy\nthe criteria for the tight category, the fake background yield can be\nestimated. This paper describes a Poisson likelihood implementation of the\nmatrix method, which provides a more precise, reliable, and robust estimate of\nthe fake background yield compared to an analytic solution. This implementation\nalso provides a reliable estimate of the background for cases in which the\nanalysis selection permits more loose leptons than tight leptons, potentially\nallowing for greater selection efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2016 04:55:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-23"}

We propose and study a new extension\nof this game to more than two stacks, which we call Twyst-off, inspired by the\nReidemeister moves of knot theory. From an ordered sequence of stacks of tiles,\na player may either remove a positive number of tiles from one of the two end\nstacks, or remove the same positive number of tiles from two consecutive\nstacks.

Although the significance of QKD is undisputed,\nits feasibility has been questioned because of certain limitations in the\npractical application of real-life QKD systems. It is a common belief the lack\nof perfect single-photon source and the existence of detection loss will\nhandicap the feasibility of QKD by creating security loopholes and distance\nlimitations. The measurement device independent QKD (MDIQKD) with decoy-state\nmethod removes the security threats from both the imperfect single-photon\nsource and the detection loss. Lengthening the distance and improving the key\nrate of QKD with such a superior method is thus the central issue in the\npractical application of QKD. Here, we report the results of MDIQKD over 404 km\nof ultralow-loss optical fibre and 311 km of standard optical fibre by\nemploying an optimized four-intensity decoy-state method. This record-breaking\nimplementation of MDIQKD method not only provides a new distance record for\nboth MDIQKD and all types of QKD systems, more significantly, it achieves a\ndistance that the traditional BB84 QKD would not be able to achieve with the\nsame detection devices even with ideal single-phone sources. For the first\ntime, our work demonstrates that with the MDIQKD method, imperfect devices can\nachieve better results than what ideal sources could have achieved.

Our experiments in a device made of the\nPMN-PT/Terfenol-D multiferroic heterostructure confirm that the states of\n{\\alpha} can be well controlled between positive and negative by applying\nselective electric fields. Consequently, two-level, four-level, and eight-level\nnonvolatile memory devices are demonstrated at room temperature. This kind of\nmultilevel magnetoelectric memory retains all the advantages of ferroelectric\nrandom access memory but overcomes the drawback of destructive reading of\npolarization. In contrast, the reading of {\\alpha} is nondestructive and highly\nefficient in a parallel way, with an independent reading coil shared by all the\nmemory cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2016 08:39:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-23"}

On open magnetic field lines, the helicity injected by the Sun\nis largely output to the solar wind, provided that the coronal relaxation is\nsufficiently fast.

Plasmonic based lasing relies on the\npopulation inversion of emitters (such as organic fluorophores) along with\nfeedback provided by plasmonic resonances. In this regime, known as weak light\nmatter coupling, the radiative characteristics of the system can be described\nby the Purcell effect. Strong light matter coupling between the molecular\nexcitons and electromagnetic field generated by the plasmonic structures leads\nto the formation of hybrid quasi-particles known as plasmon exciton polaritons\n(PEPs). Due to the bosonic character of these quasi particles, exciton\npolariton condensation can lead to laser-like emission at much lower threshold\npowers than in conventional photon lasers.

Within this framework, particles are accelerated at supernova\nremnant shocks and then released in the interstellar medium. The mechanism\nthrough which CRs are released and the way in which they propagate still remain\nopen issues. The main difficulty is the high non-linearity of the problem: CRs\nthemselves excite the magnetic turbulence that confines them close to their\nsources. We solve numerically the coupled differential equations describing the\nevolution in space and time of the escaping particles and of the waves\ngenerated through the CR streaming instability. The warm ionized and warm\nneutral phases of the interstellar medium are considered. These phases occupy\nthe largest fraction of the disc volume, where most supernovae explode, and are\ncharacterised by the significant presence of neutral particles. The friction\nbetween those neutrals and ions results in a very effective wave damping\nmechanism. It is found that streaming instability affects the propagation of\nCRs even in the presence of ion-neutral friction. The diffusion coefficient can\nbe suppressed by more than a factor of $\\sim 2$ over a region of few tens of pc\naround the remnant. The suppression increases for smaller distances.

Early term discovery systems focused on\nidentifying isolated recurring patterns in a corpus, while more recent\nfull-coverage systems attempt to completely segment and cluster the audio into\nword-like units---effectively performing unsupervised speech recognition. This\narticle presents the first attempt we are aware of to apply such a system to\nlarge-vocabulary multi-speaker data. Our system uses a Bayesian modelling\nframework with segmental word representations: each word segment is represented\nas a fixed-dimensional acoustic embedding obtained by mapping the sequence of\nfeature frames to a single embedding vector. We compare our system on English\nand Xitsonga datasets to state-of-the-art baselines, using a variety of\nmeasures including word error rate (obtained by mapping the unsupervised output\nto ground truth transcriptions). Very high word error rates are reported---in\nthe order of 70--80% for speaker-dependent and 80--95% for speaker-independent\nsystems---highlighting the difficulty of this task.

The reduction ansatz for the eleven-dimensional metric,\nand for some of the components of the 4-form field strength, were found at that\ntime, and recently the complete expression for the 4-form reduction has been\nobtained.

Native defects are responsible in many cases, but extrinsic\ndopants may also act as their own compensation when occupying an alternate\nlattice site. Suppressing the concentrations of compensating defects during\nprocessing close to thermal equilibrium is difficult because formation\nenthalpies are lowered as the Fermi level moves towards the majority band edge.\nExcess carriers, introduced for example by photogeneration, modify the\nformation enthalpy of semiconductor defects and thus can be harnessed during\ncrystal growth or annealing to suppress such defect populations. Herein we\ndevelop a rigorous and general model for defect formation in the presence of\nsteady-state excess carrier concentrations by combining the standard\nquasi-chemical formalism with a detailed-balance description that is applicable\nfor any defect state in the bandgap. Considering the quasi-Fermi levels as\nchemical potentials, we demonstrate that increasing the minority carrier\nconcentration increases the formation enthalpy for typical compensating\ncenters, thus suppressing their formation. This effect is illustrated for the\nspecific example of native GaSb antisite acceptors in nominally un-doped and\nextrinsically n-type doped GaSb. The model also predicts reductions in the\nconcentration of ionized scattering centers as well as increased mobility.\nWhile our treatment is generalized for excess carrier injection or generation\nin semiconductors by any means, we provide a set of guidelines for applying the\nconcept in photoassisted physical vapor deposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2016 15:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-23"}

Bell's nonlocality for\nquantum states is usually detected by violation of some Bell's inequalities,\nsuch as Clause-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality for two qubits. Steering is a\nmanifestation of nonlocality intermediate between entanglement and Bell's\nnonlocality. This peculiar feature has led to a curious quantum phenomenon, the\none-way Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. The one-way steering was an important\nopen question presented in 2007, and positively answered in 2014 by Bowles\n\\emph{et al.}, who presented a simple class of one-way steerable states in a\ntwo-qubit system with at least thirteen projective measurements. The inspiring\nresult for the first time theoretically confirms quantum nonlocality can be\nfundamentally asymmetric. Here, we propose another curious quantum phenomenon:\nBell nonlocal states can be constructed from some steerable states. This novel\nfinding not only offers a distinctive way to study Bell's nonlocality without\nBell's inequality but with steering inequality, but also may avoid locality\nloophole in Bell's tests and make Bell's nonlocality easier for demonstration.\nFurthermore, a nine-setting steering inequality has also been presented for\ndeveloping more efficient one-way steering and detecting some Bell nonlocal\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2016 03:33:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 03:49:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-11"}

However, such problems are intractable on digital\ncomputers based on the von Neumann architecture, thus creating the need for\nalternative solutions to tackle such problems. Recently, a deterministic,\ncontinuous-time dynamical system (CTDS) was proposed (Nat.Phys. {\\bf 7}(12),\n966 (2011)) to solve a representative NP-complete problem, Boolean\nSatisfiability (SAT). This solver shows polynomial analog time-complexity on\neven the hardest benchmark $k$-SAT ($k \\geq 3$) formulas, but at an energy cost\nthrough exponentially driven auxiliary variables. This paper presents a novel\nanalog hardware SAT solver, AC-SAT, implementing the CTDS via incorporating\nnovel, analog circuit design ideas. AC-SAT is intended to be used as a\nco-processor and is programmable for handling different problem specifications.\nIt is especially effective for solving hard $k$-SAT problem instances that are\nchallenging for algorithms running on digital machines. Furthermore, with its\nmodular design, AC-SAT can readily be extended to solve larger size problems,\nwhile the size of the circuit grows linearly with the product of the number of\nvariables and number of clauses.

To this aim, a second gradient, hyperelastic, initially\northotropic continuum theory is proposed to model fibrous composite interlocks\nat finite strains. In particular, the present work explores the relationship\nbetween the onset of wrinkling appearing during the simulation of the deep\ndrawing of a woven fabric and the use of a second gradient model. It is shown\nthat the introduction of second gradient terms accounting for the description\nof in-plane and out-of-plane bending rigidities, decreases the onset of\nwrinkles during the simulation of deep-drawing.\n  In this work, a quadratic energy, roughly proportional to the square of the\ncurvature of the fibers, is presented and implemented in the simulations.

The results obtained in second gradient simulations are\ndescriptive of the experimental evidence of deep drawing whose description is\ntargeted in this work. The present paper provides additional evidence of the\nfact that first gradient continuum theories alone cannot be considered fully\ndescriptive of the behavior of dry woven composite reinforcements.
