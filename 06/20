According to that study a toxin expelled by one of the\nstrains can be responsible for the stable maintenance of the two strain types.\nWe propose a resource-based model in which an efficient strain with a slow\nmetabolic rate competes with a second strain type which presents a fast but\ninefficient metabolism. Moreover, the model assumes that the inefficient strain\nproduces a toxin as a byproduct. This toxin affects the growth rate of both\nstrains with different strength. Through an extensive exploration of the\nparameter space we determine the situations at which the coexistence of the two\nstrains is possible. Interestingly, we observe that the resource influx rate\nplays a key role in the maintenance of the two strain types. In a scenario of\nresource scarcity the inefficient is favored, though as the resource influx\nrate is augmented the coexistence becomes possible and its domain is enlarged.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2016 19:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

Existing statistical element selection (SES) design method\ncan improve transistor matching property, but it falls short of being a general\ncalibration method due to its limited calibration range. In this dissertation,\nwe propose a high resolution digital calibration method, called extended\nstatistical element selection (ESES). As compared to the SES method, the ESES\nmethod not only provides wider calibration range, but also it results in higher\ncalibration yield with same calibration resolution target. Two types of ESES\nbased calibration application in analog/RF circuits are also proposed. One is\ncurrent source calibration and the other is phase/delay calibration. To verify\nthis proposed digital calibration method in circuit implementation, we\ndesigned, fabricated and tested a wideband harmonic rejection receiver design.\nThe receiver utilizes ESES-based gain and phase error calibration for improving\nharmonic rejection ratios. With the high calibration resolution provided by the\nESES method, after calibration, we achieved best-in-class harmonic rejection\nratios. To extend the application of the proposed method, we further designed a\ncurrent-steering D/A data converter (CS-DAC). The CS-DAC utilizes ESES-based\namplitude and timing error calibration for improving linearity performance.\nSimulation results showed that we can achieve more than one order of magnitude\nlinearity improvement after performing ESES-based calibration in the CS-DAC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2016 19:29:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-21"}

This partition can\nbe understood as a bet-hedging strategy that evolves in response to stochastic\nstarvation times. A genotype is defined by a different balance between each\ntype of cells. In this framework, if the ecological conditions are defined in\nterms of the mean starvation time (i.e. time between onset of starvation and\nthe arrival of a new food pulse), a single genotype dominates each environment,\nwhich is inconsistent with the huge genetic diversity observed in nature.

The lab-measured\nreproductive skew in the spores of chimeras indicates strong social antagonism;\nthis should result in low genotypic diversity, which is inconsistent with\nobservations from nature.

Two complementary\nchallenges arise when programming such systems. When objects interact, their\nstate machines must be \"compatible\", so that services are requested only when\nthey are available. Dually, when objects refine other objects, their state\nmachines must be \"compliant\", so that services are honoured whenever they are\npromised.\n  In this paper we show how the idea of multiparty compatibility from the\nsession types literature can be applied to both of these problems. We present\nan untyped language in which concurrent objects are checked automatically for\ncompatibility and compliance. For simple objects, checking can be exhaustive\nand has the feel of a type system. More complex objects can be partially\nvalidated via test cases, leading to a methodology closer to continuous\ntesting.

However, the\ncomputational time of such MILP reformulations grows dramatically, once the\nnetwork size increases, scheduling horizon increases, or randomness is taken\ninto consideration. In this paper, we take a fundamentally different approach\nand propose effective and customized convex programming tools to solve the\nstrategic bidding problem for producers in nodal electricity markets. Our\napproach is inspired by the Schmudgen's Positivstellensatz Theorem in\nsemi-algebraic geometry; but then we go through several steps based upon both\nconvex optimization and mixed-integer programming that results in obtaining\nclose to optimal bidding solutions, as evidenced by several numerical case\nstudies, besides having a huge advantage on reducing computation time.

Each unicast index-coding instances can be\nfully described by a directed graph and vice versa, where each vertex\ncorresponds to one receiver. For any directed graph representing a unicast\nindex-coding instance, we show that if a maximum acyclic induced subgraph\n(MAIS) is obtained by removing two or fewer vertices from the graph, then the\nminimum index codelength equals the number of vertices in the MAIS, and linear\ncodes are optimal for the corresponding index-coding instance.

In the\ncase of rectangular representations $R=[r^s]$ we found an evidence that the\ncorresponding differential expansion miraculously factorizes and can be\nobtained from that for the twist knots. This reduces the problem of rectangular\nexclusive Racah to constructing the answers for just a few twist knots. We\ndevelop a recent conjecture on the structure of differential expansion for the\nsimplest members of this family (the trefoil and the figure-eight knot) and\nprovide the exhaustive answer for the first unknown case of $R=[33]$.

As such,\nmultiple symbols can be simultaneously transmitted with fractional\ndegrees-of-freedom (DoF). Of particular interest is when the one dimensional\nspace is partitioned into two fractional dimensions. In such scenario, the\ninterfering signals are confined to one sub-space and the intended signal is\nconfined to the other sub-space. Existing real interference alignment schemes\nachieve near-capacity performance at high SNR for time-invariant channels.\nHowever, such techniques yield poor achievable rate at finite SNR, which is of\ninterest from a practical point of view. In this paper, we propose a radically\nnovel nonlinear interference alignment technique, which we refer to as\nInterference Dissolution (ID). ID allows to break-up a one-dimensional space\ninto two fractional dimensions while achieving near-capacity performance for\nthe entire SNR range. This is achieved by aligning signals by signals, as\nopposed to aligning signals by the channel. We introduce ID by considering a\ntime-invariant MISO channel. This channel has a one-dimensional space and\noffers one DoF. We show that, by breaking-up the one dimensional space into two\nsub-spaces, ID achieves a rate of two symbols per channel use while providing\n$\\frac{1}{2}$ DoF for each symbol. We analyze the performance of the proposed\nID scheme in terms of the achievable rate and the symbol error rate. In\ncharacterizing the achievable rate of ID for the entire SNR range, we prove\nthat, assuming Gaussian signals, the sum achievable rate is at most one bit\naway from the capacity. We present numerical examples to validate the\ntheoretical analysis. We also compare the performance of ID in terms of the\nachievable rate performance to that of existing schemes and demonstrate ID's\nsuperiority.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 09:01:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 15:23:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 20:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-09"}

We show that\nLAMBADA exemplifies a wide range of linguistic phenomena, and that none of\nseveral state-of-the-art language models reaches accuracy above 1% on this\nnovel benchmark. We thus propose LAMBADA as a challenging test set, meant to\nencourage the development of new models capable of genuine understanding of\nbroad context in natural language text.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 09:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-21"}

Recent works have started to\ninvestigate the possibility to use receivers based on energy detection (ED),\nwhere a single data stream is decoded based on the channel and noise energy.\nThe asymptotic features of the massive receiver array lead to a system where\nthe impact of the noise becomes predictable due to a noise hardening effect.\nThis in effect extends the communication range compared to the receiver with a\nsmall number of antennas, as the latter is limited by the unpredictability of\nthe additive noise. When the channel has a large number of spatial degrees of\nfreedom, the system becomes robust to imperfect channel knowledge due to\nchannel hardening. We propose two detection methods based on the instantaneous\nand average channel energy, respectively. Meanwhile, we design the detection\nthresholds based on the asymptotic properties of the received energy.\nDifferently from existing works, we analyze the scaling law behavior of the\nsymbol-error-rate (SER). When the instantaneous channel energy is known, the\nperformance of ED approaches that of the coherent detection in high SNR\nscenarios. When the receiver relies on the average channel energy, our\nperformance analysis is based on the exact SER, rather than an approximation.\nIt is shown that the logarithm of SER decreases linearly as a function of the\nnumber of antennas. Additionally, a saturation appears at high SNR for PAM\nconstellations of order larger than two, due to the uncertainty on the channel\nenergy. Simulation results show that ED, with a much lower complexity, achieves\npromising performance both in Rayleigh fading channels and in sparse channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 09:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

Fast evaluation of integral transforms on such an adaptive grid\nrequires an algorithm that relies on the smoothness of the continuum kernel\nonly, independent of its discrete form. A multilevel algorithm with this\nproperty was presented in [A. Brandt and C.H. Venner, SIAM J. Sci. Stat.\nComput. 19 (1998) pp.468-492] [Bra1998]. Ref. [Bra1998] shows that already on a\nuniform grid the new algorithm is more efficient than earlier fast evaluation\nalgorithms, and elaborates the application to one-dimensional transforms. The\npresent work analyses the extension and implementation of the algorithm for\nmultidimensional transforms. The analysis conveys that the multidimensional\nextension is nontrivial, on account of the occurence of nonlocal corrections.\nHowever, by virtue of the asymptotic smoothness properties of the continuum\nkernel, these corrections can again be evaluated fast. By recursion, it is then\npossible to obtain the optimal work estimates indicated in [Bra1998].\nCurrently, only uniform grids are considered. Detailed numerical results will\nbe presented for a two dimensional model problem.

Since the temporal and spatial\nperiods are related simply through the fast wave speed, we quantify the\nproperties of secondary waves by examining the dependence of the average\ntemporal period ($\\bar{p}$) on the initial pulse width ($w_0$) as well as the\ndensity contrast ($\\delta_\\rho$) and correlation length ($L_c$) that\ncharacterize the randomness of the equilibrium density profiles.

The two sets of observations are irreconcilable and to settle this, it is\nimportant to first verify if the low temperature magnetic transitions are\nintrinsic to BiFeO3 or some of them are offshoots of oxygen vacancies and the\nassociated redox reaction involving conversion of Fe3+ to Fe2+.

It is often stated that a discovery of the GWs\nestablishes the quantum fluctuation of vacuum during the cosmic inflation.\nSince the GWs could also be generated by source fields, however, we need to\ncheck if a sizable signal exists due to such source fields before reaching a\nfirm conclusion when the B-mode is discovered. Source fields of particular\ntypes can generate non-Gaussianity (NG) in the GWs. Testing statistics of the\nB-mode is a powerful way of detecting such NG. As a concrete example, we show a\nmodel in which a gauge field sources chiral GWs via a pseudoscalar coupling,\nand forecast the detection significance at the future CMB satellite LiteBIRD.\nEffects of residual foregrounds and lensing B-mode are both taken into account.\nWe find the B-mode bispectrum \"BBB\" is in particular sensitive to the\nsource-field NG, which is detectable at LiteBIRD with a $> 3 \\sigma$\nsignificance. Therefore the search for the \"BBB\" will be indispensable toward\nunambiguously establishing quantum fluctuation of vacuum when the B-mode is\ndiscovered. We also introduced the Minkowski functional to detect the NGs.\nWhile we find that the Minkowski functional is less efficient than the\nharmonic-space bispectrum estimator, it still serves as a useful cross check.\nFinally, we also discuss the possibility of extracting clean information on\nparity violation of GWs, and new types of parity-violating observables induced\nby lensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 12:25:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-10"}

Hence, employing\none of the standard regression models, as is typically done, is insufficient\nfor this kind of problem, as most models implement either one-to-one or\nmany-to-one mappings.

In\naddition, the machine can rapidly expand the compressed gas in a controlled way\nby pulling the piston outwards again.

These detections have strengthened\nour belief that compact binary coalescences (CBCs) are the most promising GW\ndetection prospects accessible to ground-based interferometric detectors. For\ndetecting CBC signals it is of vital importance to characterize and identify\nnon-Gaussian and non-stationary noise in these detectors. In this work we model\ntwo important classes of transient artifacts that contribute to this noise and\nadversely affect the detector sensitivity to CBC signals. One of them is the\nsine-Gaussian glitch, characterized by a central frequency $f_0$ and a quality\nfactor $Q$ and the other is the chirping sine-Gaussian glitch, which is\ncharacterized by $f_0$, $Q$ as well as a chirp parameter. We study the response\na bank of compact binary inspiral templates has to these two families of\nglitches when they are used to match-filter data containing any of these\nglitches. Two important characteristics of this response are the distributions\nof the signal-to-noise ratio and the timelag of individual templates. We show\nhow these distributions differ from those when the detector data has a real CBC\nsignal instead of a glitch. We argue that these distinctions can be utilized to\ndevelop useful signal-artifact vetos that add negligibly to the computational\ncost of a CBC search. Specifically, we show how $f_0$ of a glitch can be used\nto set adaptive time-windows around it so that any template trigger occurring\nin that window can be quarantined for further vetting of its supposed\nastrophysical nature. Second, we recommend focusing efforts on reducing the\nincidence of glitches with low $f_0$ values because they create CBC triggers\nwith the longest timelags. This work allows us to associate such triggers with\nthe glitches which otherwise would have escaped attention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 12:52:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2016 07:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

From these two local\nequilibrium functions, two lattice Boltzmann models are derived via the Hermite\nexpansion, namely one is in relation to the translational velocity and the\nother is connected with the rotational velocity. Accordingly, the distribution\nfunction is also decoupled. After this, the evolution equation is decoupled\ninto the evolution equation of the translational velocity and that of the\nrotational velocity. The two evolution equations evolve separately.

We show that the expected rate of joint detection is\nlow during the Advanced Virgo and Advanced LIGO 2016-2017 run; however, as the\ninterferometers approach their final design sensitivities, the rate will\nincrease by $\\sim$ a factor of ten. Future joint observations will help to\nconstrain the association between short GRBs and binary systems and to solve\nthe puzzle of the progenitors of GWs. Comparison of the joint detection rate\nwith the ones predicted in this paper will help to constrain the geometry of\nthe GRB jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 14:04:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2016 18:14:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2016 16:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

For such agents, it is desirable to determine confidence interval\nlower bounds on the performance of any given policy without executing said\npolicy. Current methods for exact high confidence off-policy evaluation that\nuse importance sampling require a substantial amount of data to achieve a tight\nlower bound. Existing model-based methods only address the problem in discrete\nstate spaces. Since exact bounds are intractable for many domains we trade off\nstrict guarantees of safety for more data-efficient approximate bounds. In this\ncontext, we propose two bootstrapping off-policy evaluation methods which use\nlearned MDP transition models in order to estimate lower confidence bounds on\npolicy performance with limited data in both continuous and discrete state\nspaces. Since direct use of a model may introduce bias, we derive a theoretical\nupper bound on model bias for when the model transition function is estimated\nwith i.i.d. trajectories. This bound broadens our understanding of the\nconditions under which model-based methods have high bias. Finally, we\nempirically evaluate our proposed methods and analyze the settings in which\ndifferent bootstrapping off-policy confidence interval methods succeed and\nfail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 14:06:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 23:26:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Sep 2018 17:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

We also extend\nautomatic differentiation for second order derivatives of options with\nnon-twice differentiable payoff. 1. Introduction. Due to BASEL III regulations,\nbanks are requested to evaluate the sensitivities of their portfolios every day\n(risk assessment). Some of these portfolios are huge and sensitivities are time\nconsuming to compute accurately. Faced with the problem of building a software\nfor this task and distrusting automatic differentiation for non-differentiable\nfunctions, we turned to an idea developed by Mike Giles called Vibrato. Vibrato\nat core is a differentiation of a combination of likelihood ratio method and\npathwise evaluation. In Giles [12], [13], it is shown that the computing time,\nstability and precision are enhanced compared with numerical differentiation of\nthe full Monte Carlo path. In many cases, double sensitivities, i.e. second\nderivatives with respect to parameters, are needed (e.g. gamma hedging). Finite\ndifference approximation of sensitivities is a very simple method but its\nprecision is hard to control because it relies on the appropriate choice of the\nincrement. Automatic differentiation of computer programs bypass the difficulty\nand its computing cost is similar to finite difference, if not cheaper. But in\nfinance the payoff is never twice differentiable and so generalized derivatives\nhave to be used requiring approximations of Dirac functions of which the\nprecision is also doubtful. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the\nfeasibility of Vibrato for second and higher derivatives. We will first compare\nVibrato applied twice with the analytic differentiation of Vibrato and show\nthat it is equivalent, as the second is easier we propose the best compromise\nfor second derivatives: Automatic Differentiation of Vibrato.

Thanks to\nits location within the COSMOS survey, each galaxy benefits from a wealth of\nancillary information.\n  In this paper we detail the survey strategy and weighting scheme adopted to\naccount for the biases introduced by the photometric pre-selection of our\ntargets. We present our galaxy stellar mass and rest-frame magnitudes estimates\ntogether with a group catalog obtained with our new data and their member\ngalaxies color/mass distribution.\n  Owing to to our new sample we can perform a detailed, high definition mapping\nof the complex COSMOS Wall structure. The sharp environmental information,\ncoupled with high quality spectroscopic information and rich ancillary data\navailable in the COSMOS field, enables a detailed study of galaxy properties as\na function of local environment in a redshift slice where environmental effects\nare important, and in a stellar mass range where mass and environment driven\neffects are both at work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 15:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

Its importance comes from the\nrelationship between the 3D structure and the function of a given protein or\nRNA. 3D structures also help to find the ligands of the protein, which are\nusually small molecules, a key step in drug design. Unfortunately, there is no\nshortcut to accurately obtain the 3D structure of a macromolecule. Many\nphysical measurements of macromolecular 3D structures cannot scale up, due to\ntheir large labor costs and the requirements for lab conditions.\n  In recent years, computational methods have made huge progress due to advance\nin computation speed and machine learning methods. These methods only need the\nsequence information to predict 3D structures by employing various mathematical\nmodels and machine learning methods.
