While many authors\nhave linked global measures of correlations such as entanglement or discord to\nthe performance of specific protocols, in general the latter may require only\ncorrelations between specific observables. In this work, we first introduce a\ngeneral measure of correlations for two-qubit states based on the classical\nmutual information between local observables. We then discuss the role of the\nsymmetry in the state's correlations distribution and accordingly provide a\nclassification of maximally mixed marginals states (MMMS). We discuss the\ncomplementarity relation between correlations and coherence. By focusing on a\nsimple yet paradigmatic example, i.e., the remote state preparation protocol,\nwe introduce a method to systematically define proper protocol-tailored\nmeasures of correlations. The method is based on the identification of those\ncorrelations that are relevant (useful) for the protocol. The approach allows\non one hand to discuss the role of the symmetry of the correlations\ndistribution in determining the efficiency of the protocol, both for MMMS and\ngeneral two-qubit quantum states, and on the other hand to devise an optimized\nprotocol for non-MMMS that can have a better efficiency with respect to the\nstandard one.

With optimal power allocation solution obtained for each policy, we\nshow that the optimal relay assignment can be obtained using bottleneck\nmatching (BM) algorithm and minimum weighted matching (MWM) algorithm for GLM\nand MWTP policies, respectively. Since relay assignment with BM algorithm is\nnot power efficient, we propose a novel minimum bottleneck matching (MBM)\nalgorithm to solve the relay assignment problem optimally for GLM policy. To\nfurther reduce the complexity of the relay assignment, we propose suboptimal\nrelay selection (SRS) algorithm which has linear complexity in number of source\nand relay nodes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed relay\nselection and power allocation strategies based on GLM policy have better\nnetwork lifetime performance over the strategies based on MWTP policy.

The typical overlap $F$ between the ground state of a Fermi\nliquid and the one of the same system with an added potential impurity is found\nto decay at the AMIT exponentially with system size $L$ as $F \\sim \\exp (-\n\\langle I_A\\rangle /2)= \\exp(-c L^{\\eta})$, where $I_A$ is the so called\nAnderson integral, $\\eta $ is the power of multifractal intensity correlations\nand $\\langle ... \\rangle$ denotes the ensemble average. Thus, strong disorder\ntypically increases the sensitivity of a system to an additional impurity\nexponentially. We recover on the metallic side of the transition Anderson's\nresult that fidelity $F$ decays with a power law $F \\sim L^{-q (E_F)}$ with\nsystem size $L$.

While these results are obtained from the mean value of $I_A,$ giving\nthe typical fidelity $F$, we find that $I_A$ is widely, log normally,\ndistributed with a width diverging at the AMIT. As a consequence, the mean\nvalue of fidelity $F$ converges to one at the AMIT, in strong contrast to its\ntypical value which converges to zero exponentially fast with system size $L$.\nThis counterintuitive behavior is explained as a manifestation of\nmultifractality at the AMIT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2016 18:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-03"}

The present paper presents a statistical modelling approach\nusing the method of moments, which is computationally very inexpensive and may\ntherefore be an attractive option when combining dust processing with, e.g.,\ndetailed simulations of interstellar gas dynamics. A solar-neighbourhood-like\ntoy model of interstellar dust evolution is presented as an example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2016 19:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-24"}

Multiscale\nnets transform the CDE regression task into a hierarchical classification task\nby decomposing the density into a series of half-spaces and learning boolean\nprobabilities of each split. CDE Trend Filtering applies a k-th order graph\ntrend filtering penalty to the unnormalized logits of a multinomial classifier\nnetwork, with each edge in the graph corresponding to a neighboring point on a\ndiscretized version of the density.

The Temporal Coupled-Mode Theory\n(TCMT) provides a simple and general tool that is widely used to model these\ndevices and has proved to yield very good results in many different systems of\nlow-loss, weakly coupled resonators. Relying on TCMT to model coupled\nresonators might however be misleading in some circumstances due to the\nlumped-element nature of the model. In this article, we report an important\nlimitation of TCMT related to the prediction of dark states. Studying a coupled\nsystem composed of three microring resonators, we demonstrate that TCMT\npredicts the existence of a dark state that is in disagreement with\nexperimental observations and with the more general results obtained with the\nTransfer Matrix Method (TMM) and the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD)\nsimulations. We identify the limitation in the TCMT model to be related to the\nmechanism of excitation/decay of the supermodes and we propose a correction\nthat effectively reconciles the model with expected results. A comparison with\nTMM and FDTD allows to verify both steady-state and transient solutions of the\nmodified-TCMT model. The proposed correction is derived from general\nconsiderations, energy conservation and the non-resonant power circulating in\nthe system, therefore it provides good insight on how the TCMT model should be\nmodified to eventually account for the same limitation in a different\ncoupled-resonator design. Moreover, our discussion based on coupled microring\nresonators can be useful for other electromagnetic resonant systems due to the\ngenerality and far-reach of the TCMT formalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2016 21:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

A\nrelatively new dynamic phenomenon, torus canards have been found in neural\napplications to mediate the transition from spiking to bursting via\namplitude-modulated spiking. In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, torus canards are degenerate:\nthey require one-parameter families of 2-fast/1-slow systems in order to be\nobserved and even then, they only occur on exponentially thin parameter\nintervals. The addition of a second slow variable unfolds the torus canard\nphenomenon, making them generic and robust. That is, torus canards in slow/fast\nsystems with (at least) two slow variables occur on open parameter sets. So\nfar, generic torus canards have only been studied numerically, and their\nbehaviour has been inferred based on averaging and canard theory. This\napproach, however, has not been rigorously justified since the averaging method\nbreaks down near a fold of periodics, which is exactly where torus canards\noriginate.

Two processing pipelines implemented at the SDO Joint Science\nOperations Center (JSOC) at Stanford University compute observables from\ncalibrated Level-1 filtergrams. One generates LoS quantities every 45s, and the\nother, primarily for the vector magnetic field, computes averages on a 720s\ncadence.

Over the ventral sensorimotor cortex (vSMC)\nwe detected significant concentration of phase across trials at the specific\nfrequency of speech production. We also observed amplitude modulations. In\naddition we found significant coupling between the phase of brain oscillations\nat the frequency of speech production and their amplitude in the high-gamma\nrange (i.e., phase-amplitude coupling, PAC). Furthermore, we saw that brain\noscillations at the frequency of speech production organized as traveling waves\n(TWs), synchronized to the rhythm of speech production. It has been\nhypothesized that PAC is a mechanism to allow low-frequency oscillations to\nsynchronize with high-frequency neural activity so that spiking occurs at\nbehaviorally relevant times. If this hypothesis is true, when PAC coexists with\nTWs, we expect a specific organization of PAC curves. We observed this\norganization experimentally and verified that the peaks of high-gamma\noscillations, and therefore spiking, occur at the same times across electrodes.\nImportantly, we observed that these spiking times were synchronized with the\nrhythm of speech production.

Modern hypothesis testing and data integration applications, on the\nother hand, routinely involve multivariate test statistics. The goal, in such\nsettings, is to combine the evidence for each hypothesis and achieve greater\npower, while controlling the number of false discoveries. This paper considers\ndata-adaptive methods for constructing nested rejection regions based on\nmultivariate test statistics (z-values). It is proved that the FDR can be\ncontrolled for appropriately constructed rejection regions, even when the\nregions depend on data and are hence random. This flexibility is then exploited\nto develop optimal multiple comparison procedures in higher dimensions, where\nthe distribution of non-null z-values is unknown.

There are extrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling(RSOC) and the\norbital gap related to the transfer of the electronic charge from graphene to\nXY2 as well. The former allows for external tuning of the band gap in GTMD and\nconnects the nearest neighbors with spin-flip. On account of the strong SOC,\nthe system acts as a quantum spin Hall insulator. We introduce the exchange\nfield (M) in the Hamiltonian to take into account the deposition of Fe atoms on\nthe graphene surface.

For this purpose, we employed an\noriginal montage, based on the simultaneous recording of the same set of\nelectrodes. Two set of recordings were performed. During the first experiment a\nsimple adapter with a direct connection between the amplifiers and the\nelectrodes was used.

The works of Schulman and Sahai over the past two decades have\ndeveloped the notions of tree codes and anytime capacity, and provided the\ntheoretical framework for studying such problems. Nonetheless, there has been\nlittle practical progress in this area due to the absence of explicit\nconstructions of tree codes with efficient encoding and decoding algorithms.\nRecently, linear time-invariant tree codes were proposed to achieve the desired\nresult under maximum-likelihood decoding. In this work, we take one more step\ntowards practicality, by showing that these codes can be efficiently decoded\nusing sequential decoding algorithms, up to some loss in performance (and with\nsome practical complexity caveats). We supplement our theoretical results with\nnumerical simulations that demonstrate the effectiveness of the decoder in a\ncontrol system setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2016 09:13:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-09"}

A theoretical model that predicts the ME\nbehavior was developed, focusing our work on the demagnetizing effects in the\ntransversal mode as well as the longitudinal mode. The model shows that: (i)\nhigh ME coefficients are obtained when ferrites with high magnetomechanical\ncoupling are used in bilayer ME composites, (ii) the ME behavior in transversal\nand longitudinal modes is quite similar, and differences in the shapes of the\nME curves are mainly due the demagnetizing effects, (iii) in the transversal\nmode, the magnetic field penetration depends on the ferrite layer thickness and\nthe ME coefficient is affected accordingly.

The simple geometrical effects\ncombined with the fractal structure of the ISM can contribute to a steeper\nempirical $\\Sigma-D$ slopes, especially for older remnants, and this is more\npronounced if $\\Sigma$ has a stronger dependence on ambient density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2016 10:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-09"}

The reason for this is that the specific\nAI, required to make an ethical robot, can always be exploited to make\nunethical robots. Hence, the development of ethical robots will not guarantee\nthe responsible deployment of AI. While advocating for ethical robots, we\nconclude that preventing the misuse of robots is beyond the scope of\nengineering, and requires instead governance frameworks underpinned by\nlegislation.

In this work, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are\napplied to semantic labelling of high-resolution remote sensing data. Recent\nadvances in fully convolutional networks (FCNs) are adapted to overhead data\nand shown to be as effective as in other domains. A full-resolution labelling\nis inferred using a deep FCN with no downsampling, obviating the need for\ndeconvolution or interpolation. To make better use of image features, a\npre-trained CNN is fine-tuned on remote sensing data in a hybrid network\ncontext, resulting in superior results compared to a network trained from\nscratch. The proposed approach is applied to the problem of labelling\nhigh-resolution aerial imagery, where fine boundary detail is important. The\ndense labelling yields state-of-the-art accuracy for the ISPRS Vaihingen and\nPotsdam benchmark data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2016 14:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-09"}

By constructing new trial functions, we obtain a sharp\nupper bound of the gap of the consecutive eigenvalues in the sense of the\norder, which affirmatively answers to a conjecture proposed by Chen-Zheng-Yang.\nIn addition, we also exploit the closed eigenvalue problem of Laplacian and\nobtain a similar optimal upper bound. As some important examples, we\ninvestigate the eigenvalues of the eigenvalue problem of the Laplacian on the\nunit sphere and cylinder, compact homogeneous Riemannian manifolds without\nboundary, connected bounded domain and compact complex hypersurface without\nboundary in the standard complex projective space $\\mathbb{C}P^{n}(4)$ with\nholomorphic sectional curvature $4$, and some intrinsic estimates for the\neigenvalue gap is obtained. As the author know, for the Dirichlet problem, the\ngap $\\lambda_{k+1}-\\lambda_{k}$ is bounded by the first $k$-th eigenvalues in\nthe previous literatures. However, by a large number of numerical calculations,\nthe author surprisingly find that the gap of the consecutive eigenvalues of the\nDirichlet problem on the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space $R^{n}$ can be bounded\nonly by the first two eigenvalues. Therefore, we venture to conjecture that all\nof the eigenvalues satisfy: $\\lambda_{k+1}-\\lambda_{k}\\leq\n\\mathfrak{S}_{i}(\\Omega)(\\lambda_{2}-\\lambda_{1})k^{1/n}$, where\n$\\mathfrak{S}_{i}(\\Omega),i=1,2$ denote the first shape coefficient and the\nsecond shape coefficient.

In\nthe VS algorithm, candidate solutions are generated around the current best\nsolution by using a Gaussian distribution at each iteration pass. This provides\nsimplicity to the algorithm but it also leads to some problems along.\nEspecially, for the functions those have a number of local minimum points, to\nselect a single point to generate candidate solutions leads the algorithm to\nbeing trapped into a local minimum point.

In\nthis paper, we present an experimental system developed to teach students in\nthe basics of geometric optics, including ray and wave optics. The students\nlearn these concepts through designing, building, and testing a home-built\nlight microscope made from component parts. We describe the experimental\nequipment and basic measurements students can perform to learn principles,\ntechnique, accuracy, and resolution of measurement. Students find the\nmagnification and test the resolution of the microscope system they build. The\nsystem is open and versatile to allow advanced building projects, such as\nepi-fluorescence, total internal reflection fluorescence, and optical trapping.\nWe have used this equipment in an optics course, an advanced laboratory course,\nand graduate-level training modules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2016 03:21:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-10"}

The magnetic\nfields of such TFMs can break the limitation of conventional magnets (<2 T), so\nthey show potential for improving the performance of many electrical\napplications that use permanent magnets like rotating machines. Towards\npractical or commercial use of TFMs, effective in situ magnetization is one of\nthe key issues. The pulsed field magnetization (PFM) is among the most\npromising magnetization methods in virtue of its compactness, mobility and low\ncost. However, due to the heat generation during the magnetization, the trapped\nfield and flux acquired by PFM usually cannot achieve the full potential of a\nsample (acquired by the field cooling or zero field cooling method). The\nmulti-pulse technique was found to effectively improve the trapped field by PFM\nin practice. In this work, a systematic study on the PFM with successive pulses\nis presented. A 2D electromagnetic-thermal coupled model with comprehensive\ntemperature dependent parameters is used to simulate a stack of CCs magnetized\nby successive magnetic pulses. An overall picture is built to show how the\ntrapped field and flux evolve with different pulse sequences and the evolution\npatterns are analyzed. Based on the discussion, an operable magnetization\nstrategy of PFM with successive pulses is suggested to provide more trapped\nfield and flux. Finally, experimental results of a stack of CCs magnetized by\ntypical pulse sequences are presented for demonstration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2016 05:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}
