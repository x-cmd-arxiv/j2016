In this paper, we discuss the details of XID+ and demonstrate\nthe basic capabilities and performance by running it on simulated SPIRE maps\nresembling the COSMOS field, and comparing to the current prior-based source\nextraction tool DESPHOT. We show that not only does XID+ perform better on\nmetrics such as flux accuracy and flux uncertainty accuracy, we illustrate how\nobtaining the posterior probability distribution can help overcome some of the\nissues inherent with maximum likelihood based source extraction routines.

In a\nself-contained way, this study introduces it to the atmospheric dynamical\ndiagnostics, with important theoretical updates. Multiscale energy equations\nare derived using a new analysis apparatus, namely, multiscale window\ntransform, with respect to both the primitive equation and quasi-geostrophic\nmodels. A reconstruction of the \"atomic\" energy fluxes on the multiple scale\nwindows allows for a natural and unique separation of the in-scale transports\nand cross-scale transfers from the intertwined nonlinear processes. The\nresulting energy transfers bear a Lie bracket form, reminiscent of the Poisson\nbracket in Hamiltonian mechanics, we hence would call them \"canonical\". A\ncanonical transfer process is a mere redistribution of energy among scale\nwindows, without generating or destroying energy as a whole. By classification,\na multiscale energetic cycle comprises of available potential energy (APE)\ntransport, kinetic energy (KE) transport, pressure work, buoyancy conversion,\nwork done by external forcing and friction, and the cross-scale canonical\ntransfers of APE and KE which correspond respectively to the baroclinic and\nbarotropic instabilities, among others, in geophysical fluid dynamics. A\nbuoyancy conversion takes place in an individual window only, bridging the two\ntypes of energy namely KE and APE, it does not involve any processes among\ndifferent scale windows, and is hence basically not related to instabilities.\nThis formalism is exemplified with a preliminary application to the\nMadden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2016 18:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-21"}

This process is known as\nre-iterated homogenization and has many variations in the numerical context.\nThough the process seems to be a straightforward extension of two-level\nprocess, it requires some careful implementation and the concept development\nfor problems without scale separation and high contrast.

Although these inflated planets have been\nknown for over fifteen years, it is unclear whether their inflation is caused\nby deposition of energy from the host star, or inhibited cooling of the planet.\nThese processes can be distinguished if the planet becomes highly irradiated\nonly when the host star evolves onto the red giant branch. We report the\ndiscovery of K2-97b, a 1.31 $\\pm$ 0.11 R$_\\mathrm{J}$, 1.10 $\\pm$ 0.11\nM$_\\mathrm{J}$ planet orbiting a 4.20 $\\pm$ 0.14 R$_\\odot$, 1.16 $\\pm$ 0.12\nM$_\\odot$ red giant star with an orbital period of 8.4 days. We precisely\nconstrained stellar and planetary parameters by combining asteroseismology,\nspectroscopy, and granulation noise modeling along with transit and radial\nvelocity measurements. The uncertainty in planet radius is dominated by\nsystematic differences in transit depth, which we measure to be up to 30%\nbetween different lightcurve reduction methods. Our calculations indicate the\nincident flux on this planet was 170$^{+140}_{-60}$ times the incident flux on\nEarth while the star was on the main sequence. Previous studies suggest that\nthis incident flux is insufficient to delay planetary cooling enough to explain\nthe present planet radius. This system thus provides the first evidence that\nplanets may be inflated directly by incident stellar radiation rather than by\ndelayed loss of heat from formation. Further studies of planets around red\ngiant branch stars will confirm or contradict this hypothesis, and may reveal a\nnew class of re-inflated planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2016 00:46:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 02:00:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-01"}

The VEV responsible for the combination is of the order of the\n$SU(2)\\times U(1)$ breaking scale, but the coupling of the new physics to\nstandard model particles is suppressed by the strong interaction of the new\ngauge group. This simple extension of the standard model has a rich\nphenomenology, including composite particles of the new confining gauge\ninteraction, a coloron and a $Z'$ which are rather weakly coupled to standard\nmodel particles, and massive vector bosons charged under both the ordinary\ncolor and hypercharge gauge groups and the new strong gauge group. The new\nscalar glueball could have mass of around $750 \\, \\rm GeV$, be produced by\ngluon fusion and decay into two photons, both through loops of the new massive\nvector bosons. The simplest version of the model has some issues: the massive\nvector bosons are stable and the coloron and the $Z'$ are strongly constrained\nby search data. An extension of the model to include additional fermions with\nthe new gauge coupling, though not as simple and elegant, can address both\nissues and more. It allows the massive vector boson to decay into a colorless,\nneutral state that could be a candidate of the dark matter. And the coloron and\n$Z'$ can decay dominantly into the new fermions, completely changing the search\nbounds. In addition, $SU(N)$ fermions below the symmetry breaking scale make it\nmore plausible that the lightest glueball is at $750$~GeV. Whatever becomes of\nthe $750$~GeV diphoton excess, the model is an unusual example of how new\nphysics at small scales could be hidden by strong interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2016 13:17:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

Additionally, we study the benefits of\nempirical Bayes shrinkage, in which subject-level estimates borrow strength\nfrom the population average by trading a small increase in bias for a greater\nreduction in variance. For each subject, we compute raw and shrinkage estimates\nof rsFC between 300 regions identified through independent components analysis\n(ICA) based on rsfMRI scans varying from 3 to 30 minutes in length. The time\ncourse for each region is determined using dual regression, and rsFC is\nestimated as the Pearson correlation between each pair of time courses.\nShrinkage estimates for each subject are computed as a weighted average between\nthe raw subject-level estimate and the population average estimate, where the\nweight is determined for each connection by the relationship of within-subject\nvariance to between-subject variance. We find that shrinkage estimates exhibit\ngreater reliability than raw estimates for most connections, with 30-40%\nimprovement using scans less than 10 minutes in length and 10-20% improvement\nusing scans of 20-30 minutes. We also observe significant spatial variability\nin reliability of both raw and shrinkage estimates, with connections within the\ndefault mode and motor networks exhibiting the greatest reliability and\nbetween-network connections exhibiting the poorest reliability. We conclude\nthat the scan length required for reliable estimation of rsFC depends on the\nspecific connections of interest, and shrinkage can be used to increase\nreliability of rsFC, even when produced from long, high-quality rsfMRI scans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2016 15:34:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

The approximate formula in the case when\nthe eikonal function chi(b) is moderately small, |chi(b)| < 0.1, is derived. It\nis shown that the total cross section is given by the series of multiple\nimproper integrals of the Born amplitude A_B. Its advantage compared to\nstandard eikonal formulas is that the integrals contain no rapidly oscillating\nBessel functions. Two theorems which allow one to relate large-b behavior of\nchi(b) with analytical properties of the Born amplitude are proved. Several\nexamples of these theorems are given. To check the efficiency of the main\nformula, it is applied for numerical calculations of the total cross section\nfor a number of particular expressions of A_B.
