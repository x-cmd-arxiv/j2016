STEREO-B/EUVI temporal image data on 7\nMarch 2012 shows an evolution of two consecutive EUV waves that interact with\nthe footpoint of a coronal streamer evident in the co-spatial and co-temporal\nSTEREO-B/COR-I observations. The evolution of EUV waves is clearly evident in\nSTEREO-B/EUVI, and its energy exchange with coronal streamer generates kink\noscillations. We estimate the phase velocities of the kink wave perturbations\nby tracking it at different heights of the coronal streamer. We also estimate\nthe electron densities inside and outside the streamer using SSI of polarized\nbrightness images in STEREO-B/COR-1 observations. Taking into account the MHD\ntheory of kink waves in a cylindrical waveguide, their observed properties at\nvarious heights, and density contrast of the streamer, we estimate the radial\nprofile of magnetic field within this magnetic structure. Both the kink waves\ndiagnose the exponentially decaying radial profiles of the magnetic field in\ncoronal steamer upto 3 solar radii. Within the limit of uncertainties in the\nmeasurements, it is indicated that coronal magnetic field of the streamer\nvaries slowly in time at various heights, although its nature always remains\nexponentially decaying. It is seen that during the evolution of second kink\nmotion in the streamer, it increases in brightness, and also in areal extent\nslightly, which may be associated with the decreased photospheric magnetic flux\nat its footpoint. As a result, the magnetic field profile produced by the\nsecond kink wave is reduced within the streamer compared to the one diagnosed\nby the first one. The precisely estimated magnetic field profiles with the\nuncertainty less than 10% match well with the empirical profile and various\nobservational estimations of the outer coronal magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2016 16:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

Therefore we study the\nimpact of point and line defects on the electronic structure and optical\nproperties of MoS2 monolayers using density-functional methods. The different\ntypes of defects form electronic states that are spatially localized on the\ndefect. The strongly localized nature is reflected in weak electronic\ninteractions between individual point or line defect and a weak dependence of\nthe defect formation energy on the defect concentration or line defect\nseparation. In the electronic energy spectrum the defect states occur as deep\nlevels in the band gap, as shallow levels very close to the band edges, as well\nas levels in-between the bulk states. Due to their strongly localized nature,\nall states of point defects are sharply peaked in energy. Periodic line defects\nform nearly dispersionless one-dimensional band structures and the related\nspectral features are also strongly peaked. The electronic structure of the\nmonolayer system is quite robust and it is well preserved for point defect\nconcentrations of up to 6%. The impact of point defects on the optical\nabsorption for concentrations of 1% and below is found to be very small. For\nhigher defect concentrations molybdenum vacancies were found to quench the\noverall absorption and sulfur defects lead to sharp absorption peaks below the\nabsorption edge of the ideal monolayer.

The manner by which bundles of\nmagnetic field traverse portions of the convection zone to emerge at the\nstellar surface is not especially well understood. In the Solar context, some\ninsight into this process has been gleaned by regarding the magnetism as\nconsisting partly of idealized thin flux tubes (TFT). Here, we present the\nresults of a large set of TFT simulations in a rotating spherical domain of\nconvective flows representative of a 0.3 solar-mass, main-sequence star. This\nis the first study to investigate how individual flux tubes in such a star\nmight rise under the combined influence of buoyancy, convection, and\ndifferential rotation. A time-dependent hydrodynamic convective flow field,\ntaken from separate 3D simulations calculated with the anelastic equations,\nimpacts the flux tube as it rises. Convective motions modulate the shape of the\ninitially buoyant flux ring, promoting localized rising loops. Flux tubes in\nfully convective stars have a tendency to rise nearly parallel to the rotation\naxis. However, the presence of strong differential rotation allows some\ninitially low latitude flux tubes of moderate strength to develop rising loops\nthat emerge in the near-equatorial region. Magnetic pumping suppresses the\nglobal rise of the flux tube most efficiently in the deeper interior and at\nlower latitudes. The results of these simulations aim to provide a link between\ndynamo-generated magnetic fields, fluid motions, and observations of starspots\nfor fully convective stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2016 18:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

Bayesian error estimation\napproach has been built-in to several recently developed exchange-correlation\nfunctionals, which allows an estimate of the uncertainty associated with\nproperties related to the ground state energy, for e.g. adsorption energies.\nHere, we propose a robust and computationally efficient method for quantifying\nuncertainty in mechanical properties, which depends on the derivatives of the\nenergy.

On the other hand, deep learning\nsystems which do beat human champions, such as in Go, do not generalise well.\nThe power of deep learning simultaneously exposes its weakness. Given that deep\nlearning is mostly clever reconfigurations of well-established methods, moving\nbeyond the state of art calls for forward-thinking visionary solutions, not\njust more of the same.

The variability occurs in the so-called discrete absorption\ncomponents (DACs) that accelerate through the UV-wind line profiles and also in\nmany optical lines. For such OB stars no dipolar magnetic fields have been\ndetected with upper limits of ~300G. We investigate whether multiple magnetic\nloops on the surface rather than non-radial pulsations or a dipolar magnetic\nfield can explain the observed cyclical UV and optical spectral line\nvariability. We present time-resolved, high-resolution optical spectroscopy of\nthe O6.5I(n)fp star lambda Cep. We apply a simplified phenomenological model in\nwhich multiple spherical blobs attached to the surface represent magnetic-loop\nstructures, which we call stellar prominences, by analogy with solar\nprominences. We compare the calculated line profiles as a function of\nrotational phase, adopting a rotation period of 4.1d, with observed relative\nchanges in subsequent quotient spectra. We identify many periodicities in\nspectral lines, almost none of which is stable over timescales from months to\nyears. We show that the relative changes in various optical absorption and\nemission lines are often very similar. Our proposed model applied to the HeII\n4686 line can typically be fitted with 2-5 equatorial blobs with lifetimes\nbetween ~1 and 24h. Given the irregular timescales involved, we propose that\nthe azimuthal distribution of DACs correspond to the locations of stellar\nprominences attached to the surface. This could explain the observed\nvariability of optical and UV lines, and put constraints on the strength and\nlifetime of these structures, which can be compared with recent theoretical\npredictions, in which bright magnetic surface spots are formed by the action of\nthe subsurface convection zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2016 19:14:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

After a reminder of the\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory a discussion of the shortcomings of any\nmean field approximation (MFA) is presented. The recovery of the symmetries\nspontaneously broken in the HFB approach, in particular the angular momentum,\nis necessary, among others, to describe excited states and transitions.\nParticle number projection is needed to guarantee the right number of protons\nand neutrons. Furthermore a projection before the variation prevents the\npairing collapse in the weak pairing regime. The lack of fluctuations around\nthe average values of the MFA is a shortcoming of this approach. To build in\ncorrelations in BMFT one selects the relevant degrees of freedom: quadrupole,\noctupole and the pairing vibrations as well as the single particle ones. In the\nGCM the operators representing these degrees of freedom are used as coordinates\nto generate a collective subspace. The highly correlated GCM wave function is\nfinally written as a linear combination of a projected basis of this space. The\nvariation of the coefficients of the linear combination leads to the\nHill-Wheeler equation. We discuss the classical beta and gamma vibrations by\nconsidering the quadrupole operators as coordinates. We present pairing\nfluctuations by considering the pairing gaps as generator coordinates.

Many of these elongated profiles are due to large\nsubhalos and/or recent mergers.

The surface\nbrightness profiles for the face-on and edge-on views of each model were\nsimulated to find out whether the flared disc produces a Type-II break in the\ndisc profile when observed edge-on, and if so under what conditions. Contrary\nto previous claims, we find that discs with realistic flares can produce\nsignificant breaks in discs when observed edge-on. Specifically a flare with\nthe parameters of that of the Milky Way would produce a significant break of\nthe disc at a Rbreak of ~8.6 kpc if observed edge-on.

The GW signals can arrive\n$earlier$ than the EM signals in some cases if the GW/EM signals have passed\nthrough a lens, even if both signals were emitted simultaneously by a source.\nGW wavelengths are much larger than EM wavelengths; therefore, the propagation\nof the GWs does not follow the laws of geometrical optics, including the\nShapiro time delay, if the lens mass is less than approximately $10^5 {\\rm\nM}_\\odot (f/{\\rm Hz})^{-1}$, where $f$ is the GW frequency.

For example, when a distant super massive\nblack hole binary (SMBHB) in a galactic center is lensed by an intervening\ngalaxy, the time lag becomes of the order of $10$ days.

Several phenomenological implications have been discussed in the\ncases in which (i) $X$ is the inflation, and (ii) $X$ is a field different from\nthe inflation, that experiences a temporary speed up during inflation. In this\nsecond case, visible sourced gravitational waves (GW) can be produced at the\nCMB scales without affecting the scalar perturbations, even if the scale of\ninflation is several orders of magnitude below what is required to produce a\nvisible vacuum GW signal. Perturbativity considerations can be used to limit\nthe regime in which these results are under perturbative control.

Testing an association\nbetween deficit severity and lesion status in each voxel involves very many\nindividual tests and requires statistical correction for multiple comparisons.\nSeveral strategies have been adapted from analysis of functional neuroimaging\ndata, though VLSM faces a more difficult trade-off between avoiding false\npositives and statistical power (missing true effects). One such strategy is\nusing permutation to non-parametrically determine a null distribution of\ncluster sizes, which is then used to establish a minimum cluster size\nthreshold. This strategy is intuitively appealing because it respects the\nnecessary spatial contiguity of stroke lesions and connects with the typical\ncluster-based interpretation of VLSM results. We evaluated this strategy for\ndetecting true lesion-symptom relations using simulated deficit scores based on\npercent damage to defined brain regions (BA 45 and BA 39) in a sample of 124\nindividuals with left hemisphere stroke. Even under the most conservative\nsettings tested here, the region identified by VLSM with cluster size\ncorrection systematically extended well beyond the true region. As a result,\nthis strategy appears to be effective for ruling out situations with no true\nlesion-symptom relations, but the spatial contiguity of stroke lesions may\ncause identified lesion-symptom relations to extend beyond their true regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2016 21:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-03"}

But\nbecause the generalized gradient expansion only involves nearest-neighbor\ncorrections, it does not work as well at low temperatures, when the systems\nenter into ordered phases. This is primarily due to the problem that ordered\nphases often satisfy some global constraints which determine the spatial\nordering pattern, and the local density and generalized gradient approximations\nare not able to impose those kinds of constraints; they also overestimate the\ntendency to order. The theory is applied to phase separation of different mass\nfermionic mixtures represented by the Falicov-Kimball model and to determining\nthe entropy per particle of a fermionic system represented by the Hubbard\nmodel.

These devices\nmay be many types of objects with embedded intelligence and communication\ncapabilities, e.g., smart phones, cars, or home appliances. The issue in in\nthis type of communication is the interference to cellular communication caused\nby D2D communication. Thus, proper power control and resource allocation should\nbe coordinated in D2D network to prevent excessive interference and drastic\ndecrease in the throughput of the cellular system. In this paper, we consider\nthe problem of cross-layer resource allocation in time-varying cellular\nwireless networks with D2D communication and incorporate average interference\nto cellular system as a quality-of-service constraint. Specifically, each D2D\npair in the network injects packets to its queue, at rates chosen in order to\nmaximize a global utility function, subject to network stability and\ninterference constraints. The interference constraint enforces an arbitrarily\nlow interference to the cellular system caused by D2D communication.

How isogenic cell populations maintain size\nhomeostasis, i.e., a narrow distribution of cell size, is an intriguing\nfundamental problem. We model cell size using a stochastic hybrid system, where\na cell grows exponentially in size (volume) over time and probabilistic\ndivision events are triggered at discrete time intervals. Moreover, whenever\ndivision events occur, size is randomly partitioned among daughter cells. We\nfirst consider a scenario, where a timer (i.e., cell-cycle clock) that measures\nthe time since the last division event regulates both the cellular growth and\ndivision rates. Analysis reveals that such a timer-controlled system cannot\nachieve size homeostasis, in the sense that, the cell-to-cell size variation\ngrows unboundedly with time. To explore biologically meaningful mechanisms for\ncontrolling size we consider two classes of regulation: a size-dependent growth\nrate and a size-dependent division rate. Our results show that these strategies\ncan provide bounded intercellular variation in cell size, and exact\nmathematical conditions on the form of regulation needed for size homeostasis\nare derived. Different known forms of size control strategies, such as, the\nadder and the sizer are shown to be consistent with these results.\nInterestingly, for timer-based division mechanisms, the mean cell size depends\non the noise in the cell-cycle duration but independent of errors incurred in\npartitioning of volume among daughter cells. In contrast, the mean cell size\ndecreases with increasing partitioning errors for size-based division\nmechanisms. Finally, we discuss how organisms ranging from bacteria to\nmammalian cells have adopted different control approaches for maintaining size\nhomeostasis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2016 04:55:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-03"}

They are affected by the temperature fluctuation in air,\nobstruction due to the solid objects, even the humidity difference in the\nenvironment, etc. How the varying range of transmission of the individual\nactive elements affects the global connectivity in the network may be an\nimportant practical question to ask. Here a new model of percolation phenomena,\nwith an additional source of disorder, has been introduced for a theoretical\nunderstanding of this problem. As in ordinary percolation, sites of a square\nlattice are occupied randomly with the probability $p$. Each occupied site is\nthen assigned a circular disc of random value $R$ for its radius. A bond is\ndefined to be occupied if and only if the radii $R_1$ and $R_2$ of the discs\ncentered at the ends satisfy certain pre-defined condition. In a very general\nformulation, one divides the $R_1 - R_2$ plane into two regions by an arbitrary\nclosed curve. One defines that a point within one region represents an occupied\nbond, otherwise it is a vacant bond. Study of three different rules under this\ngeneral formulation, indicates that the percolation threshold is always larger\nand varies continuously. This threshold has two limiting values, one is\n$p_c$(sq), the percolation threshold for the ordinary site percolation on the\nsquare lattice and the other being unity. The variation of the thresholds are\ncharacterized by exponents, which are not known in the literature. In a special\ncase, all lattice sites are occupied by discs of random radii $R \\in \\{0,R_0\\}$\nand a percolation transition is observed with $R_0$ as the control variable,\nsimilar to the site occupation probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2016 07:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

We also study the effect of a finite source star on\nthe moon feature in the wide planetary lensing events. From this study, we find\nthat when the lunar caustic is sufficiently separated from the planetary\ncaustic, the lower limit on the ratio of the lunar caustic size to the source\nradius causing a $\\geq 5\\%$ lunar deviation depends mostly on the projected\nplanet-moon separation regardless of the moon/star mass ratio, and it decreases\nas the planet-moon separation becomes smaller or larger than the planetary\nEinstein radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2016 07:14:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

Here the sensitivity of the\nzonal-mean circulation to reduced air-sea momentum roughness ($Z_{0m}$) at low\nflow speed is investigated with the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM3). In an\naquaplanet framework with prescribed sea surface temperatures, the response to\nreduced $Z_{0m}$ resembles the La Ni$\\tilde{\\text{n}}$a minus El\nNi$\\tilde{\\text{n}}$o response to El Ni$\\tilde{\\text{n}}$o Southern Oscillation\nvariability with: i) a poleward shift of the mid-latitude westerlies extending\nall the way to the surface; ii) a weak poleward shift of the subtropical\ndescent region; and iii) a weakening of the Hadley circulation, which is\ngenerally also accompanied by a poleward shift of the inter-tropical\nconvergence zone (ITCZ) and the tropical surface easterlies. Mechanism-denial\nexperiments show this response to be initiated by the reduction of tropical\nlatent and sensible heat fluxes, effected by reducing $Z_{0m}$. The circulation\nresponse is elucidated by considering the effect of the tropical energy fluxes\non the Hadley circulation strength, the upper tropospheric critical layer\nlatitudes, and the lower-tropospheric baroclinic eddy forcing. The ITCZ shift\nis understood via moist static energy budget analysis in the tropics. The\ncirculation response to reduced $Z_{0m}$ carries over to more complex setups\nwith seasonal cycle, full complexity of atmosphere-ice-land-ocean interaction,\nand a slab ocean lower boundary condition. Hence, relatively small changes in\nthe surface parameterization parameters can lead to a significant circulation\nresponse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2016 07:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

Such framework typically employs the Model\nAverage approach, denoted as MA-DNN, in which parallel workers conduct\nrespective training based on their own local data while the parameters of local\nmodels are periodically communicated and averaged to obtain a global model\nwhich serves as the new start of local models. However, since DNN is a highly\nnon-convex model, averaging parameters cannot ensure that such global model can\nperform better than those local models. To tackle this problem, we introduce a\nnew parallel training framework called Ensemble-Compression, denoted as EC-DNN.\nIn this framework, we propose to aggregate the local models by ensemble, i.e.,\naveraging the outputs of local models instead of the parameters. As most of\nprevalent loss functions are convex to the output of DNN, the performance of\nensemble-based global model is guaranteed to be at least as good as the average\nperformance of local models. However, a big challenge lies in the explosion of\nmodel size since each round of ensemble can give rise to multiple times size\nincrement. Thus, we carry out model compression after each ensemble,\nspecialized by a distillation based method in this paper, to reduce the size of\nthe global model to be the same as the local ones.

Results of tracer distribution obtained by recurrence CFD are in\nvery good agreement with full CFD simulations, while computational times are\ndramatically reduced.

The\nmodel is applied to examine in detail the slowing-down of 8.7-MeV alpha\nparticles produced in the 7Li(p,alpha)alpha reaction of the pp chain, and to\nstudy suprathermal processes in the solar CNO cycle induced by them. The\ninfluence of electron degeneracy and electron screening on suprathermal\nreactions through in-flight reaction probability and fast particle emission\nrate is clarified. In particular, these effects account for a 20% increase of\nthe 14N(alpha,p)17O reaction rate at R < 0.2Rsun. This new type of correction\nis important for the suprathermal reaction like 14N(alpha,p)17O as it is\nrecognized to be capable of distorting the CNO cycle in the 95% region of the\nsolar core. In this region, normal branching 14N <-- 17O --> 18F of nuclear\nflow transforms to abnormal sequential flow 14N --> 17O --> 18F, and the\n14N(alpha,p)17O reaction rate exceeds the rate of 17O burn up through\nconventional 17O(p,alpha)14N and 17O(p,gamma)18F processes. It is shown that\nthese factors can enhance the 17O abundance in the core as compared with\nstandard estimates. For the steady state case, the abundance enhancement is\nestimated to be as high as ~ 100 in the outer core region.

The previous studies have attempted to propose\noptimal scheduling algorithms to obtain the maximum QoA assuming a fixed\nunderlying aggregation tree. However, there exists no prior work to address the\nissue of constructing optimal aggregation tree in deadline-constraints WSNs.\nThe structure of underlying aggregation tree is important since our analysis\ndemonstrates that the ratio between the maximum achievable QoAs of different\ntrees could be as large as O(2^D), where D is the deadline. This paper casts a\ncombinatorial optimization problem to address optimal tree construction for\ndeadline-constrained data aggregation in WSNs. While the problem is proved to\nbe NP-hard, we employ the recently proposed Markov approximation framework and\ndevise two distributed algorithms with different computation overheads to find\nclose-to-optimal solutions with bounded approximation gap. To further improve\nthe convergence of the proposed Markov-based algorithms, we devise another\ninitial tree construction algorithm with low computational complexity. Our\nextensive experiments for a set randomly-generated scenarios demonstrate that\nthe proposed algorithms outperforms the existing alternative methods by\nobtaining better quality of aggregations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2016 11:50:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-03"}

Due to the small volume and\nthe resulting low self-capacitance, each single nanoparticle exhibits a high\ncharging energy. Thus, a Coulomb-energy gap emerges during transport\nexperiments that can be shifted by electric fields, allowing for charge\ntransport whenever energy levels of neighboring particles match. Hence, the\nstate of the device changes sequentially between conducting and non-conducting\ninstead of just one transition from conducting to pinch-off as in\nsemiconductors. To exploit this behavior for field-effect transistors, it is\nnecessary to use uniform nanoparticles in ordered arrays separated by\nwell-defined tunnel barriers.

In this paper, we rigorously prove that for any p, p1, p2>0\nsatisfying 1/p=1/p1+1/p2, the Schatten-p quasi-norm of any matrix is equivalent\nto minimizing the product of the Schatten-p1 norm (or quasi-norm) and\nSchatten-p2 norm (or quasi-norm) of its two factor matrices.

In particular, when p>1/2, there is an equivalence\nbetween the Schatten-p quasi-norm of any matrix and the Schatten-2p norms of\nits two factor matrices, where the widely used equivalent formulation of the\nnuclear norm can be viewed as a special case. That is, various SQNM problems\nwith p>1/2 can be transformed into the one only involving smooth, convex norms\nof two factor matrices, which can lead to simpler and more efficient algorithms\nthan conventional methods.\n  We further extend the theoretical results of two factor matrices to the cases\nof three and more factor matrices, from which we can see that for any 0<p<1,\nthe Schatten-p quasi-norm of any matrix is the minimization of the mean of the\nSchatten-(p3+1)p norms of all factor matrices, where p3 denotes the largest\ninteger not exceeding 1/p.

Within our approximation, the\nbaryon onset turns out to be a second-order phase transition, at odds with\nnature, and there is no transition to quark matter at high densities, at odds\nwith expectations from QCD. This changes when we impose certain constraints on\nthe shape of single instantons, motivated by known features of holographic\nbaryons in the vacuum. Then, a first-order baryon onset and chiral restoration\nat high density are possible, and at sufficiently large densities two instanton\nlayers are formed dynamically.

To lessen the computational burden and delay incurred onto the\nreceiver, we estimate phase noise using only scattered pilot subcarriers, i.e.,\nno tentative symbol decisions are used in obtaining and improving the phase\nnoise estimate. In particular, the phase noise estimation problem is posed as\nan unconstrained optimization problem whose minimizer suffers from the\nso-called amplitude and phase estimation error. These errors arise due to\nreceiver noise, estimation from limited scattered pilot subcarriers and\nestimation using a dimensionality reduction model. It is empirically shown\nthat, at high signal-to-noise-ratios, the phase estimation error is small. To\nreduce the amplitude estimation error, we restrict the minimizer to be drawn\nfrom the so-called phase noise geometry set when minimizing the cost function.\nThe resulting optimization problem is a non-convex program. However, using the\nS-procedure for quadratic equalities, we show that the optimal solution can be\nobtained by solving the convex dual problem. We also consider a less complex\nheuristic scheme that achieves the same objective of restricting the minimizer\nto the phase noise geometry set. Through simulations, we demonstrate improved\ncoded bit-error-rate and phase noise estimation error performance when\nenforcing the phase noise geometry. For example, at high\nsignal-to-noise-ratios, the probability density function of the phase noise\nestimation error exhibits thinner tails which results in lower bit-error-rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2016 14:07:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

We show that this behavior, which holds for all\n$7\\leq n\\leq 14$, arises from weak entropic forces among the particles. Strong\ndirectional entropic forces align polygons with fewer than seven edges and\nimpose local order in the fluid.

New SHE have been recently produced with\ndoubly-magic $^{48}$Ca beams. However, SHE synthesis experiments with\nsingle-magic $^{50}$Ti beams have so far been unsuccessful. Purpose: In\nconnection with experimental searches for $Z=117,119$ superheavy elements, we\nperform a theoretical study of fusion and quasifission mechanisms in\n$^{48}$Ca,$^{50}$Ti+$^{249}$Bk reactions in order to investigate possible\ndifferences in reaction mechanisms induced by these two projectiles. Methods:\nThe collision dynamics and the outcome of the reactions are studied using\nunrestricted time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) calculations as well as the\ndensity-constrained TDHF method to extract the nucleus-nucleus potentials and\nthe excitation energy in each fragment. Results: Nucleus-nucleus potentials,\nnuclear contact times, masses and charges of the fragments, as well as their\nkinetic and excitation energies strongly depend on the orientation of the\nprolate $^{249}$Bk nucleus. Long contact times associated with fusion are\nobserved in collisions of both projectiles with the side of the $^{249}$Bk\nnucleus, but not on collisions with its tip. The energy and impact parameter\ndependences of the fragment properties, as well as their mass-angle and\nmass-total kinetic energy correlations are investigated. Conclusions: Entrance\nchannel reaction dynamics are similar with both $^{48}$Ca and $^{50}$Ti\nprojectiles. Both are expected to lead to the formation of a compound nucleus\nby fusion if they have enough energy to get in contact with the side of the\n$^{249}$Bk target.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2016 14:33:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-03"}

This \"Lagrangian fluctuation-dissipation relation\"\nequates the scalar dissipation for either passive or active scalars to the\nvariance of scalar inputs associated to initial scalar values and internal\nscalar sources, as those are sampled backward in time by the stochastic\nLagrangian trajectories. As an important application, we reconsider the\nphenomenon of \"Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity\" or persistent\nnon-determinism of Lagrangian particle trajectories in the limit of vanishing\nviscosity and diffusivity. Previous work on the Kraichnan (1968) model of\nturbulent scalar advection has shown that anomalous scalar dissipation is\nassociated in that model to Lagrangian spontaneous stochasticity. There has\nbeen controversy, however, regarding the validity of this mechanism for scalars\nadvected by an actual turbulent flow. We here completely resolve this\ncontroversy by exploiting the fluctuation-dissipation relation. For either a\npassive or active scalar advected by any divergence-free velocity field,\nincluding solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation, and away from\nwalls, we prove that anomalous scalar dissipation requires Lagrangian\nspontaneous stochasticity. For passive scalars we prove furthermore that\nspontaneous stochasticity yields anomalous dissipation for suitable initial\nscalar distributions, so that the two phenomena are there completely\nequivalent. These points are illustrated by numerical results from a database\nof homogeneous, isotropic turbulence, which provide both additional support to\nthe results and physical insight into the representation of diffusive effects\nby stochastic Lagrangian particle trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2016 15:47:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 22:35:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 16:09:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-13"}

The primary\nadvantage of TRANSEC is its highly parallel algorithm, which enables studying\nconductance in large systems. The present scheme adds a new source of\nparallelization, significantly enhancing TRANSEC's parallel scalability,\nespecially for systems with many electrons. In principle, partitioning could\nenable super-linear parallel speedup, as we demonstrate in calculations within\nTRANSEC. In practical cases, we report better than five-fold improvement in CPU\ntime and similar improvements in wall time, compared to previously-published\nlarge calculations. Importantly, the suggested scheme is relatively simple to\nimplement. It can be useful for general large Hermitian or weakly non-Hermitian\neigenvalue problems, whenever relatively accurate inversion via direct or\niterative linear solvers is impractical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2016 06:32:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}

Despite apparent environmental and economic advantages of EVs,\ntheir high demand charging jobs pose an immense challenge to the existing\nelectricity grid infrastructure. In microgrids, as the small-scale version of\ntraditional power grid, however, the EV charging scheduling is more\nchallenging. This is because, the microgrid owner, as a large electricity\ncustomer, is interested in shaving its global peak demand, i.e., the aggregated\ndemand over multiple parking stations, to reduce total electricity cost. While\nthe EV charging scheduling problem in single station scenario has been studied\nextensively in the previous research, the microgrid-level problem with multiple\nstations subject to a global peak constraint is not tackled. This paper aims to\npropose a near-optimal EV charging scheduling mechanism in a microgrid governed\nby a single utility provider with multiple charging stations. The goal is to\nmaximize the total revenue while respecting both local and global peak\nconstraints. The underlying problem, however, is a NP-hard mixed integer linear\nproblem which is difficult to tackle and calls for approximation algorithm\ndesign. We design a primaldual scheduling algorithm which runs in polynomial\ntime and achieves bounded approximation ratio. Moreover, the proposed global\nscheduling algorithm applies a valley-filling strategy to further reduce the\nglobal peak. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed\nalgorithm is 98% of the optimum, which is much better than the theoretical\nbound obtained by our approximation analysis. Our algorithm reduces the peak\ndemand obtained by the existing alternative algorithm by 16% and simultaneously\nachieves better resource utilization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2016 11:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}
