We also investigated the differences\nbetween samples when galaxies are selected only in one particular band (pure\ncompact groups) and those that exist regardless the band in which galaxies were\nobserved (common compact groups). We found that the differences between the\ntotal samples are magnified, but also some others arise: pure-r compact groups\nare the largest in projection; pure-u compact groups have the brightest first\nranked galaxies, and the most similar two first ranked galaxies; pure-K compact\ngroups have the highest compactness and the most different two first ranked\ngalaxies; and common compact groups show the largest percentage of physically\ndense groups. Therefore, without a careful selection and identification of the\nsamples, the characteristic features of group properties in a particular\nphotometric band could be overshadowed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2016 16:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

To accomplish this task, the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model is\nstudied through the replica formalism, within a one-step\nreplica-symmetry-breaking procedure. In addition, the dependence of the\nAlmeida-Thouless eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\rm AT}$ (replicon) on the random fields\nis analyzed. Particularly, in absence of random fields, the temperature $T_f$\ncan be traced by a divergence in the spin-glass susceptibility $\\chi_{\\rm SG}$,\nwhich presents a term inversely proportional to the replicon $\\lambda_{\\rm\nAT}$.

Thus, the maximum\nvalue of $\\chi_3$ at $T^*$ reflects the effects of the random fields in the\nparamagnetic phase, instead of the non-trivial ergodicity breaking associated\nwith the spin-glass phase transition.

To\nensure that our CIs are honest, we use critical values that take into account\nthe possible bias of the estimator upon which the CIs are based. We show that\nthis approach leads to CIs that are more efficient than conventional CIs that\nachieve coverage by undersmoothing or subtracting an estimate of the bias. We\ngive sharp efficiency bounds of using different kernels, and derive the optimal\nbandwidth for constructing honest CIs. We show that using the bandwidth that\nminimizes the maximum mean-squared error results in CIs that are nearly\nefficient and that in this case, the critical value depends only on the rate of\nconvergence. For the common case in which the rate of convergence is\n$n^{-2/5}$, the appropriate critical value for 95% CIs is 2.18, rather than the\nusual 1.96 critical value.

Analysis of the X-ray spectra obtained in 2013\nand 2015 confirms that AG Peg is an X-ray source of class $\\beta$ of the X-ray\nsources amongst the symbiotic stars. The X-ray emission of AG Peg as observed\nwith ROSAT (1993 June) might well originate from colliding stellar winds (CSW)\nin binary system. On the other hand, the characteristics of the X-ray emission\nof AG Peg in 2013 and 2015 (Swift) are hard to accommodate in the framework of\nthe CSW picture. Analysis of the light curves in 2015 shows that the power\nspectrum of the X-ray variability in AG Peg resembles that of the flicker noise\n(or flickering) being typical for accretion processes in astronomical objects.\nThis is a sign that CSWs did not play a key role for the X-ray emission from AG\nPeg in 2013-2015 and a different mechanism (probably accretion) is also getting\ninto play.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2016 17:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

Despite their importance, the complexity of these\nproblems is prohibitively high (coNEXPTIME-complete). We isolate their two main\nsources of complexity and propose relaxations of them that reduce the\ncomplexity while having meaningful theoretical interpretations. The first\nrelaxation is based on the idea of using existential pebble games for\napproximating homomorphism tests. We show that this characterizes\nQBE/definability for CQs up to treewidth $k$, while reducing the complexity to\nEXPTIME. As a side result, we obtain that the complexity of the\nQBE/definability problems for CQs of treewidth $k$ is EXPTIME-complete for each\n$k \\geq 1$. The second relaxation is based on the idea of \"desynchronizing\"\ndirect products, which characterizes QBE/definability for unions of CQs and\nreduces the complexity to coNP. The combination of these two relaxations yields\ntractability for QBE and characterizes it in terms of unions of CQs of\ntreewidth at most $k$.

The main goal of the program\nis to determine whether the star formation histories (SFHs) of the Andromeda\ndSph satellites demonstrate significant statistical differences from those of\nthe Milky Way, which may be attributable to the different properties of their\nlocal environments. Our observations reach the oldest main sequence turn-offs,\nallowing a time resolution at the oldest ages of ~ 1 Gyr, which is comparable\nto the best achievable resolution in the MW satellites. We find that the six\ndSphs present a variety of SFHs that are not strictly correlated with\nluminosity or present distance from M31. Specifically, we find a significant\nrange in quenching times (lookback times from 9 to 6 Gyr), but with all\nquenching times more than ~ 6 Gyr ago. In agreement with observations of Milky\nWay companions of similar mass, there is no evidence of complete quenching of\nstar formation by the cosmic UV background responsible for reionization, but\nthe possibility of a degree of quenching at reionization cannot be ruled out.\nWe do not find significant differences between the SFHs of the three members of\nthe vast, thin plane of satellites and the three off-plane dSphs. The primary\ndifference between the SFHs of the ISLAndS dSphs and Milky Way dSph companions\nof similar luminosities and host distances is the absence of very late\nquenching (< 5 Gyr ago) dSphs in the ISLAndS sample.

In many cases,\nthe surface can exhibit chemical properties unique from the bulk. These\ndifferences are important as they control reactions and mediate thin film\ngrowth. This is particularly true for complex oxides where certain terminating\ncrystal planes are polar and have a net dipole moment. For polar terminations,\nreconstruction of atoms on the surface is the central mechanism to avoid the so\ncalled polar catastrophe. This adds to the complexity of the reconstruction\nwhere charge polarization and stoichiometry govern the final surface in\naddition to standard thermodynamic parameters such as temperature and partial\npressure. Here we present direct, in-situ determination of polar SrTiO3 (110)\nsurfaces at temperatures up to 900 C using cross-sectional aberration corrected\nscanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Under these conditions, we\nobserve the coexistence of various surface structures that change as a function\nof temperature. As the specimen temperature is lowered, the reconstructed\nsurface evolves due to thermal mismatch with the substrate. Periodic defects,\nsimilar to dislocations, are found in these surface structures and act to\nrelieve stress due to mismatch. Combining STEM observations and electron\nspectroscopy with density functional theory, we find a combination of lattice\nmisfit and charge compensation for stabilization. Beyond the characterization\nof these complex reconstructions, we have developed a general framework that\nopens a new pathway to simultaneously investigate the surface and near surface\nregions of single crystals as a function of environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2016 19:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

A triangle in $\\mathbb{F}_p^n$ is an ordered triple\n$(x,y,z)$ of points satisfying $x+y+z=0$. Let $N=p^n=|\\mathbb{F}_p^n|$. Green\nproved an arithmetic triangle removal lemma which says that for every\n$\\epsilon>0$ and prime $p$, there is a $\\delta>0$ such that if $X,Y,Z \\subset\n\\mathbb{F}_p^n$ and the number of triangles in $X \\times Y \\times Z$ is at most\n$\\delta N^2$, then we can delete $\\epsilon N$ elements from $X$, $Y$, and $Z$\nand remove all triangles. Green posed the problem of improving the quantitative\nbounds on the arithmetic triangle removal lemma, and, in particular, asked\nwhether a polynomial bound holds.

While these quantities cannot be directly\nobserved, there are suitable proxies: the luminosity Lk, half-light radius Re\nand dispersion sigma_e. These proxies indeed lie on a very tight Fundamental\nPlane (FP). How do the black holes in the centers of galaxies relate to the FP?\nTheir masses are known to exhibit no strong correlation with total galaxy mass,\nbut they do correlate weakly with bulge mass (when present), and extremely well\nwith the velocity dispersion through the Mbh = sigma_e^5.4 relation. These\nfacts together imply that a tight plane must also exist defined by black hole\nmass, total galaxy mass and size. Here I show that this is indeed the case\nusing a heterogeneous set of 230 black holes. The sample includes BHs from zero\nto 10 billion solar masses and host galaxies ranging from low surface\nbrightness dwarfs, through bulge-less disks, to brightest cluster galaxies. The\nresulting BH-size-luminosity Mbh=(Lk/Re)^3.8 has the same amount of scatter as\nthe M-sigma relation and is aligned with the galaxy FP, such that it is just a\nre-projection of sigma. The inferred BH-size-mass relation is\nMbh=(M_star/Re)^2.9. These relationships are universal and extend to galaxies\nwithout bulges. This implies that the black hole is primarily correlated with\nits global velocity dispersion and not with the properties of the bulge. I show\nthat the classical bulge--mass relation is a projection of the M-sigma\nrelation. When the velocity dispersion cannot be measured (at high-z or low\ndispersions), the BH-size-mass relation should be used as a proxy for black\nhole mass in favor of just galaxy or bulge mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2016 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2016 14:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-07"}

The DM density in the cusp varies as $r^{-1/2}$ for\n$s$-wave annihilation, where $r$ is the distance from the central black hole,\nand is not a flat \"plateau\" profile.

For the linear\nversion of this problem, the so-called controllability Gramian has played an\nimportant role to quantify how effectively the dynamical states are reachable\nby a suitable driving input. In this paper, we first extend the notion of the\ncontrollability Gramian to nonlinear dynamics in terms of the Gibbs\ndistribution. Next, we show that, when the networks are open to environmental\nnoise, the newly defined Gramian is equal to the covariance matrix associated\nwith randomly excited, but uncontrolled, dynamical state trajectories. This\nfact theoretically justifies a simple Monte Carlo simulation that can extract\neffectively controllable subdynamics in nonlinear complex networks. In\naddition, the result provides a novel insight into the relationship between\ncontrollability and statistical mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2016 20:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}

The [OIII]/H$\\beta$ line\nratio is of interest because it is a main component of the standard diagnostic\ntools used to differentiate between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and\nstar-forming galaxies, as well as the gas-phase metallicity indicators $O_{23}$\nand $R_{23}$. Here, we investigate the primary driver of increased\n[OIII]/H$\\beta$ ratios by median-stacking rest-frame optical spectra for a\nsample of star-forming galaxies in the 3D-HST survey in the redshift range\n$z\\sim1.4-2.2$.

We are\ngiven a decision set $\\mathcal{X}$ in a reflexive Banach space $X$ and a\nsequence of reward vectors in the dual space of $X$. At each iteration, we\nchoose an action from $\\mathcal{X}$, based on the observed sequence of previous\nrewards. Our goal is to minimize regret, defined as the gap between the\nrealized reward and the reward of the best fixed action in hindsight. Using\nresults from infinite dimensional convex analysis, we generalize the method of\nDual Averaging (or Follow the Regularized Leader) to our setting and obtain\ngeneral upper bounds on the worst-case regret that subsume a wide range of\nresults from the literature. Under the assumption of uniformly continuous\nrewards, we obtain explicit anytime regret bounds in a setting where the\ndecision set is the set of probability distributions on a compact metric space\n$S$ whose Radon-Nikodym derivatives are elements of $L^p(S)$ for some $p > 1$.\nImportantly, we make no convexity assumptions on either the set $S$ or the\nreward functions. We also prove a general lower bound on the worst-case regret\nfor any online algorithm. We then apply these results to the problem of\nlearning in repeated continuous two-player zero-sum games, in which players'\nstrategy sets are compact metric spaces. In doing so, we first prove that if\nboth players play a Hannan-consistent strategy, then with probability 1 the\nempirical distributions of play weakly converge to the set of Nash equilibria\nof the game. We then show that, under mild assumptions, Dual Averaging on the\n(infinite-dimensional) space of probability distributions indeed achieves\nHannan-consistency. Finally, we illustrate our results through numerical\nexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2016 20:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}

Followup simulations performed using\npreviously-estimated binary parameters most resemble the data.

Simulations with extreme mass ratios and effective\nspins are highly inconsistent with the data, at any mass. Several nonprecessing\nand precessing simulations with similar mass ratio and \\chi_{eff} are\nconsistent with the data. Though correlated, the components' spins (both in\nmagnitude and directions) are not significantly constrained by the data. For\nnonprecessing binaries, interpolating between simulations, we reconstruct a\nposterior distribution consistent with previous results. The final black hole's\nredshifted mass is consistent with Mf,z between 64.0 - 73.5M_\\odot and the\nfinal black hole's dimensionless spin parameter is consistent with af = 0.62 -\n0.73. As our approach invokes no intermediate approximations to general\nrelativity and can strongly reject binaries whose radiation is inconsistent\nwith the data, our analysis provides a valuable complement to LVC_PE[1].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2016 20:13:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

In addition, the developer can provide software\nthat expresses business rules and provides access to programmatic APIs,\nenabling the LSTM to take actions in the real world on behalf of the user. The\nLSTM can be optimized using supervised learning (SL), where a domain expert\nprovides example dialogs which the LSTM should imitate; or using reinforcement\nlearning (RL), where the system improves by interacting directly with end\nusers.

To recognize driving styles of path-tracking behaviors for\ndifferent divers, a statistical pattern-recognition method is developed to deal\nwith the uncertainty of driving styles or characteristics based on probability\ndensity estimation. First, to describe driver path-tracking styles, vehicle\nspeed and throttle opening are selected as the discriminative parameters, and a\nconditional kernel density function of vehicle speed and throttle opening is\nbuilt, respectively, to describe the uncertainty and probability of two\nrepresentative driving styles, e.g., aggressive and normal. Meanwhile, a\nposterior probability of each element in feature vector is obtained using full\nBayesian theory. Second, a Euclidean distance method is involved to decide to\nwhich class the driver should be subject instead of calculating the complex\ncovariance between every two elements of feature vectors. By comparing the\nEuclidean distance between every elements in feature vector, driving styles are\nclassified into seven levels ranging from low normal to high aggressive.\nSubsequently, to show benefits of the proposed pattern-recognition method, a\ncross-validated method is used, compared with a fuzzy logic-based\npattern-recognition method. The experiment results show that the proposed\nstatistical pattern-recognition method for driving styles based on kernel\ndensity estimation is more efficient and stable than the fuzzy logic-based\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2016 21:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-12"}

However, this\nconsiderable improvement takes place mainly for small values of $ke$, when the\ninteraction between networks becomes stronger there is only a slight change in\nthe fluctuations.

We apply a Bayesian\nmodel-selection framework on these pre-generated models. We compare our\nalgorithm with classical inversion methods using simulated measurements. We\nthen extend our reconstruction algorithm for two-component aerosols, so that we\ncan simultaneously retrieve their particle-size distributions and unknown\nvolume fractions of their two components. Finally we present the results of a\nnumerical study for the extended algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2016 22:31:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 18:57:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-17"}

We detect Lyman-alpha emission in COS-zs7-1,\nconfirming its redshift as z=7.154, and we detect Lyman-alpha in EGS-zs8-2 at\nz=7.477, verifying a tentative detection presented in an earlier study. The\nubiquity of Lyman-alpha in this sample is puzzling given that the IGM is likely\nsignificantly neutral over 7<z<9. To investigate this result in more detail, we\nhave initiated a campaign to target UV metal emission in the four Lyman-alpha\nemitters as a probe of both the radiation field and the velocity offset of\nLyman-alpha. Here we present the detection of intense CIII] emission in\nEGS-zs8-1, a galaxy from this sample previously shown to have Lyman-alpha at\nz=7.73. Photoionization models indicate that an intense radiation field and low\nmetallicity are required to reproduce the intense CIII] and optical line\nemission. We argue that this extreme radiation field is likely to affect the\nlocal environment, increasing the transmission of Lyman-alpha through the\ngalaxy. Moreover, the centroid of CIII] indicates that Lyman-alpha is\nredshifted from the systemic value by 340 km/s. This velocity offset is larger\nthan that seen in less luminous systems, providing an additional explanation\nfor the transmission of Lyman-alpha emission through the IGM. Since the\ntransmission is further enhanced by the likelihood that such systems are also\nsituated in the densest regions with the largest ionized bubbles, the\nvisibility of Lyman-alpha at z>7 is expected to be strongly\nluminosity-dependent, with the most effective transmission occurring in systems\nwith intense star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2016 23:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

Of this, approximately 10 tonnes would be allocated for cruise-phase\nscience instruments, and about 35 tonnes (i.e. the average of estimated lower\nand upper limits of 28 and 41 tonnes) would be contributed by the intra-system\nscience payload itself (i.e. the dry mass of the stellar and planetary probes\nand their instruments). The remaining ~55 tonnes is allocated for the sub-probe\nintra-system propulsion requirements (crudely estimated from current Solar\nSystem missions; detailed modelling of sub-probe propulsion systems will be\nneeded to refine this figure). The overall mass contributed by the science\npayload to the total that must be decelerated from the interstellar cruise\nvelocity will be considerably more than 100 tonnes, however, as allowance must\nbe made for the payload structural and infrastructural elements required to\nsupport, deploy, and communicate with the science probes and instruments. Based\non the earlier Daedalus study, we estimate another factor of two to allow for\nthese components. Pending the outcome of more detailed studies, it therefore\nappears that an overall science-related payload mass of ~200 tonnes will be\nrequired.

The two main competing\nmechanisms are the extensively studied internal shocks and the less studied\nmagnetic reconnection. Here we consider GRB emission from magnetic reconnection\naccounting for the relativistic bulk motions that it produces in the jet's bulk\nrest frame. Far from the source the magnetic field is almost exactly normal to\nthe radial direction, suggesting locally quasi-spherical thin reconnection\nlayers between regions of oppositely directed magnetic field. We show that if\nthe relativistic motions in the jet's frame are confined to such a\nquasi-spherical uniform layer, then the resulting GRB lightcurves are\nindependent of their direction distribution within this layer. This renders\nprevious results for a delta-function velocity-direction distribution\n(Beniamini & Granot 2016) applicable to a much more general class of\nreconnection models, which are suggested by numerical simulations. Such models\nthat vary in their velocity-direction distribution differ mainly in the size of\nthe bright region that contributes most of the observed flux at a given\nemission radius or observed time. The more sharply peaked this distribution,\nthe smaller this bright region, and the stronger the lightcurve variability\nthat may be induced by deviations from a uniform emission over the thin\nreconnection layer, which may be expected in a realistic GRB outflow. This is\nreflected both in the observed image at a given observed time and in the\nobserver-frame emissivity map at a given emission radius, which are calculated\nhere for three simple velocity-direction distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2016 09:21:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}

Traditionally,\nlectures and presentations rely on one-way communication from the presenter to\nthe listening audience. Without receiving ongoing feedback, speakers cannot be\nsure that their delivery is at an appropriate pace, or that their message is\nbeing received and understood by their audience. This study suggests using a\nreal-time audience engagement solution (Xorro-Q) to facilitate synchronous\ninteraction between lecturers and their student audiences. Using activity\ntheory as a theoretical framework we conducted a study to investigate student\nparticipation and engagement with an audience interaction tool in two\nundergraduate computing courses. In one classroom setting, discussion questions\nare raised during the class and instant feedback provided to students. In the\nsecond setting, subject related questions were asked near the end of the\nlecture to gauge students knowledge of concepts just taught in the class. In\nthis study quantitative data such as attendance, response rates, and assessment\noutcomes were collected to explore how participant engagement varies across\ndifferent lecturing techniques. Findings from the study show that continuous\nuse of audience interaction tools through activity theory based settings is\npreferred than merely using tools for assessment purpose in traditional\nclassroom settings. Although these findings are at a very initial stage, they\ngive some indication on how real-time audience engagement tools can be\ndeveloped within classroom settings for assisting in teaching and learning\npractices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2016 10:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}

A simple\nand natural strategy is to select the best assortment out of all those that are\nconstructed by fixing a threshold revenue $\\pi$ and then choosing all products\nwith revenue at least $\\pi$. This is known as the revenue-ordered assortments\nstrategy. In this paper we study the approximation guarantees provided by\nrevenue-ordered assortments when customers are rational in the following sense:\nthe probability of selecting a specific product from the set being offered\ncannot increase if the set is enlarged. This rationality assumption, known as\nregularity, is satisfied by almost all discrete choice models considered in the\nrevenue management and choice theory literature, and in particular by random\nutility models. The bounds we obtain are tight and improve on recent results in\nthat direction, such as for the Mixed Multinomial Logit model by\nRusmevichientong et al. (2014). An appealing feature of our analysis is its\nsimplicity, as it relies only on the regularity condition.\n  We also draw a connection between assortment optimisation and two pricing\nproblems called unit demand envy-free pricing and Stackelberg minimum spanning\ntree: These problems can be restated as assortment problems under discrete\nchoice models satisfying the regularity condition, and moreover revenue-ordered\nassortments correspond then to the well-studied uniform pricing heuristic. When\nspecialised to that setting, the general bounds we establish for\nrevenue-ordered assortments match and unify the best known results on uniform\npricing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2016 11:31:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 08:57:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Feb 2019 09:13:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-22"}

Consensus is critical when distributed services\nare replicated for fault-tolerance, because non-faulty replicas must agree on\nthe state of the system or the sequence of operations that have been performed.\nUnfortunately, consensus algorithms including Multi-Paxos in particular are\nwell-known to be difficult to understand, and their accurate specifications and\ncorrectness proofs remain challenging, despite extensive studies ever since\nLamport introduced Paxos.\n  This article describes formal specification and verification of Lamport's\nMulti-Paxos algorithm for distributed consensus. The specification is written\nin TLA+, Lamport's Temporal Logic of Actions. The proof is written and\nautomatically checked using TLAPS, the TLA+ Proof System. The proof is for the\nsafety property of the algorithm. Building on Lamport, Merz, and Doligez's\nspecification and proof for Basic Paxos, we aim to facilitate the understanding\nof Multi-Paxos and its proof by minimizing the difference from those for Basic\nPaxos, and to demonstrate a general way of proving other variants of Paxos and\nother sophisticated distributed algorithms.

The fabrication and\ncharacterization of novel luminescent defects with suitable opto-physical\nproperties is therefore of primary importance for further advances in these\nresearch fields. In this work we report on the investigation in the formation\nof photoluminescent (PL) defects upon MeV He implantation in diamond. Such\ncolor centers, previously reported only in electroluminescence and\ncathodoluminescence regime, exhibited two sharp emission lines at 536.5 nm and\n560.5 nm, without significant phonon sidebands. A strong correlation between\nthe PL intensities of the above-mentioned emission lines and the He\nimplantation fluence was found in the 10^15-10^17 cm^{-2} fluence range. The PL\nemission features were not detected in control samples, i.e. samples that were\neither unirradiated or irradiated with different ion species (H, C). Moreover,\nthe PL emission lines disappeared in samples that were He-implanted above the\ngraphitization threshold. Therefore, the PL features are attributed to\noptically active defects in the diamond matrix associated with He impurities.\nThe intensity of the 536.5 nm and 560.5 nm emission lines was investigated as a\nfunction of the annealing temperature of the diamond substrate. The emission\nwas observed upon annealing at temperatures higher than 500{\\deg}C, at the\nexpenses of the concurrently decreasing neutral-vacancy-related GR1 emission\nintensity. Therefore, our findings indicate that the luminescence originates\nfrom the formation of a stable lattice defect. Finally, the emission was\ninvestigated under different laser excitations wavelengths (i.e. 532 nm and 405\nnm) with the purpose of gaining a preliminary insight about the position of the\nrelated levels in the energy gap of diamond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2016 15:49:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-14"}

The morphology of the emission in this band is generally diffuse and\nfilamentary, consistent with synchrotron radiation observed at radio\nwavelengths. However, in one region to the southwest of the remnant, compact\nknots of emission appear to be entrained in the ejecta and have the same proper\nmotion as ejecta observed at similar projected radii. The presence of these\nknots suggests that material with high magnetic field strength contributes\nsignificantly to synchrotron emission at these wavelengths. We analyze these\nknots at J, H, and Ks bands as well as in 3.5-8 micron emission and at 6 cm\nwhere synchrotron emission is dominant and we find that the Ks band emission\nfalls along the expected synchrotron spectrum. Using multi-epoch data, we\ncalculate the magnetic field strength and electron density for a population of\nnear-infrared synchrotron-emitting electrons. We find electron densities from\n1,000-15,000 cm$^{-3}$ and magnetic field strengths from 1.3-5.8 mG. These\nmagnetic field strengths are an order of magnitude higher than inferred from\nthe much lower angular resolution gamma-ray observations toward Cas A. We\nconclude that dense knots of post-shock material behind the Cas A shock front\nare emitting synchrotron emission in a compressed and enhanced magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2016 18:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}

In both setups, the fermionic reservoirs are voltage\nbiased, and the quantum dots are coupled to a single-mode cavity.
