In this paper, we simulate blood flow and oxygen\ntransfer in feto-placental capillaries by converting three-dimensional\nrepresentations of villous and capillary surfaces, reconstructed from confocal\nlaser scanning microscopy, to finite-element meshes, and calculating values of\nvascular flow resistance and total oxygen transfer. The relationship between\nthe total oxygen transfer rate and the pressure drop through the capillary is\nshown to be captured across a wide range of pressure drops by physical scaling\nlaws and an upper bound on the oxygen transfer rate. A regression equation is\nintroduced that can be used to estimate the oxygen transfer in a capillary\nusing the vascular resistance. Two techniques for quantifying the effects of\nstatistical variability, experimental uncertainty and pathological placental\nstructure on the calculated properties are then introduced. First, scaling\narguments are used to quantify the sensitivity of the model to uncertainties in\nthe geometry and the parameters. Second, the effects of localized dilations in\nfetal capillaries are investigated using an idealized axisymmetric model, to\nquantify the possible effect of pathological placental structure on oxygen\ntransfer. The model predicts how, for a fixed pressure drop through a\ncapillary, oxygen transfer is maximized by an optimal width of the dilation.\nThe results could explain the prevalence of fetal hypoxia in cases of delayed\nvillous maturation, a pathology characterized by a lack of the\nvasculo-syncytial membranes often seen in conjunction with localized capillary\ndilations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 16:00:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2016 08:47:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2016 16:49:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 18:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-28"}

Here, a Lattice Boltzmann and Immersed Boundary methods are combined\ntogether for predicting the near wall dynamics of particles with different\nshapes in a laminar flow. For the lattice Boltzmann modelling, a Gauss-Hermite\nprojection is used to derive the lattice equation, wall boundary conditions are\nimposed through the Zou-He framework, and a moving least squares algorithm\naccurately reconstructs the forcing term accounting for the immersed boundary.\nFirst, the computational code is validated against two well-known test cases:\nthe sedimentation of circular and elliptical cylinders in a quiescent fluid. A\nvery good agreement is observed between the present results and those available\nin the literature. Then, the transport of circular, elliptical, rectangular,\nsquare and triangular particles is analyzed in a Couette flow, at Re=20. All\nparticles drifted laterally across the stream lines reaching an equilibrium\nposition, independently of the initial conditions. For this large Reynolds\nnumber, the particle shape has no significant effect on the final equilibrium\nposition but it does affect the absolute value and periodicity of the angular\nvelocity. Specifically, elongated particles show longer oscillation periods\nand, most interestingly, larger variations in angular velocity. The longest\nparticles exhibit a zero angular velocity for almost the whole rotational\nperiod. Collectively, this data demonstrates that the proposed approach can be\nefficiently used for predicting complex particle dynamics in biologically\nrelevant flows. This computational strategy could have significant impact in\nthe field of computational nanomedicine for optimizing the specific delivery of\ntherapeutic and imaging agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 16:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}

Within this framework, we show that decidability imposes\nabsolute limits to the stable growth of complexity in computable dynamical\nsystems. Conversely, systems that exhibit (strong) open-ended evolution must be\nundecidable, establishing undecidability as a requirement for such systems.\nComplexity is assessed in terms of three measures: sophistication, coarse\nsophistication and busy beaver logical depth. These three complexity measures\nassign low complexity values to random (incompressible) objects. As time grows,\nthe stated complexity measures allow for the existence of complex states during\nthe evolution of a computable dynamical system. We show, however, that finding\nthese states involves undecidable computations. We conjecture that for similar\ncomplexity measures that assign low complexity values, decidability imposes\ncomparable limits to the stable growth of complexity, and that such behaviour\nis necessary for non-trivial evolutionary systems. We show that the\nundecidability of adapted states imposes novel and unpredictable behaviour on\nthe individuals or populations being modelled.

Experimentally, several techniques are used to trap the maximum\npossible field in a given practical application. However, regardless of the\nmagnetization method used, there is a physical limit to the maximum magnetic\nfield that a given superconducting magnet can trap. This limit is given by the\ngeometric design, the particular superconducting material used and the\ntemperature of operation. Knowing the maximum possible trapped field is\nimportant for device design as it provides an upper limit for applications such\nas magnetic bearings or rotating machinery. In this work we present a\ncollection of finite element method (FEM) models in 2D and 3D capable of\nestimating the maximum trapped field of stacked tape superconducting magnets.\nThe models are computationally fast and can be used to perform parametric\nstudies with ease. For the case of square stacks tape magnets, various sizes\nare considered and their estimated maximum trapped field is compared with\nexperimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 16:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}

Further, the analysis does not\nnaturally generalize to interesting variations, such as having a server request\nto be placed on the idle queue of a dispatcher before it has completed all\njobs, which can be beneficial under high loads.\n  We provide a new asymptotic analysis of Join-Idle-Queue systems based on mean\nfield fluid limit methods, deriving families of differential equations that\ndescribe these systems. Our analysis avoids previous simplifying assumptions,\nis empirically more accurate, and generalizes naturally to the variation\ndescribed above, as well as other simple variations. Our theoretical and\nempirical analyses shed further light on the performance of Join-Idle-Queue,\nincluding potential performance pitfalls under high load.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 17:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}

The objective of our\npaper is to determine whether next generation telescopes will be capable of\nalbedo estimations for icy exomoons using their occultation light curves. The\nsuccess of the measurements depends on the depth of the moon's occultation in\nthe light curve and on the sensitivity of the used instruments. We applied\nsimple calculations for different stellar masses in the V and J photometric\nbands, and compared the flux drop caused by the moon's occultation and the\nestimated photon noise of next generation missions with 5 $\\sigma$ confidence.\nWe found that albedo estimation by this method is not feasible for moons of\nsolar-like stars, but small M dwarfs are better candidates for such\nmeasurements.

Then we investigate the region of parameter space that is consistent\nwith right handed sneutrino as thermal cold dark matter, under the light of\nPlanck results on the relic abundance and direct detection from LUX experiment.\nThis sneutrino mainly annihilates through an extra neutral gauge boson,\n$Z^\\prime$, and Higgs exchange, so that the physics of dark matter is somewhat\nrelated to the parameters determining Higgs and $Z^\\prime$ masses. We then\nobtain that right handed sneutrino in this model must be heavier than $400$~GeV\nto conform with Planck and LUX, simultaneously constraining the $Z^\\prime$ mass\nto be above 2400~GeV, which is in perfect agreement with LHC searches in a\nnon-supersymmetric version of this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 18:31:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2016 18:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

In addition, our framework shows great noise resilience\ncapability, which tolerates up to 40dB higher noise energy at a CP of 9 times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 19:29:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 21:20:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-20"}

In the distill step, one performs several rounds of\ndistillation to create high-fidelity logical qubits in a magic state. Each such\nmagic state provides one good T gate. In the synthesize step, one seeks the\noptimal decomposition of an algorithm into a sequence of many T gates\ninterleaved with Clifford gates. This gate-synthesis problem is well understood\nfor multiqubit gates that do not use any Hadamards. We present an in-depth\nanalysis of a unified framework that realises one round of distillation and\nmultiqubit gate synthesis in a single step. We call these synthillation\nprotocols, and show they lead to a large reduction in resource overheads. This\nis because synthillation can implement a general class of circuits using the\nsame number of T-states as gate synthesis, yet with the benefit of quadratic\nerror suppression. This general class includes all circuits primarily dominated\nby control-control-Z gates, such as adders and modular exponentiation routines\nused in Shor's algorithm. Therefore, synthillation removes the need for a\ncostly round of magic state distillation. We also present several additional\nresults on the multiqubit gate-synthesis problem. We provide an efficient\nalgorithm for synthesizing unitaries with the same worst-case resource scaling\nas optimal solutions. For the special case of synthesizing\ncontrolled-unitaries, our techniques are not just efficient but exactly\noptimal.

The\nbottleneck in this process, as with all collisional runaways, is growing the\nfirst e-fold in black hole mass. The growth of a stellar mass black hole past\nthis bottleneck occurs as tidally captured stars are consumed in repeated\nepisodes of mass transfer at pericenter. Tidal captures may turn off as a\ngrowth channel once the black hole reaches a mass ~100-1000 solar masses, but\ntidal disruption events will continue and appear capable of growing the seed\nSMBH to larger sizes. The runaway slows (becomes sub-exponential) once the seed\nSMBH consumes the core of its host NSC. While the bulk of the cosmic mass\ndensity in SMBHs is ultimately produced (via the Soltan-Paczynski argument) by\nepisodic gaseous accretion in very massive galaxies, the smallest SMBHs have\nprobably grown from strong tidal encounters with NSC stars.

We computed dynamical masses within\nthe radius R$_{2.2}$ and found a median stellar-to-dynamical mass fraction\nequal to 0.2 (assuming Chabrier IMF), which implies a contribution of gas and\ndark matter masses of 80% of the total mass within R$_{2.2}$, in agreement with\nrecent integral field spectroscopy surveys. We find no dependence of the\nstellar-mass Tully-Fisher relation with environment probing up to group scale\nmasses. This study shows that multi-slit galaxy surveys remain a powerful tool\nto derive kinematics for large numbers of galaxies at both high and low\nredshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 20:38:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 21:03:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

Currently, the most used ones can be fitted into two\nclasses, namely vehicle flow formulations and set partitioning formulations.\nThese types of formulations differ from each other not only due to their\nvariables and constraints but also due to their main features. Vehicle flow\nformulations have the advantage of being compact models, so general-purpose\noptimization packages can be used to straightforwardly solve them. However,\nthey typically show weak linear relaxations and have a large number of\nconstraints. Branch-and-cut methods based on specialized valid inequalities can\nalso be devised to solve these formulations, but they have not shown to be\neffective for large-scale instances. On the other hand, set partitioning\nformulations have stronger linear relaxations, but requires the implementation\nof sophisticate techniques such as column generation and specialized\nbranch-and-price methods. Due to all these reasons, so far it is has been\nrecognized in the vehicle routing community that these two types of\nformulations are rather different.

However, such\ndistributed operation of the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer leads to\nsub-optimal utilization of the shared channel. One of the reasons is the\noccurrence of collisions when more than one packet is transmitted at the same\ntime. These packets cannot be decoded and retransmissions are necessary.\nHowever, it has been recently shown that it is possible to apply signal\nprocessing techniques with these collided packets so that useful information\ncan be decoded. This was recently proposed in the Irregular Repetition Slotted\nALOHA (IRSA), achieving a throughput $T \\simeq 0.97$ for very large MAC frame\nlengths as long as the number of active users is smaller than the number of\nslots per frame. In this paper, we extend the operation of IRSA with i) an\niterative physical layer decoding processing that exploits the capture effect\nand ii) a Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) processing at the\nslot-level, named intra-slot SIC, to decode more than one colliding packet per\nslot. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, referred to as\nExtended IRSA (E-IRSA), in terms of throughput and channel capacity.\nComputer-based simulation results show that E-IRSA protocol allows to reach the\nmaximum theoretical achievable throughput even in scenarios where the number of\nactive users is higher than the number of slots per frame. Results also show\nthat E-IRSA protocol significantly improves the performance even for small MAC\nframe lengths used in practical scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 21:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

Two electromagnon branches appear at lower energies of 0.07(1) meV and\n0.45(1) meV at the zone center. They reflect the dynamic magnetoelectric\ncoupling and persist in both, the collinear magnetic and paraelectric AF1\nphase, and the spin spiral ferroelectric AF2 phase.

In many cases,\nthese studies only concentrated on the central region or were not homogeneous.\nThis latter aspect, in particular, is crucial because very different ages and\ndistances for key clusters have been claimed in recent years. The aim of this\nwork is to study in detail an area of the Galactic plane in Carina. We analyze\nthe properties of different stellar populations and focus on a sample of open\nclusters and their population of YSOs and highly reddened early stars. We also\nstudied the stellar mass distribution in these clusters and the possible\nscenario of their formation. Finally, we outline the Galactic spiral structure\nin this direction. We obtained photometric data for six young open clusters\nlocated in Carina at l = 291, and their adjacent stellar fields, which we\ncomplemented with spectroscopic observations of a few selected targets. We also\nculled additional information from the literature. Our results provide more\nreliable estimates of distances, color excesses, masses, and ages of the\nstellar populations in this direction. We estimate the basic parameters of the\nstudied clusters and find that they identify two overdensities of young stellar\npopulations. We find evidence of PMS populations inside them, with an apparent\ncoeval stellar formation in the most conspicuous clusters. We also discuss\napparent age and distance gradients in the direction NW-SE. We study the mass\ndistributions of several clusters in the region. They consistently show a\ncanonical IMF slope. We discover and characterise an abnormally reddened\nmassive stellar population. Spectroscopic observations of ten stars of this\nlatter population show that all selected targets were massive OB stars. Their\nlocation is consistent with the position of the Car-Sag spiral arm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 22:06:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

However, in practice, the substrate's neutron-nucleai optical\npotential does not match perfectly that for spin-down neutrons in the SM. For a\npositive step in the optical potential (as in a Fe/SiN(x) SM on Si substrate),\nthis mismatch results in spin-independent total reflection for neutrons with\nsmall momentum transfer Q, limiting the useful neutron bandwidth in the low-Q\nregion. To overcome this limitation, we propose to replace Si single-crystal\nsubstrates by media with higher optical potential than that for spin-down\nneutrons in the SM ferromagnetic layers. We found single-crystal sapphire and\nsingle-crystal quartz as good candidates for solid-state Fe/SiN(x) SM\npolarizers. To verify this idea, we coated a thick plate of single-crystal\nsapphire with a m=2.4 Fe/SiN(x) SM. At the T3 instrument at the ILL, we\nmeasured the spin-up and spin-down reflectivity curves with 7.5 A neutrons\nincident from the substrate to the interface between the substrate and the SM\ncoating. The results of this experimental test were in excellent agreement with\nour expectations: the bandwidth of high polarizing power extended significantly\ninto the low-Q region. This finding, together with the possibility to apply a\nstrong magnetizing field, opens a new road to produce high-efficient\nsolid-state SM polarizers with an extended neutron wavelength bandwidth and\nnear-to-perfect polarizing power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 22:11:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 15:12:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

Here, we propose neural network models that are\nbased on feedforward and long-short term memory architecture without any\nsurface features. To our surprise, our best configured feedforward architecture\noutperforms LSTM-based model in most cases despite thorough tuning. Under\nvarious fine-grained label sets and a cross-linguistic setting, our feedforward\nmodels perform consistently better or at least just as well as systems that\nrequire hand-crafted surface features. Our models present the first neural\nChinese discourse parser in the style of Chinese Discourse Treebank, showing\nthat our results hold cross-linguistically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2016 01:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

However,\nin LSM-tree, random key-value queries can experience long latency and low\nthroughput due to the interference from the compaction, a basic operation in\nthe algorithm, to caching. LSM-tree relies on frequent compaction operations to\nmerge data into a sorted structure. After a compaction, the original data are\nreorganized and written to other locations on the disk. As a result, the cached\ndata are invalidated since their referencing addresses are changed, causing\nserious performance degradations.\n  We propose dLSM in order to re-enable high-speed caching during intensive\nwrites. dLSM is an LSM-tree with a compaction buffer on the disk, working as a\ncushion to minimize the cache invalidation caused by compactions. The\ncompaction buffer maintains a series of snapshots of the frequently compacted\ndata, which represent a consistent view of the corresponding data in the\nunderlying LSM-tree. Being updated in a much lower rate than that of\ncompactions, data in the compaction buffer are almost stationary. In dLSM, an\nobject is referenced by the disk address of the corresponding block either in\nthe compaction buffer for frequently compacted data, or in the underlying\nLSM-tree for infrequently compacted data. Thus, hot objects can be effectively\nkept in the cache without harmful invalidations. With the help of a small\non-disk compaction buffer, dLSM achieves a high query performance by enabling\neffective caching, while retaining all merits of LSM-tree for write-intensive\ndata processing. We have implemented dLSM based on LevelDB. Our evaluations\nshow that with a standard DRAM cache, dLSM can achieve 5--8x performance\nimprovement over LSM with the same cache on HDD storage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2016 03:53:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

Extinction\nproperties for MW, LMC, and SMC dust types are considered. It is illustrated\nthat the attenuation curves are primarily determined by the wavelength\ndependence of absorption rather than by the underlying extinction\n(absorption+scattering) curve. Attenuation curves consistent with the \"Calzetti\nattenuation curve\" are found by assuming the silicate-carbonaceous dust model\nfor the MW, but with the 2175A absorption bump suppressed or absent. The\ndiscrepancy between our results and previous work that claimed the SMC-type\ndust to be the most likely origin of the Calzetti curve is ascribed to the\ndifference in adopted albedos; this study uses the theoretically calculated\nalbedos whereas the previous ones adopted empirically derived albedos from\nobservations of reflection nebulae. It is also found that the model attenuation\ncurves calculated with the MW dust are well represented by a modified Calzetti\ncurve with a varying slope and UV bump strength. The strong correlation between\nthe slope and UV bump strength, with steeper curves having stronger bumps, as\nfound in star-forming galaxies at 0.5<z<2.0, is well reproduced by our models\nif the abundance of the UV bump carriers or PAHs is assumed to be 30% or 40% of\nthat of the MW-dust. The trend is explained by radiative transfer effects which\nlead to shallower attenuation curves with weaker UV bumps as the ISM is more\nclumpy and dustier. We also argue that at least some of the IUE local starburst\ngalaxies may have a UV bump feature in their attenuation curves, albeit much\nweaker than that of the MW extinction curve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2016 04:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

We demonstrate this using controlled N-body\nsimulations of plane-symmetric collapse and show that spurious haloes are\nseeded at shell crossing by localised velocity perturbations induced by the\ndiscrete nature of the density field, and that their characteristic separation\nshould be approximately the mean inter-particle separation of the N-body\nsimulation, which is fixed by the mass resolution within the volume. Using\ncosmological N-body simulations in which particles are split into two\ncollisionless components of fixed mass ratio, we find that the spatial\ndistribution of the two components show signatures of discreteness-driven\nrelaxation in their spatial distribution on both large and small scales.\nAdopting a spline kernel gravitational softening that is of order the comoving\nmean inter-particle separation helps to suppress the effect of\ndiscreteness-driven relaxation, but cannot eliminate it completely.

By a direct determination of the distance of the\nsplit-off band to the Fermi energy EF, we conclude that EF is located within\nthe heavy/light hole band. However, the bands are strongly perturbed by\ndisorder and disorder-induced carrier correlations that lead to the Coulomb gap\nat EF, which we resolve experimentally in a series of samples, and show that\nits depth and width enlarge when the Curie temperature decreases. Furthermore,\nwe have detected surprising linear magnetic dichroism in photoemission spectra\nof the split-off band.

Maximum likelihood estimation of the\nparameters is typically carried out via the Expectation-Maximization (EM)\nalgorithm. The complexity of the implementation of the algorithm depends on the\nparametric distribution that is adopted as the component densities of the\nmixture model. In the case of the skew normal and skew t-distributions, for\nexample, the E-step would involve complicated expressions that are\ncomputationally expensive to evaluate. This can become quite time-consuming for\nlarge and/or high-dimensional datasets. In this paper, we develop a\nmultithreaded version of the EM algorithm for the fitting of finite mixture\nmodels.

This MIC, which results in\nsuch phenomena as heat conductivity downturn, anomalous Lorentz ratio,\nnonlinear entropy, insulating ground state, nematicity- and stripe-phases and\nFermi pockets, reveals the nonconventional dielectric property of the\npseudogap-normal phase. Since conventional superconductivity appears from a\nconducting normal phase, the understanding of how superconductivity arises from\nan insulating state becomes a fundamental problem and thus the keystone for all\nof cuprate physics. Recently, in interpreting the physics of visualization in\nscanning tunneling microscopy (STM) real space nanoregions (NRs), which exhibit\nan energy gap, we have succeeded in understanding that the minimum size for\nthese NRs provides pseudogap and superconductivity pairs, which are single\nbosons. In this work, we discuss the intra-particle magnetic spin and charge\nfluctuations of these bosons, observed recently in hidden magnetic order and\nSTM experiments. We find that all the mentioned MIC phenomena can be obtained\nin the Coulomb single boson and single fermion two liquid model, which we\nrecently developed, and the MIC is a crossover of sample percolating NRs of\nsingle fermions into those of single bosons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2016 08:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

In this study, we developed a multistate\ndynamic site occupancy model to estimate transition probabilities that accounts\nfor resampling errors associated with local community structure.

While predicting human motion for tasks not known a priori is very\nchallenging, we argue that single-arm reaching motions for known tasks in\ncollaborative settings (which are especially relevant for manufacturing) are\nindeed predictable. Two hypotheses underlie our approach for predicting such\nmotions: First, that the trajectory the human performs is optimal with respect\nto an unknown cost function, and second, that human adaptation to their\npartner's motion can be captured well through iterative re-planning with the\nabove cost function. The key to our approach is thus to learn a cost function\nwhich \"explains\" the motion of the human.

Three\ninverted phase-shifted fringe patterns are used to complement three regular\nphase-shifted fringe patterns for phase retrieval when any of the regular\nfringe patterns are saturated.

(1) The DDAs can be classified\ninto two broad categories, i.e., unstructured and structured DDAs. The\nunstructured DDAs are mainly distributed in the morning and afternoon, but the\nstructured DDAs predominantly occurred around the magnetic local noon (MLN).\n(2) The unstructured DDAs observed in morning and afternoon present obviously\ndifferent properties.

Arbitrary spectral slopes are obtained by sliding\nthe array of zeros relative to the array of poles, where each array maintains\nperiodic spacing on a log scale. The nature of the slope approximation is close\nto Chebyshev optimal in the interior of the pole-zero array, approaching\nconjectured Chebyshev optimality over all frequencies in the limit as the order\napproaches infinity. Practical designs can arbitrarily approach the\nequal-ripple approximation by enlarging the pole-zero array band beyond the\ndesired frequency band. The spectral roll-off slope can be robustly modulated\nin real time by varying only the zeros controlled by one slope parameter.\nSoftware implementations are provided in matlab and Faust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2016 07:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-21"}
