These\ninputs are derived from regular inputs by minor yet carefully selected\nperturbations that deceive machine learning models into desired\nmisclassifications. Existing work in this emerging field was largely specific\nto the domain of image classification, since the high-entropy of images can be\nconveniently manipulated without changing the images' overall visual\nappearance. Yet, it remains unclear how such attacks translate to more\nsecurity-sensitive applications such as malware detection - which may pose\nsignificant challenges in sample generation and arguably grave consequences for\nfailure.\n  In this paper, we show how to construct highly-effective adversarial sample\ncrafting attacks for neural networks used as malware classifiers. The\napplication domain of malware classification introduces additional constraints\nin the adversarial sample crafting problem when compared to the computer vision\ndomain: (i) continuous, differentiable input domains are replaced by discrete,\noften binary inputs; and (ii) the loose condition of leaving visual appearance\nunchanged is replaced by requiring equivalent functional behavior. We\ndemonstrate the feasibility of these attacks on many different instances of\nmalware classifiers that we trained using the DREBIN Android malware data set.\nWe furthermore evaluate to which extent potential defensive mechanisms against\nadversarial crafting can be leveraged to the setting of malware classification.\nWhile feature reduction did not prove to have a positive impact, distillation\nand re-training on adversarially crafted samples show promising results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 16:01:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 08:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-17"}

Supernova remnants are known as sources of galactic cosmic rays for\ntheir non-thermal emission of radio waves, X-rays, and gamma-rays. However, the\nobserved soft broken power-law spectra are hard to reproduce within standard\nacceleration theory based on the assumption of Bohm diffusion and steady-state\ncalculations. Aims. We point out that a time-dependent treatment of the\nacceleration process together with a self-consistent treatment of the\nscattering turbulence amplification is necessary. Methods. We numerically solve\nthe coupled system of transport equations for cosmic rays and isotropic\nAlfvenic turbulence. The equations are coupled through the growth rate of\nturbulence determined by the cosmic-ray gradient and the spatial diffusion\ncoefficient of cosmic rays determined by the energy density of the turbulence.\nThe system is solved on a co-moving expanding grid extending upstream for\ndozens of shock radii, allowing for the self-consistent study of cosmic-ray\ndiffusion in the vicinity of their acceleration site. The transport equation\nfor cosmic rays is solved in a test-particle approach. Results. We demonstrate\nthat the system is typically not in a steady state. In fact, even after several\nthousand years of evolution, no equilibrium situation is reached. The resulting\ntime-dependent particle spectra strongly differ from those derived assuming a\nsteady state and Bohm diffusion. Our results indicate that proper accounting\nfor the evolution of the scattering turbulence and hence the particle diffusion\ncoefficient is crucial for the formation of the observed soft spectra. In any\ncase, the need to continuously develop magnetic turbulence upstream of the\nshock introduces non-linearity in addition to that imposed by cosmic-ray\nfeedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 17:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

We first focus on the single-node setting and show that by using standard\nbatching and data-parallel techniques, throughput can be improved by at least\n5.5x over state-of-the-art systems on CPUs. This ensures an end-to-end training\nspeed directly proportional to the throughput of a device regardless of its\nunderlying hardware, allowing each node in the cluster to be treated as a black\nbox.

Feature selection is typically\nemployed to select a subset of features which im- proves generalization\naccuracy as well as reduces the computational cost of learning the model. One\nof the criteria used for feature selection is to jointly minimize the\nredundancy and maximize the rele- vance of the selected features. In this\npaper, we formulate the task of feature selection as a one class SVM problem in\na space where features correspond to the data points and instances correspond\nto the dimensions. The goal is to look for a representative subset of the\nfeatures (support vectors) which describes the boundary for the region where\nthe set of the features (data points) exists. This leads to a joint\noptimization of relevance and redundancy in a principled max-margin framework.\nAdditionally, our formulation enables us to leverage existing techniques for\noptimizing the SVM objective resulting in highly computationally efficient\nsolutions for the task of feature selection. Specifically, we employ the dual\ncoordinate descent algorithm (Hsieh et al., 2008), originally proposed for\nSVMs, for our formulation. We use a sparse representation to deal with data in\nvery high dimensions. Experiments on seven publicly available benchmark\ndatasets from a variety of domains show that our approach results in orders of\nmagnitude faster solutions even while retaining the same level of accuracy\ncompared to the state of the art feature selection techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 19:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

The subgroups form a rich hierarchy and allow\nfor many different phases of matter with orientational order. Such spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking occurs in nematic liquid crystals and a highlight of such\nanisotropic liquids are the uniaxial and biaxial nematics. Generalizing the\nfamiliar uniaxial and biaxial nematics to phases characterized by an arbitrary\npoint group symmetry, referred to as \\emph{generalized nematics}, leads to a\nlarge hierarchy of phases and possible orientational phase transitions. We\ndiscuss how a particular class of nematic phase transitions related to axial\npoint groups can be efficiently captured within a recently proposed gauge\ntheoretical formulation of generalized nematics [K. Liu, J. Nissinen, R.-J.\nSlager, K. Wu, J. Zaanen, Phys. Rev. X {\\bf 6}, 041025 (2016)]. These\ntransitions can be introduced in the model by considering anisotropic couplings\nthat do not break any additional symmetries. By and large this generalizes the\nwell-known uniaxial-biaxial nematic phase transition to any arbitrary axial\npoint group in three dimensions. We find in particular that the generalized\naxial transitions are distinguished by two types of phase diagrams with\nintermediate vestigial orientational phases and that the window of the\nvestigial phase is intimately related to the amount of symmetry of the defining\npoint group due to inherently growing fluctuations of the order parameter.

In particular, the gas\nmay be subject to the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and indeed recent\nmodelling of $\\beta$ Pictoris requires an anomalous viscosity to explain the\ngas's observed radial structure. In this paper we explore the possibility that\nthe MRI is active in debris-disc gas and responsible for the observed mass\ntransport.

Even if the MRI is stabilised by too strong a field, a\nmagnetocentrifugal wind may be launched in its place and this could lead to\nequivalent (non-turbulent) transport.

At low but finite external magnetic fields, N\\'eel-type\nskyrmions are formed in this material. Skyrmions are whirl-like spin vortices\nthat have received great theoretical interest because of their non-trivial spin\ntopology and that are also considered as basic entities for new data-storage\ntechnologies. Interestingly, we found that the orbitally ordered phase shows\nsizable ferroelectric polarization and that excess spin-driven polarizations\nappear in all magnetic phases, including the skyrmion-lattice phase. Hence,\nGaV4S8 shows simultaneous magnetic and polar order and belongs to the class of\nmultiferroics, materials that attracted enormous attention in recent years.\nHere, we summarize the existing experimental information on the magnetic,\nelectronic, and dielectric properties of GaV4S8. By performing detailed\nmagnetic susceptibility, resistivity, specific heat, and dielectric\nexperiments, we complement the low-temperature phase diagram. Specifically, we\nshow that the low-temperature and low-field ground state of GaV4S8 seems to\nhave a more complex spin configuration than purely collinear ferromagnetic spin\norder. In addition, at the structural Jahn-Teller transition the magnetic\nexchange interaction changes from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic. We also\nprovide experimental evidence that the vanadium V4 clusters in GaV4S8 can be\nregarded as molecular units with spin 1/2. However, at high temperatures\ndeviations in the susceptibility show up, indicating that either the magnetic\nmoments of the vanadium atoms fluctuate independently or excited states of the\nV4 molecule become relevant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 19:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-14"}

Using certain idempotent subalgebras in the finite\nand affine algebras, we construct infinite `arc' towers of the diagram algebras\nand the corresponding direct system of representation categories, with terms\nlabeled by $N\\in\\mathbb{N}$. The corresponding direct-limit category is our\nmain object of studies.\n  For the case of the finite TL algebras, we prove that the direct-limit\ncategory is abelian and highest-weight at any $q$ and endowed with braided\nmonoidal structure. The most interesting result is when $q$ is a root of unity\nwhere the representation theory is non-semisimple. The resulting braided\nmonoidal categories we obtain at different roots of unity are new and\ninterestingly they are not rigid. We observe then a fundamental relation of\nthese categories to a certain representation category of the Virasoro algebra\nand give a conjecture on the existence of a braided monoidal equivalence\nbetween the categories. This should have powerful applications to the study of\nthe `continuum' limit of critical statistical mechanics systems based on the TL\nalgebra.\n  We also introduce a novel class of embeddings for the affine Temperley-Lieb\nalgebras and related new concept of fusion or bilinear $\\mathbb{N}$-graded\ntensor product of modules for these algebras.

The programme aims to\ncharacterize the energy balance in starburst galaxies and gas cooling in the\ndifficult-to-map coronal temperature regime of 2-5 x $10^5$K. We present the\nfirst resolved image of gas emission in the OVI line. Our target, SDSS\nJ1156+5008, is very compact in the continuum but displays OVI emission to radii\nof 23 kpc. The surface brightness profile is well fit by an exponential with a\nscale of 7.5kpc. This is ten times the size of the photoionized gas, and we\nestimate that 1/6 the total OVI luminosity comes from resonantly scattered\ncontinuum radiation. Spectroscopy - which closely resembles a stacked sample of\narchival spectra - confirms the OVI emission, and determines the column density\nand outflow velocity from blueshifted absorption. The combination of\nmeasurements enables several new calculations with few assumptions. The OVI\nregions fill only ~$10^{-3}$ of the volume. By comparing the cooling time with\nthe cloud sound-crossing time, the cooling distance with the size, and the\npressure in the OVI and nebular gas, we conclude that the OVI-bearing gas\ncannot have been lifted to the scale height at this temperature, and must be\ncooling in situ through this coronal temperature regime.

This variance-based subspace approach to\ndimensionality reduction forces a fixed choice of the number of dimensions, is\nnot responsive to real-time shifts in observed traffic patterns, and is\nvulnerable to normal traffic spoofing.

Numerical\nsimulations are performed based on Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) of model\ninputs drawn from uniform probability distributions. Key sensitive parameters\nare identified from these simulations, which are fracture zone permeability,\nwell/skin factor, bottom hole pressure, and injection flow rate. The inputs for\nROMs are based on these key sensitive parameters. The ROMs are then used to\nevaluate the influence of subsurface attributes on thermal power production\ncurves.

Secondly, professional societies like the AAS now have a great\nopportunity to support the education-outreach continuum at a national level, by\nfacilitating communication between institutions and clubs that are considering\na long-term partnership, by acting as a central resource for such partnerships,\nand possibly by convening or sponsoring events such as professional meetings\namong the metropolitan educational community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 21:42:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-16"}

That is, we specify not just a key\nexchange, but when and how to run these relative to transport-layer events; how\nto achieve liveness properties such as reliability and consistency, that are\ntime-sensitive and lie outside of the send-receive logic that cryptography-only\nprotocols often restrict themselves to; and offer suggestions for displaying\naccurate (i.e. secure) but not overwhelming information in user interfaces.\n  We aim towards a general-purpose unified protocol. In other words, we'd\nprefer to avoid creating a completely new protocol merely to support\nautomation, or asynchronity, or a different transport protocol. This would add\ncomplexity to the overall ecosystem of communications protocols. It is simply\nunnecessary if the original protocol is designed well, as we have tried to do.\n  That aim is not complete -- our full protocol system, as currently\nimplemented, is suitable only for use with certain instant messaging protocols.\nHowever, we have tried to separate out conceptually-independent concerns, and\nsolve these individually using minimal assumptions even if other components\nmake extra assumptions.

We present a two-pathogen model of\ntransmission which examines how immune boosting and cross-immunity can\ninfluence the timing and severity of epidemics. We use a combination of\nnumerical simulations and bifurcation techniques to study the dynamical\nproperties of the system, particularly the conditions under which stable\nperiodic solutions are present.

In doing so, we consider two masking methods that\npreserve the local and global geometric structure of the manifold,\nrespectively.

Hydrodynamic simulations of the common envelope\ninteraction between giant stars and their companions are restricted to the\ndynamical, fast, in-spiral phase. They find that the giant envelope is lifted\nduring this phase, but remains mostly bound to the system. At the same time,\nthe orbital separation is greatly reduced, but in most simulations it levels\noff? at values larger than measured from observations. We conjectured that\nduring the post-in-spiral phase the bound envelope gas will return to the\nsystem. Using hydrodynamic simulations, we generate initial conditions for our\nsimulation that result in a fall-back disk with total mass and angular momentum\nin line with quantities from the simulations of Passy et al. We find that the\nsimulated fall-back event reduces the orbital separation efficiently, but fails\nto unbind the gas before the separation levels off once again. We also find\nthat more massive fall-back disks reduce the orbital separation more\nefficiently, but the efficiency of unbinding remains invariably very low. From\nthese results we deduce that unless a further energy source contributes to\nunbinding the envelope (such as was recently tested by Nandez et al.), all\ncommon envelope interactions would result in mergers. On the other hand,\nadditional energy sources are unlikely to help, on their own, to reduce the\norbital separation. We conclude by discussing our dynamical fall-back event in\nthe context of a thermally-regulated post-common envelope phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 04:05:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 05:22:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

In this paper, we study simultaneous wireless information and\npower transfer (SWIPT) for a multiple-input single-output (MISO) DAS in the\ndownlink which consists of arbitrarily distributed remote antenna units (RAUs).\nIn order to save the energy cost, we adopt energy cooperation of energy\nharvesting (EH) and two-way energy flows to let the RAUs trade their harvested\nenergy through the smart grid network. Under individual EH constraints, per-RAU\npower constraints and various smart grid considerations, we investigate a power\nmanagement strategy that determines how to utilize the stochastically spatially\ndistributed harvested energy at the RAUs and how to trade the energy with the\nsmart grid simultaneously to supply maximum wireless information transfer (WIT)\nwith a minimum WET constraint for a receiver adopting power splitting (PS). Our\nanalysis shows that the optimal design can be achieved in two steps. The first\nstep is to maximize a new objective that can simultaneously maximize both WET\nand WIT, considering both the smart grid profitable and smart grid neutral\ncases. For the grid-profitable case, we derive the optimal full power strategy\nand provide a closed-form result to see under what condition this strategy is\nused. On the other hand, for the grid-neutral case, we illustrate that the\noptimal power policy has a double-threshold structure and present an optimal\nallocation strategy. The second step is then to solve the whole problem by\nobtaining the splitting power ratio based on the minimum WET constraint.\nSimulation results are provided to evaluate the performance under various\nsettings and characterize the double-threshold structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 04:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-16"}

Properties of elementary modes of excitation are strongly\ninfluenced by the symmetry breaking and can be studied with TDDFT. In\nparticular, a number of recent developments in the linear response calculation\nhave demonstrated their usefulness in description of collective modes of\nexcitation in nuclei.

One important\ncharacteristic of the functional brain networks is that they are modularly\nstructured, being this modular architecture regarded to account for a series of\nproperties and functional dynamics. In the neurobiological context, communities\nmay indicate brain regions that are involved in one same activity, representing\nneural segregated processes. Several studies have demonstrated the modular\ncharacter of organization of brain activities. However, empirical evidences\nregarding to its dynamics and relation to different levels of consciousness\nhave not been reported yet. Within this context, this research sought to\ncharacterize the community structure of functional brain networks during an\nanesthetic induction process. The experiment was based on intra-cranial\nrecordings of neural activities of an old world macaque of the species Macaca\nfuscata during a Ketamine-Medetomidine anesthetic induction process. Networks\nwere serially estimated in time intervals of five seconds. Changes were\nobserved within about one and a half minutes after the administration of the\nanesthetics, revealing the occurrence of a transition on the community\nstructure. The awake state was characterized by the presence of large clusters\ninvolving frontal and parietal regions, while the anesthetized state by the\npresence of communities in the primary visual and motor cortices, being the\nareas of the secondary associative cortex most affected. The results report the\ninfluence of general anesthesia on the structure of functional clusters,\ncontributing for understanding some new aspects of neural correlates of\nconsciousness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 10:56:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-16"}

The rise of Software Defined Networks has\nrenewed interest in the use of traffic engineering approaches leveraging\ncentralised network controllers for capacity optimisation. We argue that future\nnetworks can realise the network optimisation benefits of traffic engineering\nwithout incurring additional network complexity through closer coupling between\nthe network and the applications and services using the network.

The ground states were found by energy minimization over\nconfigurations and deformations. We find that the non-axiallity significantly\nchanges first and second fission barrier in many nuclei. The effect of the mass\n- asymmetry, known to lower the second, very deformed barriers in actinides, in\nthe heaviest nuclei appears at the less deformed saddles in more than 100\nnuclei. It happens for those saddles in which the triaxiallity does not play\nany role, what suggests a decoupling between effects of the mass-asymmetry and\ntriaxiality. We studied also the influence of the pairing interaction strength\non the staggering of $B_f$ for odd- and even-particle numbers. Finally, we\nprovide a comparison of our results with other theoretical fission barrier\nevaluations and with available experimental estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 11:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

This result is revealed by a decreased electron temperature at a\nresonator-coupled probe resistor, even when the electrons in the refrigerator\nitself are at an elevated temperature. Our conclusions are verified by control\nexperiments and by a good quantitative agreement between a detailed theoretical\nmodel and the direct experimental observations in a broad range of operation\nvoltages and phonon bath temperatures. In the future, the introduced\nrefrigerator can be integrated with different quantum electric devices,\npotentially enhancing their performance.

A prerequisite for these applications is a\nstrong qubit-resonator coupling. Strong coupling between an electron-spin qubit\nand a microwave resonator can be achieved by correlating spin- and orbital\ndegrees of freedom. This correlation can be achieved through the Zeeman\ncoupling of a single electron in a double quantum dot to a spatially\ninhomogeneous magnetic field generated by a nearby nanomagnet. In this paper,\nwe consider such a device and estimate spin-resonator couplings of order ~ 1\nMHz with realistic parameters. Further, through realistic simulations, we show\nthat precise placement of the double dot relative to the nanomagnet allows to\nselect between a purely longitudinal coupling (commuting with the bare spin\nHamiltonian) and a purely transverse (spin non-conserving) coupling.\nAdditionally, we suggest methods to mitigate dephasing and relaxation channels\nthat are introduced in this coupling scheme.

This integral\nequation can be used in two ways: as a forward solver to predict optoacoustic\nsignals in terms of the direct problem, and as an inverse solver for which we\nhere devise highly efficient numerical schemes used for the reconstruction of\ninitial pressure profiles from observed signals, constituting a methodical\nprogress of computational aspects of optoacoustics. In this regard, we explore\nthe validity as well as the limits of the inversion scheme via numerical\nexperiments, with parameters geared towards actual optoacoustic problem\ninstances. The considered inversion input consists of synthetic data, obtained\nby means of forward solvers based on the Volterra integral, and, more\ngenerally, the optoacoustic Poisson integral. Regarding the latter, we\nnumerically invert signals that correspond to different detector-to-sample\ndistances and assess the convergence to the true initial stress profiles upon\napproaching the far-field.

It is commonly demanding in computation capacity,\ngiven that the relevant applications involve very large volumes of data. Data\nstructures act as articulation points and maintain the state of data streaming\noperators, potentially supporting high parallelism and balancing the work\nbetween them. Prompted by this fact, in this work we study and analyze\nparallelization needs of these articulation points, focusing on the problem of\nstreaming multiway aggregation, where large data volumes are received from\nmultiple input streams. The analysis of the parallelization needs, as well as\nof the use and limitations of existing aggregate designs and their data\nstructures, leads us to identify needs for proper shared objects that can\nachieve low-latency and high throughput multiway aggregation.

This is infeasible for\nsafety critical applications, such as robotics, where even a single unsafe\naction may cause system failure. In this paper, we address the problem of\nsafely exploring finite Markov decision processes (MDP). We define safety in\nterms of an, a priori unknown, safety constraint that depends on states and\nactions. We aim to explore the MDP under this constraint, assuming that the\nunknown function satisfies regularity conditions expressed via a Gaussian\nprocess prior. We develop a novel algorithm for this task and prove that it is\nable to completely explore the safely reachable part of the MDP without\nviolating the safety constraint. To achieve this, it cautiously explores safe\nstates and actions in order to gain statistical confidence about the safety of\nunvisited state-action pairs from noisy observations collected while navigating\nthe environment. Moreover, the algorithm explicitly considers reachability when\nexploring the MDP, ensuring that it does not get stuck in any state with no\nsafe way out. We demonstrate our method on digital terrain models for the task\nof exploring an unknown map with a rover.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 13:18:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 14:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-30"}

In this work we explore this idea in\nthe context of neural encoder decoder architectures, albeit on a smaller scale\nand without MT as the end goal. Specifically, we consider the case of three\nlanguages or modalities X, Z and Y wherein we are interested in generating\nsequences in Y starting from information available in X. However, there is no\nparallel training data available between X and Y but, training data is\navailable between X & Z and Z & Y (as is often the case in many real world\napplications). Z thus acts as a pivot/bridge. An obvious solution, which is\nperhaps less elegant but works very well in practice is to train a two stage\nmodel which first converts from X to Z and then from Z to Y. Instead we explore\nan interlingua inspired solution which jointly learns to do the following (i)\nencode X and Z to a common representation and (ii) decode Y from this common\nrepresentation. We evaluate our model on two tasks: (i) bridge transliteration\nand (ii) bridge captioning. We report promising results in both these\napplications and believe that this is a right step towards truly interlingua\ninspired encoder decoder architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 13:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-16"}

Using the Pan-STARRS1 telescope we mapped out 290 square\ndegrees in the optical i_ps filter starting 11.5hr after the LIGO information\nrelease and lasting for a further 28 days. The first observations started\n49.5hr after the time of the GW151226 detection. We typically reached\nsensitivity limits of i_ps = 20.3-20.8 and covered 26.5% of the LIGO\nprobability skymap. We supplemented this with ATLAS survey data, reaching 31%\nof the probability region to shallower depths of m~19. We found 49\nextragalactic transients (that are not obviously AGN), including a faint\ntransient in a galaxy at 7Mpc (a luminous blue variable outburst) plus a\nrapidly decaying M-dwarf flare. Spectral classification of 20 other transient\nevents showed them all to be supernovae. We found an unusual transient,\nPS15dpn, with an explosion date temporally coincident with GW151226 which\nevolved into a type Ibn supernova. The redshift of the transient is secure at\nz=0.1747 +/- 0.0001 and we find it unlikely to be linked, since the luminosity\ndistance has a negligible probability of being consistent with that of\nGW151226. In the 290 square degrees surveyed we therefore do not find a likely\ncounterpart. However we show that our survey strategy would be sensitive to\nNS-NS mergers producing kilonovae at D < 100 Mpc which is promising for future\nLIGO/Virgo searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 14:54:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 09:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

In order to improve the optical detection efficiency, both the\ntransmission spectrum and the reflection spectrum of the FFP-SI are used for\nspectral analyses of the aerosol backscatter and the reference laser pulse. The\nreference signal is tapped from the outgoing laser and served as a zero\nvelocity indicator. The Doppler shift is retrieved from a frequency response\nfunction Q, which is defined as the ratio of difference of the transmitted\nsignal and the reflected signal to their sum. Taking advantages of high\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the detectors and high spectral resolution of the\nFFP-SI, the Q spectra of the aerosol backscatter are reconstructed along the\nline-of-sight (LOS) of the telescope. By applying a least squares fit procedure\nto the measured Q spectra, the center frequencies and the bandwidths are\nobtained simultaneously. And then the Doppler shifts are determined relative to\nthe center frequency of the reference signal. To eliminate the influence of\ntemperature fluctuations on the FFP-SI, the FFP-SI is cased in a chamber with\ntemperature stability of 0.001 during the measurement. Continuous LOS wind\nobservations are carried out on two days at Hefei (31.843 N, 117.265 E), China.\nIn the meantime, LOS wind measurements from the HSRWL show good agreement with\nthe results from an ultrasonic wind sensor (Vaisala windcap WMT52). Due to the\ncomputational expensive of the convolution operation of the Q function, an\nempirical method is adopted to evaluate the quality of the measurements. The\nstandard deviation of the wind speed is 0.76 m/s at the 1.8 km. The standard\ndeviation of the retrieved bandwidth variation is 2.07 MHz at the 1.8 km.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 14:55:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-13"}

The statistics of the corresponding strains are near-Poissonian. The\nmean characteristic strains exhibit scaling with the number of particles N and\npressure P, and reveal the existence of finite size effects akin to those seen\nfor linear response quantities. Second, we show that linear response accurately\npredicts the strains of the first contact changes, which allows us to study the\nscaling of the characteristic strains of making and breaking contacts\nseparately. Both of these show finite size scaling, and we formulate scaling\narguments that are consistent with the observed behavior. Third, we probe the\neffect of the first contact change on the shear modulus G, and show in detail\nhow the variation of G remains smooth and bounded in the large system size\nlimit: even though contact changes occur then at vanishingly small strains,\ntheir cumulative effect, even at a fixed value of the strain, are limited, so\nthat effectively, linear response remains well-defined. Fourth, we explore\nmultiple contact changes under shear, and find strong and surprising\ncorrelations between alternating making and breaking events. Fifth, we show\nthat by making a link with extremal statistics, our data is consistent with a\nvery slow crossover to self averaging with system size, so that the\nthermodynamic limit is reached much more slowly than expected based on finite\nsize scaling of elastic quantities or contact breaking strains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 14:56:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2016 21:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

EM~Cep switches between B and Be star states, as revealed by\nthe level of H$\\alpha$ emission, but spends most of its time in the B~star\nstate. EM~Cep has been considered to be an eclipsing, near contact binary of\nnearly equal-massed B stars in order to reproduce regular photometric\nvariations; however, this model is problematic due to the lack of any observed\nDoppler shift in the spectrum. Our observations confirm that there are no\napparent Doppler shifts in the wide spectral lines H$\\alpha$ and HeI~6678 in\neither the B or Be star states.The profiles of HeI~6678 typically exhibited a\nfilled-in absorption core, but we detected weak emission in this line during\nthe highest Be state. Given the lack of observed Doppler shifts, we model\nEM~Cep as an isolated Be star with a variable circumstellar disk. We can\nreproduce the observed H$\\alpha$ emission profiles over the eleven year period\nreasonably well with disk masses on the order of $3$ to\n$10\\times\\,10^{-11}\\;M_*$ in the Be state with the circumstellar disk seen at\nan inclination of $78^{\\circ}$ to the line of sight.

The derived disk density parameters are typical of those\nfound for the classical Be stars.

The basic physics of thermal conduction in\nplasmas with ICM-like conditions has yet to be elucidated, however. We use\nparticle-in-cell simulations and analytic models to explore the dynamics of an\nICM-like plasma (with small gyroradius, large mean-free-path, and strongly\nsub-dominant magnetic pressure) driven by the diffusive heat flux associated\nwith thermal conduction. Lin- ear theory reveals that whistler waves are driven\nunstable electron heat flux, even when the heat flux is weak. The resonant\ninteraction of electrons with these waves then plays a critical role in\nscattering electrons and suppressing the heat flux. In a 1D model where only\nwhistler modes that are parallel to the magnetic field are captured, the only\nresonant electrons are moving in the opposite direction to the heat flux and\nthe electron heat flux suppression is small. In 2D or more, oblique whistler\nmodes also resonate with electrons moving in the direction of the heat flux.\nThe overlap of resonances leads to effective symmetrization of the electron\ndistribution function and a strong suppression of heat flux. The results\nsuggest that thermal conduction in the ICM might be strongly suppressed,\npossibly to negligible levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 21:41:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 20:51:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 20:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}
