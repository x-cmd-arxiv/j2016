Thus natural selection serves as a counter example to a\nwidely-held interpretation that restricts Bayesian Inference to human mental\nprocesses (including the endeavors of statisticians). As Bayesian inference can\nalways be cast in terms of (variational) free energy minimization, natural\nselection can be viewed as comprising two components: a generative model of an\n\"experiment\" in the external world environment, and the results of that\n\"experiment\" or the \"surprise\" entailed by predicted and actual outcomes of the\n\"experiment\".

Choosing an appropriate cut along the filament\nmajor axis, we minimize the impact of the filament emission on the modeling.\nFor the bulk of the core (5000-20000 au) an isothermal sphere model with a\ntemperature of around 10 K provides the best fits. We show that the power law\nindex of the density profile, as well as the constant temperature can be\nderived directly from the radial surface brightness profiles.

Based on our core models, we find that pixel-by-pixel single\ntemperature spectral energy distribution fits are incapable of determining\ndense core properties. We conclude that, to derive physical core properties, it\nis important to avoid an azimuthal average of core and filament.\nCorrespondingly, derived core masses are too high since they include some mass\nof the filament, and might introduce errors when determining core mass\nfunctions. The forward radiative transfer methods also avoids the loss of\ninformation owing to smearing of all maps to the coarsest spatial resolution.\nWe find the central core region to be colder and denser than estimated in\nrecent inverse radiative transfer modeling, possibly indicating the start of\nstar formation in L1689B.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2016 17:57:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

Despite the\nincreasingly number of studies carried out with such models, most of them use\nnetworks just to represent the data, while the pattern recognition performed on\nthe attribute space is performed using traditional learning techniques. In\nother words, the structural relationship between words have not been explicitly\nused in the pattern recognition process. In addition, only a few investigations\nhave probed the suitability of representations based on bipartite networks and\ngraphs (bigraphs) for the problem, as many approaches consider all possible\nlinks between words. In this context, we assess the relevance of a bipartite\nnetwork model representing both feature words (i.e. the words characterizing\nthe context) and target (ambiguous) words to solve ambiguities in written\ntexts. Here, we focus on the semantical relationships between these two type of\nwords, disregarding the relationships between feature words. In special, the\nproposed method not only serves to represent texts as graphs, but also\nconstructs a structure on which the discrimination of senses is accomplished.\nOur results revealed that the proposed learning algorithm in such bipartite\nnetworks provides excellent results mostly when topical features are employed\nto characterize the context.

Considering specific forms of $f(R,T)$ function, we seek for the\nexistence of solutions representing ES state. Using dynamical system techniques\nalong with numerical analysis, we find two classes of solutions: the first one\nis always unstable of the saddle type while the second is always stable so that\nits dynamical behavior corresponds to a center equilibrium point. The\nimportance of the second class of solutions is due to the significant duty they\nhave in constructing non-singular emergent models in which the universe could\nhave experienced past-eternally, a series of infinite oscillations about such\nan initial static state after which, it enters through a suitable physical\nmechanism, to an inflationary era.

The magnetosphere with twisted closed lines leads\nto enhanced spin-down rates. The enhancement in spin-down rate depends on the\nsize of region with twisted closed lines.

We present a coreset\nconstruction by projecting the rows of matrix $A$ on some orthonormal vectors\nthat closely approximate the right singular vectors of $A$.

We use an effective gauge-fixed description where the\nnonperturbative infrared dynamics of the theory is parametrized by a gluon mass\nwhich, as argued elsewhere, may originate from the Gribov ambiguity. In this\nscheme, one can perform consistent perturbative calculations down to infrared\nmomenta, which have been shown to correctly describe the phase diagram of\nYang-Mills theories in four dimensions as well as the zero-temperature\ncorrelators computed in lattice simulations. In this article, we provide the\none-loop expressions of the finite temperature Landau-DeWitt ghost and gluon\npropagators for a large class of gauge groups and present explicit results for\nthe SU(2) case. These are substantially different from those previously\nobtained in the Landau gauge, which corresponds to a vanishing background\nfield. The nonanalyticity of the order parameter across the transition is\ndirectly imprinted onto the propagators in the various color modes.

Fast rotating red giants in the upper part of the red giant branch\nhave surface velocities that cannot be explained by single star evolution.\n  Aims. We check whether tides between a star and a planet followed by planet\nengulfment can indeed accelerate the surface rotation of red giants for a\nsufficient long time in order to produce these fast rotating red giants.\n  Methods. Using rotating stellar models, accounting for the redistribution of\nthe angular momentum inside the star by different transport mechanisms, for the\nexchanges of angular momentum between the planet orbit and the star before the\nengulfment and for the deposition of angular momentum inside the star at the\nengulfment, we study how the surface rotation velocity at the stellar surface\nevolves.\n  Results. We show that the surface velocities reached at the end of the\norbital decay due to tidal forces and planet engulfment can be similar to\nvalues observed for fast rotating red giants. This surface velocity then\ndecreases when the star evolves along the red giant branch but at a\nsufficiently slow pace for allowing stars to be detected with such a high\nvelocity. More quantitatively, star-planet interaction can produce a rapid\nacceleration of the surface of the star, above values equal to 8 km s$^{-1}$,\nfor periods lasting up to more than 30% the red giant branch phase. The changes\nof the surface carbon isotopic ratios produced by the dilution of the planetary\nmaterial into the convective envelope is quite modest. Much more important\nmight be the increase of the lithium abundance due to this effect. However\nlithium may be affected by many different, still uncertain, processes.\n  Conclusions. The acceleration of the stellar surface to rotation velocities\nabove limits that depend on the surface gravity does appear at the moment as\nthe clearest signature of a star-planet interaction.[abridged]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2016 12:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

In practice data are often multi-way, or measured\nover multiple dimensions. For example, metabolite abundance may be measured\nover multiple regions or tissues, or gene expression may be measured over\nmultiple time points, for the same subjects. We propose a framework for linear\nclassification of high-dimensional multi-way data, in which coefficients can be\nfactorized into weights that are specific to each dimension. More generally,\nthe coefficients for each measurement in a multi-way dataset are assumed to\nhave low-rank structure.

Nanophysics aims to connect scientists\nwith disparate interests to begin interdisciplinary projects and incorporate\nthe theory and methodology of other fields into their work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jun 2016 18:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

The\ncommon remarkable feature of the selected nodeless solutions co-existent with\nthe discrete energy spectrum is that they can be used as seed functions for\nmulti-step 'canonical Liouville-Darboux transformations' (CLDTs) to convert the\nGauss-Reference (GRef) potential (appearing in the resultant Schrodinger\nequation) into its isospectral rational SUSY partners conditionally exactly\nquantized by the so-called 'Jacobi-Seed' Heine polynomials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2016 13:26:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Oct 2016 03:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-01"}

Heat flux and constant temperature\nboundary conditions were applied for evaporator and condenser sections,\nrespectively. Water and ethanol were used as working fluids. Volume of Fluid\n(VOF) method has been employed for two-phase flow simulation. Spectral analysis\nof temperature time series was carried out using Power Spectrum Density (PSD)\nmethod. Existence of dominant peak in PSD diagram indicated periodic or\nquasi-periodic behavior in temperature oscillations at particular frequencies.\nCorrelation dimension values for ethanol as working fluid was found to be\nhigher than that for water under the same operating conditions. Similar range\nof Lyapunov exponent values for the PHP with water and ethanol as working\nfluids indicated strong dependency of Lyapunov exponent to the structure and\ndimensions of the PHP. An O-ring structure pattern was obtained for\nreconstructed 3D attractor at periodic or quasi-periodic behavior of\ntemperature oscillations. Minimum thermal resistance of 0.85 degree/W and 0.88\ndegree/W were obtained for PHP with water and ethanol, respectively.
