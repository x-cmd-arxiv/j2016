Here, we\nprovide very general conditions guaranteeing when dictionaries yielding the\nsparsest encodings are unique and stable with respect to measurement or\nmodeling error. We demonstrate that some or all original dictionary elements\nare recoverable from noisy data even if the dictionary fails to satisfy the\nspark condition, its size is overestimated, or only a polynomial number of\ndistinct sparse supports appear in the data.

This last mode has often been overlooked\nin the literature, due to the assumption that the application of the Lorenz\ngauge implies transverse-traceless wave solutions.

This\napproach provides a transparent description of the interband, intersubband, and\nintraband excitations, fully includes all resonant as well as off-resonant\nexcitations, and treats the light-matter interaction non-perturbatively. For\nlinearly polarized excitations the photocurrents contain contributions from\nshift and rectification currents. We numerically compute and analyze these\ncurrents generated by the excitation with femtosecond laser pulses for [110]-\nand [111]-oriented GaAs quantum wells. It is shown that the often employed\nperturbative $\\chi^{(2)}$-approach breaks down for peak fields larger than\nabout 10~kV/cm and that non-perturbative effects lead to a reduction of the\npeak values of the shift and rectification currents and to temporal\noscillations which originate from Rabi flopping. In particular, we find a\ncomplex oscillatory photon energy dependence of the magnitudes of the shift and\nrectification currents. Our simulations demonstrate that this dependence is the\nresult of mixing between the heavy- and light-hole valence bands. This is a\nsurprising finding since the bandmixing has an even larger influence on the\nstrength of the photocurrents than the absorption coefficient. For\n[110]-oriented GaAs quantum wells the calculated photon energy dependence is\ncompared to experimental results and a good agreement is obtained which\nvalidates our theoretical approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2016 16:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

Recently, it was\nshown that this problem can be solved to a global optimum, for many practically\ninteresting diversity measures. It was noted that the labelings are, so-called,\nnested. This nestedness property also holds for labelings of a class of\nparametric submodular minimization problems, where different values of the\nglobal parameter $\\gamma$ give rise to different solutions. The popular example\nof the parametric submodular minimization is the monotonic parametric max-flow\nproblem, which is also widely used for computing multiple labelings. As the\nmain contribution of this work we establish a close relationship between\ndiversity with submodular energies and the parametric submodular minimization.\nIn particular, the joint M-best diverse labelings can be obtained by running a\nnon-parametric submodular minimization (in the special case - max-flow) solver\nfor M different values of $\\gamma$ in parallel, for certain diversity measures.\nImportantly, the values for $\\gamma$ can be computed in a closed form in\nadvance, prior to any optimization. These theoretical results suggest two\nsimple yet efficient algorithms for the joint M-best diverse problem, which\noutperform competitors in terms of runtime and quality of results.

The inflow asymmetry in HCN spectra seems\nto be prevalent throughout all the three evolutionary phases, with IRDCs\nshowing the largest excess in blue profile. In the case of HNC spectra, the\nprevalence of blue sources does not appear, excepting for IRDCs.

In this work we analyse the origin of chaos in Halley's orbit and the\ngrowth of perturbations, in order to get a better understanding of this\nunusually short time scale. We perform N-body simulations to model Halley's\norbit in the Solar System and measure the separation between neighbouring\ntrajectories.

We show that this problem is unavoidable whenever agents\nare able to coordinate using low-cost signals about the items being evaluated\n(e.g., text labels or pictures). We then consider ways of circumventing this\nproblem by comparing agents' reports to ground truth, which is available in\npractice when there exist trusted evaluators---such as teaching assistants in\nthe peer grading scenario---who can perform a limited number of unbiased (but\nnoisy) evaluations. Of course, when such ground truth is available, a simpler\napproach is also possible: rewarding each agent based on agreement with ground\ntruth with some probability, and unconditionally rewarding the agent otherwise.\nSurprisingly, we show that the simpler mechanism achieves stronger incentive\nguarantees given less access to ground truth than a large set of\npeer-prediction mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2016 18:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-23"}

The 60pc resolution line width and molecular gas surface\ndensity correlate well, which is a fundamental behavior expected for virialized\nor free-falling gas. Varying the measurement scale for the LMC and M31, we show\nthat the molecular ISM has higher surface densities, lower line widths, and\nmore self-gravity at smaller scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2016 20:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

To account for\nerrors and variation in judgments, we consider the noisy situation in which the\ngiven constraints are independently corrupted by reversing the correct\nconstraint with some probability. This paper makes several new contributions to\nthis problem. First, we derive prediction error bounds for ordinal embedding\nwith noise by exploiting the fact that the rank of a distance matrix of points\nin $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is at most $d+2$. These bounds characterize how well a\nlearned embedding predicts new comparative judgments. Second, we investigate\nthe special case of a known noise model and study the Maximum Likelihood\nestimator. Third, knowledge of the noise model enables us to relate prediction\nerrors to embedding accuracy. This relationship is highly non-trivial since we\nshow that the linear map corresponding to distance comparisons is\nnon-invertible, but there exists a nonlinear map that is invertible. Fourth,\ntwo new algorithms for ordinal embedding are proposed and evaluated in\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2016 20:06:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-24"}

Here, we present results from a direct integration of the\npost-Newtonian $N$-body equations of motion describing stellar clusters\ncontaining an IMBH and a population of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) and solar\nmass stars.

We show how can we interpret the agent's policy\nand give evidence for the hierarchical state aggregation that DQNs are learning\nautomatically. Our algorithm is fully automatic, does not require any domain\nspecific knowledge and is evaluated by a novel likelihood based evaluation\ncriteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2016 21:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-24"}

In the present work, we\nexplore a center vortex model which does not rely on such a scaffolding.\nVortices are represented by closed random lines in continuous 2+1-dimensional\nspace-time.

To this end, we simulate the\ndistribution of dissolved Mn using a global-scale circulation model. This first\nmodel includes simple parameterisations to account, realistically, for the\nsources, processes and sinks of Mn in the ocean. Whereas oxidation and\n(photo)reduction, as well as aggregation and settling are parameterised in the\nmodel, biological uptake is not yet taken into account by the model. Our model\nreproduces observations accurately and provides the following insights:\n  - The high surface concentrations of manganese are caused by the combination\nof photoreduction and sources to the upper ocean. The most important sources\nare dust, then sediments, and, more locally, rivers.\n  - Results show that surface Mn in the Atlantic Ocean moves downwards into the\nNorth Atlantic Deep Water, but because of strong removal rates the Mn does not\npropagate southwards.\n  - There is a mostly homogeneous background concentration of dissolved Mn of\nabout 0.10 to 0.15 nM throughout most of the deep ocean. The model reproduces\nthis by means of a threshold on manganese oxides of 25 pM, suggesting that a\nminimal concentration of Mn is needed before aggregation and removal become\nefficient.\n  - The observed sharp hydrothermal signals are produced by assuming both a\nhigh source and a strong removal of Mn near hydrothermal vents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2016 22:14:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2017 13:49:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-10"}

Hence we address the\nproblem of secure transmission in a relay-assisted network, where a pair of\nlegitimate user equipments (UEs) communicate with the aid of a multiple-input\nmultiple output (MIMO) relay in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers (eves).\nAssuming imperfect knowledge of the eves' channels, we jointly optimize the\npower of the source UE, the amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying matrix and the\ncovariance of the artificial noise (AN) transmitted by the relay, in order to\nmaximize the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the\ndestination, while imposing a set of robust secrecy constraints.

Optimality ensures that\nthe algorithm always returns a proper coloring with the minimum number of\nrequired colors, and rearrangeability allows partially re-coloring the existing\nconnection patterns if the underlying graph only changes slightly. The running\ntime of the proposed scheduling algorithm is on the order of $O(\\log^2 N)$ per\nframe, and the amortized time complexity, the time to compute a matching per\ntimeslot, is only $O(\\log N)$. The scheduling algorithm is highly robust in the\nface of traffic fluctuations.

A\nprominent approach for exploiting joint sparsity considers mixed-norm\nminimization in which, however, the problem size grows with the number of\nmeasurements and the desired resolution, respectively. In this work we derive\nan equivalent, compact reformulation of the $\\ell_{2,1}$ mixed-norm\nminimization problem which provides new insights on the relation between\ndifferent existing approaches for jointly sparse signal reconstruction.

A detailed model\nfitting of all the molecular line data, including previous maps and single-dish\nspectra, was performed using a sophisticated code. These observations and the\ncorresponding modeling allowed us to deepen the analysis of the nebular\nproperties. We also stress the uncertainties in the model fitting.\n  We confirm the presence of a rotating equatorial disk and an outflow, which\nis mainly formed of gas leaving the disk. The mass of the disk is ~ 0.01 Mo,\nand that of the CO-rich outflow is ~ 10 times smaller. High temperatures of ~\n100 K are derived for most components. From comparison of the mass values, we\nroughly estimate the lifetime of the rotating disk, which is found to be of\nabout 10000 yr. Taking data of a few other post-AGB composite nebulae into\naccount, we find that the lifetimes of disks around post-AGB stars typically\nrange between 5000 and more than 20000 yr. The angular momentum of the disk is\nfound to be high, ~ 9 Mo AU km/s, which is comparable to that of the stellar\nsystem at present. Our observations of H13CN show a particularly wide velocity\ndispersion and indicate that this molecule is only abundant in the inner\nKeplerian disk, at ~ 60 AU from the stellar system. We suggest that HCN is\nformed in a dense photodissociation region (PDR) due to the UV excess known to\nbe produced by the stellar system, following chemical mechanisms that are well\nestablished for interstellar medium PDRs and disks orbiting young stars. We\nfurther suggest that this UV excess could lead to the efficient formation and\nexcitation of PAHs and other C-bearing macromolecules, whose emission is very\nintense in the optical counterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2016 09:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

Acquiring data at high b-values contains\nrelevant information and is now of great interest for microstructural and\nconnectomics studies. High noise levels bias the measurements due to the\nnon-Gaussian nature of the noise, which in turn can lead to a false and biased\nestimation of the diffusion parameters. Additionally, the usage of in-plane\nacceleration techniques during the acquisition leads to a spatially varying\nnoise distribution, which depends on the parallel acceleration method\nimplemented on the scanner. This paper proposes a novel diffusion MRI denoising\ntechnique that can be used on all existing data, without adding to the scanning\ntime. We first apply a statistical framework to convert the noise to Gaussian\ndistributed noise, effectively removing the bias. We then introduce a spatially\nand angular adaptive denoising technique, the Non Local Spatial and Angular\nMatching (NLSAM) algorithm. Each volume is first decomposed in small 4D\noverlapping patches to capture the structure of the diffusion data and a\ndictionary of atoms is learned on those patches. A local sparse decomposition\nis then found by bounding the reconstruction error with the local noise\nvariance. We compare against three other state-of-the-art denoising methods and\nshow quantitative local and connectivity results on a synthetic phantom and on\nan in-vivo high resolution dataset. Overall, our method restores perceptual\ninformation, removes the noise bias in common diffusion metrics, restores the\nextracted peaks coherence and improves reproducibility of tractography. Our\nwork paves the way for higher spatial resolution acquisition of diffusion MRI\ndatasets, which could in turn reveal new anatomical details that are not\ndiscernible at the spatial resolution currently used by the diffusion MRI\ncommunity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2016 09:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-27"}

By enhancing the solid surface density and\nincreasing the sticking efficiency, ice catalyzes the rapid formation of\nplanetesimals and decreases the time scale for giant planet core accretion.\nAims: In this paper we analyse the composition of the outer disk around the\nHerbig star HD~142527. We focus on the composition of the water ice, but also\nanalyse the abundances of previously proposed minerals. Methods: We present new\nHerschel far infrared spectra and a re-reduction of archival data from the\nInfrared Space Observatory (ISO). We model the disk using full 3D radiative\ntransfer to obtain the disk structure. Also, we use an optically thin analysis\nof the outer disk spectrum to obtain firm constraints on the composition of the\ndust component. Results: The water ice in the disk around HD~142527 contains a\nlarge reservoir of crystalline water ice. We determine the local abundance of\nwater ice in the outer disk (i.e. beyond 130\\,AU). The re-reduced ISO spectrum\ndiffers significantly from that previously published, but matches the new\nHerschel spectrum at their common wavelength range. In particular, we do not\ndetect any significant contribution from carbonates or hydrous silicates, in\ncontrast to earlier claims. Conclusions: The amount of water ice detected in\nthe outer disk requires $\\sim80\\,$\\% of the oxygen atoms. This is comparable to\nthe water ice abundance in the outer solar system, in comets and in dense\ninterstellar clouds. The water ice is highly crystalline while the temperatures\nwhere we detect it are too low to crystallize the water on relevant time\nscales.

VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 bind vascular\nendothelial growth factors (VEGFs), inducing receptor dimerisation and\nactivation, characterised by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in their\ncytoplasmic domain. Although experimental evidence suggests that RTK signalling\noccurs both on the plasma membrane and intra-cellularly, and reveals the role\nof endocytosis in RTK signal transduction, we still lack knowledge of VEGFR\nphosphorylation-site use and of the spatiotemporal regulation of VEGFR\nsignalling. In this paper, we introduce four stochastic mathematical models to\nstudy the binding kinetics of vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF-A to\nVEGFR1 and VEGFR2, and phosphorylation. The formation of phosphorylated dimers\non the cell surface is a two-step process: diffusive transport and binding. The\nfirst two of our models only consider VEGFR2, which allows us to introduce new\nstochastic descriptors making use of a matrix-analytic approach. The two\nremaining models describe the competition of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 for ligand\navailability, and are analysed making use of Gillespie simulations and the van\nKampen approximation. Under the hypothesis that bound phosphorylated receptor\ndimers are the signalling units, we study the time to reach a threshold number\nof such complexes. Our results indicate that the presence of VEGFR1 does not\nonly affect the timescale to reach a given signalling threshold, but it also\naffects the maximum attainable threshold. This result is consistent with the\nconjectured role of VEGFR1 as a decoy receptor, that prevents VEGF-A binding to\nVEGFR2, and thus, VEGFR2 attaining suitable phosphorylation levels. We identify\nan optimum range of ligand concentration for sustained dimer phosphorylation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2016 11:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-24"}

Based on the positive results for these models we propose that\nreplica analytic continuation is a robust procedure in replica analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2016 12:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-24"}

In many cases, events recorded in the event log are too fine-grained,\ncausing process discovery algorithms to discover incomprehensible process\nmodels or process models that are not representative of the event log. We show\nthat when process discovery algorithms are only able to discover an\nunrepresentative process model from a low-level event log, structure in the\nprocess can in some cases still be discovered by first abstracting the event\nlog to a higher level of granularity. This gives rise to the challenge to\nbridge the gap between an original low-level event log and a desired high-level\nperspective on this log, such that a more structured or more comprehensible\nprocess model can be discovered. We show that supervised learning can be\nleveraged for the event abstraction task when annotations with high-level\ninterpretations of the low-level events are available for a subset of the\nsequences (i.e., traces).

The study of the frequency dependence of the resonance\nlinewidth in a broad band of 3 to 35 GHz has allowed the determination of\nintrinsic and extrinsic contributions to the relaxation as function of\nBiFeO$_3$ thickness in perpendicular geometries. In our system the magnetic\nrelaxation is dominated by the spin-pumping mechanism due to the presence of\nPt. The insertion of BiFeO$_3$ between Pt and Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$ attenuates the\nspin-pumping damping at one interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2016 12:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

Our algorithm solves RMC using\nnearly optimal number of observations as well as nearly optimal number of\ncorruptions. Our result also implies significant improvement over the existing\ntime complexity bounds for the low-rank matrix completion problem. Finally, an\napplication of our result to the robust PCA problem (low-rank+sparse matrix\nseparation) leads to nearly linear time (in matrix dimensions) algorithm for\nthe same; existing state-of-the-art methods require quadratic time.

We make use of the Planck-HFI 2015 data release at\nhigh frequencies to place new constraints on the properties of the polarized\nthermal dust emission at high Galactic latitudes. Here, we specifically study\nthe spatial variability of the dust polarized spectral energy distribution, and\nits potential impact on the determination of the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We use\nthe correlation ratio of the $C_\\ell^{BB}$ angular power spectra between the\n217- and 353-GHz channels as a tracer of these potential variations, computed\non different high Galactic latitude regions, ranging from 80% to 20% of the\nsky. The new insight from Planck data is a departure of the correlation ratio\nfrom unity that cannot be attributed to a spurious decorrelation due to the\ncosmic microwave background, instrumental noise, or instrumental systematics.\nThe effect is marginally detected on each region, but the statistical\ncombination of all the regions gives more than 99% confidence for this\nvariation in polarized dust properties. In addition, we show that the\ndecorrelation increases when there is a decrease in the mean column density of\nthe region of the sky being considered, and we propose a simple power-law\nempirical model for this dependence, which matches what is seen in the Planck\ndata. We explore the effect that this measured decorrelation has on simulations\nof the BICEP2-Keck Array/Planck analysis and show that the 2015 constraints\nfrom those data still allow a decorrelation between the dust at 150 and 353GHz\nof the order of the one we measure. Finally we show that either spatial\nvariation of the dust SED or of the dust polarization angle could produce\ndecorrelations between 217- and 353-GHz data similar to those we observe in the\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2016 14:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

We formally define\nthe set of parental trees of a network and make three contributions based on\nthis definition. First, we extend the notion of anomaly zone to phylogenetic\nnetworks and report on anomaly results for different networks. Second, we\ndemonstrate how coalescence events could negatively affect the ability to infer\na species tree that could be augmented into the correct network. Third, we\ndemonstrate how a phylogenetic network can be viewed as a mixture model that\nlends itself to a novel inference approach via gene tree clustering.\n  Our results demonstrate the limitations of focusing on the set of trees\ndisplayed by a network when analyzing and inferring the network.

In previous\nstudies often the effect of the gas on the cluster dynamics has been neglected,\nthis is remedied here. Using the code NBody6++ we study the stellar dynamics in\ndifferent developmental phases - embedded, expulsion, expansion - including the\ngas and quantify the effect of fly-bys on the disc size.

By contrast, discs in sparser clusters are initially less\naffected but as they expand slower 13% of discs are truncated after gas\nexpulsion. For ONC-like clusters we find that usually discs larger than 500 AU\nare affected by the environment, which corresponds to the observation that 200\nAU-sized discs are common. For NGC 6611-like clusters disc sizes are cut-down\non average to roughly 100 AU.

Such a remarkable ability has been shown in\ntransformation and ray optics. Alternatively, it may be realistic to create a\nspatial cloak by means of confining electromagnetic field in three-dimensional\narrayed waveguides and introducing appropriate collective curvature surrounding\nan object. We realize the artificial structure in borosilicate by femtosecond\nlaser direct writing, where we prototype up to 5000 waveguides to conceal\nmillimeter-scale volume. We characterize the performance of the cloak by\nnormalized cross correlation, tomography analysis and continuous\nthree-dimensional viewing angle scan. Our results show invisibility cloak can\nbe achieved in waveguide optics. Furthermore, directly printed invisibility\ncloak on a photonic chip may enable controllable study and novel applications\nin classical and quantum integrated photonics, such as invisualising a coupling\nor swapping operation with on-chip circuits of their own.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2016 20:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-27"}

An evidence based approach applies\ntwo foundational principles of information theory to show dark energy and dark\nmatter may be Holographic Dark Information Energy, HDIE. HDIE explains many\neffects attributed separately to Lambda and CDM. HDIE mimics Lambda with\nsufficient energy and an equation of state parameter, w= -1.03+-0.05 at\nredshifts z<1.35 to account for accelerating expansion. HDIE is clumped around\ngalaxies at densities that distort space-time, explaining many CDM attributed\neffects. The present ratio of HDIE:baryons ~2.15, required for observed\nexpansion history, is equivalent to a dark matter fraction ~68%, consistent\nwith several galaxy surveys. The HDIE/baryon model is based largely on proven\nphysics, provides a common explanation for dark energy and dark matter, and\nsolves the cosmological coincidence problem. At earlier times, z > ~1.35, HDIE\nwas phantom, w = -1.82+-0.08, enabling the model to be falsified. HDIE fits\nPlanck dark energy wo-wa plots at least as well as Lambda, and is consistent\nwith other results that suggest dark energy was phantom at earlier times. A new\nw-parameterisation is proposed, as the usual CPL parameterisation is unsuitable\nfor distinguishing between HDIE/baryon and LambdaCDM models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2016 22:50:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 17:03:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2016 14:25:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 20:20:13 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 14:33:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}
