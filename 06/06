An implicit assumption is that all the constituent\nnodes belong equally to their associated community. However, some nodes are\nmore important in the community than others. To date, efforts have been\nprimarily driven to identify communities as a whole, rather than understanding\nto what extent an individual node belongs to its community. Therefore, most\nmetrics for evaluating communities, for example modularity, are global. These\nmetrics produce a score for each community, not for each individual node. In\nthis paper, we argue that the belongingness of nodes in a community is not\nuniform.\n  The central idea of permanence is based on the observation that the strength\nof membership of a vertex to a community depends upon two factors: (i) the the\nextent of connections of the vertex within its community versus outside its\ncommunity, and (ii) how tightly the vertex is connected internally. We discuss\nhow permanence can help us understand and utilize the structure and evolution\nof communities by demonstrating that it can be used to -- (i) measure the\npersistence of a vertex in a community, (ii) design strategies to strengthen\nthe community structure, (iii) explore the core-periphery structure within a\ncommunity, and (iv) select suitable initiators for message spreading.\n  We demonstrate that the process of maximizing permanence produces meaningful\ncommunities that concur with the ground-truth community structure of the\nnetworks more accurately than eight other popular community detection\nalgorithms.

Two continuum velocity field quantities are introduced to facilitate\nthe discrete-to-continuum transition.

The second one is the decoupling velocity\nof dislocation pairs controlled by a threshold stress value, which is proposed\nto be the effective flow stress for single slip systems. Compared to the almost\nubiquitously adopted Taylor relationship, the derived flow stress formula\nexhibits two features that are more consistent with the underlying discrete\ndislocation dynamics: i) the flow stress increases with the in-plane component\nof the dislocation density only up to a certain value, hence the derived\nformula admits a minimum inter-dislocation distance within slip planes; ii) the\nflow stress smoothly transits to zero when all dislocations become\ngeometrically necessary dislocations.

Nevertheless, there is no general\nconstructive method for finding such martingales that yields diffusions. We\nconsider the uniform peacock, namely the peacock with uniform law at all times\non a generic time-varying support [a(t); b(t)]. We derive explicitly the\ncorresponding SDEs and prove that, under certain \"conic\" conditions on a(t) and\nb(t), they admit a unique strong diffusive solution. To guess the candidate SDE\nwe resort to the approach of inverting the Fokker Planck equation. Dupire\n(1994) did this for volatility modeling.

Independently,\nMadan and Yor (2002) obtained the result as a simple application of Dupire.\nOnce the SDE is guessed, we analyze it rigorously, discussing the cases where\nour approach adds strong uniqueness of the solution of the SDE and cases where\nonly a weak solution is obtained. We further study the local time and activity\nof the solution. We then study the peacock with uniform law at all times on a\nconstant support [-1; 1] and derive the SDE of an associated mean-reverting\ndiffusion process with uniform margins that is not a martingale. For the\nrelated SDE we prove existence of a solution.

We propose and verify a\nnew set of nonlinear SGS closures for future application as an SGS model in LES\nof compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).

At the critical driving\nstrength that yields maximum conversion efficiency, the spectral conversion\nprobability density is shown to exhibit a flat-topped peak, indicating a range\nof insensitivity to the spectrum of a single photon input. Two alternate\ntheoretical approaches are presented to study the conversion dynamics: a\ndressed mode approach that yields a better intuitive picture of the conversion\nprocess, and a study of the temporal dynamics of the participating modes in the\nresonator, which uncovers a regime of Rabi-like coherent oscillations of single\nphotons between two different frequency modes. This oscillatory regime arises\nfrom the strong coupling of distinct frequency modes mediated by coherent\npumps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2016 23:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-10"}

Service virtualization is an approach to this challenge where\nservices within the deployment environment are emulated by synthesising service\nresponse messages from models or by recording and then replaying service\ninteraction messages with the system. Record-and-replay techniques require an\napproach where (i) message prototypes can be derived from recorded system\ninteractions (i.e. request-response sequences), (ii) a scheme to match incoming\nrequest messages against message prototypes, and (iii) the synthesis of\nresponse messages based on similarities between incoming messages and the\nrecorded system interactions.

It typically involves two\nprocedures of non-linear feature extractions against dramatic appearance\nchanges, and subsequent discriminative analysis in order to reduce intra-\npersonal variations while enlarging inter-personal differences. In this paper,\nwe introduce a hybrid architecture which combines Fisher vectors and deep\nneural networks to learn non-linear representations of person images to a space\nwhere data can be linearly separable. We reinforce a Linear Discriminant\nAnalysis (LDA) on top of the deep neural network such that linearly separable\nlatent representations can be learnt in an end-to-end fashion. By optimizing an\nobjective function modified from LDA, the network is enforced to produce\nfeature distributions which have a low variance within the same class and high\nvariance between classes. The objective is essentially derived from the general\nLDA eigenvalue problem and allows to train the network with stochastic gradient\ndescent and back-propagate LDA gradients to compute the gradients involved in\nFisher vector encoding. For evaluation we test our approach on four benchmark\ndata sets in person re-identification (VIPeR [1], CUHK03 [2], CUHK01 [3], and\nMarket1501 [4]).

DTW is essentially a point-to-point\nmatching method under some boundary and temporal consistency constraints.\nAlthough DTW obtains a global optimal solution, it does not necessarily achieve\nlocally sensible matchings. Concretely, two temporal points with entirely\ndissimilar local structures may be matched by DTW. To address this problem, we\npropose an improved alignment algorithm, named shape Dynamic Time Warping\n(shapeDTW), which enhances DTW by taking point-wise local structural\ninformation into consideration. shapeDTW is inherently a DTW algorithm, but\nadditionally attempts to pair locally similar structures and to avoid matching\npoints with distinct neighborhood structures. We apply shapeDTW to align audio\nsignal pairs having ground-truth alignments, as well as artificially simulated\npairs of aligned sequences, and obtain quantitatively much lower alignment\nerrors than DTW and its two variants.

However, previous methods\nfor image aesthetics analysis have primarily focused on the coarse, binary\ncategorization of images into high- or low-aesthetic categories. In this work,\nwe propose to learn a deep convolutional neural network to rank photo\naesthetics in which the relative ranking of photo aesthetics are directly\nmodeled in the loss function. Our model incorporates joint learning of\nmeaningful photographic attributes and image content information which can help\nregularize the complicated photo aesthetics rating problem.\n  To train and analyze this model, we have assembled a new aesthetics and\nattributes database (AADB) which contains aesthetic scores and meaningful\nattributes assigned to each image by multiple human raters. Anonymized rater\nidentities are recorded across images allowing us to exploit intra-rater\nconsistency using a novel sampling strategy when computing the ranking loss of\ntraining image pairs. We show the proposed sampling strategy is very effective\nand robust in face of subjective judgement of image aesthetics by individuals\nwith different aesthetic tastes. Experiments demonstrate that our unified model\ncan generate aesthetic rankings that are more consistent with human ratings. To\nfurther validate our model, we show that by simply thresholding the estimated\naesthetic scores, we are able to achieve state-or-the-art classification\nperformance on the existing AVA dataset benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 06:14:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 00:20:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-28"}

Determining an optimal set of\nexchanges is theoretically and empirically hard. Traditionally, exchanges took\nplace in cycles, with each participating patient-donor pair both giving and\nreceiving a kidney. The recent introduction of chains, where a donor without a\npaired patient triggers a sequence of donations without requiring a kidney in\nreturn, increased the efficacy of fielded kidney exchanges---while also\ndramatically raising the empirical computational hardness of clearing the\nmarket in practice. While chains can be quite long, unbounded-length chains are\nnot desirable: planned donations can fail before transplant for a variety of\nreasons, and the failure of a single donation causes the rest of that chain to\nfail, so parallel shorter chains are better in practice.\n  In this paper, we address the tractable clearing of kidney exchanges with\nshort cycles and chains that are long but bounded. This corresponds to the\npractice at most modern fielded kidney exchanges. We introduce three new\ninteger programming formulations, two of which are compact. Furthermore, one of\nthese models has a linear programming relaxation that is exactly as tight as\nthe previous tightest formulation (which was not compact) for instances in\nwhich each donor has a paired patient. On real data from the UNOS nationwide\nexchange in the United States and the NLDKSS nationwide exchange in the United\nKingdom, as well as on generated realistic large-scale data, we show that our\nnew models are competitive with all existing solvers---in many cases\noutperforming all other solvers by orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 06:16:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2016 22:39:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-14"}

To understand the dynamics of this\nresonance, frequency locking is examined in a system near the Hopf bifurcation\nand subject to two types of driving forces: additive and parametric. Derivation\nof a universal amplitude equation that contains both forcing terms enables a\nstudy of their relative impact on the hair cell response. In the parametric\ncase, although the resonant solutions are 1:1 frequency locked, they show the\ncoexistence of solutions obeying a phase shift of $\\pi$, a feature typical of\nthe 2:1 resonance. Different characteristics are predicted for the transition\nfrom unlocked to locked solutions, leading to smooth or abrupt dynamics in\nresponse to different types of forcing. The theoretical framework provides a\nmore realistic model of the auditory system, which incorporates a direct\nmodulation of the internal control parameter by an applied drive.

For nearly fifteen years, astrocladistics has explored\nthe use of Maximum Parsimony (or cladistics) for astronomical objects like\ngalaxies or globular clusters. In this lesson we will learn how it works. 1 Why\nphylogenetic tools in astrophysics? 1.1 History of classification The need for\nclassifying living organisms is very ancient, and the first classification\nsystem can be dated back to the Greeks. The goal was very practical since it\nwas intended to distinguish between eatable and toxic aliments, or kind and\ndangerous animals. Simple resemblance was used and has been used for centuries.\nBasically, until the XVIIIth century, every naturalist chose his own criterion\nto build a classification. At the end, hundreds of classifications were\navailable, most often incompatible to each other. The criteria for this\ntraditional way of classifying is the subjective appearance of the living\norganisms. During the XVIIIth a revolution occurred. Scientists like Adanson\nand Linn{\\'e} devised new ways of classifying the objects and naming the\nclasses. Adanson realised that all the observable traits should be used, giving\nbirth to the mutivariate clustering and classification activity (Adanson,\n1763). Linn{\\'e} based his binomial nomenclature on neutral names unrelated\nwhatsoever to any property of the classes. We can realise the success of these\ntwo ideas more than two centuries and a half later!\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 06:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}

The outflow is observed\nas shallow HI absorption blueshifted ~1300 km/s with respect to the systemic\nvelocity and located against the inner kpc of the radio source. The outflowing\ngas has an estimated column density between 5 and 15x10^18 Tspin cm^-2. We\nderive the Tspin to lie in the range 400-2000 K and the densities are\nn_HI~10-100 cm^-3. Our results confirm the multiphase nature of the outflow in\nMrk231. Although effects of the interaction between the radio plasma and the\nsurrounding medium cannot be ruled out, the energetics and the lack of a clear\nkpc-scale jet suggest that the most likely origin of the HI outflow is a\nwide-angle nuclear wind, as earlier proposed to explain the neutral outflow\ntraced by NaI and molecular gas. Our results suggest that an HI component is\npresent in fast outflows regardless of the acceleration mechanism (wind vs jet\ndriven) and that it must be connected with common properties of the\npre-interaction gas. Considering the observed similarity of their column\ndensities, the HI outflow likely represents the inner part of the broad wind\nidentified on larger scales in NaI. The mass outflow rate of the HI outflow\ndoes not appear to be as large as the one observed in molecular gas. These\ncharacteristics suggest that the HI may represent a short intermediate phase in\nthe rapid cooling of the gas. We also obtained deeper continuum images than\npreviously available. At the resolution of ~1arcsec we do not see a kpc-scale\njet. Instead, we detect a plateau of emission, likely due to star formation,\nsurrounding the bright nuclear region. We also detect a poorly collimated\nbridge which may represent the channel feeding the southern lobe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 07:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

More interestingly, a pronounced conductance\nplateau with $G=0$ is found around zero energy, which is attributable to the\nopening of the bulk energy gap between the valence and conduction bands.\nMeanwhile, the thermopower can be enhanced more than twice, compared to that of\nthe perfect ZPNRs. The large magnitude of thermopower is ascribed to the\nappearance of the bulk energy gap around zero energy. Our results show that the\nmodulated ZPNRs are more reliable in thermoelectric application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 08:29:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 01:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-14"}

It has a statistical model for 3D properties of\n'nonlocal' contacts and a physics based description of 'local' interactions,\nbased on mechanical torque. The form of the torque barrier is derived using a\nrepresentation of the local electronic structure, which is presumed to improve\ntransferability, compared to traditional force fields. The nonlocal contacts\nare more distant than 1-4 interactions and Target-atoms are represented by 3D\nprobability densities. Probability mass quantifies strength of contact and is\ncalculated as an overlap integral. Repulsion is described by negative\nprobability density, allowing probability mass to be used as the descriptor of\ncontact preference. As a result, we are able to transform the high-dimensional\nproblem into a simpler evaluation of three-dimensional integrals.

The\nimplicit assumption when using these indices as a monitor of the westward\nelectrojet is that the electrojet flows perpendicular to $\\textbf{B}_{0,\n\\textit{H}}$. However, $\\textbf{B}_{0, \\textit{H}}$ is, in general, not\nperpendicular to the westward direction in coordinate systems that take\nnondipole terms of the Earth's magnetic field into account, such as apex and\nthe Altitude Adjusted Corrected Geomagnetic coordinate systems. In this paper\nwe derive a new $\\textit{SML}$ index, based on apex coordinates. We find that\nthe new index has less variation with longitude and universal time (UT),\ncompared to the traditionally defined $\\textit{SML}$. We argue that when\nanalyzing ionospheric currents using magnetometers, it is appropriate to\nconvert the components to a corrected geomagnetic system. This is most\nimportant when considering longitudinal or UT variations, or when data from a\nlimited region are used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 13:14:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}

Therefore we use a metric which incorporates the fundamental quarks\nby embedding the coincident D7 branes in the Klebanov-Tseytlin background and a\nfinite temperature is switched on by inserting a black hole into the\nbackground, known as OKS-BH metric. Further inclusion of an additional UV cap\nto the metric prepares the dual gauge theory to run similar to thermal QCD.\nMoreover $\\hat{q}$ is usually defined in the literature from the Glauber-model\nperturbative QCD evaluation of the Wilson loop, which has no reasons to hold if\nthe coupling is large and is thus against the main idea of gauge-gravity\nduality. Thus we use an appropriate definition of $\\hat{q}$: $\\hat{q} L^- =\n1/L^2$, where $L$ is the separation for which the Wilson loop is equal to some\nspecific value. The above two refinements cause $\\hat{q}$ to vary with the\ntemperature as $T^4$ always and to depend linearly on the light-cone time $L^-$\nwith an additional ($1/L^-$) correction term in the short-distance limit\nwhereas in the long-distance limit, it depends only linearly on $L^-$ with no\ncorrection term.

Similar in many aspects to common gamma-ray bursts\n(GRBs), their strong X-ray emission is accompanied by very low or absent\nemission in the gamma-ray band. Despite this key difference, a number of\nindications have consolidated the idea that XRFs and GRBs share a common\norigin, including a number of potential XRF/supernova associations and the\nconsistency of some XRFs with the Amati relation for long GRBs. However, the\ndifficulties in explaining XRFs as off-axis or intrinsically weak GRBs still\ncast doubts on this interpretation. Here we explore the possibility that some\nXRFs are instead powered by the spindown of a long-lived neutron star (NS)\nformed in a binary NS (BNS) merger or, possibly, in a core-collapse supernova.\nFocusing on XRF 020903 and a few other cases observed by HETE-2, we show that\ntheir lack of gamma-ray emission, spectral properties, duration and X-ray\nluminosity find a natural explanation within our hypothesis.

However, this convention usually employs a\npost-Newtonian (PN) accurate precessional equation, appropriate for the PN\naccurate orbital angular momentum ${\\bf L}$, to evolve the ${\\bf L}_{\\rm\nN}$-based precessing source frame. This motivated us to develop inspiral\nwaveforms for spinning compact binaries in a precessing convention that\nexplicitly use ${\\bf L}$ to describe the binary orbits. Our approach introduces\ncertain additional 3PN order terms in the orbital phase and frequency evolution\nequations with respect to the usual ${\\bf L}_{\\rm N}$-based implementation of\nthe precessing convention. The implications of these additional terms are\nexplored by computing the match between inspiral waveforms that employ ${\\bf\nL}$ and ${\\bf L}_{\\rm N}$-based precessing conventions. We found that the match\nestimates are smaller than the optimal value, namely 0.97, for a non-negligible\nfraction of unequal mass spinning compact binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 14:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-17"}

Our measurements indicate that SOI is\nultra-strong and extremely robust, despite it being merely\ninterfacially-induced, with neither graphene nor the TMD substrates changing\ntheir structure. This is found to be the case irrespective of the TMD material\nused, of the transport regime, of the carrier type in the graphene band, and of\nthe thickness of the graphene multilayer. Specifically, we perform weak\nantilocalization measurements as the simplest and most general diagnostic of\nSOI, and show that the spin relaxation time is very short in all cases\nregardless of the elastic scattering time. Such a short spin-relaxation time\nstrongly suggests that the SOI originates from a modification of graphene band\nstructure. We confirmed this expectation by measuring a gate-dependent beating,\nand a corresponding frequency splitting, in the low-field Shubnikov-de Haas\nmagneto-resistance oscillations in high quality bilayer graphene on WSe$_2$.\nThese measurements provide an unambiguous diagnostic of a SOI-induced splitting\nin the electronic band structure, and their analysis allows us to determine the\nSOI coupling constants for the Rashba term and the so-called spin-valley\ncoupling term, i.e., the terms that were recently predicted theoretically for\ninterface-induced SOI in graphene. The magnitude of the SOI splitting is found\nto be on the order of 10 meV, more than 100 times greater than the SOI\nintrinsic to graphene. Both the band character of the interfacially induced\nSOI, as well as its robustness and large magnitude make graphene-on-TMD a\npromising system to realize and explore a variety of spin-dependent transport\nphenomena, such as, in particular, spin-Hall and valley-Hall topological\ninsulating states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 15:36:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

The universal feature found across all partition models\nis having many small parts but only very few big parts, while Benford's Law is\nvalid only in some particular partition cases and under certain constraints.\nHence another suggested vista of Benford's Law is viewing it as a particular\nsubset of the broader positive skewness phenomenon in quantitative\npartitioning. Significantly, such a vista is true in all other causes and\nexplanations of Benford's Law where the small consistently outnumbers the big\nalso in partial structures of the model or well before full convergence to\nBenford is achieved - endowing the principle universality in a sense. In\nconclusion, either the active act of partitioning or the passive consideration\nof a large quantity as the composition of smaller parts can be considered as\nanother independent explanation for the widespread empirical observation of\nBenford's Law in the physical sciences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 15:41:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 10:17:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2016 07:11:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 20 Feb 2019 14:33:25 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 18 Jan 2020 03:44:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

While this deterministic conclusion of instability is\ncorrect, we show that the Ellis wormhole reduces to Schwarzschild black hole\n\\textit{only} when the Ellis solution parameter $\\gamma $ assumes a complex\nvalue $-i$. We shall then reexamine stability of Ellis and phantom wormholes\nfrom the viewpoint of local and asymptotic observers by using a completely\ndifferent approach, viz., we adapt Tangherlini's nondeterministic, prequantal\nstatistical simulation about photon motion in the real optical medium to an\neffective medium reformulation of motions obtained via Hamilton's\noptical-mechanical analogy in a gravity field. A crucial component of\nTangherlini's idea is the observed increase of momentum of the photons entering\na real medium. We show that this fact has a heuristic parallel in the effective\nmedium\\ version of the Pound-Rebka experiment in gravity. Our conclusion is\nthat there is a non-zero probability that Ellis and phantom wormholes could\nappear stable or unstable depending on the location of observers and on the\nvalues of $\\gamma$, leading to the possibility of \\textit{ghost wormholes}\n(like ghost stars). The Schwarzschild horizon, however, would always appear\ncertainly stable ($R=1$, $T=0$) to observers regardless of their location.\nPhantom wormholes of bounded mass in the extreme limit $a\\rightarrow -1$ are\nalso shown to be stable just as the Schwarzschild black hole is. We shall\npropose a thought experiment showing that our non-deterministic results could\nbe numerically translated into observable deterministic signatures of ghost\nwormholes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 07:27:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

While the inner spacetime\nis represented by asymptotically flat phantom wormhole that have repulsive\ngravity, it is most likely to be unstable to perturbations. Hence, we consider\na situation, where a phantom wormhole is somehow trapped inside a Schwarzschild\nsphere across a thin shell. Applying the method developed by Garcia, Lobo and\nVisser (GLV), we shall exemplify that the shell can possess zones of stability\ndepending on certain constraints.
