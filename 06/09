However, normal quasars -- powered by accretion\nonto a single, supermassive black hole -- usually show stochastic variability\nover a wide range of timescales. It is therefore important to carefully assess\nthe methods for identifying periodic candidates from among a population\ndominated by stochastic variability. Using a Bayesian analysis of the light\ncurve of PG 1302-102, we find that a simple stochastic process is preferred\nover a sinusoidal variations. We then discuss some of the problems one\nencounters when searching for rare, strictly periodic signals among a large\nnumber of irregularly sampled, stochastic time series, and use simulations of\nquasar light curves to illustrate these points. From a few thousand simulations\nof steep spectrum (`red noise') stochastic processes, we find many simulations\nthat display few-cycle periodicity like that seen in PG 1302-102.

We propose an optimal control framework that\ntakes advantage of feeding back information of finished tasks to solve a\nreal-time multiprocessor scheduling problem with uncertainty in task execution\ntimes, with the objective of minimizing the total energy consumption.\nSpecifically, we propose a linear programming based algorithm to solve a\nworkload partitioning problem and adopt McNaughton's wrap around algorithm to\nfind the task execution order. The simulation results illustrate that our\nfeedback scheduling algorithm can save energy by as much as 40% compared to an\nopen-loop method for two processor models, i.e. a PowerPC 405LP and an XScale\nprocessor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2016 16:52:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-13"}

In the present paper, we demonstrate that such a view is only valid in\nvery special cases, and in general the homotopy analysis method is far more\nrobust. In particular, the equivalence is only valid when the solution is\nrepresented as a power series in the independent variable. As has been shown\nmany times, alternative basis functions can greatly improve the error\nproperties of homotopy solutions, and when the base functions are not\npolynomials or power functions, we no longer have that the generalized Taylor\nseries approach is equivalent to the homotopy analysis method. We demonstrate\nthis by consideration of an example where the generalizes Taylor series must\nalways have a finite radius of convergence (and hence limited applicability),\nwhile the homotopy solution is valid over the entire infinite domain. We then\ngive a second example for which the exact solution is not analytic, and hence\nit will not agree with the generalized Taylor series over the domain. We\nconclude that the generalized Taylor series approach is not equivalent to the\nhomotopy analysis method. In particular, the generalized Taylor series can at\nbest recover local information about solutions, whereas the homotopy analysis\nmethod can recover the solutions globally if appropriate base functions are\nselected.

Recently, there has been interest in\nmaximizing the number of homomorphisms from graphs with a fixed number of\nvertices and edges into small image graphs. For the image graph\n$H_{\\text{ind}}$, the graph on two adjacent vertices, one of which is looped,\neach homomorphism from $G$ to $H_{\\text{ind}}$ corresponds to an independent\nset in $G$. It follows from the Kruskal-Katona theorem that the number of\nhomomorphisms to $H_{\\text{ind}}$ is maximized by the lex graph, whose edges\nform an initial segment of the lex order.\n  A \\emph{loop-threshold graph} is a graph built recursively from a single\nvertex, which may be looped or unlooped, by successively adding either a looped\ndominating vertex or an unlooped isolated vertex at each stage. Thus, the graph\n$H_{\\text{ind}}$ is a loop-threshold graph. We survey known results for\nmaximizing the number of homomorphisms into small loop-threshold image graphs.\nThe only extremal homomorphism problem with a loop-threshold image graph on at\nmost three vertices not yet solved is $H_{\\text{ind}}\\cup E_1$, where extremal\ngraphs are the union of a lex graph and an empty graph. The only question that\nremains is the size of the lex component of the extremal graph.

Quantum information\nand quantum metrology have given us new ways to approach measurement ; a new\nproposal inspired by these ideas has now re-examined the problem of trying to\nestimate the separation between two poorly resolved point sources. The \"Fisher\ninformation\" provides the inverse of the Cramer-Rao bound, the lowest variance\nachievable for an unbiased estimator. For a given imaging system and a fixed\nnumber of collected photons, Tsang, Nair and Lu observed that the Fisher\ninformation carried by the intensity of the light in the image-plane (the only\ninformation available to traditional techniques, including previous\nsuper-resolution approaches) falls to zero as the separation between the\nsources decreases; this is known as \"Rayleigh's Curse.\" On the other hand, when\nthey calculated the quantum Fisher information of the full electromagnetic\nfield (including amplitude and phase information), they found it remains\nconstant. In other words, there is infinitely more information available about\nthe separation of the sources in the phase of the field than in the intensity\nalone.

It is customary to\nconsider $\\ell_1$ penalty to enforce sparsity in such scenarios. Sparsity\nenforcing methods, the Lasso being a canonical example, are popular candidates\nto address high dimension. For efficiency, they rely on tuning a parameter\ntrading data fitting versus sparsity. For the Lasso theory to hold this tuning\nparameter should be proportional to the noise level, yet the latter is often\nunknown in practice. A possible remedy is to jointly optimize over the\nregression parameter as well as over the noise level.

The characteristic photometric HB signal evident in their\nlight curves is produced by a combination of tidal distortion, heating, and\nDoppler boosting near orbital periastron. Many HB stars continue to oscillate\nafter periastron and along the entire orbit, indicative of the tidal excitation\nof oscillation modes within one or both stars. These systems are among the most\neccentric binaries known, and they constitute astrophysical laboratories for\nthe study of tidal effects. We have undertaken a radial velocity (RV)\nmonitoring campaign of Kepler HB stars in order to measure their orbits.

The 19\nsystems measured here have orbital periods from 7 to 90 d and eccentricities\nfrom 0.2 to 0.9. We show that HB stars draw the upper envelope of the\neccentricity - period distribution.

In many quasars,\nthe CIV-emission line exhibits significant blue asymmetries (`blueshifts') with\nthe line centroid displaced by up to thousands of km/s to the blue. These\nblueshifts almost certainly signal the presence of strong outflows, most likely\noriginating in a disc wind.

A strong\ncorrelation between CIV-velocity width and blueshift is found and, at large\nblueshifts, > 2000 km/s, the velocity-widths appear to be dominated by\nnon-virial motions.

Desmosomes are membrane-associated adhesion complexes that\nmechanically tether the cytoskeletal intermediate filaments (IFs) between two\nadjacent cells, creating a network of tough connections in tissues such as skin\nand heart. Desmoplakin (DP) is the key desmosomal protein that binds IFs, and\nthe DP-IF association poses a quandary: desmoplakin must stably and tightly\nbind IFs to maintain the structural integrity of the desmosome. Yet, newly\nsynthesized DP must traffick along the cytoskeleton to the site of nascent\ndesmosome assembly without 'sticking' to the IF network, implying weak or\ntransient DP--IF contacts. Recent work reveals that these contacts are\nmodulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) in DP's C-terminal tail.\nUsing molecular dynamics simulations, we have elucidated the structural basis\nof these PTM-induced effects. Our simulations, nearing 2 microseconds in\naggregate, indicate that phosphorylation of S2849 induces an 'arginine claw' in\ndesmoplakin's C-terminal tail (DPCTT).

The dusty ring is detected for the first time along its\nfull projected elliptical shape. The radial extent of the ring is not spatially\nresolved and shows no evidence, to within the uncertainties, of dust density\nenhancements. Additional features of the 1.1 mm map are: (i) the presence of\nsignificant flux in the gap between the ring and the star, probably providing\nthe first exo-solar evidence of Poynting-Robertson drag, (ii) an unambiguous\ndetection of emission at the stellar position with a flux significantly above\nthat expected from Epsilon Eridani's photosphere, and (iii) the identification\nof numerous unresolved sources which could correspond to background dusty\nstar-forming galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2016 21:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

It is important for the theories of black hole accretion\ndisks and their applications to astrophysical black hole systems.\nTraditionally, the marginally stable circular orbit is obtained by considering\nthe equatorial motion of a test particle around a black hole. However, in\nreality the accretion flow around black holes consists of fluid, in which the\npressure often plays an important role. Here we consider the influence of fluid\npressure on the location of marginally stable circular orbit around black\nholes. It is found that when the temperature of the fluid is so low that the\nthermal energy of a particle is much smaller than its rest energy, the location\nof marginally stable circular orbit is almost the same as that in the test\nparticle case. However, we demonstrate that in some special cases the\nmarginally stable circular orbit can be different when the fluid pressure is\nlarge and the thermal energy becomes non-negligible comparing with the rest\nenergy. We present our results for both the cases of non-spinning and spinning\nblack holes. The influences of our results on the black hole spin parameter\nmeasurement in X-ray binaries and the energy release efficiency of accretion\nflows around black holes are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2016 23:15:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-10"}

This is especially true in poor\ncountries, where basic needs are frequently threatened by economic,\nenvironmental, and health shocks. An empirically sound formalization of the\nconcept of food security resilience, however, is lacking. Here we introduce a\ngeneral framework for quantifying resilience based on a simple definition: a\nunit is resilient if $(a)$ its long-term food security trend is not\ndeteriorating and $(b)$ the effects of shocks on this trend do not persist over\ntime. Our approach can be applied to any food security variable for which\nhigh-frequency time-series data is available, can accommodate any unit of\nanalysis (e.g., individuals, households, countries), and is especially useful\nin rapidly changing contexts wherein standard equilibrium-based economic models\nare ineffective. We illustrate our method with an analysis of per capita\nkilocalorie availability for 161 countries between 1961 and 2011. We find that\nresilient countries are not necessarily those that are characterized by high\nlevels or less volatile fluctuations of kilocalorie intake. Accordingly, food\nsecurity policies and programs will need to be tailored not only to welfare\nlevels at any one time, but also to long-run welfare dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2016 23:27:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-30"}

To accomplish\nthis, machines need to learn about their human users' intentions and adapt to\ntheir preferences. In most current research, a user has conveyed preferences to\na machine using explicit corrective or instructive feedback; explicit feedback\nimposes a cognitive load on the user and is expensive in terms of human effort.\nThe primary objective of the current work is to demonstrate that a learning\nagent can reduce the amount of explicit feedback required for adapting to the\nuser's preferences pertaining to a task by learning to perceive a value of its\nbehavior from the human user, particularly from the user's facial\nexpressions---we call this face valuing. We empirically evaluate face valuing\non a grip selection task. Our preliminary results suggest that an agent can\nquickly adapt to a user's changing preferences with minimal explicit feedback\nby learning a value function that maps facial features extracted from a camera\nimage to expected future reward. We believe that an agent learning to perceive\na value from the body language of its human user is complementary to existing\ninteractive machine learning approaches and will help in creating successful\nhuman-machine interactive applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 03:06:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-10"}

Key challenges remain, but a new wave of\norbital and in situ observations and improvements in climate modeling have led\nto significant advances over the last decade. Multiple lines of geologic\nevidence now point to an episodically warm surface during the late Noachian and\nearly Hesperian periods 3-4 Ga. The low solar flux received by Mars in its\nfirst billion years and inefficiency of plausible greenhouse gases such as CO2\nmeans that the steady-state early Martian climate was likely cold. A denser CO2\natmosphere would have caused adiabatic cooling of the surface and hence\nmigration of water ice to the higher altitude equatorial and southern regions\nof the planet. Transient warming caused melting of snow and ice deposits and a\ntemporarily active hydrological cycle, leading to erosion of the valley\nnetworks and other fluvial features. Precise details of the warming mechanisms\nremain unclear, but impacts, volcanism and orbital forcing all likely played an\nimportant role. The lack of evidence for glaciation across much of Mars'\nancient terrain suggests the late Noachian surface water inventory was not\nsufficient to sustain a northern ocean. While mainly inhospitable on the\nsurface, early Mars may nonetheless have presented significant opportunities\nfor the development of microbial life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 03:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

We characterize thermal magnon Hall conductivity in\ndisordered quantum magnon Hall system in terms of robust chiral edge magnon\ntransport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 07:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 03:56:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

In context of amorphous InGaZn oxide (a-IGZO), even though the\ncoordination polyhedra are irregularly arranged, it will be beneficial to\nidentify them. In this work, we address the questions, (a) is it possible to\nclassify all the polyhedra that occur in a-IGZO into only a few distinct\ngroups? and (b) are these the same polyhedral motifs as those observed in the\ncrystalline indium gallium zinc oxide (c-IGZO) or other related crystalline\noxides of indium, gallium and zinc? Therefore, in this first principles based\nstudy, a large number (ten) of equivalent samples of a-IGZO were prepared by ab\ninitio melt-and-quench molecular dynamics, so that several distinct samples of\nthe amorphous landscape are obtained. The combination of all these structures\nthus obtained is a better representation of a real a-IGZO sample. For the ten\nsamples containing 360 cations, we propose a simpler and more accurate method\nfor determining the coordination number of each polyhedron, which was verified\nby charge density plots. Based on a method of comparing bond angles between\nmetal and oxygen atoms, the identified polyhedra were matched to the polyhedral\nmotifs present in the related crystalline systems, such as, InGaZnO4, In2O3,\nGa2O3 and ZnO. We find, the a-IGZO primarily consists of the following\npolyhedra: a tetrahedron from space group 199 and an octahedron from space\ngroup 206 of In2O3; a tetrahedron from space group 12 and an octahedron from\nspace group 167 of Ga2O3; a tetrahedron from space group 186 of ZnO; zinc and\ngallium trigonal bipyramids from c-IGZO; and one zinc 4-fold, one zinc 5-fold\nand one indium 5-fold coordination polyhedra that occur only in the amorphous\nphase. We are able to reduce the description of structure from 360 to 10 groups\nof polyhedra.

If the\nhub dynamics is slow, we obtain that the large time network dynamics is\ncompletely defined by the hub dynamics. Moreover, such networks are maximally\nflexible and switchable, in the sense that they can switch from a globally\nattractive rest state to any structurally stable dynamics when the response\ntime of a special controller hub is changed. In particular, we show that a\ndecrease of the controller hub response time can lead to a sharp variation in\nthe network attractor structure: we can obtain a set of new local attractors,\nwhose number can increase exponentially with N, the total number of nodes of\nthe nework. These new attractors can be periodic or even chaotic.

It\nis a field that combines different disciplines such as computer science,\nstatistics, psychology and pedagogy to achieve its intended objectives. The\nmain goals illustrate in creating convenient interventions on learning as well\nas its environment and the final optimization about learning domain\nstakeholders. Because the field matures and is now adapted in diverse\neducational settings, we believe there is a pressing need to list its own\nresearch methods and specify its objectives and dilemmas. This paper surveys\npublications from Learning Analytics and Knowledge conference from 2013 to 2015\nand lists the significant research areas in this sphere. We consider the method\nprofile and classify them into seven different categories with a brief\ndescription on each. Furthermore, we show the most cited method categories\nusing Google scholar. Finally, the authors raise the challenges and constraints\nthat affect its ethical approach through the meta-analysis study. It is\nbelieved that this paper will help researchers to identify the common methods\nused in Learning Analytics, and it will assist by establishing a future\nforecast towards new research work taking into account the privacy and ethical\nissues of this strongly emerged field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 09:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-21"}

However, their capability to handle individual appearance\nvariations caused by factors such as head pose, illumination, occlusion, and\nmisalignment has not been thoroughly assessed till now. In this paper, we\npresent a comprehensive study to evaluate the performance of deep learning\nbased face representation under several conditions including the varying head\npose angles, upper and lower face occlusion, changing illumination of different\nstrengths, and misalignment due to erroneous facial feature localization. Two\nsuccessful and publicly available deep learning models, namely VGG-Face and\nLightened CNN have been utilized to extract face representations.

As a result, it is expected that high neutrino flux would provide\nabout 15,000 IBD interactions per day in the detector with a sensitive volume\nof 1 m$^3$. High segmentation of the plastic scintillator will allow to\nsuppress a background down to a 1% level. Numerous tests performed with a\nsimplified pilot prototype DANSSino under a 3 GW$_{th}$ reactor of the Kalinin\nNPP have demonstrated operability of the chosen design. The DANSS detector\nsurrounded with a composite shield is movable by means of a special lifting\ngear, varying the distance to the reactor core in a range from 10 m to 12 m.\nDue to this feature, it could be used not only for the reactor monitoring, but\nalso for fundamental research including short-range neutrino oscillations to\nthe sterile state. Supposing one-year measurement, the sensitivity to the\noscillation parameters is expected to reach a level of $sin^2(2\\theta)$ ~ 0.005\nwith $\\Delta m^2 \\subset (0.02-5.0)$ eV$^2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 10:33:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 06:29:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 19:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

In contrast to some of the earlier\nstudies, the magnetic field in our work is included through both the hopping\nfrequencies (via Peierls coupling) and the zeeman interaction, thereby\nfacilitating an explo- ration for competition between the two. The phase\ndiagrams in the antiferromagnetic case shows that the Mott insulating (MI)\nphase with even particle occupancies is stable at low magnetic fields. At\nhigher magnetic fields, due to a competition between the hopping and the zeeman\ninteraction terms, the latter tries to destabilize the MI phase by suppressing\nthe formation of singlet pairs, while the former tends to stabilize the MI\nphase. In the ferromagnetic case, the MI lobes become more stable with\nincreasing flux strengths. Further inclusion of a three body interaction\npotential in order to ascertain its role on the phase diagram, we found that in\nabsence of the magnetic field, the MI lobes become more stable compared to the\nsuperfluid (SF) phase and the location of the transition point for the MI-SF\nphase increases with increasing the three body interaction strength. A strong\ncoupling perturbative calculation has also been done to provide a comparison\nwith our mean field phase diagrams. Lastly, with inclusion of the external\nfield, the insulating phases are found to be further stabilized by the three\nbody interaction potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 10:34:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 06:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-08"}

Primary mirror segmentation is a key\ntechnological solution for large-aperture telescopes because it opens the path\ntoward significantly increasing the angular resolution. The segments are kept\naligned by an active optics system that must reduce segment misalignments below\ntens of nm RMS to achieve the high optical quality required for astronomical\nscience programs. The development of cophasing techniques is mandatory for the\nnext generation of space- and ground-based segmented telescopes, which both\nshare the need for increasing spatial resolution. We propose a new focal plane\ncophasing sensor that exploits the scientific image of a coronagraphic\ninstrument to retrieve simultaneously piston and tip-tilt misalignments. The\nself-coherent camera phasing sensor (SCC-PS) adequately combines the SCC\nproperties to segmented telescope architectures with adapted segment\nmisalignment estimators and image processing. An overview of the system\narchitecture, and a thorough performance and sensitivity analysis, including a\nclosed-loop efficiency, are presented by means of numerical simulations. The\nSCC-PS estimates simultaneously piston and tip-tilt misalignments and corrects\nthem in closed-loop operation. The SCC-PS does not require any a priori on the\nsignal at the segment boundaries or any dedicated optical path. It has a\nmoderate sensitivity to misalignments, virtually none to pupil shear, and is\ninsensitive to segment gaps and edge effects. Primary mirror phasing can be\nachieved with bright natural guide star. The SCC-PS is a noninvasive concept\nand an efficient phasing sensor from the image domain. It is an attractive\ncandidate for segment cophasing at the instrument level or alternatively at the\ntelescope level, as usually envisioned in current space- and ground-based\nobservatories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 12:23:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-10"}

Because the ETEL\nfunction has a well defined probabilistic interpretation and plays the role of\na nonparametric likelihood, a fully Bayesian semiparametric framework can be\ndeveloped. We establish a number of powerful results surrounding the Bayesian\nETEL framework in such models. One major concern driving our work is the\npossibility of misspecification. To accommodate this possibility, we show how\nthe moment conditions can be reexpressed in terms of additional nuisance\nparameters and that, even under misspecification, the Bayesian ETEL posterior\ndistribution satisfies a Bernstein-von Mises result. A second key contribution\nof the paper is the development of a framework based on marginal likelihoods\nand Bayes factors to compare models defined by different moment conditions.\nComputation of the marginal likelihoods is by the method of Chib (1995) as\nextended to Metropolis-Hastings samplers in Chib and Jeliazkov (2001). We\nestablish the model selection consistency of the marginal likelihood and show\nthat the marginal likelihood favors the model with the minimum number of\nparameters and the maximum number of valid moment restrictions. When the models\nare misspecified, the marginal likelihood model selection procedure selects the\nmodel that is closer to the (unknown) true data generating process in terms of\nthe Kullback-Leibler divergence.

The principle behind this approach is the observation that the shift\nof the 2D wavenumber as a function of strain for different types of PAN based\nfibres is a linear function of their Young's moduli and, hence, the\ncorresponding value of the shift of the 2D Raman peak over axial stress is, in\nfact, a constant. By moving across the length scales we show that this value is\nalso valid at the nanoscale as it corresponds to the in plane breathing mode of\ngraphene that is present in both PAN based fibres and monolayer graphene.\nHence, the values of the shift of the 2D Raman peak can be easily converted to\nvalues of stress in the linear elastic region without the aid of modelling or\nthe need to resort to cumbersome experimental procedures for obtaining the\naxial force transmitted to the material and the cross sectional area of the two\ndimensional membrane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 12:30:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2016 15:12:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-14"}

While a previous analysis shows a qualitative consistency\nbetween this suggestion and the Swift SGRB data, the distribution of observed\nbreak time $t_b$ is much narrower than the distribution of the collapse time of\nsupramassive NSs for the several NS equations-of-state (EoSs) investigated. In\nthis paper, we study four recently-constructed \"unified\" NS EoSs, as well as\nthree developed strange quark star (QS) EoSs within the new confinement\ndensity-dependent mass model. All the EoSs chosen here satisfy the recent\nobservational constraints of the two massive pulsars whose masses are precisely\nmeasured. We construct sequences of rigidly rotating NS/QS configurations with\nincreasing spinning frequency $f$, from non-rotating ($f = 0$) to the Keplerian\nfrequency ($f = f_{\\rm K}$), and provide convenient analytical parametrizations\nof the results. Assuming that the cosmological NS-NS merger systems have the\nsame mass distribution as the Galactic NS-NS systems, we demonstrate that all\nexcept the BCPM NS EoS can reproduce the current $22\\%$ supramassive NS/QS\nfraction constraint as derived from the SGRB data. We simultaneously simulate\nthe observed quantities (the break time $t_b$, the break time luminosity $L_b$\nand the total energy in the electromagnetic channel $E_{\\rm total}$) of SGRBs,\nand find that while equally well reproducing other observational constraints,\nQS EoSs predict a much narrower $t_b$ distribution than that of the NS EoSs,\nbetter matching the data. We therefore suggest that the post-merger product of\nNS-NS mergers might be fast-rotating supramassive QSs rather than NSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 12:36:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 04:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

We moreover\ndiscuss the simplification of TBA equations to Y systems, including the\ntransition back to integral equations given sufficient analyticity data, in\nsimple examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 13:16:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2016 12:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2016 10:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

It deals with a beautiful\nmethod, developed in the mid-nineties by V.V. Bazhanov, S.L. Lukyanov and A.B.\nZamolodchikov and, as such, called BLZ. This method can be interpreted as a\nfield theory version of the quantum inverse scattering (QIS), also known as\nalgebraic Bethe ansatz (ABA). Starting with the case of conformal field\ntheories (CFT) we show how to build the field theory analogues of commuting\ntransfer T matrices and Baxter Q-operators of integrable lattice models. These\nobjects contain the complete information of the integrable structure of the\ntheory, viz. the integrals of motion, and can be used, as we will show, to\nderive the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) and non-linear integral (NLIE)\nequations. This same method can be easily extended to the description of\nintegrable structures of certain particular massive deformations of CFTs;\nthese, in turn, can be described as quantum group reductions of the quantum\nsine-Gordon model and it is an easy step to include this last theory in the\nframework of BLZ approach. Finally we show an interesting and surprising\nconnection of the BLZ structures with classical objects emerging from the study\nof classical integrable models via the inverse scattering transform method.\nThis connection goes under the name of ODE/IM correspondence and we will\npresent it for the specific case of quantum sine-Gordon model only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 13:17:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 15:49:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-26"}

While many efforts have been made in this direction, it still\nremains a real challenge. Moreover, the issue is even more complex as full\ntexts are not always freely available. Then, using only partial information to\nannotate these documents is promising but remains a very ambitious issue.\nMethodsWe propose two classification methods: a k-nearest neighbours\n(kNN)-based approach and an explicit semantic analysis (ESA)-based approach.\nAlthough the kNN-based approach is widely used in text classification, it needs\nto be improved to perform well in this specific classification problem which\ndeals with partial information. Compared to existing kNN-based methods, our\nmethod uses classical Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for ranking the labels.\nAdditional features are also investigated in order to improve the classifiers'\nperformance. In addition, the combination of several learning algorithms with\nvarious techniques for fixing the number of relevant topics is performed. On\nthe other hand, ESA seems promising for this classification task as it yielded\ninteresting results in related issues, such as semantic relatedness computation\nbetween texts and text classification. Unlike existing works, which use ESA for\nenriching the bag-of-words approach with additional knowledge-based features,\nour ESA-based method builds a standalone classifier. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate if the results of this method could be useful as a complementary\nfeature of our kNN-based approach.ResultsExperimental evaluations performed on\nlarge standard annotated datasets, provided by the BioASQ organizers, show that\nthe kNN-based method with the Random Forest learning algorithm achieves good\nperformances compared with the current state-of-the-art methods, reaching a\ncompetitive f-measure of 0.55% while the ESA-based approach surprisingly\nyielded reserved results.ConclusionsWe have proposed simple classification\nmethods suitable to annotate textual documents using only partial information.\nThey are therefore adequate for large multi-label classification and\nparticularly in the biomedical domain. Thus, our work contributes to the\nextraction of relevant information from unstructured documents in order to\nfacilitate their automated processing. Consequently, it could be used for\nvarious purposes, including document indexing, information retrieval, etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 14:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-10"}

However, as also found for other data for ion channels,\nthis interpretation must be rejected in favor of a multiphasic profile, a\nseries of straight lines separated by discontinuous transitions, quite often in\nthe form of noncontiguities (jumps). The data points in the present study are\noften very unevenly distributed around the curvilinear profiles. Thus, for 43\nof the 75 profiles, the probability is less than 5% that the uneven\ndistribution is due to chance, for 26 the probability is less than 1%, and for\n12 the probability is less than 0.1%, giving a vanishingly low overall\nprobability for all profiles. Especially at low voltages, the differences\nbetween the fits to curvilinear and multiphasic profiles may be huge. In the\nmultiphasic profiles, adjacent lines are quite often parallel or nearly so, in\nwhich case the transitions are, necessarily, in the form of jumps. The lines in\nthe multiphasic profiles appear to be perfectly straight, with no indication of\nany curvilinearity. The r values are for the most part high, quite often\nexceedingly high.

The constraint results at 95\\% confidence level are: $\\Sigma\nm_\\nu<0.202$ eV for the active neutrino case, $m_{\\nu, sterile}^{eff}<0.757$ eV\nwith $N_{eff}<3.22$ for the sterile neutrino case. For the effects by the mass\nof neutrinos, the constraint results on model parameter at 95\\% confidence\nlevel become $f_{R0}\\times 10^{-6}> -1.89$ and $f_{R0}\\times 10^{-6}> -2.02$\nfor two cases, respectively. It is also shown that the fitting values of\nseveral parameters much depend on the neutrino properties, such as the cold\ndark matter density, the cosmological quantities at matter-radiation equality,\nthe neutrino density and the fraction of baryonic mass in helium. At last, the\nconstraint result shows that the tension between direct and CMB measurements of\n$H_0$ gets slightly weaker in the viable $f(R)$ model than that in the base\n$\\Lambda$CDM model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 15:02:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2016 09:40:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

We also show the possibility of using entanglement to infer about\nuniverse features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 15:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}
