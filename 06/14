In this case, the mechanical energy can undergo\na process compatible with an inverse cascade, being transferred preferentially\ntowards scales larger than the forcing scale. The presence of helicity changes\nthe spectral scaling of the small magnetic field fluctuations, and affects the\nstatistics of the velocity field and of the velocity gradients.

Unlike granulation,\nthe size of which is comparable to both the thickness of the radiative boundary\nlayer and local scale height of the plasma in the photosphere, supergranulation\ndoes not reflect any obvious length scale of the solar convection zone. Early\nsuggestions that the depth of second helium ionization is important are not\nsupported by numerical simulations. Thus the origin of the solar\nsupergranulation remains largely a mystery. Moreover, observations of flows in\nthe photosphere using either Doppler imaging or correlation or feature tracking\nshow a monotonic decrease in power at scales larger than supergranulation. Both\nlocal area and global spherical shell simulations of solar convection by\ncontrast show the opposite, a power law increase in horizontal flow amplitudes\nto low wavenumber. Here we examine this disparity, and investigate how the\nsolar supergranulation may arise as a consequence of strong photospheric\ndriving and non-local heat transport by cool diving plumes. Using three\ndimensional anelastic simulations with surface driving, we show that the\nkinetic energy of largest convective scales in the upper layers of a stratified\ndomain reflects the depth of transition from strong buoyant driving to\nadiabatic stratification below.

We introduce modified Siegel-Veech weights whose generating functions\nwill later be shown to be quasimodular.\n  Parts II and III are devoted to the study of the quasimodularity of the\ngenerating functions arising from weighted counting of torus coverings. The\nstarting point is the theorem of Bloch and Okounkov saying that q-brackets of\nshifted symmetric functions are quasimodular forms. In Part II we give an\nexpression for their growth polynomials in terms of Gaussian integrals and use\nthis to obtain a closed formula for the generating series of cumulants that is\nthe basis for studying large genus asymptotics. In Part III we show that the\neven hook-length moments of partitions are shifted symmetric polynomials and\nprove a formula for the q-bracket of the product of such a hook-length moment\nwith an arbitrary shifted symmetric polynomial.

First, a numerical analysis of the additive\nwhite Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel investigates the effect of using a small\nnumber of input probability mass functions (PMFs) for a range of\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), instead of optimizing the constellation shaping\nfor each SNR. It is shown that if a small penalty of at most 0.1 dB SNR to the\nfull shaping gain is acceptable, just two shaped PMFs are required per\nquadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) over a large SNR range. For a multi-span\nwavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical fiber system with 64QAM input,\nit is shown that just one PMF is required to achieve large gains over uniform\ninput for distances from 1,400 km to 3,000 km. Using recently developed\ntheoretical models that extend the Gaussian noise (GN) model and full-field\nsplit-step simulations, we illustrate the ramifications of probabilistic\nshaping on the effective SNR after fiber propagation. Our results show that,\nfor a fixed average optical launch power, a shaping gain is obtained for the\nnoise contributions from fiber amplifiers and modulation-independent nonlinear\ninterference (NLI), whereas shaping simultaneously causes a penalty as it leads\nto an increased NLI. However, this nonlinear shaping loss is found to have a\nrelatively minor impact, and optimizing the shaped PMF with a\nmodulation-dependent GN model confirms that the PMF found for AWGN is also a\ngood choice for a multi-span fiber system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2016 19:14:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 11:23:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-29"}

Finally, we test different mapping\nfunctions to assign topic segments to word communities, determining which topic\nsegments are considered equivalent.\n  By performing this task it is possible to enable efficient multi-document\nbrowsing, since when a user finds relevant content in one document we can\nprovide access to similar topics in other documents. We deploy our approach in\ntwo different scenarios. One is an educational scenario where equivalence\nrelationships between learning materials need to be found. The other consists\nof a series of dialogs in a social context where students discuss commonplace\ntopics. Results show that our proposed approach better discovered equivalence\nrelationships in learning material documents and obtained close results in the\nsocial speech domain, where the best performing approach was a clustering\ntechnique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2016 19:41:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-14"}

The characteristic\nfeature of mUED is the occurrence of nearly degenerate mass spectrum for the\nKaluza-Klein (KK) particles and hence, soft leptons, soft jets at the collider\nexperiments. The degree of degeneracy of KK-mass spectrum crucially depends on\n$\\Lambda$. The strongest direct bound on $R^{-1}$ ($\\sim $950 GeV for large\n$\\Lambda$) arises from a search for a pair of soft dimuons at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) experiment with 8 TeV center-of-mass energy and $20~{\\rm\nfb}^{-1}$ integrated luminosity.

On the other\nside, individual ages derived from dwarfs observed through microlensing events\nseem to indicate a large spread, from $\\sim$ 2 to $\\sim$ 13 Gyr. Because the\nbulge is now recognised as being mainly a boxy peanut-shaped bar, it is\nsuggested that disk stars are one of its main constituents, and therefore also\nstars with ages significantly younger than 10 Gyr. Other arguments as well\npoint to the fact that the bulge cannot be exclusively old, and in particular\ncannot be a burst population, as it is usually expected if the bulge was the\nfossil remnant of a merger phase in the early Galaxy. In the present study, we\nshow that given the range of metallicities observed in the bulge, a uniformly\nold population would be reflected into a significant spread in color at the\nturn-off which is not observed. Inversely, we demonstrate that the correlation\nbetween age and metallicity expected to hold for the inner disk would conspire\nto form a color-magnitude diagram with a remarkably small spread in color, thus\nmimicking the color-magnitude diagram of a uniformly old population. If stars\nyounger than 10 Gyr are part of the bulge, as must be the case if the bulge has\nbeen mainly formed through dynamical instabilities in the disk, then a very\nsmall spread at the turn-off is expected, as seen in the observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2016 19:59:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

In the low pt region we discuss\nthe all-order exponentiation of collinear bottom mass logarithms. In the high\npt region we show that the infinite top mass approximation loses accuracy as a\npower of pt, while the accuracy of the high-energy approximation is\napproximately constant as pt grows.

Our understanding of dissipative phase transitions in quantum systems\nis less developed, and experiments that probe this physics even less so. By\nplacing cold atoms in optical cavities, and inducing strong coupling between\nlight and excitations of the atoms, one can experimentally study phase\ntransitions of open quantum systems.

These results, found in the few-mode-degenerate\ncavity regime, demonstrate the potential of fully multimode cavities to exhibit\nphysics beyond mean-field theories.

Despite this strong and oftentimes\nunrealistic assumption, it is remarkable that the revenue-maximizing\ncombinatorial auction remains unknown. In recent years, automated mechanism\ndesign has emerged as one of the most practical and promising approaches to\ndesigning high-revenue combinatorial auctions. The most scalable automated\nmechanism design algorithms take as input samples from the bidders' valuation\ndistribution and then search for a high-revenue auction in a rich auction\nclass.

In the problem, we are given a single machine with an initial\nnon-negative maintenance level, and a set of jobs each with a non-preemptive\nprocessing time and a machine deterioration. Such a machine deterioration\nquantifies the decrement in the machine maintenance level after processing the\njob. To avoid machine breakdown, one should guarantee a non-negative\nmaintenance level at any time point; and whenever necessary, a maintenance\nactivity must be allocated for restoring the machine maintenance level. The\ngoal of the problem is to schedule the jobs and the maintenance activities such\nthat the total completion time of jobs is minimized. There are two variants of\nmaintenance activities: in the partial maintenance case each activity can be\nallocated to increase the machine maintenance level to any level not exceeding\nthe maximum; in the full maintenance case every activity must be allocated to\nincrease the machine maintenance level to the maximum. In a recent work, the\nproblem in the full maintenance case has been proven NP-hard; several special\ncases of the problem in the partial maintenance case were shown solvable in\npolynomial time, but the complexity of the general problem is left open.

The fewer assumptions that an estimator makes about the\nattacker, the larger the set of attacks it can protect the system against. In\nthis paper, we focus on sensor attacks on UAVs and attempt to design a secure\nestimator for linear time-invariant systems based on as few assumptions about\nthe attackers as possible. We propose a computationally efficient estimator\nthat protects the system against arbitrary and unbounded attacks, where the set\nof attacked sensors can also change over time.

In AL, one selects the instances to be\nmanually labeled with the aim of maximizing model performance with minimal\neffort. Neural models capitalize on word embeddings as representations\n(features), tuning these to the task at hand. We argue that AL strategies for\nmulti-layered neural models should focus on selecting instances that most\naffect the embedding space (i.e., induce discriminative word representations).\nThis is in contrast to traditional AL approaches (e.g., entropy-based\nuncertainty sampling), which specify higher level objectives. We propose a\nsimple approach for sentence classification that selects instances containing\nwords whose embeddings are likely to be updated with the greatest magnitude,\nthereby rapidly learning discriminative, task-specific embeddings. We extend\nthis approach to document classification by jointly considering: (1) the\nexpected changes to the constituent word representations; and (2) the model's\ncurrent overall uncertainty regarding the instance. The relative emphasis\nplaced on these criteria is governed by a stochastic process that favors\nselecting instances likely to improve representations at the outset of\nlearning, and then shifts toward general uncertainty sampling as AL progresses.\nEmpirical results show that our method outperforms baseline AL approaches on\nboth sentence and document classification tasks. We also show that, as\nexpected, the method quickly learns discriminative word embeddings.

The necessity for a coupling\ncoefficient in the form of a small fractional power of rho is empirical and the\npower often chosen arbitrarily. Consequently, precision-oriented\nparameterisations risk overfitting and loss of predictive power.\n  Observing that the Fermi momentum kF~rho^1/3 is a key variable in Fermi\nsystems, we examine if a power hierarchy in kF can be inferred from the\nproperties of homogeneous matter in a domain of densities which is relevant for\nnuclear structure and neutron stars. For later applications we want to\ndetermine an EDF that is of good quality but not overtrained.

Two cases in which the squeezed vacuum is generated by degenerated\nand non-degenerate parametric oscillators (DPO and NDPO) are considered. We\nfind that for the case of finite bandwidth squeezed vacuum injection, the two\nspectra exhibit unique features, which strongly differ from those of broadband\nsqueezing excitation. In particular, the spectra exhibit a three-peaked and a\nfour-peaked structure, respectively, for the squeezing injection from DPO and\nNDPO. Besides, some anomalous characteristics of the spectra such as\nsqueezing-induced pimple, hole burning, and dispersive profile are found to be\nhighly sensitive to the squeezing parameters and the temperature of the mirror.\nWe also evaluate the mean-square fluctuations in position and momentum\nquadratures of the movable mirror and analyze the influence of the squeezing\nparameters of the input field on the mechanical squeezing. It will be shown\nthat the parameters of driven squeezed vacuum affects the squeezing. We find\nthe optimal mechanical squeezing is achievable via finite bandwidth squeezed\nvacuum injection which is affected by the intensity of squeezed vacuum. We also\nshow that the phase of incident squeezed vacuum determines whether position or\nmomentum squeezing occurs.

The model describes both\nthe strategic phase associated to the planning of the flight trajectories and\nthe tactical modifications occurring in the en-route phase. An implementation\nof the model is available as open-source and freely accessible by any user.\n  More specifically, different procedures related to business trajectories and\nfree-routing are tested and we illustrate the capabilities of the model on\nairspace implementing these concepts. After performing numerical simulations\nwith the model, we show that in a free-routing scenario the controllers perform\nless operations although they are dispersed over a larger portion of the\nairspace. This can potentially increase the complexity of conflict detection\nand resolution for controllers.\n  In order to investigate this specific aspect, we consider some metrics used\nto measure traffic complexity. We first show that in non-free-routing\nsituations our simulator deals with complexity in a way similar to what humans\nwould do. This allows us to be confident that the results of our numerical\nsimulations relative to the free-routing can reasonably forecast how human\ncontrollers would behave in this new situation. Specifically, our numerical\nsimulations show that most of the complexity metrics decrease with\nfree-routing, while the few metrics which increase are all linked to the flight\nlevel changes. This is a non-trivial result since intuitively the complexity\nshould increase with free-routing because of problematic geometries and more\ndispersed conflicts over the airspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 08:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}

We suggest that these are direct consequences of the galaxy\nbeing acted upon by a torque which causes a change in its primordial spin\nangular momentum first observed as changes in the gas kinematics or\ndistribution. We suggest that this torque is exerted by the gravitational force\nbetween nearby galaxies. This origin requires the presence of at least one\ncompanion galaxy in the vicinity - we find a companion galaxy within 750 kpc\nfor 51/57 counter-rotating galaxies and literature indicates that all ring\ngalaxies have a companion galaxy thus giving observable credence to this\norigin. Moreover in these 51 galaxies, we find a kinematic offset between\nstellar and gas heliocentric velocities $>50$ kms$^{-1}$ for several galaxies\nif the separation between the galaxies $<$ 100 kpc. This, we suggest, indicates\na change in the orbital angular momentum of the torqued galaxies. A major\ndifference between the torque origin suggested here and the existing model of\ngas accretion/galaxy collision, generally used to explain the above two\nphenomena, is that the torque acts on the matter of the same galaxy whereas in\nthe latter case gas, with different properties, is brought in from outside. An\nimportant implication of our study is that mutual gravity torques acting on the\ngalaxy can explain the formation of warps, polar ring galaxies and lenticular\ngalaxies. We conclude that mutual gravity torques play an important role in the\ndynamical evolution of galaxies and that they naturally explain several galaxy\nobservables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 08:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

These are stationary, asymptotically flat black hole (BH) spacetimes,\nthat are solutions of General Relativity minimally coupled to a massive,\ncomplex scalar field: Kerr BHs with scalar hair (KBHsSH). Such BHs bifurcate\nfrom the vacuum Kerr solution and can be regarded as a horizon within a\nrotating boson star. In a recent letter, it was shown that KBHsSH can exhibit\nvery distinct shadows from the ones of their vacuum counterparts. The setup\ntherein, however, considered the light source to be a celestial sphere\nsufficiently far away from the BH. Here, we analyse KBHsSH surrounded by an\nemitting torus of matter, simulating a more realistic astrophysical\nenvironment, and study the corresponding lensing of light as seen by a very far\naway observer, to appropriately model ground-based observations of Sgr A*. We\nfind that the differences in imaging between KBHsSH and comparable vacuum Kerr\nBHs remain, albeit less dramatic than those observed for the corresponding\nshadows in the previous setup. In particular, we highlight two observables that\nmight allow differentiating KBHsSH and Kerr BHs. The first is the angular size\nof the photon ring (in a Kerr spacetime) or lensing ring (in a KBHSH\nspacetime), the latter being significantly smaller for sufficiently\nnon-Kerr-like spacetimes. The second is the existence of an edge in the\nintensity distribution (the photon ring in Kerr spacetime). This edge can\ndisappear for very non-Kerr-like KBHsSH. It is plausible, therefore, that\nsufficiently precise Very Long Baseline Interferometric observations of BH\ncandidates can constrain this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 08:33:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 12:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

The framework is based on the\ndynamics of independent filaments and on their statistical behaviour and can be\nused to rigorously understand the mechanisms that lead to the non-exponential\nnature of the radial SOL profiles as well as the increase of the relative\nfluctuation amplitude in the far SOL. Several models for the dynamics of the\nfilaments, which can be applied to the framework, are derived and discussed for\nthe purpose of identifying how different assumptions lead to the emergence of\nfeatures in the profiles. It is found that multiple alternative models can\nexplain the observations, thus motivating more stringent and focused\nexperimental analysis. In particular, radially accelerating filaments, less\nefficient parallel exhaust and also a statistical distribution of the velocity\nof the filaments can all contribute to induce flatter profiles in the far SOL.\nA quite general result is the resiliency of the non-exponential nature of the\nprofiles. At the same time, several of the models discussed can also capture\nthe increase of the relative fluctuation amplitude observed in the far SOL. It\nis also shown that several scenarios are compatible with the broadening of the\nSOL, which could be caused by charge exchange interactions with neutral\nparticles or by a significant radial acceleration of the filaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 09:08:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-24"}

GRBs are considered as the potential alternative to push\nthis limit to as high as $z\\sim 10$, a redshift regime corresponding to an\nepoch when the universe just started to form the first structures. There exist\nseveral correlations between the energy and an observable of a GRB which can be\nused to derive luminosity distance. In recent works, we have studied spectral\nevolution within the individual pulses and obtained such correlations within\nthe pulses. Here we summarize our results of the pulse-wise GRB correlation\nstudy. It is worth mentioning that all GRB correlations are still empirical,\nand we cannot use them in cosmology unless we understand the basic physics of\nGRBs. To this end, we need to investigate the prompt emission spectrum which is\nso far generally described by the empirical Band function. We shall discuss our\ncurrent understanding of the radiation process particularly the finding of two\nblackbodies and a powerlaw (the 2BBPL model) as the generic spectral model and\nits implication.

Finally, we generalize work by\nEsteves and Osserman by associating to each exact level-$\\delta$ limit linear\nseries $\\mathfrak g$ on $X$ a closed subscheme $\\mathbb P(\\mathfrak g)\\subseteq\nX^{(d)}$ of the $d$th symmetric product of $X$, and showing that $\\mathbb\nP(\\mathfrak g)$ is the limit of the spaces of divisors associated to linear\nseries on smooth curves degenerating to $\\mathfrak g$ on $X$, if such\ndegenerations exist. In particular, we describe completely limits of divisors\nalong degenerations to such a curve $X$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 09:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

Negative eigenvalues, obtained by\npartial-transpose (PT) plus local unitary transformations (PTU) for one qubit\nfrom the whole system, are used for indicating inseparability. A sufficient\ncriterion for full separability of the n-qubits and qubit-qudit systems is\ngiven. We use the singular value decomposition (SVD) for improving the\ncriterion for full separability. General properties of entanglement and\nseparability are analyzed for a system of a qubit and a qudit and n-qubits\nsystems, with emphasis on maximally disordered subsystems (MDS) (i.e., density\nmatrices rho(MDS) for which tracing over any subsystem gives the unit density\nmatrix). A sufficient condition that rho(MDS) is not separable is that it has\nan eigenvalue larger than 1/d for a qubit and a qudit, and larger than\n1/2^(n-1) for n-qubits system. The PTU transformation does not change the\neigenvalues of the n-qubits MDS density matrices for odd n. Thus the\nPeres-Horodecki criterion does not give any information about entanglement of\nthese density matrices, but this criterion is useful for indicating\ninseparability for even n.

Five values of the\nwall-to-recovery-temperature ratio ($T_w/T_r$) are considered, corresponding to\ncold, adiabatic and hot wall thermal conditions. We show that the main effect\nof cooling is to decrease the characteristic scales of the interaction in terms\nof upstream influence and extent of the separation bubble.

The distribution of the Stanton number shows that a\nstrong amplification of the heat transfer occurs across the interaction, and\nthe maximum values of thermal and dynamic loads are found in the case of cold\nwall.

Although the\nprobability can be amplified through the amplitude amplification process, the\ninput dependence of the amplitude amplification makes difficult to sequentially\ncombine two or more ancilla based circuits. A new version of the amplitude\namplification known as the oblivious amplitude amplification runs independently\nof the input to the system register. This allow us to to sequentially combine\ntwo or more ancilla based circuits.

Using this ray-tracing inversion\ntechnique, we derive the dust temperature and density structure of six isolated\nstarless cloud cores. We employ self-consistent radiative transfer modeling to\nthe derived density profiles, treating the ISRF as the only heating source. The\nbest-fit values of local strength of the ISRF and the extinction by the outer\nenvelope are derived by comparing the self-consistently calculated temperature\nprofiles with those derived by the ray-tracing method. We find that all\nstarless cores are significantly colder inside than outside, with the core\ntemperatures showing a strong negative correlation with peak column density.\nThis suggests that their thermal structure is dominated by external heating\nfrom the ISRF and shielding by dusty envelopes. The temperature profiles\nderived with the ray-tracing inversion method can be well-reproduced with\nself-consistent radiative transfer models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 11:44:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

In\nparticular, the mass within one Einstein radius can be determined with an\naccuracy of order of a few percent or better, depending on the image\nconfiguration. For other radii, however, degeneracies exist between galaxy\ndensity profiles, precluding an accurate determination of the enclosed mass.\nThe source position transformation (SPT), which includes the well-known\nmass-sheet transformation (MST) as a special case, describes this degeneracy of\nthe lensing observables in a more general way. In this paper we explore\nproperties of an SPT, removing the MST to leading order, i.e., we consider\ndegeneracies which have not been described before. The deflection field\n$\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\alpha}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ resulting from an SPT is not\ncurl-free in general, and thus not a deflection that can be obtained from a\nlensing mass distribution.

The corresponding mass\ndistributions from these 'valid' SPTs are studied: their radial profiles are\nmodified relative to the original mass distribution in a significant and\nnon-trivial way, and originally axi-symmetric mass distributions can obtain a\nfinite ellipticity. These results indicate a significant effect of the SPT on\nquantitative analyses of lens systems. We show that the mass inside the\nEinstein radius of the original mass distribution is conserved by the SPT;\nhence, as is the case for the MST, the SPT does not affect the mass\ndetermination at the Einstein radius.

The Fe K emission is peaked at 6.6 keV\nwith moderate broadening. It is likely to originate from a highly ionized disc\nwith the ionization parameter of log xi ~3. The Fe K line flux responds to the\nmajor flare, supporting its disc origin. There is a short burst of the Fe line\nflux with no relation to the continuum brightness for which we have no clear\nexplanation.

The magnitude (in terms of\norbital variation) and the timing of the instability though (early or late with\nrespect to the dispersal of the gas disk) still remains an open debate. The\nterrestrial planets seem to set a strict constraint: either the giant planet\ninstability happened early, while the terrestrial planets were still forming,\nor the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn had to separate from each other\nimpulsively, with a large enough `jump' in semimajor axis (Brasser et al. 2009;\nKaib and Chambers 2016) for the terrestrial planets to remain stable. Because a\nlarge orbital jump is a low probability event, the early instability hypothesis\nseems to be favored.

These two constraints\nneed to match each other in order to favor one scenario over the other.\nConsidering an initially dynamically cold disk of asteroids, Morbidelli et al.\n(2010) concluded that a comparably large jump is needed to reconstruct the\ncurrent asteroid belt. Here we confirm the same conclusion, but considering an\nasteroid population already strongly excited in eccentricity, such as that\nproduced in the Grand Tack scenario (Walsh et al. 2011). Because the asteroids\nexisted since the time of removal of the gas disk, unlike the terrestrial\nplanets, this constraint on the width of the giant planet jump is valid\nregardless of whether the instability happened early or late.

We have investigated neutral gas in the central cavity of the\ncircumnuclear disk (CND) at the Galactic Center, where the ionized minispiral\nlies, to describe the H2 distribution and properties in this ionized\nenvironment.

The observed field\nof view is 36\"x 29\" , with a spectral resolution R = 1 300 in the\nnear-infrared. These observations cover several H2 lines. To preserve the\nspatial resolution and avoid edge effects, we applied a new line-fitting method\nthat consists of a regularized 3D fitting. We also applied a more classical 1D\nfitting to compare the relative strength of the H2 lines. Results. We present\nhigh spatial and spectral resolution maps of the intensity, velocity, and width\nof five H2 lines and an extinction map derived from H2.

The excitation diagrams allow us to estimate the temperature, mass,\nand density of these features. Conclusions. We interpret the CND emission as\ncoming from a hot, thermalized, thin layer at the surface of the clouds. The\nobserved H2 corresponds only to a small fraction of the total H2 mass. The\nemission remains fairly strong in the whole central cavity, but it is not\nthermalized. A strong deviation from thermal equilibrium is detected near the\nminicavity.

Recent experiments have demonstrated the emergence\nof quantum phenomena such as scattering resonances in the cold collisions\nregime due to quantization of the intermolecular degrees of freedom. Although\nthese states have been shown to be sensitive to interaction details, the effect\nof anisotropy on quantum resonances has eluded experimental observation so far.\nHere, we directly measure the anisotropy in atom-molecule interactions via\nquantum resonances by changing the quantum state of the internal molecular\nrotor. We observe that a quantum scattering resonance at a collision energy of\n$k_B$ x 270 mK appears in the Penning ionization of molecular hydrogen with\nmetastable helium only if the molecule is rotationally excited. We use state of\nthe art ab initio and multichannel quantum molecular dynamics calculations to\nshow that the anisotropy contributes to the effective interaction only for\n$H_2$ molecules in the first excited rotational state, whereas rotationally\nground state $H_2$ interacts purely isotropically with metastable helium.\nControl over the quantum state of the internal molecular rotation allows us to\nswitch the anisotropy on or off and thus disentangle the isotropic and\nanisotropic parts of the interaction.

One of the major\nchallenges lies in the lack of spatial and temporal cues, which makes it\ndifficult to deal with large variations of lighting conditions, viewing angles,\nbody poses and occlusions. Recently, several deep learning based person\nre-identification approaches have been proposed and achieved remarkable\nperformance. However, most of those approaches extract discriminative features\nfrom the whole frame at one glimpse without differentiating various parts of\nthe persons to identify. It is essentially important to examine multiple highly\ndiscriminative local regions of the person images in details through multiple\nglimpses for dealing with the large appearance variance.

The end-to-end CAN learns to selectively focus on parts of\npairs of person images after taking a few glimpses of them and adaptively\ncomparing their appearance. The CAN model is able to learn which parts of\nimages are relevant for discerning persons and automatically integrates\ninformation from different parts to determine whether a pair of images belongs\nto the same person.

Surprisingly, when exponential\ngrowth data is plotted as a simple histogram disregarding the time dimension, a\nremarkable fit to the positively skewed k/x distribution is found, where the\nsmall is numerous and the big is rare. Such quantitative preference for the\nsmall has a corresponding digital preference known as Benford's Law which\npredicts that the first significant digit on the left-most side of numbers in\ntypical real-life data is proportioned between all possible 1 to 9 digits\napproximately as in LOG(1 + 1/digit), so that low digits occur much more\nfrequently than high digits in the first place. Exponential growth series with\nhigh growth rate are nearly perfectly Benford given that plenty of elements are\nconsidered. An additional constraint is that the logarithm of the growth factor\nmust be an irrational number. Since the irrationals vastly outnumber the\nrationals, on the face of it, this constraint seems to constitute the\nexplanation of why almost all growth series are Benford, yet, in reality this\nis all too simplistic, and the real and more complex explanation is provided in\nthis article. Empirical examinations of close to a half a million growth series\nvia computerized programs almost perfectly match the prediction of the\ntheoretical study on rational versus irrational occurrences, thus in a sense\nconfirming both, the empirical work as well as the theoretical study. In\naddition, a rigorous mathematical proof is provided in the continuous growth\ncase showing that it exactly obeys Benford's Law.

Here, we propose a simple solution to these\nissues based on synthetic ferrimagnet (SFM) structures.

Here, we focus on two prototypes\ncalled HD-P2 and THU-strip, both with strips of 27 cm$^2$ length and\nlow-resistive glass electrodes. The HD-P2 prototype has a single-stack\nconfiguration with 8 gaps while the THU-strip prototype is constructed in a\ndouble-stack configuration with 2 $\\times$ 4 gaps.

This saves the effort on analytical\nderivation and coding of stress and tangent modulus, which is time-consuming\nand prone to human errors. Using the one-sided Newton difference quotients, the\nproposed algorithm first perturbs deformation gradients and calculate the\ndifference on strain energy to approximate stress. Then, we perturb again to\nget difference in stress to approximate tangent modulus. Accuracy of the\napproximations were evaluated across the perturbation parameter space, where we\nfind the optimal amount of perturbation being $10^{-6}$ to obtain stress and\n$10^{-4}$ to obtain tangent modulus. Single element verification in ABAQUS with\nNeo-Hookean material resulted in a small stress error of only $7\\times10^{-5}$\non average across uniaxial compression and tension, biaxial tension and simple\nshear situations. A full 3D model with Holzapfel anisotropic material for\nartery inflation generated a small relative error of $4\\times10^{-6}$ for\ninflated radius at $25 kPa$ pressure. Results of the verification tests suggest\nthat the proposed numerical method has good accuracy and convergence\nperformance, therefore a good material implementation algorithm in small scale\nmodels and a useful debugging tool for large scale models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2016 17:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}

We use the extended off-shell ADT current to define quasi-local\nconserved charges such that they are conserved for Killing vectors and\nasymptotically Killing vectors which depend on dynamical fields of the\nconsidered theory. We apply this formalism to the Generalized Minimal Massive\nGravity( GMMG) and obtain conserved charges of a spacetime which describes near\nhorizon geometry of non-extremal black holes. Eventually, we find the algebra\nof conserved charges in Fourier modes. It is interesting that, similar to the\nEinstein gravity in the presence of negative cosmological constant, for the\nGMMG model also we obtain the Heisenberg algebra as the near horizon symmetry\nalgebra of the black flower solutions. Also the vacuum state and all\ndescendants of the vacuum have the same energy.

Instead, smaller numbers are\nfavoured by nature in accordance with a logarithmic distribution law, which is\nreferred to as Benford's law. The existence and applicability of this empirical\nlaw have been extensively studied by physicists, accountants, computer\nscientists, mathematicians, statisticians, etc., and it has been observed that\na large number of data-sets related to diverse problems follow this\ndistribution. However, applicability of Benford's law has been hardly tested\nfor extrasolar objects. Motivated by this fact, this paper investigates the\nexistence of Benford's distribution in the extrasolar world using Kepler data\nfor exoplanets. The investigation has revealed the presence of Benford's\ndistribution in various physical properties of these exoplanets. Further,\nBenford goodness parameters are computed to provide a quantitative measure of\ncoincidence of real data with the ideal values obtained from Benford's\ndistribution. The quantitative analysis and the plots have revealed that\nseveral physical parameters associated with the exoplanets (e.g., mass, volume,\ndensity, orbital semi-major axis, orbital period, and radial velocity) nicely\nfollow Benford's distribution, whereas some physical parameters (e.g., total\nproper motion, stellar age and stellar distance) moderately follow the\ndistribution, and some others (e.g., longitude, radius, and effective\ntemperature) do not follow Benford's distribution. Further, some specific\ncomments have been made on the possible generalizations of the obtained result,\nits potential applications in analyzing data-set of candidate exoplanets, and\nhow interested readers can perform similar investigations on other interesting\ndata-sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2016 18:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

The inclusion of the U-boson\nmay thus allow the existence of the quark degrees of freedom in the interior of\nlarge mass neutron stars. Unlike the consequence of the U-boson in hadronic\nmatter, the stiffening role of the U-boson in the hybrid EOS is not sensitive\nto the choice of the hadron phase models. In addition, we have also\ninvestigated the effect of the effective QCD correction on the hybrid EOS. This\ncorrection may reduce the coupling strength of the U-boson that is needed to\nsatisfy NS maximum mass constraint. While the inclusion of the U-boson also\nincreases the NS radius significantly, we find that appropriate in-medium\neffects of the U-boson may reduce the NS radii significantly, satisfying both\nthe NS radius and mass constraints well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 08:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-07"}
