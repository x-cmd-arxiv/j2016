This\nsuggests that in order to better understand the distinctive properties of\nWilson polynomials and related topics, one should use a function theory that is\nmore natural with respect to the Wilson operator. Inspired by the recent work\nof Halburd and Korhonen, we establish a full-fledged Nevanlinna theory of the\nWilson operator for meromorphic functions of finite order. In particular, we\nprove a Wilson analogue of the lemma on logarithmic derivatives, which helps us\nto derive Wilson operator versions of Nevanlinna's Second Fundamental Theorem,\nsome defect relations and Picard's Theorem.

The symmetric\nbinary liquid mixtures considered cover a variety of densities, a wide range of\ncompressibilities, and various interactions between the unlike particles. The\nstatic quantities studied here encompass the bulk phase diagram (including both\nthe binodal and the $\\lambda$-line), the correlation length, the concentration\nsusceptibility, the compressibility of the finite-sized systems at the bulk\ncritical temperature $T_c$, and the pressure. Concerning the collective\ntransport properties, we focus on the Onsager coefficient and the shear\nviscosity. The critical power-law singularities of these quantities are\nanalyzed in the mixed phase (above $T_c$) and non-universal critical amplitudes\nare extracted. Two universal amplitude ratios are calculated. The first one\ninvolves static amplitudes only and agrees well with the expectations for the\nthree-dimensional Ising universality class. The second ratio includes also\ndynamic critical amplitudes and is related to the Einstein--Kawasaki relation\nfor the interdiffusion constant. Precise estimates of this amplitude ratio are\ndifficult to obtain from MD simulations, but within the error bars our results\nare compatible with theoretical predictions and experimental values for model\nH'.

This type of bias\nis caused by the functional form of the CVI model. For example, the popular\nRand index (RI) exhibits a monotone increasing (NCinc) bias, while the Jaccard\nIndex (JI) index suffers from a monotone decreasing (NCdec) bias. This type of\nbias has been previously recognized in the literature. In this work, we\nidentify a new type of bias arising from the distribution of the ground truth\n(reference) partition against which candidate partitions are compared. We call\nthis new type of bias ground truth (GT) bias. This type of bias occurs if a\nchange in the reference partition causes a change in the bias status (e.g.,\nNCinc, NCdec) of a CVI. For example, NCinc bias in the RI can be changed to\nNCdec bias by skewing the distribution of clusters in the ground truth\npartition. It is important for users to be aware of this new type of biased\nbehaviour, since it may affect the interpretations of CVI results. The\nobjective of this article is to study the empirical and theoretical\nimplications of GT bias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nextensive study of such a property for external cluster validity indices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 17:31:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-21"}

A recent extension of $2 \\times 2$ GRT models (GRTwIND) was developed\nto solve this problem and a conceptually similar problem with the simultaneous\nidentifiability of means and marginal variances in GRT models. Central to the\nability of GRTwIND to solve these problems is the assumption of universal\nperception, which consists of shared perceptual distributions modified by\nattentional and global scaling parameters (Soto et al., 2015). If universal\nperception is valid, GRTwIND solves both issues. In this paper, we show that\nGRTwIND with universal perception and subject-specific failures of decisional\nseparability is mathematically, and thereby empirically, equivalent to a model\nwith decisional separability and failure of universal perception. We then\nprovide a formal proof of the fact that means and marginal variances are not,\nin general, simultaneously identifiable in $2 \\times 2$ GRT models, including\nGRTwIND. These results can be taken to delineate precisely what the assumption\nof universal perception must consist of. Based on these results and related\nrecent mathematical developments in the GRT framework, we propose that, in\naddition to requiring a fixed subset of parameters to determine the location\nand scale of any given GRT model, some subset of parameters must be set in GRT\nmodels to fix the orthogonality of the modeled perceptual dimensions, a central\nconceptual underpinning of the GRT framework.

The intensity profiles of iron and oxygen in Solar Energetic\nParticle (SEP) events often display differences that result in a decreasing\nFe/O ratio over time. The physical mechanisms behind this behaviour are not\nfully understood, but these observational signatures provide important tests of\nphysical modelling efforts. Aims. In this paper we study the propagation of\niron and oxygen SEP ions using a 3D model of propagation which includes the\neffect of guiding centre drift in a Parker spiral magnetic field. We derive\ntime intensity profiles for a variety of observer locations and study the\ntemporal evolution of the Fe/O ratio. Methods. We use a 3D full orbit test\nparticle model which includes scattering. The configuration of the\ninterplanetary magnetic field is a unipolar Parker spiral. Particles are\nreleased instantaneously from a compact region at 2 solar radii and allowed to\npropagate in 3D. Results. Both Fe and O experience significant transport across\nthe magnetic field due to gradient and curvature drifts. We find that Fe ions\ndrift more than O ions due to their larger mass-to-charge ratio, so that an\nobserver that is not magnetically well connected to the source region will\nobserve Fe arriving before O, for particles within the same range in energy per\nnucleon. As a result, for the majority of observer locations, the Fe/O ratio\ndisplays a decrease in time. Conclusions. We conclude that propagation effects\nassociated with drifts produce a decay over time of the Fe/O ratio,\nqualitatively reproducing that observed in SEP event profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 18:01:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 17:20:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

This paper, on the other hand, introduces a novel framework to obtain\ndense depth-map solely from a single LIDAR point cloud; which is a research\ndirection that has been barely explored. The formulation behind the proposed\ndepth-mapping process relies on local spatial interpolation, using\nsliding-window (mask) technique, and on the Bilateral Filter (BF) where the\nvariable of interest, the distance from the sensor, is considered in the\ninterpolation problem. In particular, the BF is conveniently modified to\nperform depth-map upsampling such that the edges (foreground-background\ndiscontinuities) are better preserved by means of a proposed method which\ninfluences the range-based weighting term. Other methods for spatial upsampling\nare discussed, evaluated and compared in terms of different error measures.\nThis paper also researches the role of the mask's size in the performance of\nthe implemented methods.

Based on the two mechanisms of homophily\nand social influence, the classical model for the dissemination of cultures\nproposed by Axelrod predicts the existence of a fragmented regime where\ndifferent cultures can coexist in a social network. However, in such model the\nmulticultural regime is achievable only when a high number of cultural traits\nis present, and is not robust against cultural drift, i.e. the spontaneous\nmutations of agents' traits. In real systems, social influence is inherently\norganised in layers, meaning that individuals tend to diversify their\nconnections according to the topic on which they interact. In this work we show\nthat the observed persistence of multiculturality in real-world social systems\nis a natural consequence of the layered organisation of social influence. We\nfind that the critical number of cultural traits that separates the\nmonocultural and the multicultural regimes depends on the redundancy of\npairwise connections across layers. Surprisingly, for low values of structural\nredundancy the system is always in a multicultural state, independently on the\nnumber of traits, and is robust to the presence of cultural drift. Moreover, we\nshow that layered social influence allows the coexistence of different levels\nof consensus on different topics. The insight obtained from simulations on\nsynthetic graphs are confirmed by the analysis of two real-world social\nnetworks, where the multicultural regime persists even for a very small number\nof cultural traits, suggesting that the layered organisation of social\ninteractions might indeed be at the heart of multicultural societies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 19:52:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 22:48:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-18"}

In the Kerr black hole,\ncomplications arise due to the absence of a global timelike Killing field and\nthe presence of the ergosphere. Nevertheless, it is possible to calculate the\nentropy of a thin shell of matter field in the near-horizon region using the\nbrick wall model. The corresponding leading order entropy of the\nnonsuperradiant modes is found to be proportional to the area of the horizon\nand is logarithmically divergent. Thus, the entropy of a three dimensional\nsystem in the near-horizon region is proportional to the boundary surface. This\nis similar to that of the black hole entropy itself. The corresponding internal\nenergy remains finite if the entropy is chosen to be of the order of the black\nhole entropy itself. For a fixed value of the brick wall cut-off, the leading\norder entropy in the Kerr black hole is found to be half of the corresponding\nterm in the Schwarzschild black hole. This is consistent with the preferential\nemission of particles in the Kerr black hole with azimuthal angular momentum in\nthe same direction as that of the black hole itself. However, we can obtain the\nSchwarzschild case expression by including a subleading term and taking the\nappropriate limit.

Galaxy clusters are continuously growing through the accretion of\nmatter in their outskirts. This process induces inhomogeneities in the gas\ndensity distribution (clumping) which need to be taken into account to recover\nthe physical properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) at large radii. Aims.\nWe studied the thermodynamic properties in the outskirts (R > R500) of the\nmassive galaxy cluster Abell 2142 by combining the Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ)\neffect with the X-ray signal. Methods. We combined the SZ pressure profile\nmeasured by Planck with the XMM-Newton gas density profile to recover radial\nprofiles of temperature, entropy and hydrostatic mass out to 2R500. We used a\nmethod that is insensitive to clumping to recover the gas density, and we\ncompared the results with traditional X-ray measurement techniques. Results.\nWhen taking clumping into account, our joint SZ/X-ray entropy profile is\nconsistent with the predictions from pure gravitational collapse, whereas a\nsignificant entropy flattening is found when the effect of clumping is\nneglected. The hydrostatic mass profile recovered using joint X-ray/SZ data\nagrees with that obtained from spectroscopic X-ray measurements and with mass\nreconstructions obtained through weak lensing and galaxy kinematics.\nConclusions. We found that clumping can explain the entropy flattening observed\nby Suzaku in the outskirts of several clusters. When using a method insensitive\nto clumping for the reconstruction of the gas density, the thermodynamic\nproperties of Abell 2142 are compatible with the assumption that the thermal\ngas pressure sustains gravity and that the entropy is injected at accretion\nshocks, with no need to evoke more exotic physics. Our results highlight the\nneed for X-ray observations with sufficient spatial resolution, and large\ncollecting area, to understand the processes at work in cluster outer regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 20:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

Yet, the full star\nformation and enrichment history of a galaxy can be traced directly only if two\nkey observables can be determined for large stellar samples - age and chemical\ncomposition. While spectroscopy is a powerful method to analyse the detailed\nabundances of stars, stellar ages are the \"missing link in the chain\", since\nthey are not a direct observable. However, spectroscopy should be able to\nestimate stellar masses, which for red giants directly infer ages provided\ntheir chemical composition is known.\n  Here we establish a new empirical relation between the shape of the hydrogen\nline in the observed spectra of red giants and stellar mass determined from\nasteroseismology. The relation allows to determine stellar masses and ages with\nthe accuracy of 10-15%. The method can be used with confidence for stars in the\nfollowing range of stellar parameters: 4000 < Teff < 5000 K, 0.5 < log g < 3.5,\n-2.0 < [Fe/H] < 0.3, and luminosities log L/LSun < 2.5. Our analysis provides\nobservational evidence that the Halpha spectral characteristics of red giant\nstars are tightly correlated with their mass and therefore their age. We also\nshow that the method samples well all stellar populations with ages above 1\nGyr. Targeting bright giants, the method allows to obtain simultaneous age and\nchemical abundance information far deeper than would be possible with\nasteroseismology, extending the possible survey volume to remote regions of the\nMilky Way and even to neighbouring galaxies like Andromeda or the Magellanic\nClouds already with present instrumentation, like VLT and Keck facilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 20:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

The ratchet\nefficiency is nonmonotonic since the ratcheting is enhanced by increased\nactivity but diminished by the onset of self-clustering of the active\nparticles. Increasing the particle density decreases the ratchet efficiency for\nweak substrates but increases the ratchet efficiency for strong substrates due\nto collective hopping events. At the highest particle densities, the ratchet\nmotion is destroyed by a self-jamming effect. We show that it is possible to\nrealize reversals of the ratchet effect, where the net flux of particles is\nalong the hard rather than the easy direction of the substrate asymmetry.

Other things being equal, processing a larger image\ntends to increase throughput, because fractionally less computation is wasted\non the borders of the image.

In\nparallel networks, optimal and equilibrium behavior eventually coincides, but\nthe selfish behavior of the first players has consequences that cannot be\nundone and are paid by all future generations. In more general topologies, our\nmain contributions are three-fold.\n  First, we show that equilibria are usually not unique. In particular, we\nprove that there exists a sequence of networks such that the price of anarchy\nis equal to $n-1$, where $n$ is the number of vertices, and the price of\nstability is equal to 1.\n  Second, we illustrate a new dynamic version of Braess's paradox: the presence\nof initial queues in a network may decrease the long-run costs in equilibrium.\nThis paradox may arise even in networks for which no Braess's paradox was\npreviously known.\n  Third, we propose an extension to model seasonalities by assuming that\ndeparture flows fluctuate periodically over time.

Then, for capacity analysis, we\nuse the exact power consumption that takes into account the electromagnetic\ninteraction between the field and the source.

Multi-label classifiers have to address many problems including:\nhandling large-scale datasets with many instances and a large set of labels,\ncompensating missing label assignments in the training set, considering\ncorrelations between labels, as well as exploiting unlabeled data to improve\nprediction performance. To tackle datasets with a large set of labels,\nembedding-based methods have been proposed which seek to represent the label\nassignments in a low-dimensional space. Many state-of-the-art embedding-based\nmethods use a linear dimensionality reduction to represent the label\nassignments in a low-dimensional space.

The flow model developed is used here to qualitatively answer some\nquestions motivated by observed glacial flow features found on Sputnik Planum.\nWe find that the wavy transverse dark features found along the northern\nshoreline of Sputnik Planum may be a transitory imprint of shallow topography\njust beneath the ice surface suggesting the possibility that a major shoreward\nflow event happened relatively recently within the last few hundred years.\nModel results also support the interpretation that the prominent darkened\nfeatures resembling flow lobes observed along the eastern shoreline of the\nSputnik Planum basin may be a result of wet nitrogen glacial ice flowing into\nthe basin from the pitted highlands of eastern Tombaugh Regio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2016 10:06:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 15:50:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2018 05:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-27"}

On OSNs, a user\nswitches roles constantly between content generator and content receiver. The\ngoals and softgoals are different when the user is generating a post, as\nopposed as replying to a post. In other words, the user is generating instances\nof different entities, depending on the role she has: a generator generates\ninstances of a \"post\", while the receiver generates instances of a \"reply\".\nTherefore, we believe that when addressing Requirements Engineering (RE) for\nRS, it is necessary to distinguish these roles clearly.\n  We aim to model an essential dynamic on OSN, namely that when a user creates\n(posts) content, other users can ignore that content, or themselves start\ngenerating new content in reply, or react to the initial posting. This dynamic\nis key to designing OSNs, because it influences how active users are, and how\nattractive the OSN is for existing, and to new users. We apply a well-known\nGoal Oriented RE (GORE) technique, namely i-star, and show that this language\nfails to capture this dynamic, and thus cannot be used alone to model the\nproblem domain. Hence, in order to represent this dynamic, its relationships to\nother OSNs' requirements, and to capture all relevant information, we suggest\nusing another modelling language, namely Petri Nets, on top of i-star for the\nmodelling of the problem domain. We use Petri Nets because it is a tool that is\nused to simulate the dynamic and concurrent activities of a system and can be\nused by both practitioners and theoreticians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2016 12:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-21"}

Realizing these electronic phases requires preserving the\ndesired transport properties down to a monolayer, which is challenging. Here,\nusing semimetallic $WTe_2$ that exhibits large magnetoresistance, we show that\nsurface oxidation and Fermi level pinning degrade the transport properties of\nthin $WTe_2$ flakes significantly. With decreasing $WTe_2$ flake thickness, we\nobserve a dramatic suppression of the large magnetoresistance. This is\nexplained by fitting a two-band model to the transport data, which shows that\nmobility of the electron and hole carriers decreases significantly for thin\nflakes. The microscopic origin of this mobility decrease is attributed to a ~ 2\nnm-thick amorphous surface oxide layer that introduces disorder. The oxide\nlayer also shifts the Fermi level by ~ 300 meV at the $WTe_2$ surface. However,\nband bending due to this Fermi level shift is not the dominant cause for the\nsuppression of magnetoresistance as the electron and hole carrier densities are\nbalanced down to ~ 13 nm based on the two-band model.

In this paper, the macrocell offloading\nproblem in femtocaching-assisted cellular networks is investigated. The\nobjective is to minimize the number of transmissions by the macrocell base\nstation (MBS) given that all requests should be served simultaneously to\nsatisfy quality-of-experience (QoE) of the clients. We first formulate this MBS\noffloading problem as an optimization problem over a network coding graph, and\nshow that it is NP-hard. Therefore, we propose an ONC-broadcast offloading\nscheme that exploits both broadcasting and opportunistic network coding (ONC)\nto minimize the number of required MBS transmissions. We utilize a random graph\nmodel to approximate the performance of the proposed ONC-broadcast scheme in\nterms of the resultant average number of transmissions by the MBS. Moreover,\ndespite the complexity of finding the optimal solution for each and every case,\nwe prove that this ONC-broadcast scheme is asymptotically optimal, i.e., for\nlarge number of requests, the ONC-broadcast scheme achieves a similar macrocell\noffloading performance to that of the optimal solution. To implement the\nONC-broadcast scheme, we devise a heuristic that employs a dual conflict graph\nor broadcasting at the FCs such that the remaining requests can be served using\nthe minimum number of transmissions at the MBS. Simulations show that the dual\ngraph scheme improves MBS offloading as compared to the traditional separate\ngraph scheme. Furthermore, the simple heuristic proposed to implement the\nONC-broadcast scheme achieves a very close performance to the optimal\nONC-broadcast scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jun 2016 15:36:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-21"}

These\nsuggest that the recoil may not be instantaneous, and that the recoil time\ncould be used to distinguish between them. An experiment is proposed to measure\nthis time. The idea is to use a small sphere whose outer surface is coated with\nan electrically charged M\\\"ossbauer-active element, and then to measure the\namount of energy lost due to Bremmsstrahlung during the recoil of this sphere\nwhen a M\\\"ossbauer event occurs. As the energy radiated is proportional to the\nsquare of the acceleration from Larmor's formula, the amount of energy so\nradiated varies inversely proportional to the recoil time, and proportional to\nthe charge squared. Although this energy is quite small, it can in principle be\nmeasured with the extreme sensitivity available in M\\\"ossbauer experiments. It\nis found that the most information would be gained with more long-lived isomers\nsuch as Rhodium-103m as the M\\\"ossbauer agent, and that correction terms to\nLarmor's formula need to be considered due to the finite radius of a small\nparticle, and some of these corrections are included in the paper. These\ncorrections are taken from the extensive literature on radiating spherical\nshells which were developed to analyze the Abraham-Lorentz model for a\nclassical charged particle. This problem is interesting because a perfectly\nrigid crystal seems to pose questions about relativity, and because the\nM\\\"ossbauer effect is a phenomenon where the solid-state environment\ndramatically influences the probability of a nuclear process. Moreover, if the\nexperiment proposed can measure the recoil time, then such measurements might\nprovide a new class of analytical methods for material science and chemistry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 21:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

Important\nclarifications are achieved regarding, in particular, the concepts of time\nreversal, negative energy, and time-symmetric causality. From this analysis\nemerges an improved understanding of the general-relativistic concept of\nstress-energy of matter as being a manifestation of local variations in the\nenergy density of zero-point vacuum fluctuations. Based on those developments,\na set of axioms is proposed from which are derived generalized gravitational\nfield equations which actually constitute a simplification of relativity theory\nin the presence of negative-energy matter and a non-zero cosmological constant.\nThose results are then applied to provide original solutions to several\nlong-standing problems in cosmology, including the problem of the nature of\ndark matter and dark energy, that of the origin of thermodynamic time\nasymmetry, and several other issues traditionally approached using inflation\ntheory. Finally, we draw on those developments to provide significant new\ninsights into the foundations of quantum theory, regarding, in particular, the\nproblem of quantum non-locality, that of the emergence of time in quantum\ncosmology, as well as the question of the persistence of quasiclassicality\nfollowing decoherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 17:57:23 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2023 03:30:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 16:07:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Jun 2018 00:47:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 22 Oct 2018 18:53:47 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 14:53:25 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 17:38:40 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 10:51:43 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 12:01:50 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 15:50:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-28"}
