The Effective Field Theory of Large\nScale Structure (EFTofLSS) provides an instrument for performing analytical\ncomputations of LSS observables with the required precision in the mildly\nnonlinear regime. In this paper, we develop efficient implementations of these\ncomputations that allow for an exploration of their dependence on cosmological\nparameters. They are based on two ideas. First, once an observable has been\ncomputed with high precision for a reference cosmology, for a new cosmology the\nsame can be easily obtained with comparable precision just by adding the\ndifference in that observable, evaluated with much less precision. Second, most\ncosmologies of interest are sufficiently close to the Planck best-fit cosmology\nthat observables can be obtained from a Taylor expansion around the reference\ncosmology. These ideas are implemented for the matter power spectrum at two\nloops and are released as public codes. When applied to cosmologies that are\nwithin 3$\\sigma$ of the Planck best-fit model, the first method evaluates the\npower spectrum in a few minutes on a laptop, with results that have 1\\% or\nbetter precision, while with the Taylor expansion the same quantity is\ninstantly generated with similar precision.

The hard astromaterial discussed here is a\ncrystalline lattice, such as the Coulomb crystals in the interior of cold white\ndwarfs and in the crust of neutron stars, while the soft astromaterial is\nnuclear pasta found in the inner crusts of neutron stars. In particular, we\ndiscuss how molecular dynamics simulations have been used to calculate the\nproperties of astromaterials to interpret observations of white dwarfs and\nneutron stars. Coulomb crystals are studied to understand how compact stars\nfreeze. Their incredible strength may make crust \"mountains\" on rotating\nneutron stars a source for gravitational waves that the Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) may detect. Nuclear pasta is expected\nnear the base of the neutron star crust at densities of $10^{14}$ g/cm$^3$.\nCompetition between nuclear attraction and Coulomb repulsion rearranges\nneutrons and protons into complex non-spherical shapes such as sheets (lasagna)\nor tubes (spaghetti). Semi-classical molecular dynamics simulations of nuclear\npasta have been used to study these phases and calculate their transport\nproperties such as neutrino opacity, thermal conductivity, and electrical\nconductivity. Observations of neutron stars may be sensitive to these\nproperties, and can be be used to interpret observations of supernova\nneutrinos, magnetic field decay, and crust cooling of accreting neutron stars.\nWe end by comparing nuclear pasta shapes with some similar shapes seen in\nbiological systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2016 00:13:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 18:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

The network is\noptimized by minimizing loss aggregated from all the units, which share model\nparameters while receiving different information to compute attention\nprobability. For training, our model attends to a region within image feature\nmap, updates its memory based on the question and attended image feature, and\nanswers the question based on its memory state. This procedure is performed to\ncompute loss in each step. The motivation of this approach is our observation\nthat multi-step inferences are often required to answer questions while each\nproblem may have a unique desirable number of steps, which is difficult to\nidentify in practice. Hence, we always make the first unit in the network solve\nproblems, but allow it to learn the knowledge from the rest of units by\nbackpropagation unless it degrades the model. To implement this idea, we\nearly-stop training each unit as soon as it starts to overfit. Note that, since\nmore complex models tend to overfit on easier questions quickly, the last\nanswering unit in the unfolded recurrent neural network is typically killed\nfirst while the first one remains last. We make a single-step prediction for a\nnew question using the shared model. This strategy works better than the other\noptions within our framework since the selected model is trained effectively\nfrom all units without overfitting. The proposed algorithm outperforms other\nmulti-step attention based approaches using a single step prediction in VQA\ndataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2016 00:47:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 03:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-03"}

The rapid increase of the availability of\nbig data from various types of mobile devices, such as online query data and\noffline positioning data, provides us with the possibility to develop automatic\nand accurate data-driven prediction models for business store placement. In\nthis paper, we propose a Demand Distribution Driven Store Placement (D3SP)\nframework for business store placement by mining search query data from Baidu\nMaps. D3SP first detects the spatial-temporal distributions of customer demands\non different business services via query data from Baidu Maps, the largest\nonline map search engine in China, and detects the gaps between demand and sup-\nply. Then we determine candidate locations via clustering such gaps. In the\nfinal stage, we solve the location optimization problem by predicting and\nranking the number of customers. We not only deploy supervised regression\nmodels to predict the number of customers, but also learn to rank models to\ndirectly rank the locations. We evaluate our framework on various types of\nbusinesses in real-world cases, and the experiments results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our methods. D3SP as the core function for store placement has\nalready been implemented as a core component of our business analytics platform\nand could be potentially used by chain store merchants on Baidu Nuomi.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2016 03:42:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-14"}

To\nmaximize the sum-throughput of SUs, we present a secondary sum-throughput\noptimal resource allocation (STORA) scheme. Under the constraint of meeting\ntarget primary rate, the STORA scheme chooses the optimal set of relaying SUs\nand jointly performs the time and energy allocation for SUs. Specifically, by\nexploiting the structure of the optimal solution, we find the order in which\nSUs are prioritized to relay primary data. Since the STORA scheme focuses on\nthe sum-throughput, it becomes inconsiderate towards individual SU throughput,\nresulting in low fairness. To enhance fairness, we investigate three resource\nallocation schemes, which are (i) equal time allocation, (ii) minimum\nthroughput maximization, and (iii) proportional time allocation. Simulation\nresults reveal the trade-off between sum-throughput and fairness. The minimum\nthroughput maximization scheme is the fairest one as each SU gets the same\nthroughput, but yields the least SU sum-throughput.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2016 04:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-14"}

(2012) of light echoes from $\\eta$ Carinae has\nprovided important new observational constraints on the nature of its 1840's\nera giant eruption. Spectra of the echoes suggest a relatively cool spectral\ntemperature of about 5500K, lower than the lower limit of about 7000K suggested\nin the optically thick wind outflow analysis of Davidson (1987). This has lead\nto a debate about the viability of this steady wind model relative to\nalternative, explosive scenarios. Here we present an updated analysis of the\nwind outflow model using newer low-temperature opacity tabulations and\naccounting for the stronger mass loss implied by the $>$10 Msun mass now\ninferred for the Homunculus. A major conclusion is that, because of the sharp\ndrop in opacity due to free electron recombination for $T<$6500K, a low\ntemperature of about 5000K is compatible with, and indeed expected from, a wind\nwith the extreme mass loss inferred for the eruption. Within a spherical gray\nmodel in radiative equilibrium, we derive spectral energy distributions for\nvarious assumptions for the opacity variation of the wind, providing a basis\nfor comparisons with observed light echo spectra. The scaling results here are\nalso potentially relevant for other highly optically thick outflows, including\nthose from classical novae, giant eruptions of LBVs and SN Type IIn precursors.\nA broader issue therefore remains whether the complex, variable features\nobserved from such eruptions are better understood in terms of a steady or\nexplosive paradigm, or perhaps a balance of these idealizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2016 08:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

Our\nresults reveal that the existence of vacancy will reduce the bulk modulus,\nwhile enhance the shear and Young's moduli.

To further investigate how the\nclustering of vacancies influences the mechanical properties, the most stable\nconfigurations of di- and trivacancy clusters have been predicted, which\ncorrespond to the most compact distribution of vacancies.

On the one hand, analytical\nsolutions are quite generally expanded into power series of the eccentricity\nand so limited to quasi-circular orbits. On the other hand, the time-dependency\ndue to the motion of the third body (e.g. Moon and Sun) is almost always\nneglected. We propose several tools to overcome these limitations. Firstly, we\nhave expanded the third-body disturbing function into a finite polynomial using\nFourier series in multiple of the satellite's eccentric anomaly (instead of the\nmean anomaly) and involving Hansen-like coefficients. Next, by combining the\nclassical Brouwer-von Zeipel procedure and the time-dependent Lie-Deprit\ntransforms, we have performed a normalization of the expanded Hamiltonian in\norder to eliminate all the periodic terms. One of the benefits is that the\noriginal Brouwer solution for J2 is not modified. The main difficulty lies in\nthe fact that the generating functions of the transformation must be computed\nby solving a partial differential equation, involving derivatives with respect\nto the mean anomaly, which appears implicitly in the perturbation. We present a\nmethod to solve this equation by means of an iterative process. Finally we have\nobtained an analytical tool useful for the mission analysis, allowing to\npropagate the osculating motion of objects on highly elliptical orbits (e>0.6)\nover long periods efficiently with very high accuracy, or to determine initial\nelements or mean elements. Comparisons between the complete solution and the\nnumerical simulations will be presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2016 14:16:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-14"}

In this paper, we propose a general scheme for analyzing\nresource theories based on resource destroying maps, which leave resource-free\nstates unchanged but erase the resource stored in all other states. We\nintroduce a group of general conditions that determine whether a quantum\noperation exhibits typical resource-free properties in relation to a given\nresource destroying map. Our theory reveals fundamental connections among basic\nelements of resource theories, in particular, free states, free operations, and\nresource measures. In particular, we define a class of simple resource measures\nthat can be calculated without optimization, and that are monotone\nnonincreasing under operations that commute with the resource destroying map.\nWe apply our theory to the resources of coherence and quantum correlations\n(e.g., discord), two prominent features of nonclassicality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2016 15:00:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 21:29:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 18:57:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 17:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-16"}

The field is currently undergoing a\nrevolution fuelled by increasing numbers of genetic variants demonstrated to be\nassociated with exposures in genome-wide association studies, and the public\navailability of summarized data on genetic associations with exposures and\noutcomes from large consortia. A Mendelian randomization analysis with many\ngenetic variants can be performed relatively simply using summarized data.\nHowever, a causal interpretation is only assured if each genetic variant\nsatisfies the assumptions of an instrumental variable. To provide some\nprotection against failure of these assumptions, robust methods for\ninstrumental variable analysis have been proposed. Here, we develop three\nextensions to instrumental variable methods using: i) robust regression, ii)\nthe penalization of weights from candidate instruments with heterogeneous\ncausal estimates, and iii) L1 penalization. Results from a wide variety of\nrobust methods, including the recently-proposed MR-Egger and median-based\nmethods, are compared in an extensive simulation study. We demonstrate that two\nmethods, robust regression in an inverse-variance weighted method and a simple\nmedian of the causal estimates from the individual variants, have considerably\nimproved Type 1 error rates compared with conventional methods in a wide\nvariety of scenarios when up to 30% of the genetic variants are invalid\ninstruments. While the MR-Egger method gives unbiased estimates when its\nassumptions are satisfied, these estimates are less efficient than those from\nother methods and are highly sensitive to violations of the assumptions.\nMethods that make different assumptions should be used routinely to assess the\nrobustness of findings from applied Mendelian randomization investigations with\nmultiple genetic variants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2016 15:12:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Aug 2018 13:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-31"}

Different\nfrom two-set matching which can be transformed to a quadratic assignment\nprogramming task that is known NP-hard, inclusion of merely unary attributes\nleads to a linear assignment problem for matching two feature sets. This\nproblem has been well studied and there are effective polynomial global optimum\nsolvers such as the Hungarian method. However, it becomes ill-posed when the\nunary attributes are (heavily) corrupted. The global optimal correspondence\nconcerning the best score defined by the attribute affinity/cost between the\ntwo sets can be distinct to the ground truth correspondence since the score\nfunction is biased by noises. To combat this issue, we devise a method for\nmatching a collection of feature sets by synergetically exploring the\ninformation across the sets.

Under some regularity conditions on $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$, these\neigenvalues are those of the operator $\\rho$^{-1} div($\\sigma$$\\nabla$u) with\nNeumann conditions on the boundary if $\\partial$M = $\\emptyset$.
