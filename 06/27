Both sets of simulations successfully reproduce measured radii,\nmasses, and orbital distances of the planets, except for the radius of Kepler\n11b, which loses its entire gaseous envelope shortly after formation.

Is there any scientific way to understand\nthe origin of this mysterious force that drives the behavior of even the\nstupidest naturally intelligent systems and is completely absent in their\nsmartest artificial analogs? Can we build AI systems that could be curious\nabout something, systems that would have an intrinsic motivation to learn? Is\nsuch a motivation quantifiable? Is it implementable? I will discuss this\nproblem from the standpoint of physics. The relationship between physics and\nintelligence is a consequence of the fact that correctly predicted information\nis nothing but an energy resource, and the process of thinking can be viewed as\na process of accumulating and spending this resource through the acts of\nperception and, respectively, decision making. The natural motivation of any\nautonomous system to keep this accumulation/spending balance as high as\npossible allows one to treat the problem of describing the dynamics of thinking\nprocesses as a resource optimization problem. Here I will propose and discuss a\nsimple theoretical model of such an autonomous system which I call the\nAutonomous Turing Machine (ATM). The potential attractiveness of ATM lies in\nthe fact that it is the model of a self-propelled AI for which the only\navailable energy resource is the information itself. For ATM, the problem of\noptimal thinking, learning, and decision-making becomes conceptually simple and\nmathematically well tractable. This circumstance makes the ATM an ideal\nplayground for studying the dynamics of intelligent behavior and allows one to\nquantify many seemingly unquantifiable features of genuine intelligence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 01:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-28"}

Simulations on synthetic data,\ncompare the proposed methods with competing alternatives, and corroborate their\nefficacy in terms of estimation accuracy over complexity reduction. Finally,\nmonitoring large networks is considered as an application domain, with the\nproposed methods tested on Kronecker graphs to evaluate their efficiency in\ntracking traffic matrices and time-varying link costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 06:30:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2017 21:54:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

G5.89-0.39 comprises two separate HII regions G5.89-0.39A and\nG5.89-0.39B (an ultra-compact HII region).

To maintain the\nmatrix sparse, we would like to minimize the number $k$ of these changes, hence\ncalled the minimum fill-in problem. Agrawal et al.~[FOCS'90] developed the\nfirst approximation algorithm, based on early heuristics by George [SIAM J\nNumer Anal 10] and by Lipton et al.~[SIAM J Numer Anal 16]. The objective\nfunction they used is $m+k$, the number of nonzero elements after elimination.\nAn approximation algorithm using $k$ as the objective function was presented by\nNatanzon et al.~[STOC'98]. These two versions are incomparable in terms of\napproximation.\n  Parameterized algorithms for the problem was first studied by Kaplan et\nal.~[FOCS'94]. Fomin & Villanger [SODA'12] recently gave an algorithm running\nin time $2^{O(\\sqrt{k} \\log k)}+n^{O(1)}$.\n  Hardness results of this problem are surprisingly scarce, and the few known\nones are either weak or have to use nonstandard complexity conjectures. The\nonly inapproximability result by Wu et al.~[IJCAI'15] applies to only the\nobjective function $m+k$, and is grounded on the Small Set Expansion\nConjecture. The only nontrivial parameterized lower bounds, by Bliznets et\nal.~[SODA'16], include a very weak one based on ETH, and a strong one based on\nhardness of subexponential-time approximation of the minimum bisection problem\non regular graphs. For both versions of the problem, we exclude the existence\nof PTASs, assuming P$\\ne$NP, and the existence of $2^{O(n^{1-\\delta})}$-time\napproximation schemes for any positive $\\delta$, assuming ETH. It also implies\na $2^{O(k^{1/2-\\delta})} n^{O(1)}$ parameterized lower bound. Behind these\nresults is a new reduction from vertex cover, which might be of its own\ninterest: All previous reductions for similar problems are from some kind of\ngraph layout problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 07:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-28"}

This requires the introduction of a new definition of the distance\nbetween a point and a general surface, which is compared with the more usual\nvertical distance to the top of the layer. Interfaces are obtained by\nthresholding the enstrophy field and the magnitude of the rate-of-strain\ntensor, and it is concluded that, while the former are physically relevant\nfeatures, the latter are not. By varying the threshold, a topological\ntransition is identified as the interface moves from the free stream into the\nturbulent core. A vorticity scale is defined that collapses that transition for\ndifferent Reynolds numbers, roughly equivalent to the root-mean-squared\nvorticity at the edge of the boundary layer. Conditionally averaged flow\nvariables are analysed as functions of the new distance, both within and\noutside the interface. It is found that the interface contains a nonequilibrium\nlayer whose thickness scales well with the Taylor microscale, enveloping a\nself-similar layer spanning a fixed fraction of the boundary-layer thickness.\nInterestingly, the straining structure of the flow is similar in both regions.\nIrrotational pockets within the turbulent core are also studied. They form a\nself-similar set whose size decreases with increasing depth, presumably due to\nbreak-up by the turbulence, but the rate of viscous diffusion is independent of\nthe pocket size.

Apart\nfrom recording the trajectory data, another major characteristic of these\nlocation-based services is that they also allow the users to connect whomever\nthey like. A combination of social networking and location-based services is\ncalled as location-based social networks (LBSN). As shown in previous works,\nlocations that are frequently visited by socially-related persons tend to be\ncorrelated, which indicates the close association between social connections\nand trajectory behaviors of users in LBSNs. In order to better analyze and mine\nLBSN data, we present a novel neural network model which can joint model both\nsocial networks and mobile trajectories. In specific, our model consists of two\ncomponents: the construction of social networks and the generation of mobile\ntrajectories. We first adopt a network embedding method for the construction of\nsocial networks: a networking representation can be derived for a user. The key\nof our model lies in the component of generating mobile trajectories. We have\nconsidered four factors that influence the generation process of mobile\ntrajectories, namely user visit preference, influence of friends, short-term\nsequential contexts and long-term sequential contexts. To characterize the last\ntwo contexts, we employ the RNN and GRU models to capture the sequential\nrelatedness in mobile trajectories at different levels, i.e., short term or\nlong term. Finally, the two components are tied by sharing the user network\nrepresentations. Experimental results on two important applications demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our model. Especially, the improvement over baselines is\nmore significant when either network structure or trajectory data is sparse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 08:06:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2017 08:02:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-31"}

Under the proposed setup each thread of the\nparallelized application constitutes an independent decision maker (or agent),\nwhich (based on its own prior performance measurements and its own prior\nCPU-affinities) decides on which processing unit to run next. Decisions are\nupdated recursively for each thread by a resource manager/scheduler which runs\nin parallel to the application's threads and periodically records their\nperformances and assigns to them new CPU affinities. For updating the\nCPU-affinities, the scheduler uses a distributed reinforcement-learning\nalgorithm, each branch of which is responsible for assigning a new placement\nstrategy to each thread. According to this algorithm, prior allocations are\ngoing to be reinforced in the future proportionally to their prior performance.\nThe proposed resource allocation framework is flexible enough to address\nalternative optimization criteria, such as maximum average processing speed and\nminimum speed variance among threads. We demonstrate analytically that\nconvergence to locally-optimal placements is achieved asymptotically. Finally,\nwe validate these results through experiments in Linux platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 08:14:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-28"}

The theory suggests that, following an\ninformation scent, the information seeker must optimize the tradeoff between\nexploration by repeated steps in the search space vs. exploitation, using the\nresources encountered. We conjecture that this tradeoff characterizes how a\nuser deals with uncertainty and its two aspects, risk and ambiguity in economic\ntheory. Risk is related to the perceived quality of the actually visited patch\nof information, and can be reduced by exploiting and understanding the patch to\na better extent. Ambiguity, on the other hand, is the opportunity cost of\nhaving higher quality patches elsewhere in the search space. The aforementioned\ntradeoff depends on many attributes, including traits of the user: at the two\nextreme ends of the spectrum, analytic and wholistic searchers employ entirely\ndifferent strategies. The former type focuses on exploitation first,\ninterspersed with bouts of exploration, whereas the latter type prefers to\nexplore the search space first and consume later. Based on an eye-tracking\nstudy of experts' interactions with novel search interfaces in the biomedical\ndomain, we demonstrate that perceived risk shifts the balance between\nexploration and exploitation in either type of users, tilting it against vs. in\nfavour of ambiguity minimization. Since the pattern of behaviour in information\nforaging is quintessentially sequential, risk and ambiguity minimization cannot\nhappen simultaneously, leading to a fundamental limit on how good such a\ntradeoff can be. This in turn connects information seeking with the emergent\nfield of quantum decision theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 08:14:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

In spite\nof the impressive results there are indications that the known sources\nrepresent only the tip of the iceberg. A major step in sensitivity is needed to\nincrease the number of detected sources, observe short time-scale variability\nand improve morphological studies of extended sources. An extended energy\ncoverage is advisable to observe far-away extragalactic objects and improve\nspectral analysis. CTA aims to increase the sensitivity by an order of\nmagnitude compared to current facilities, to extend the accessible gamma-ray\nenergies from a few tens of GeV to a hundred of TeV, and to improve on other\nparameters like angular and energy resolution. CTA will provide moreover a full\nsky-coverage by featuring an array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes\nin both hemispheres. This paper presents an overview of the technical design\nand summarize the current status of the project.

Starting from the model, in which\nthe SO coupling constants are treated as parameters, we show that the\ninter-subband SO interaction strongly affects the ordinary conductance\noscillations predicted for the transistor with the single occupancy.\nInterestingly, we find that even in the absence of the intra-subband SO\ninteraction, the conductance oscillates as a function of the inter-subband SO\ncoupling constant.

Our work, to the best of our knowledge, is the\nfirst to offer an in-depth analysis on semantic homophily in a communication\nnetwork and the interplay between them. We quantify diverse levels of semantic\nhomophily, identify the semantic aspects that are the drivers of observed\nhomophily, show insights in its temporal evolution and finally, we present its\nintricate interplay with the communication network on Twitter. By analyzing\nthese mechanisms we increase understanding on what are the semantic aspects\nthat shape and how they shape the human computer-mediated communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 11:04:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2016 16:47:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 16:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-21"}

It was recently\nshown that the transition from floppy to rigid states as a function of simple\nshear strain is continuous, with hallmark signatures of criticality (Nat. Phys.\n12, 584 (2016)). The nonlinear mechanical response of collagen networks was\nshown to be quantitatively described within the framework of such mechanical\ncritical phenomenon.

Using finite size scaling we\ndemonstrate the divergence of strain fluctuations in the network at\nwell-defined critical strain.

We confirm\nthis prediction experimentally for collagen networks. Moreover, we find that\nthe apparent critical exponents are largely independent of the spatial\ndimensionality.

A recent work has proposed to extract these limits in heavy atoms\nwhere the Higgs term is enhanced by $\\approx 10^3 AZ$, due to both the large\ncoupling modifier and large $A$, $Z$, and assuming sufficiently precise\nrelativistic electron wave functions. We first revisit the old idea of using\nthe Lamb shift in light muonic ions where the coupling is enhanced by about\n$201^3 AZ^3$ primarily due to the concentration of the muon wave function at\nthe origin, the muon coupling modifier already being close to 1. For the muonic\nhelium an experimental precision below 0.1 ppm is required to reach the\nconstraints on Higgs couplings. However, theoretical uncertainty is large due\nto nuclear potential dependence of the finite size terms enhanced by the small\nmuon orbit, and their elimination by using several states is precluded due to\nthe Lamb shift being the only precisely measurable state.

We solve the quantum dynamics of an\noptomechanical system in the multi-photon strong coupling regime retaining\nnonlinear terms. This is achieved by performing a Schrieffer-Wolff\ntransformation on the Hamiltonian including driving terms. The approach is\nvalid away from the red- and blue-sideband drive. We show that the mechanical\nresonator displays self-sustained oscillations in regimes where the linearized\nmodel predicts instabilities, and that the amplitude of these oscillations is\nlimited by the nonlinear terms. Related oscillations of the photon number are\npresent due to frequency mixing of the shifted mechanical and cavity\nfrequencies. This leads to additional peaks in the cavity's power spectral\ndensity. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to create phonon states with\nsub-Poissonian statistics when the system is red-detuned. This result is valid\neven with strong driving and with initial coherent states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 15:14:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

We investigate the consequences of relaxing\nthese constraints on parameters. Using the normal approximation of the\nmultinomial approximation, we derive a new continuous time limit of the USM in\nthe form of a weak-noise stochastic differential equation.

If we increase the size of the network by keeping all the\nother parameters constant, we transition from a state where conventions emerge\nto a state when no convention emerges.

However, as recent events have shown, such\nsystems are vulnerable to cyber attacks. Being safety critical, their\ndisruption or misbehavior can cause economic losses or injuries and loss of\nlife. It is therefore important to secure such networked cyber-physical systems\nagainst attacks. In the absence of credible security guarantees, there will be\nresistance to the proliferation of cyber-physical systems, which are much\nneeded to meet global needs in critical infrastructures and services.\n  This paper addresses the problem of secure control of networked\ncyber-physical systems. This problem is different from the problem of securing\nthe communication network, since cyber-physical systems at their very essence\nneed sensors and actuators that interface with the physical plant, and\nmalicious agents may tamper with sensors or actuators, as recent attacks have\nshown.\n  We consider physical plants that are being controlled by multiple actuators\nand sensors communicating over a network, where some sensors could be\n\"malicious,\" meaning that they may not report the measurements that they\nobserve. We address a general technique by which the actuators can detect the\nactions of malicious sensors in the system, and disable closed-loop control\nbased on their information. This technique, called \"watermarking,\" employs the\ntechnique of actuators injecting private excitation into the system which will\nreveal malicious tampering with signals. We show how such an active defense can\nbe used to secure networked systems of sensors and actuators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 06:06:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

The\nbehavior of the inflation and reheating stages are often known as power law\nexpansion like $ S(\\eta)\\propto \\eta^{1+\\beta}$, $S(\\eta)\\propto\n\\eta^{1+\\beta_s}$ respectively. The $\\beta$ and $\\beta_s$ have an unique effect\non the shape of the spectrum. We find some upper bounds on the $\\beta$ and\n$\\beta_s$ by comparison the usual and the thermal spectrum with the Adv.LIGO\nand Dml. As this result modifies our information about the nature of the\nevolution of inflation and reheating stages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 08:24:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2016 07:33:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-06"}
