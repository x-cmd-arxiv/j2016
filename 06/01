This simulation is characterized by coherent bands of toroidal field\nthat exist within the convection zone, with opposite polarities in the northern\nand southern hemispheres. Throughout most of the cycle, the magnetic helicity\nin these bands is negative in the northern hemisphere and positive in the\nsouthern hemisphere. However, during the declining phase of each cycle, this\nhemispheric rule reverses. We attribute this to a global restructuring of the\nmagnetic topology that is induced by the interaction of the bands across the\nequator. This band interaction appears to be ultimately responsible for, or at\nleast associated with, the decay and subsequent reversal of both the toroidal\nbands and the polar fields. We briefly discuss the implications of these\nresults within the context of solar observations, which also show some\npotential evidence for toroidal band interactions and helicity reversals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 16:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

For compact groups, including finite\ndimensional unitary groups, the well known Lie algebra rank criterion provides\na sufficient and necessary condition for the reachable set to cover the whole\ngroup. Because of the non-compact nature of the symplectic group, which\ncorresponds to Gaussian unitary transformations, this criterion turns out to be\nstill necessary but not sufficient for Gaussian systems.

The HNCO maps are the first interferometric observations of this\nspecies in L1157. The maps show distinct differences in the chemistry within\nthe various shocked regions in L1157B. This is further supported through\nconstraints of the molecular abundances using the non-LTE code RADEX (Van der\nTak et al. 2007). We find the east/west chemical differentiation in C2 may be\nexplained by the contrast of the shock's interaction with either cold, pristine\nmaterial or warm, previously-shocked gas, as seen in enhanced HCN abundances.\nIn addition, the enhancement of the HNCO abundance toward the the older shock,\nB2, suggests the importance of high-temperature O-chemistry in shocked regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 16:38:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-04"}

A key generation strategy for IBFD wireless\ndevices to increase the rate of generated secret keys over multipath fading\nchannels is proposed. Conventionally, due to the half-duplex (HD) constraint on\nwireless transmissions, sensing simultaneous reciprocal channel measurements is\nnot possible, which leads to a degraded key generation rate. However, with the\nadvent of IBFD wireless devices, the legitimate nodes can sense the shared\nwireless link simultaneously at the possible cost of a self-interference (SI)\nchannel estimation and some residual self-interference (RSI).

Many quantum image processing schemes claim that\ntheir efficiency are theoretically higher than their corresponding classical\nschemes.

Observations indicate that Al$_2$O$_3$ condenses at distances of about\n2 stellar radii or less, prior to the formation of silicates. Al$_2$O$_3$\ngrains are therefore prime candidates for producing the scattered light\nobserved in the close vicinity of several M-type AGB stars, and they may be\nseed particles for the condensation of silicates at lower temperatures. We have\nconstructed a new generation of Dynamic Atmosphere & Radiation-driven Wind\nmodels based on Implicit Numerics (DARWIN), including a time-dependent\ntreatment of grain growth & evaporation for both Al$_2$O$_3$ and Fe-free\nsilicates (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$). The equations describing these dust species are\nsolved in the framework of a frequency-dependent radiation-hydrodynamical model\nfor the atmosphere & wind structure, taking pulsation-induced shock waves and\nperiodic luminosity variations into account. Condensation of Al$_2$O$_3$ at the\nclose distances and in the high concentrations implied by observations requires\nhigh transparency of the grains in the visual and near-IR region to avoid\ndestruction by radiative heating. For solar abundances, radiation pressure due\nto Al$_2$O$_3$ is too low to drive a wind. Nevertheless, this dust species may\nhave indirect effects on mass loss. The formation of composite grains with an\nAl$_2$O$_3$ core and a silicate mantle can give grain growth a head start,\nincreasing both mass loss rates and wind velocities. Furthermore, our\nexperimental core-mantle grain models lead to variations of visual and near-IR\ncolors during a pulsation cycle which are in excellent agreement with\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 17:21:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

Physics explanations of this anomaly typically focus on the properties\nof the Universe at the surface of last scattering, relying on the fact that\nlarge-angle temperature fluctuations are dominated by the Sachs-Wolfe effect\n(SW). However, these fluctuations also receive important contributions from the\nintegrated Sachs-Wolfe effect (ISW) at both early (eISW) and late ($\\ell$ISW)\ntimes. Here we study the correlations in those large-angle temperature\nfluctuations and their relative contributions to $S_{1/2}$ -- the standard\nmeasure of the correlations on large angular scales. We find that in the\nbest-fitting $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, while the auto-correlation of the early\ncontributions (SW plus eISW) dominates $S_{1/2}$, there are also significant\ncontributions originating from cross-terms between the early and late\ncontributions. In particular, realizations of $\\Lambda$CDM with low $S_{1/2}$\nare typically produced from a combination of somewhat low pure-early\ncorrelations and accidental cancellations among early-late correlations. We\nalso find that if the pure $\\ell$ISW auto-correlations were the only\ncontribution to $S_{1/2}$ in $\\Lambda$CDM, then the $p$-value of the observed\ncut-sky $S_{1/2}$ would be unremarkable. This suggests that physical mechanisms\noperating only at or near the last scattering surface could explain the\nobserved lack of large-angle correlations, though this is not the typical\nresolution within $\\Lambda$CDM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 17:24:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

A priori $L^p$-estimates, together with classical Schauder theory,\ndeliver global existence of classical solutions for small data on bounded,\nLipschitz domains. For two physically reasonable regularised versions of the\nboundary coupling, we are able to prove global existence of solutions for\narbitrary data.

We show that\nrunning stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in an asynchronous manner can be\nviewed as adding a momentum-like term to the SGD iteration. Our result does not\nassume convexity of the objective function, so it is applicable to deep\nlearning systems. We observe that a standard queuing model of asynchrony\nresults in a form of momentum that is commonly used by deep learning\npractitioners. This forges a link between queuing theory and asynchrony in deep\nlearning systems, which could be useful for systems builders. For convolutional\nneural networks, we experimentally validate that the degree of asynchrony\ndirectly correlates with the momentum, confirming our main result. An important\nimplication is that tuning the momentum parameter is important when considering\ndifferent levels of asynchrony. We assert that properly tuned momentum reduces\nthe number of steps required for convergence. Finally, our theory suggests new\nways of counteracting the adverse effects of asynchrony: a simple mechanism\nlike using negative algorithmic momentum can improve performance under high\nasynchrony. Since asynchronous methods have better hardware efficiency, this\nresult may shed light on when asynchronous execution is more efficient for deep\nlearning systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 19:16:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2016 12:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-28"}

However, the computation of these network motif statistics via naive\nenumeration is infeasible for either its prohibitive computational costs or\naccess restrictions on the full graph data. Methods to estimate the motif\nstatistics based on random walks by sampling only a small fraction of the\nsubgraphs in the large graph address both of these challenges. In this paper,\nwe present a new algorithm, called the Waddling Random Walk (WRW), which\nestimates the concentration of motifs of any size. It derives its name from the\nfact that it sways a little to the left and to the right, thus also sampling\nnodes not directly on the path of the random walk. The WRW algorithm achieves\nits computational efficiency by not trying to enumerate subgraphs around the\nrandom walk but instead using a randomized protocol to sample subgraphs in the\nneighborhood of the nodes visited by the walk. In addition, WRW achieves\nsignificantly higher accuracy (measured by the closeness of its estimate to the\ncorrect value) and higher precision (measured by the low variance in its\nestimations) than the current state-of-the-art algorithms for mining subgraph\nstatistics. We illustrate these advantages in speed, accuracy and precision\nusing simulations on well-known and widely used graph datasets representing\nreal networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 19:22:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 21:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-16"}

The problem\naddressed by the resolution is a lack of established conversion constants\nbetween solar and planetary values and SI units: a missing standard has caused\na proliferation of solar values (e.g., solar radius, solar irradiance, solar\nluminosity, solar effective temperature and solar mass parameter) in the\nliterature, with cited solar values typically based on best estimates at the\ntime of paper writing. As precision of observations increases, a set of\nconsistent values becomes increasingly important. To address this, an IAU\nWorking Group on Nominal Units for Stellar and Planetary Astronomy formed in\n2011, uniting experts from the solar, stellar, planetary, exoplanetary and\nfundamental astronomy, as well as from general standards fields to converge on\noptimal values for nominal conversion constants. The effort resulted in the IAU\n2015 Resolution B3, passed at the IAU General Assembly by a large majority. The\nresolution recommends the use of nominal solar and planetary values, which are\nby definition exact and are expressed in SI units. These nominal values should\nbe understood as conversion factors only, not as the true solar/planetary\nproperties or current best estimates. Authors and journal editors are urged to\njoin in using the standard values set forth by this resolution in future work\nand publications to help minimize further confusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 19:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

Furthermore, the\nversatility of our method opens the possibility of tuning the position, the\nlocalization length and the chirality of the edge modes, through simple\nadjustments of the lattice potentials. In order to demonstrate the unique\ndetectability offered by engineered interfaces, we numerically investigate the\ntime-evolution of wave packets, indicating how topological transport\nunambiguously manifests itself within the lattice. Finally, we analyze the\neffects of disorder on the dynamics of chiral and non-chiral states present in\nthe system. Interestingly, engineered disorder is shown to provide a powerful\ntool for the detection of topological edge modes in cold-atom setups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 20:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-11"}

Past studies of\n$R_{1064}$ neglected the effects of atmospheric opacity and viewing geometry on\nboth active and passive measurements and also identified a potential\ncalibration issue with passive radiometry. Therefore, as yet, there exists no\nacceptable reference $R_{1064}$ to derive a column opacity product for\natmospheric studies and planning future orbital lidar observations.

Over darker surfaces, $R^{M,N}_{1064}$ and the absolute\nlevel of atmospheric opacity were estimated from active sounding. Over all\nsurfaces, the opacity derived from active sounding was used to exclude passive\nradiometry measurements made under opaque conditions and estimate\n$R^{M,N}_{1064}$. These latter estimates then were re-calibrated by comparison\nwith $R^{M,N}$ derived from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations over\nareas of approximately uniform reflectivity. Estimates of $R^{M,N}_{1064}$ from\nre-calibrated passive radiometry typically agree with HST observations within\n10%. The resulting $R^{M,N}_{1064}$ is then used to derive and quantify the\nuncertainties of a column opacity product, which can be applied to\nmeteorological and climatological studies of Mars, particularly to detect and\nmeasure mesoscale cloud/aerosol structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 20:37:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2016 17:32:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 01:29:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

We analyze the\nstandard QS (SQS) method, where the sampling is constrained to active\nconfigurations, the reflecting boundary condition (RBC), where the dynamics\nreturns to the pre-absorbing configuration, and hub reactivation (HR), where\nthe most connected vertex of the network is reactivated after a visit to an\nabsorbing state.

The investigated methods yield the same epidemic threshold for both\nmodels. For CP, that undergoes a standard collective phase transition, the\nmethods are equivalent. For SIS, whose phase transition is ruled by the hub\nmutual reactivation, the SQS and HR methods are able to capture localized\nepidemic phases while RBC is not. We also apply the auto-correlation time as a\ntool to characterize the phase transition and observe that this analysis\nprovides the same finite-size scaling exponents for the critical relaxation\ntime for the investigated methods.

We believe that enabling such idiosyncratic manual\ntransformations in a classical relational database is critical for curation, as\ncuration operations that are easy to declare for individual values can often be\nextremely challenging to generalize. We explore the challenges of enabling\nsingletons in relational databases, propose a hybrid spreadsheet/relational\nnotebook environment for data curation, and present our vision of Vizier, a\nsystem that exposes data curation through such an interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 21:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-02"}

The next\nstage in this quest is the realization of quantum error correction codes, which\nwill mitigate the impact of faulty quantum information on a quantum computer.\nArchitectures with ten or more quantum bits (qubits) have been realized using\ntrapped ions and superconducting circuits. While these implementations are\npotentially scalable, true scalability will require systems engineering to\ncombine quantum and classical hardware. One technology demanding imminent\nefforts is the realization of a suitable wiring method for the control and\nmeasurement of a large number of qubits. In this work, we introduce an\ninterconnect solution for solid-state qubits: The quantum socket. The quantum\nsocket fully exploits the third dimension to connect classical electronics to\nqubits with higher density and better performance than two-dimensional methods\nbased on wire bonding. The quantum socket is based on spring-mounted micro\nwires the three-dimensional wires that push directly on a micro-fabricated\nchip, making electrical contact. A small wire cross section (~1 mmm), nearly\nnon-magnetic components, and functionality at low temperatures make the quantum\nsocket ideal to operate solid-state qubits. The wires have a coaxial geometry\nand operate over a frequency range from DC to 8 GHz, with a contact resistance\nof ~150 mohm, an impedance mismatch of ~10 ohm, and minimal crosstalk. As a\nproof of principle, we fabricated and used a quantum socket to measure\nsuperconducting resonators at a temperature of ~10 mK.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 22:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

In the single skyrmion limit,\nthe skyrmion motion is locked along the driving or longitudinal direction for\nlow drives, while at higher drives a transition occurs to a state in which the\nskyrmion moves both transverse and longitudinal to the driving direction.\nWithin the longitudinally locked phase we find a pronounced speed up effect\nthat occurs when the Magnus force aligns with the external driving force, while\nat the transition to transverse and longitudinal motion, the skyrmion velocity\ndrops, producing negative differential conductivity. For collectively\ninteracting skyrmion assemblies, the speed up effect is still present and we\nobserve a number of distinct dynamical phases, including a sliding smectic\nphase, a disordered or moving liquid phase, a moving hexatic phase, and a\nmoving crystal phase.

The identification of its exciting source has\nremained uncertain over the years. A non-thermal radio source located at the\ncore of the shock structure was proposed to be the exciting source. However,\nVery Large Array studies showed that the radio source has a clear morphology of\nradio galaxy and a lack of flux variations or proper motions, favoring an\nextragalactic origin. Recently, an optical-IR study proposed that this giant HH\nobject is driven by the multiple stellar system V380 Ori, located about 23$'$\nto the SE of HH 222. The exciting sources of HH systems are usually detected as\nweak free-free emitters at centimeter wavelengths. Here we report the detection\nof an elongated radio source associated with the Herbig Be star or with its\nclose infrared companion in the multiple V380 Ori system. This radio source has\nthe characteristics of a thermal radio jet and is aligned with the direction of\nthe giant outflow defined by HH~222 and its suggested counterpart to the SE,\nHH~1041. We propose that this radio jet traces the origin of the large scale HH\noutflow. Assuming that the jet arises from the Herbig Be star, the radio\nluminosity is a few times smaller than the value expected from the\nradio-bolometric correlation for radio jets, confirming that this is a more\nevolved object than those used to establish the correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2016 00:36:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

Driven by buoyancy, a deflagration flame rises in a narrow\ncone towards the surface. For the most part, the flow of the expanding ashes\nremains radial, but upon reaching the outer, low-pressure layers of the white\ndwarf, an additional lateral component develops. This makes the deflagration\nashes converge again at the opposite side, where the compression heats fuel and\na detonation may be launched. To test the GCD explosion model, we perform a 3D\nsimulation for a model with an ignition spot offset near the upper limit of\nwhat is still justifiable, 200 km. This simulation meets our deliberately\noptimistic detonation criteria and we initiate a detonation. The detonation\nburns through the white dwarf and leads to its complete disruption. We\ndetermine nucleosynthetic yields by post-processing 10^6 tracer particles with\na 384 nuclide reaction network and we present multi-band light curves and\ntime-dependent optical spectra. We find that our synthetic observables show a\nprominent viewing-angle sensitivity in UV and blue bands, which is in tension\nwith observed SNe Ia. The strong dependence on viewing-angle is caused by the\nasymmetric distribution of the deflagration ashes in the outer ejecta layers.\nFinally, we perform a comparison of our model to SN 1991T. The overall\nflux-level of the model is slightly too low and the model predicts pre-maximum\nlight spectral features due to Ca, S, and Si that are too strong. Furthermore,\nthe model chemical abundance stratification qualitatively disagrees with recent\nabundance tomography results in two key areas: our model lacks low velocity\nstable Fe and instead has copious amounts of high-velocity 56Ni and stable Fe.\nWe therefore do not find good agreement of the model with SN 1991T.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2016 01:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

It is found that the stability of the system is\nheavily affected by the mirror radius as well as the mass of the scalar\nperturbation, AdS radius and the dimension of space-time. In a higher\ndimensional space-time, the degree of instability of the superradiant modes\nwill be severely weakened. Nevertheless, the degree of instability can be\nmagnified significantly by choosing a suitable value of the mirror radius.\nRemarkably, when the mirror radius is smaller than a threshold value the system\nbecomes stable. We also find that massive charged scalar fields cannot trigger\nthe instabilities in the background of $D$-dimensional asymptotically flat RN\nblack hole. For a given scalar charge, a small RN-AdS black hole can be\nsuperradiantly unstable, while a large one may be always stable under charged\nscalar field with or without a reflecting mirror. We also show that these\nresults can be easily expounded and understood with the help of factorized\npotential analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2016 02:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2016 14:40:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 09:08:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

Our\nalgorithm achieves a regret of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L\\mathrm{poly}(m, \\log K) \\log\nT \\right)$ at time $T$, as compared to $\\mathcal{O}(LK\\log T)$ for conventional\ncontextual bandits, assuming a constant gap between the best arm and the rest\nfor each context. These guarantees are obtained under mild sufficiency\nconditions on the factors that are weaker versions of the well-known\nStatistical RIP condition. We further propose a class of generative models that\nsatisfy our sufficient conditions, and derive a lower bound of\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(Km\\log T\\right)$. These are the first regret guarantees for\nonline matrix completion with bandit feedback, when the rank is greater than\none.

In this paper, we focus on the minimizer\nfunction, and study a group of new regularizer, named self-paced implicit\nregularizer that is deduced from robust loss function. Based on the convex\nconjugacy theory, the minimizer function for self-paced implicit regularizer\ncan be directly learned from the latent loss function, while the analytic form\nof the regularizer can be even known. A general framework (named SPL-IR) for\nSPL is developed accordingly.

Recently the least\nabsolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) has been applied in the\nstatistical and econometric literature. Consis- tency of Lasso has been\nestablished under various conditions, some of which are difficult to verify in\npractice. In this paper, we study model selection from the perspective of\ngeneralization ability, under the framework of structural risk minimization\n(SRM) and Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory. The approach emphasizes the balance\nbetween the in-sample and out-of-sample fit, which can be achieved by using\ncross-validation to select a penalty on model complexity. We show that an exact\nrelationship exists between the generalization ability of a model and model\nselection consistency. By implementing SRM and the VC inequality, we show that\nLasso is L2-consistent for model selection under assumptions similar to those\nimposed on OLS. Furthermore, we derive a probabilistic bound for the distance\nbetween the penalized extremum estimator and the extremum estimator without\npenalty, which is dominated by overfitting. We also propose a new measurement\nof overfitting, GR2, based on generalization ability, that converges to zero if\nmodel selection is consistent. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the\nproposed CV-Lasso algorithm performs well in terms of model selection and\noverfitting control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2016 07:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-02"}

Most\nolivine and enstatite present rare earth element (REE) patterns comparable to\ntheir counterparts in type I chondrules in ordinary chondrites. They thus\nlikely share a similar igneous origin, likely under similar redox conditions.\nThe mesostasis however frequently shows negative Eu and/or Yb (and more rarely\nSm) anomalies, evidently out of equilibrium with olivine and enstatite. We\nsuggest that this reflects crystallization of oldhamite during a sulfidation\nevent, already inferred by others, during which the mesostasis was molten,\nwhere the complementary positive Eu and Yb anomalies exhibited by oldhamite\nwould have possibly arisen due to a divalent state of these elements. Much of\nthis igneous oldhamite would have been expelled from the chondrules, presumably\nby inertial acceleration or surface tension effects, and would have contributed\nto the high abundance of opaque nodules found outside them in EH chondrites. In\ntwo chondrules, olivine and enstatite exhibit negatively sloped REE patterns,\nwhich may be an extreme manifestation of a general phenomenon (possibly linked\nto near-liquidus partitioning) underlying the overabundance of light REE\nobserved in most chondrule silicates relative to equilibrium predictions. The\nsilicate phases in one of these two chondrules show complementary Eu, Yb and Sm\nanomalies providing direct evidence for the postulated occurrence of the\ndivalent state for these elements at some stage in the formation reservoir of\nenstatite chondrites.

We were able to well constrain the lag spectrum with respect to the\nsoftest (0.3--2.3 keV) band: the delay shows increasing lag values reaching a\nmaximum delay of $\\sim$ 12 ms, between 6 and 6.4 keV. After this maximum, the\nvalue of the hard lag drops to 7 ms, followed by a recovery to a plateau at 9\nms for energies above 8 keV. NuSTAR data confirm this trend up to 30 keV, but\nthe measurements are statistically poorer, and therefore, less constraining.\nThe lag-energy pattern up to the discontinuity is well described by a\nlogarithmic function.

The existence of\nsuch quantum-refereed games is discussed, with particular emphasis on how they\nmake it impossible for the parties to cheat. The example of a particular\nquantum-refereed steering game is used to show explicitly how\nmeasurement-device independence is achieved via `quantum programming' of\nuntrusted measurement devices; how cheating is prevented by the steered party\nbeing unable to distinguish sufficiently well between two sets of nonorthogonal\nsignal states; and that cheating remains impossible when one-way communication\nis allowed from the steered party to the unsteered party.

This stems from the\nfollowing two-step paradigm: (i) the factorization of the orbital\n(spin-independent) terms in $f_{\\ell m}$; (ii) the resummation of the residual\nspin (or orbital) factors. We find that resumming the residual spin factor by\ntaking its inverse resummed (iResum) is an efficient way to obtain amplitudes\nthat are more accurate in the strong-field, fast-velocity regime. The\nperformance of the method is illustrated on the $\\ell=2$ and $m=(1,2)$ waveform\nmultipoles, both for a test-mass orbiting around a Kerr black hole and for\ncomparable-mass BBHs. In the first case, the iResum $f_{\\ell m}$'s are much\ncloser to the corresponding \"exact\" functions (obtained solving numerically the\nTeukolsky equation) up to the light-ring, than the nonresummed ones, especially\nwhen the black-hole spin is nearly extremal. The iResum paradigm is also more\nefficient than including higher post-Newtonian terms (up to 20PN order): the\nresummed 5PN information yields per se a rather good numerical/analytical\nagreement at the last-stable-orbit, and a well-controlled behavior up to the\nlight-ring. For comparable mass binaries (including the highest PN-order\ninformation available, 3.5PN), comparing EOB with Numerical Relativity (NR)\ndata shows that the analytical/numerical fractional disagreement at merger,\nwithout NR-calibration of the EOB waveform, is generically reduced by iResum,\nfrom a $40\\%$ of the usual approach to just a few percents. This suggests that\nEOBNR waveform models for coalescing BBHs may be improved using iResum\namplitudes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2016 10:20:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 10:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Using a mosaic of 45 pointings, we have obtained a homogeneous\n1.3mm image of the HUDF, achieving an rms sensitivity of 35 microJy, at a\nresolution of 0.7 arcsec. From an initial list of ~50 >3.5sigma peaks, a\nrigorous analysis confirms 16 sources with flux densities S(1.3) > 120 microJy.\nAll of these have secure galaxy counterparts with robust redshifts (<z> =\n2.15), and 12 are also detected at 6GHz in new deep JVLA imaging.

Astrophysics is no exception since an overwhelming amount of\nmultivariate data has appeared in the last twenty years or so. In particular,\nthe diversification of galaxies throughout the evolution of the Universe quite\nnaturally invokes phylogenetic approaches. We have demonstrated that Maximum\nParsimony brings useful astrophysical results, and we now proceed toward the\nanalyses of large datasets for galaxies. In this talk I present how we solve\nthe major difficulties for this goal: the choice of the parameters, their\ndiscretization, and the analysis of a high number of objects with an\nunsupervised NP-hard classification technique like cladistics. 1. Introduction\nHow do the galaxy form, and when? How did the galaxy evolve and transform\nthemselves to create the diversity we observe? What are the progenitors to\npresent-day galaxies? To answer these big questions, observations throughout\nthe Universe and the physical modelisation are obvious tools. But between\nthese, there is a key process, without which it would be impossible to extract\nsome digestible information from the complexity of these systems. This is\nclassification. One century ago, galaxies were discovered by Hubble. From\nimages obtained in the visible range of wavelengths, he synthetised his\nobservations through the usual process: classification. With only one parameter\n(the shape) that is qualitative and determined with the eye, he found four\ncategories: ellipticals, spirals, barred spirals and irregulars. This is the\nfamous Hubble classification. He later hypothetized relationships between these\nclasses, building the Hubble Tuning Fork. The Hubble classification has been\nrefined, notably by de Vaucouleurs, and is still used as the only global\nclassification of galaxies. Even though the physical relationships proposed by\nHubble are not retained any more, the Hubble Tuning Fork is nearly always used\nto represent the classification of the galaxy diversity under its new name the\nHubble sequence (e.g. Delgado-Serrano, 2012). Its success is impressive and can\nbe understood by its simplicity, even its beauty, and by the many correlations\nfound between the morphology of galaxies and their other properties. And one\nmust admit that there is no alternative up to now, even though both the Hubble\nclassification and diagram have been recognised to be unsatisfactory. Among the\nmost obvious flaws of this classification, one must mention its monovariate,\nqualitative, subjective and old-fashioned nature, as well as the difficulty to\ncharacterise the morphology of distant galaxies. The first two most significant\nmultivariate studies were by Watanabe et al. (1985) and Whitmore (1984). Since\nthe year 2005, the number of studies attempting to go beyond the Hubble\nclassification has increased largely. Why, despite of this, the Hubble\nclassification and its sequence are still alive and no alternative have yet\nemerged (Sandage, 2005)? My feeling is that the results of the multivariate\nanalyses are not easily integrated into a one-century old practice of modeling\nthe observations. In addition, extragalactic objects like galaxies, stellar\nclusters or stars do evolve. Astronomy now provides data on very distant\nobjects, raising the question of the relationships between those and our\npresent day nearby galaxies. Clearly, this is a phylogenetic problem.\nAstrocladistics 1 aims at exploring the use of phylogenetic tools in\nastrophysics (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2006a,b). We have proved that Maximum\nParsimony (or cladistics) can be applied in astrophysics and provides a new\nexploration tool of the data (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2009, 2012, Cardone \\&\nFraix-Burnet, 2013). As far as the classification of galaxies is concerned, a\nlarger number of objects must now be analysed.

These SRCs provide corrections to lepton- nucleus\ncross sections as computed in the impulse approximation (IA). Purpose: We want\nto investigate the influence of SRCs on the one-nucleon (1N) and two-nucleon\n(2N) knockout channel for muon-neutrino induced processes on a $^{12}$C target\nat energies relevant for contemporary measurements. Method: The model adopted\nin this work, corrects the impulse approximation for SRCs by shifting the com-\nplexity induced by the SRCs from the wave functions to the operators. Due to\nthe local character of the SRCs, it is argued that the expansion of these\noperators can be truncated at a low order. Results: The model is compared with\nelectron-scattering data, and two-particle two-hole responses are presented for\nneutrino scattering. The contributions from the vector and axial-vector parts\nof the nuclear current as well as the central, tensor and spin-isospin part of\nthe SRCs are studied. Conclusions: Nuclear SRCs affect the 1N knockout channel\nand give rise to 2N knockout.

While most research in ZSL focuses on\nsingle-label classification, few studies have been done in multi-label ZSL,\nwhere an instance is associated with a set of labels simultaneously, due to the\ndifficulty in modeling complex semantics conveyed by a set of labels. In this\npaper, we propose a novel approach to multi-label ZSL via concept embedding\nlearned from collections of public users' annotations of multimedia. Thanks to\nconcept embedding, multi-label ZSL can be done by efficiently mapping an\ninstance input features onto the concept embedding space in a similar manner\nused in single-label ZSL. Moreover, our semantic learning model is capable of\nembedding an out-of-vocabulary label by inferring its meaning from its\nco-occurring labels. Thus, our approach allows both seen and unseen labels\nduring the concept embedding learning to be used in the aforementioned instance\nmapping, which makes multi-label ZSL more flexible and suitable for real\napplications.

Until the next generation of\ninstruments allow us to push to much higher redshifts, we must rely mostly upon\ntheoretical models of galaxy formation to provide us with key insights into the\nlikely cosmic evolution of HI in the Universe, and its links to molecular\nclouds and star formation. In this work, we present a new set of methods to\nconvert mock galaxy catalogues into synthetic data cubes containing model\ngalaxies with realistic spatial and spectral HI distributions over large\ncosmological volumes. Such synthetic data products can be used to guide\nobserving and data handling/analysis strategies for forthcoming HI galaxy\nsurveys. As a demonstration of the potential use of our simulated products we\nuse them to conduct several mock HI stacking experiments for both low and\nhigh-redshift galaxy samples. The stacked spectra can be accurately decomposed\ninto contributions from target and non-target galaxies, revealing in all\nco-added spectra large fractions of contaminant mass due to source confusion.\nOur results are consistent with similar estimates extrapolated from z=0\nobservational data. The amount of confused mass in a stacked spectrum grows\nalmost linearly with the size of the observational beam, suggesting potential\nover-estimates of Omega_HI by some recent HI stacking experiments. Our\nsimulations will allow the study of subtle redshift-dependent effects in future\nstacking analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2016 13:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-02"}

The coherent perfect absorption (CPA) phenomenon\nextends to the general multibeam interference phenomenology the well known\ncritical coupling concepts. This interferometric control of absorption can be\nemployed to reach full delivery of optical energy to nanoscale systems such as\nplasmonic nanoparticles, and multi-port interference can be used to enhance the\nabsorption of a nanoscale device when it is embedded in a strongly scattering\nsystem, with potential applications to nanoscale sensing. Here we review the\ntwo-port CPA in reference to photonic structures which can resonantly couple to\nthe external fields. A revised two-port theory of CPA is illustrated, which\nrelies on the Scattering Matrix formalism and is valid for all linear two-port\nsystems with reciprocity. Through a semiclassical approach, treating two-port\ncritical coupling conditions in a non-perturbative regime, it is demonstrated\nthat the strong coupling regime and the critical coupling condition can indeed\ncoexist; in this situation, termed strong critical coupling, all the incoming\nenergy is converted into polaritons. Experimental results are presented, which\nclearly display the elliptical trace of absorption as function of input\nunbalance in a thin metallo-dielectric metamaterial, and verify polaritonic CPA\nin an intersubband-polariton photonic-crystal membrane resonator. Concluding\nremarks discuss the future perspectives of CPA with photonic structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2016 14:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-02"}

For two gap superconductors\n2H-NbSe$_{1.8}$S$_{0.2}$ and 2H-NbS$_2$, we find that $\\cal C$ is field\nindependent and has the same value for both bands. We conclude that,\nindependently of the magnetic field induced variation of the order parameter\nvalues in both bands, the spatial variation of the order parameter close to the\nvortex core is the same for all bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2016 14:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-28"}

In addition, weight initialization is very important to train very\ndeep networks. The existing methods laid a solid foundation for networks using\nrectified linear units but not for exponential linear units. This paper\ncomplements the current theory and extends it to the wider range. Specifically,\nwe put forward a way of initialization, enabling training of very deep networks\nusing exponential linear units.

Previous estimates of the\nkinetic energy of the blast waves, based on the X-ray afterglow luminosity\n$L_X$, suggested that this efficiency is large, with values above 90\\% in some\ncases. This poses a problem to emission mechanisms and in particular to the\ninternal shocks model. These estimates are based, however, on the assumption\nthat the X-ray emitting electrons are fast cooling and that their Inverse\nCompton (IC) losses are negligible. The observed correlations between $L_X$\n(and hence the blast wave energy) and $E_{\\gamma\\rm ,iso}$, the isotropic\nequivalent energy in the prompt emission, has been considered as observational\nevidence supporting this analysis. It is reasonable that the prompt gamma-ray\nenergy and the blast wave kinetic energy are correlated and the observed\ncorrelation corroborates, therefore, the notion $L_X$ is indeed a valid proxy\nfor the latter. Recent findings suggest that the magnetic field in the\nafterglow shocks is significantly weaker than was earlier thought and its\nequipartition fraction, $\\epsilon_B$, could be as low as $10^{-4}$ or even\nlower. Motivated by these findings we reconsider the problem, taking now IC\ncooling into account. We find that the observed $L_X-E_{\\gamma\\rm ,iso}$\ncorrelation is recovered also when IC losses are significant. For small\n$\\epsilon_B$ values the blast wave must be more energetic and we find that the\ncorresponding prompt efficiency is significantly smaller than previously\nthought. For example, for $\\epsilon_B\\sim10^{-4}$ we infer a typical prompt\nefficiency of $\\sim15\\%$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2016 14:42:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

The value of $v_{\\rm 2}$ decreases towards more central collisions at\nlow and intermediate $p_{\\rm T}$ (0.5 $<$ $p_{\\rm T}$ $<$ 3 GeV/$c$). The\n$v_{\\rm 2}$ of electrons from heavy-flavour hadron decays at mid-rapidity is\nfound to be similar to the one of muons from heavy-flavour hadron decays at\nforward rapidity (2.5 $<$ $y$ $<$ 4). The results are described within\nuncertainties by model calculations including substantial elastic interactions\nof heavy quarks with an expanding strongly-interacting medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2016 15:07:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2016 19:59:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-04"}

Why it has these properties -- and whether they\nare intended to facilitate language learning -- is matter of contention. We\nargue that much of this disagreement stems from lack of a formal, guiding\ntheory of how phonetic categories should best be taught to infant-like\nlearners. In the absence of such a theory, researchers have relied on\nintuitions about learning to guide the argument. We use a formal theory of\nteaching, validated through experiments in other domains, as the basis for a\ndetailed analysis of whether IDS is well-designed for teaching phonetic\ncategories. Using the theory, we generate ideal data for teaching phonetic\ncategories in English. We qualitatively compare the simulated teaching data\nwith human IDS, finding that the teaching data exhibit many features of IDS,\nincluding some that have been taken as evidence IDS is not for teaching. The\nsimulated data reveal potential pitfalls for experimentalists exploring the\nrole of IDS in language learning. Focusing on different formants and phoneme\nsets leads to different conclusions, and the benefit of the teaching data to\nlearners is not apparent until a sufficient number of examples have been\nprovided. Finally, we investigate transfer of IDS to learning ADS. The teaching\ndata improves classification of ADS data, but only for the learner they were\ngenerated to teach; not universally across all classes of learner.

This completely symmetric representation of the\nparticles makes it necessary to choose another solution of the Dirac equation\nfor the free particle propagator as compared to that currently used in QED. The\nBethe-Salpeter equation is studied in the ladder approximation with using these\nfree propagators. A new branch of electron-positron bound states which\nrepresent the massless composite bosons, have been found for the actual\ncoupling equal to the fine structure constant. We have obtained that: 1) the\nmassless boson states have the normalized complex wave functions; 2) the\naverage distance between the electron and positron diverges as the boson\nkinetic energy goes to zero; 3) the spatial contraction of the wave function of\nthe transverse motion of strongly coupled electron-positron pair is\ncontinuously occurred with increasing the boson kinetic energy. Unlike the\nusual annihilation process in which nothing remains from the electron and\npositron, a similar annihilation-like process in which the reaction products\nare two or three gamma quanta and the massless boson, is predicted. In this\nsymmetric representation one could expect states, which have a certain symmetry\nrelative to Ps states, but have negative masses. For these states the\nequal-time bound-state equation was derived neglecting the interaction\nretardation and interaction through the vector potential. It turned out that\nthe wave functions of the negative mass boson states are not normalized. Beyond\nthese assumptions, the existence of these negative mass states remains unclear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 20:14:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 16:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-21"}

This contradicts our expectation that couple stress theory\nshould predict some size effect for such a deformation pattern. Therefore, this\nresult clearly demonstrates another inconsistency of indeterminate symmetric\nmodified couple stress theory (M-CST), which is based on considering the\nsymmetric torsion tensor as the curvature tensor. On the other hand, the fully\ndeterminate skew-symmetric consistent couple stress theory (C-CST) predicts\nresults for pure plate bending that tend to agree with mechanics intuition and\nexperimental evidence.

This consists of a set of definitions of the same\nconcept made up of a general definition (in this case, one encompassing the\nentire environmental domain) along with additional definitions describing the\nconcept from the perspective of the subdomains in which it is relevant. Since\ncontext is a determining factor in the construction of the meaning of lexical\nunits (including terms), we assume that terminological definitions can, and\nshould, reflect the effects of context, even though definitions have\ntraditionally been treated as the expression of meaning void of any contextual\neffect. The main objective of this thesis is to analyze the effects of\ncontextual variation on specialized environmental concepts with a view to their\nrepresentation in terminological definitions. Specifically, we focused on\ncontextual variation based on thematic restrictions. To accomplish the\nobjectives of this doctoral thesis, we conducted an empirical study consisting\nof the analysis of a set of contextually variable concepts and the creation of\na flexible definition for two of them. As a result of the first part of our\nempirical study, we divided our notion of domain-dependent contextual variation\ninto three different phenomena: modulation, perspectivization and\nsubconceptualization. These phenomena are additive in that all concepts\nexperience modulation, some concepts also undergo perspectivization, and\nfinally, a small number of concepts are additionally subjected to\nsubconceptualization. In the second part, we applied these notions to\nterminological definitions and we presented we presented guidelines on how to\nbuild flexible definitions, from the extraction of knowledge to the actual\nwriting of the definition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2016 09:39:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-22"}

Liquid polyimide (PI) was mixed with\nazodicarbonamide (ADC, ADA) which is a chemical blowing agent (CBA) and mixture\nwas pre-cured in order to fabricate solid PI film. Porous PI was prepared by\nirradiating PI film mixed with azodicarbonamide. The PI film with\nazodicarbonamide was etched by laser ablation, and the CBA was decomposed by\nheat induced by the absorbed laser energy. The higher the laser beam\nirradiation, the more pores were fabricated due to the resulting increase in\nCBA decomposition from 27 mJ/cm2 to 40 mJ/cm2 per single pulse. Higher fluence\nat about 50 mJ/cm2 resulted in fewer and larger open pores, which were formed\nby the coalescence of small pores. In contrast, a closed porous structure was\nfabricated at a fluence of less than 1 mJ/cm2 because PI was barely etched.
