We\nthus introduce a two-step cascaded quantum communication scheme that includes a\nswapping protocol followed by a teleportation protocol. The swapping protocol\nis fed by a general class of tunable non-Gaussian states, the squeezed Bell\nstates, which, by means of controllable free parameters, allows for a\ncontinuous morphing from Gaussian twin beams up to maximally non-Gaussian\nsqueezed number states. In the realistic instance, taking into account the\neffects of losses and imperfections, we show that as the input two-mode\nsqueezing increases, optimized non-Gaussian swapping resources allow for a\nmonotonically increasing enhancement of the fidelity compared to the\ncorresponding Gaussian setting.

In\nthis letter we scrutinise, with high resolution 3D spectral simulations, the\nonset and survival of this instability in the presence of viscous and thermal\nphysics. First, we find that the ZVI is strongly dependent on the nature of the\nviscous operator. Although the ZVI is easily obtained with hyper-diffusion, it\nis difficult to sustain with physical (second order) diffusion operators up to\nReynolds numbers as high as 10^7. This sensitivity is probably due to the ZVI's\nreliance on critical layers, whose characteristic lengthscale, structure, and\ndynamics are controlled by viscous diffusion. Second, we observe that the ZVI\nis sensitive to radiative processes, and indeed only operates when the Peclet\nnumber is greater than a critical value ~10^4, or when the cooling time is\nlonger than ~10 Omega^{-1}. As a consequence, the ZVI struggles to appear at\nR>0.3 AU in standard 0.01 M_sun T Tauri disc models, though younger more\nmassive disks provide a more hospitable environment. Together these results\nquestion the prevalence of the ZVI in protoplanetary discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 16:10:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

For this reason, the surface composition of\nthese objects remains a subject of speculation. Spectra have revealed, however,\nthat the Jupiter Trojan asteroids consist of two distinct sub-populations which\ndiffer in the optical to near-infrared colors. The origins and compositional\ndifferences between the two sub-populations remain unclear. Here we report the\nresults from a 2.2-3.8 $\\mu$m spectral survey of a collection of 16 Jupiter\nTrojan asteroids, divided equally between the two sub-populations. We find\nclear spectral absorption features centered around 3.1 $\\mu$m in the less red\npopulation. Additional absorption consistent with expected from organic\nmaterials might also be present. No such features are see in the red\npopulation. A strong correlation exists between the strength of the 3.1 $\\mu$m\nabsorption feature and the optical to near-infrared color of the objects. While\ntraditionally absorptions such as these in dark asteroids are modeled as being\ndue to fine-grain water frost, we find it physically implausible that the\nspecial circumstances required to create such fine-grained frost would exist on\na substantial fraction of the Jupiter Trojan asteroids. We suggest, instead,\nthat the 3.1 $\\mu$m absorption on Trojans and other dark asteroids could be due\nto N-H stretch features.

In contrast to graphene,\nit has an optical gap of 1.9 eV. This makes it a prominent candidate for\ntransistor and opto-electronic applications. Single-layer MoS$_2$ exhibits\nremarkably different physical properties compared to bulk MoS$_2$ due to the\nabsence of interlayer hybridization.

In this review, we analyze from a theoretical point of view the\nelectronic, optical, and vibrational properties of single-layer, few-layer and\nbulk MoS$_2$. In particular, we focus on the effects of spin-orbit interaction,\nnumber of layers, and applied tensile strain on the vibrational and optical\nproperties.

Voyager\nmeasurements of this ratio at low energies and AMS-2 measurements at high\nenergies are used in this study. These measurements both considerably exceed at\nboth low and high energies the ratio predicted using a simple Leaky Box Model\nfor propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy. Between 1-70 GeV/nuc, however,\nthis same model provides an excellent fit (within +2-3%) to the new AMS-2\nmeasurements using an escape length ~P-0.45. This would imply a diffusion\ncoefficient ~P0.45, very close to the Kraichian cascade value of 0.50 for the\nexponent. Extending this same diffusion dependence to high energies, still in a\nLBM, along with a truncation of short path lengths in the galaxy will predict a\nB/C ratio of 4.5% at ~800 GeV/nuc which is very close to the AMS-2 measurement\nat that energy. This would indicate that the amount of material traversed near\nthe source in a Nested LBM, for example, is less than about 0.5 g/cm2 at these\nenergies since this process, with additional matter near the sources, would\nincrease the B/C ratio.

They are based on a reconstruction procedure\nand the solution of generalized Riemann problems. However, for general boundary\nconditions, in particular of Dirichlet type, a lack of accuracy might occur if\na suitable treatment of boundaries conditions is not properly carried out. In\nthis work the treatment of Dirichlet boundary conditions for conservation laws\nin the context of ADER schemes, is concerned. The solution of generalized\nRiemann problems at the extremes of the computational domain, provides the\ncorrect influence of boundaries. The reconstruction procedure, for data near to\nthe boundaries, demands for information outside the computational domain, which\nis carried out in terms of ghost cells, which are provided by using the\nnumerical solution of auxiliary problems. These auxiliary problems are\nhyperbolic and they are constructed from the conservation laws and the\ninformation at boundaries, which may be partially or totally known in terms of\nprescribed functions. The evolution of these problems, unlike to the usual\nmanner, is done in space rather than in time due to that these problems are\nnamed here, {\\it reverse problems}. The methodology can be considered as a\nnumerical counterpart of the inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure for filling ghost\ncells. However, the use of Taylor series expansions, as well as, Lax-Wendroff\nprocedure, are avoided. For the scalar case is shown that the present procedure\npreserve the accuracy of the scheme which is reinforced with some numerical\nresults. Expected orders of accuracy for solving conservation laws by using the\nproposed strategy at boundaries, are obtained up to fifth-order in both space\nand time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 17:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-10"}

There may not be\nenough information in the gene sequences alone to accurately reconstruct the\ncorrect \"gene tree.\" Although the gene tree may deviate from the \"species tree\"\ndue to a variety of genetic processes, in the absence of evidence to the\ncontrary it is parsimonious to assume that they agree.

Recent studies using simulation and empirical data\nsuggest that a likelihood penalty quantifying concordance with a species tree\ncan significantly improve the accuracy of gene tree reconstruction compared to\nusing sequence data alone. However, the consistency of such an approach has not\nyet been established, nor have convergence rates been bounded.

Quantifying the set of planet masses and orbits that could have been\ndetected will enable more efficient planet discovery and characterization.

The convex relaxation on the Lov\\'{a}sz\nextension, originally presented for the submodular multi-partitioning (Sub-MP)\nproblem, can be extended for the Sub-ML problem, thereby proving that the\nSub-ML (Sup-ML, respectively) can be approximated within a factor of $2 -\n\\frac{2}{k}$ ($\\frac{2}{k}$, respectively).

The feasibility of\nthese methods was investigated by computer simulations, in which the projection\ndata were generated by summing up the Fourier harmonics obtained from the MPI\nsignals based on the Langevin function. Images were reconstructed from the\ngenerated projection data using the filtered backprojection (FBP) method and\nthe ML-EM algorithm. The effects of the gradient of selection magnetic field\n(SMF), the strength of drive magnetic field (DMF), the diameter of magnetic\nnanoparticles (MNPs), and the number of projection data on the image quality of\nthe reconstructed images were investigated. The spatial resolution of the\nreconstructed images became better with increasing gradient of SMF and with\nincreasing diameter of MNPs up to approximately 30 nm. For the diameter greater\nthan approximately 30 nm, the spatial resolution was almost constant. It also\nbecame better with decreasing strength of DMF. The image quality was improved\nby use of the ML-EM algorithm compared to the FBP method, especially when the\nstrength of DMF was weak and the number of projection data was small.

We assume that there are n stations and that at\nmost k<= n stations are active at the same time, i.e, are willing to transmit a\nmessage. If in a certain instant at most d<=k active stations transmit to the\nchannel then their messages are successfully transmitted, whereas if more than\nd active stations transmit simultaneously then their messages are lost. In this\nlatter case we say that a conflict occurs. The present paper investigates\nnon-adaptive conflict resolution algorithms working under the assumption that\nactive stations receive a feedback from the channel that informs them on\nwhether their messages have been successfully transmitted. If a station becomes\naware that its message has been correctly sent over the channel then it becomes\nimmediately inactive. The measure to optimize is the number of time slots\nneeded to solve conflicts among all active stations. The fundamental question\nis whether this measure decreases linearly with the number d of messages that\ncan be simultaneously transmitted with success. We give a positive answer to\nthis question by providing a conflict resolution algorithm that uses a 1/d\nratio of the number of time slots used by the optimal conflict resolution\nalgorithm for the case d=1. Moreover, we derive a lower bound on the number of\ntime slots needed to solve conflicts non-adaptively which is within a log (k/d)\nfactor from the upper bound. To this aim, we introduce a new combinatorial\nstructure that consists in a generalization of Komlos and Greenberg codes.\nConstructions of these new codes are obtained via a new generalization of\nselectors, whereas the non-existential result is implied by a non-existential\nresult for a new generalization of the locally thin families.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2016 06:09:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-13"}

In classical group testing the goal is to\nfind all defectives by using as few tests as possible. We consider a variant of\nclassical group testing in which one is concerned not only with minimizing the\ntotal number of tests but aims also at reducing the number of tests involving\ndefective elements. The rationale behind this search model is that in many\npractical applications the devices used for the tests are subject to\ndeterioration due to exposure to or interaction with the defective elements. In\nthis paper we consider adaptive, non-adaptive and two-stage group testing. For\nall three considered scenarios, we derive upper and lower bounds on the number\nof \"yes\" responses that must be admitted by any strategy performing at most a\ncertain number t of tests. In particular, for the adaptive case we provide an\nalgorithm that uses a number of \"yes\" responses that exceeds the given lower\nbound by a small constant. Interestingly, this bound can be asymptotically\nattained also by our two-stage algorithm, which is a phenomenon analogous to\nthe one occurring in classical group testing. For the non-adaptive scenario we\ngive almost matching upper and lower bounds on the number of \"yes\" responses.\nIn particular, we give two constructions both achieving the same asymptotic\nbound. An interesting feature of one of these constructions is that it is an\nexplicit construction. The bounds for the non-adaptive and the two-stage cases\nfollow from the bounds on the optimal sizes of new variants of d-cover free\nfamilies and (p,d)-cover free families introduced in this paper, which we\nbelieve may be of interest also in other contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2016 06:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-13"}

We investigate how IA\ncorrelations depend on observable galaxy properties such as stellar mass,\napparent magnitude, redshift, and photometric type, and on the employed shape\nmeasurement method. The correlations considered include the matter\ndensity-intrinsic ellipticity (mI), galaxy density-intrinsic ellipticity (dI),\ngravitational shear-intrinsic ellipticity (GI), and intrinsic\nellipticity-intrinsic ellipticity (II) correlations. We find stronger\ncorrelations for more massive and more luminous galaxies, as well as for\nearlier photometric types, in agreement with observations. Moreover, the\ncorrelations significantly depend on the choice of shape estimator, even if\ncalibrated to serve as unbiased shear estimators. In particular, shape\nestimators that down-weight the outer parts of galaxy images produce much\nweaker IA signals on intermediate and large scales than methods employing flat\nradial weights. The expected contribution of intrinsic alignments to the\nobserved ellipticity correlation in tomographic cosmic shear surveys may be\nbelow one percent or several percent of the full signal depending on the\ndetails of the shape measurement method. A comparison of our results to a tidal\nalignment model indicates that such a model is able to reproduce the IA\ncorrelations well on intermediate and large scales, provided the effect of\nvarying galaxy density is correctly taken into account.

Although two-dimensional (2D) materials provide a\nsuperior immunity to Short Channel Effects (SCEs) than bulk materials, they\ncould dominate in scaled GFETs. In this work, we have developed a model that\ncalculates electron and hole transport along the graphene channel in a\ndrift-diffusion basis, while considering the 2D electrostatics. Our model\nobtains the self-consistent solution of the 2D Poisson's equation coupled to\nthe current continuity equation, the latter embedding an appropriate model for\ndrift velocity saturation. We have studied the role played by the\nelectrostatics and the velocity saturation in GFETs with short channel lengths\nL. Severe scaling results in a high degradation of GFET output conductance. The\nextrinsic cutoff frequency follows a 1/L^n scaling trend, where the index n\nfulfills n < 2. The case n = 2 corresponds to long-channel GFETs with low\nsource/drain series resistance, that is, devices where the channel resistance\nis controlling the drain current. For high series resistance, n decreases down\nto n= 1, and it degrades to values of n < 1 because of the SCEs, especially at\nhigh drain bias. The model predicts high maximum oscillation frequencies above\n1 THz for channel lengths below 100 nm, but, in order to obtain these\nfrequencies, it is very important to minimize the gate series resistance.

The quantization of\nthe universe as a dynamical space-time is inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity\nideas. In addition, loop quantum cosmology could bridge contact with\nastronomical observations, and thus potentially investigate quantum cosmology\nmodellings in the light of observations. To do so however, modelling both the\nbackground evolution and its perturbations is needed. The latter describe\ncosmic inhomogeneities that are the main cosmological observables. In this\ncontext, we present the so-called deformed algebra approach implementing the\nquantum corrections to the perturbed universe at an effective level by taking\ngreat care of gauge issues. We particularly highlight that in this framework,\nthe algebra of hypersurface deformation receives quantum corrections, and we\ndiscuss their meaning. The primordial power spectra of scalar and tensor\ninhomogeneities are then presented, assuming initial conditions are set in the\ncontracting phase preceding the quantum bounce and the well-known expanding\nphase of the cosmic history. These spectra are subsequently propagated to\nangular power spectra of the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background.\nIt is then shown that regardless of the choice for the initial conditions\ninside the effective approach for the background evolution (except that they\nare set in the contracting phase), the predicted angular power spectra of the\npolarized B-modes exceed the upper bound currently set by observations. The\nexclusion of this specific version of loop quantum cosmology establishes the\nfalsifiability of the approach, though one shall not conclude here that either\nloop quantum cosmology or loop quantum gravity is excluded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2016 11:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

This work considers the MAP\n(maximum a posteriori) clustering for the Gaussian DPMM (where the cluster\nmeans have Gaussian distribution and, for each cluster, the observations within\nthe cluster have Gaussian distribution).

The CO detection yields (i) a much improved\ndetermination of the CO mole fraction, as 515+/-40 ppm for a 12 ubar surface\npressure (ii) clear evidence for a well-marked temperature decrease (i.e.,\nmesosphere) above the 30-50 km stratopause and a best-determined temperature of\n70+/-2 K at 300 km, in agreement with recent inferences from New Horizons /\nAlice solar occultation data.

The\nobservations suggest variations in this absorber's strength are best explained\nby ionization changes in response to a variable incident continuum.\nPhotoionization simulations constrain the total hydrogen number density of the\nepoch 5 absorber to 7.1<log(n_H/cm^-3)<8.8, the hydrogen column density to\n21.2<log(N_H/cm^-2)<23.3 and the ionization parameter range to -1.9<logU<0.4.\nThe simulations also suggest the absorber is located between 0.03 and 0.49 pc\nfrom the continuum emission region. This range in physical properties is\nconsistent with an absorber of similar velocity seen in NGC 4151 from previous\nultraviolet and optical studies, but with high column density X-ray absorbing\ncomponents not present. The mass outflow rate due to the fifth epoch absorber\nis in the range 0.008 to 0.38 M_sun/yr, too low to contribute to galaxy\nfeedback effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2016 13:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

This 2d-dimensional space naturally captures some of the fundamental\nnonlocality and causal structure inherent in the entanglement of CFT states.\nFor any primary CFT operator, we construct an observable on this space, which\nis defined by smearing the associated one-point function over causal diamonds.\nKnown examples of such quantities are the entanglement entropy of vacuum\nexcitations and its higher spin generalizations. We show that in holographic\nCFTs, these observables are given by suitably defined integrals of dual bulk\nfields over the corresponding Ryu-Takayanagi minimal surfaces. Furthermore, we\nexplain connections to the operator product expansion and the first law of\nentanglement entropy from this unifying point of view. We demonstrate that for\nsmall perturbations of the vacuum, our observables obey linear two-derivative\nequations of motion on the space of causal diamonds. In two dimensions, the\nlatter is given by a product of two copies of a two-dimensional de Sitter\nspace. For a class of universal states, we show that the entanglement entropy\nand its spin-three generalization obey nonlinear equations of motion with local\ninteractions on this moduli space, which can be identified with Liouville and\nToda equations, respectively. This suggests the possibility of extending the\ndefinition of our new observables beyond the linear level more generally and in\nsuch a way that they give rise to new dynamically interacting theories on the\nmoduli space of causal diamonds.

Most of the techniques have been developed after an\nintensive experimental process. It is believed that these techniques exploit\nthe underlying structure of industrial instances. However, there are few works\ntrying to exactly characterize the main features of this structure.\n  The research community on complex networks has developed techniques of\nanalysis and algorithms to study real-world graphs that can be used by the SAT\ncommunity. Recently, there have been some attempts to analyze the structure of\nindustrial SAT instances in terms of complex networks, with the aim of\nexplaining the success of SAT solving techniques, and possibly improving them.\n  In this paper, inspired by the results on complex networks, we study the\ncommunity structure, or modularity, of industrial SAT instances. In a graph\nwith clear community structure, or high modularity, we can find a partition of\nits nodes into communities such that most edges connect variables of the same\ncommunity. In our analysis, we represent SAT instances as graphs, and we show\nthat most application benchmarks are characterized by a high modularity. On the\ncontrary, random SAT instances are closer to the classical Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi\nrandom graph model, where no structure can be observed. We also analyze how\nthis structure evolves by the effects of the execution of a CDCL SAT solver. In\nparticular, we use the community structure to detect that new clauses learned\nby the solver during the search contribute to destroy the original structure of\nthe formula. This is, learned clauses tend to contain variables of distinct\ncommunities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2016 14:02:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2016 21:04:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 21:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-14"}

Group of individuals who are cyclically\nconnected are said to be balanced if the number of negative edges in the cycle\nis even and unbalanced otherwise. In its earliest and most natural formulation,\nthe balance of a social network was thus defined from its simple cycles, cycles\nwhich do not visit any vertex more than once. Because of the inherent\ndifficulty associated with finding such cycles on very large networks, social\nbalance has since then been studied via other means. In this article we present\nthe balance as measured from the simple cycles and primitive orbits of social\nnetworks. We specifically provide two measures of balance: the proportion\n$R_\\ell$ of negative simple cycles of length $\\ell$ for each $\\ell\\leq 20$\nwhich generalises the triangle index, and a ratio $K_\\ell$ which extends the\nrelative signed clustering coefficient introduced by Kunegis. To do so, we use\na Monte Carlo implementation of a novel exact formula for counting the simple\ncycles on any weighted directed graph. Our method is free from the\ndouble-counting problem affecting previous cycle-based approaches, does not\nrequire edge-reciprocity of the underlying network, provides a gray-scale\nmeasure of balance for each cycle length separately and is sufficiently\ntractable that it can be implemented on a standard desktop computer. We observe\nthat social networks exhibit strong inter-edge correlations favouring balanced\nsituations and we determine the corresponding correlation length $\\xi$. For\nlonger simple cycles, $R_\\ell$ undergoes a sharp transition to values expected\nfrom an uncorrelated model. This transition is absent from synthetic random\nnetworks, strongly suggesting that it carries a sociological meaning warranting\nfurther research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2016 14:43:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 15:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-19"}

It is found that\nviscothermal effects can be as important as shear, and therefore including\nshear while neglecting viscothermal effects by solving the linearised Euler\nequations is questionable. In particular, the damping rate of upstream\npropagating waves is found to be dramatically under-predicted by the LEE in\ncertain instances. The effects of viscosity on stability are also found to be\nimportant. Short wavelength disturbances are stabilised by viscosity, greatly\naltering the characteristic wavelength and maximum growth rate of instability.\nFor the parameters typical of aeroacoustic simulations considered here, the\nReynolds number below which the flow stabilizes ranges from $10^5$ to $10^7$.\nBy assuming a thin but nonzero-thickness boundary layer, asymptotic analysis\nleads to a system of boundary layer governing equations for the acoustics.

This\nfar-field neutron interferometry allows for the utilization of the full neutron\nflux for precise measurements of potential gradients, and expands neutron\nphase-contrast imaging techniques to more intense polycromatic neutron beams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2016 01:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

Current PS1 astrometry is\nbased on differential astrometric measurements using 2MASS reference stars,\nthus PS1 astrometry inherits the errors of the 2MASS catalog. The GAS, based on\na single, least squares adjustment to approximately 750k grid stars using over\n3000 extragalactic objects as reference objects, avoids this catalog-to-catalog\npropagation of errors to a great extent. The GAS uses a relatively small number\nof Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSOs, or distant AGN) with very accurate (<1 mas)\nradio positions, referenced to the ICRF2. These QSOs provide a hard constraint\nin the global least squares adjustment. Solving such a system provides absolute\nastrometry for all the stars simultaneously. The concept is much cleaner than\nconventional astrometry but is not easy to perform for large catalogs. In this\npaper we describe our method and its application to Pan-STARRS1 data. We show\nthat large-scale systematic errors are easily corrected but our solution\nresiduals for position (~60 mas) are still larger than expected based on\nsimulations (~10 mas). We provide a likely explanation for the reason the\nsmall-scale residual errors are not corrected in our solution as would be\nexpected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2016 02:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}
