The Bass diffusion\nmodel has been widely used to model the temporal evolution of adoption in such\nsocial systems. In the model, the likelihood of a new adoption is proportional\nto the number of previous adopters, implicitly assuming a global (or\nhomogeneous) interaction among all individuals in the network. Such global\ninteractions do not exist in many large social networks, however. Instead,\nindividuals typically interact with a small part of the larger population. To\nquantify the growth rate (or equivalently the adoption timing) in networks with\nlimited interactions, we study a stochastic adoption process where the\nlikelihood that each individual adopts is proportional to the number of\nadopters among the small group of persons he/she interacts with (and not the\nentire population of adopters). When the underlying network of interactions is\na random $k$-regular graph, we compute the sample path limit of the fraction of\nadopters. We show the limit coincides with the solution of a differential\nequation which can viewed as a generalization of the Bass diffusion model. When\nthe degree $k$ is bounded, we show the adoption curve differs significantly\nfrom the one corresponds to the Bass diffusion model. In particular, the\nadoption grows more slowly than what the Bass model projects. In addition, the\nadoption curve is asymmetric, unlike that of the Bass diffusion model. Such\nasymmetry has important consequences for the estimation of market potential.\nFinally, we calculate the timing of early adoptions at finer scales, e.g.,\nlogarithmic in the population size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2016 16:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-13"}

In WSM, it\nis expected to induce a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (NMR), the\nchiral magnetic effect.Here, we present experimental evidence that the\nobservation of the chiral magnetic effect can be hindered by an effect called\n\"current jetting\". This effect also leads to a strong apparent NMR, but it is\ncharacterized by a highly non-uniform current distribution inside the sample.\nIt appears in materials possessing a large field-induced anisotropy of the\nresistivity tensor, such as almost compensated high-mobility semimetals due to\nthe orbital effect.In case of a non-homogeneous current injection, the\npotential distribution is strongly distorted in the sample.As a consequence, an\nexperimentally measured potential difference is not proportional to the\nintrinsic resistance.Our results on the MR of the WSM candidate materials NbP,\nNbAs, TaAs, TaP exhibit distinct signatures of an inhomogeneous current\ndistribution, such as a field-induced \"zero resistance' and a strong dependence\nof the `measured resistance\" on the position, shape, and type of the voltage\nand current contacts on the sample. A misalignment between the current and the\nmagnetic-field directions can even induce a \"negative resistance\".\nFinite-element simulations of the potential distribution inside the sample,\nusing typical resistance anisotropies, are in good agreement with the\nexperimental findings.

To understand the impact of these\ncharacteristics on the solar chromosphere and coronal dynamics, images from a\nwide wavelength range are needed. In this work we use the 17~GHz radio\ncontinuum, formed in the upper chromosphere and the EUV lines 304 and\n171~{\\AA}, that come from the transition region (He II) and the corona (Fe IX,\nX), respectively. We analyze daily images at 304 and 171~{\\AA} obtained by the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). The 17~GHz maps were obtained by the\nNobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH). To construct synoptic limb charts, we\ncalculated the mean emission of delimited limb areas with 100\" wide and angular\nseparation of $5^\\circ$. At the equatorial region, the results show an\nhemispheric asymmetry of the solar activity. The northern hemisphere dominance\nis coincident with the first sunspot number peak, whereas the second peak\noccurs concurrently with the increase in the activity at the south. The polar\nemission reflects the presence of coronal holes at both EUV wavelengths,\nmoreover, the 17~GHz polar brightenings can be associated with the coronal\nholes. Until 2013, both EUV coronal holes and radio polar brightenings were\nmore predominant at the south pole. Since then they have not been apparent in\nthe north, but thus appear in the beginning of 2015 in the south as observed in\nthe synoptic charts. This work strengthens the association between coronal\nholes and the 17~GHz polar brightenings as it is evident in the synoptic limb\ncharts, in agreement with previous case study papers. The enhancement of the\nradio brightness in coronal holes is explained by the presence of bright\npatches closely associated with the presence of intense unipolar magnetic\nfields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2016 17:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

Specifically, TeamPhone consists of two components: a\nmessaging system and a self-rescue system. The messaging system integrates\ncellular networking, ad-hoc networking and opportunistic networking seamlessly,\nand enables communications among rescue workers. The self-rescue system groups,\nschedules and positions the smartphones of trapped survivors. Such a group of\nsmartphones can cooperatively wake up and send out emergency messages in an\nenergy-efficient manner with their location and position information so as to\nassist rescue operations. We have implemented TeamPhone as a prototype\napplication on the Android platform and deployed it on off-the-shelf\nsmartphones.

We focus on three main classes of systematics: (i) experimental\nsystematic errors in the observed shear; (ii) signal contamination by intrinsic\nalignments; and (iii) systematic effects due to an incorrect modelling of\nnon-linear scales. First, we show that a comprehensive, multi-wavelength\nanalysis provides a self-calibration method for experimental systematic\neffects, only implying <50% increment on the errors on cosmological parameters.\nWe also illustrate how the cross-correlation between radio and optical/near-IR\nsurveys alone is able to remove residual systematics with variance as large as\n0.00001, i.e. the same order of magnitude of the cosmological signal. This also\nopens the possibility of using such a cross-correlation as a means to detect\nunknown experimental systematics. Secondly, we demonstrate that, thanks to\npolarisation information, radio weak lensing surveys will be able to mitigate\ncontamination by intrinsic alignments, in a way similar but fully complementary\nto available self-calibration methods based on position-shear correlations.\nLastly, we illustrate how radio weak lensing experiments, reaching higher\nredshifts than those accessible to optical surveys, will probe dark energy and\nthe growth of cosmic structures in regimes less contaminated by non-linearities\nin the matter perturbations. For instance, the higher-redshift bins of radio\ncatalogues peak at z~0.8-1, whereas their optical/near-IR counterparts are\nlimited to z<0.5-0.7.

Our sample includes 933 galaxies at z~3, 121 of which\nhave very deep spectroscopic observations (>7 hrs) in the rest-UV\n(lambda=850-1300 A) with Keck/LRIS. Based on the high covering fraction of\noutflowing optically-thick HI indicated by the composite spectra of these\ngalaxies, we conclude that photoelectric absorption, rather than dust\nattenuation, dominates the depletion of ionizing photons. By modeling the\ncomposite spectra as the combination of an unattenuated stellar spectrum\nincluding nebular continuum emission with one that is absorbed by HI and\nreddened by a line-of-sight extinction, we derive an empirical relationship\nbetween E(B-V) and fcov(HI). Galaxies with redder UV continua have larger\ncovering fractions of HI characterized by higher line-of-sight extinctions. Our\nresults are consistent with the escape of Lya through gas-free lines-of-sight.\nCovering fractions based on low-ionization interstellar absorption lines\nsystematically underpredict those deduced from the HI lines, suggesting that\nmuch of the outflowing gas may be metal-poor.

These theories capture the quantum\nstatistics and fusion rules of Bogoliubov quasiparticles and vortices and\nincorporate global continuous symmetries - specifically, spin rotation and\nconservation of magnetic flux - present in all singlet superconductors.

A controller observes a random event at the beginning of each renewal\nframe and then chooses an action in response to the event, which affects the\nduration of the frame, the amount of resources used, and a penalty metric. The\ngoal is to make frame-wise decisions so as to minimize the time average penalty\nsubject to time average resource constraints. This problem has applications to\ntask processing and communication in data networks, as well as to certain\nclasses of Markov decision problems.

Temporal periodicity conditions are imposed on ZPF,\nassociated with the way the rotating oscillator observes ZPF. They are similar\nto spatial boundary conditions in Casimir phenomenon and therefore result in\nZPF spectrum change from continuous one to a discrete one and, as a\nconsequence, an effective temperature of the modified ZPF (Y. S. Levin ). The\naverage centripetal average force on the oscillator, originating from this\nmodified ZPF scattered by the oscillator in the near zone, is calculated in\nterms of the bilinear correlation functions of electromagnetic field. After\nrenormalization of the correlation function, which physically means extraction\nof a pure effect of periodicity, the force has a finite value. All calculations\nare carried out using the methodology of stochastic electrodynamics. The radial\ncomponent of the force is directed to the center of rotation. In non\nrelativistic case and for oscillator frequency smaller than rotation frequency,\nthe force turns out to be proportional to the rotation radius. Such result\ncould mean a possibility that micro motion of the oscillator in ZPF sustains\nits average circular motion without any other external forces.Though the\nestimation done for the point-like electron shows that the effect is not\nobservable because the radius of such circular electron motion would have been\nmuch smaller than the classical electron radius when our semi classical\napproach to the electromagnetic problem does not work. It is well expected\nresult and considered as the first step in the application of the idea in the\nquark world governed by non abelian colored fields, subject of the next paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2016 20:24:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-14"}

We\npresent a new calculus for computing the effect of subhalo fly-bys on cold\ntidal streams based on the action-angle representation of streams. The heart of\nthis calculus is a line-of-parallel-angle approach that calculates the\nperturbed distribution function of a given stream segment by undoing the effect\nof all impacts. This approach allows one to compute the perturbed stream\ndensity and track in any coordinate system in minutes for realizations of the\nsubhalo distribution down to 10^5 Msun, accounting for the stream's internal\ndispersion and overlapping impacts. We study the properties of density and\ntrack fluctuations with suites of simulations. The one-dimensional density and\ntrack power spectra along the stream trace the subhalo mass function, with\nhigher-mass subhalos producing power only on large scales, while lower mass\nsubhalos cause structure on smaller scales. The time-dependence of impacts and\nof the evolution of the stream after an impact gives rise to bispectra. We\nfurther find that tidal streams are essentially corrugated sheets in the\npresence of subhalo perturbations: different projections of the track all\nreflect the same pattern of perturbations, facilitating their observational\nmeasurement.

These annihilations will\nproceed in e.g. Galactic subhalos such as dwarf Galaxies or, as recently\npointed out, high velocity clouds such as the \"Smith Cloud\". In this note, we\nfocus on the radio emission associated with DM annihilations into electrons and\npositrons occurring in the Smith Cloud. The phenomenology of this emission is\ndiscussed in quite some detail. We argue that the uncertainties in the\npropagation can be captured by the typical diffusion-loss length parameter\n(Syrovatskii variable) but that the angle-integrated radio fluxes are\nindependent of the propagation. We conclude that if the Smith Cloud is indeed\ndominated by DM, radio signals from DM annihilation stand out amongst other\nmessengers. Furthermore, low frequencies such as the ones observed by e.g. the\nLow Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the next-generation Square Kilometre Array\n(SKA) are optimal for searches for DM in the Smith Cloud. As a practical\napplication, we set conservative constraints on dark matter annihilation cross\nsection using data of continuum radio emission from the Galaxy at 22 MHz and at\n1.4 GHz. Stronger constraints could be reached by background subtraction,\nexploiting the profile and frequency dependence of the putative DM signal.

The code also computes the IBS\nsynchrotron emission pattern, and thus can model black widow X-ray light\ncurves. As a test we apply the results to the high quality asymmetric optical\nlight curves of PSR J2215+5135; the resulting fit gives a substantial\nimprovement upon direct heating models and produces an X-ray light curve\nconsistent with that seen. The IBS model parameters imply that, at the present\nloss rate, the companion evaporation has a characteristic timescale tau_evap\n~150My. Still, the model is not fully satisfactory, indicating additional\nunmodeled physical effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2016 01:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

This paper aims to begin changing that by\npresenting the most essential concepts in robust control using human stick\nbalancing, a simple case study popular in both the sensorimotor control\nliterature and extremely familiar to engineers. With minimal and familiar\nmodels and mathematics, we can explore the impact of unstable poles and zeros,\ndelays, and noise, which can then be easily verified with simple experiments\nusing a standard extensible pointer.

Based on empirical analyses, a\ndiscovery is made that the time series of fractal dimension of urban form can\nbe treated as a sigmoid function of time. Among various sigmoid functions, the\nlogistic function is the most probable selection. However, how to use the model\nof fractal dimension growth to explain and predict urban growth is a pending\nproblem remaining to be solved. This paper is devoted to modeling fractal\ndimension evolution of different types of cities. A interesting discovery is as\nfollows: for the cities in developed countries such as UK, USA and Israel, the\ncomparable fractal dimension values of a city's morphology in different years\ncan be fitted to the logistic function; while for the cities in developing\ncountries such as China, the fractal dimension data of urban form can be fitted\nto a quadratic logistic function. A generalized logistic function is thus\nproposed to model fractal dimension growth of urban form. The logistic model\ncan also be employed to characterize the change of the dimensions of\nmultifractals. The generalized logistic models can be used to predict the\nmissing values of fractal dimension, to estimate the growth rate of the\ndimension, and thus to reveal the spatio-temporal process and pattern of a\ncity's growth. Especially, the models lay a foundation for researching the\ncorrelation between urban form and urbanization and for developing the theory\nof spatial replacement dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2016 03:18:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

The generalized lasso path collects these estimates for a range of\npenalty parameter ({\\lambda}) values. Leveraging a sequential characterization\nof this path from Tibshirani & Taylor (2011), and recent advances in\npost-selection inference from Lee et al. (2016), Tibshirani et al.

For a\nbumpy base made by spheres, at least two factors should be considered to\ncharacterize its geometric roughness, namely the size ratio of base- to\nflow-particles and the packing of base particles. In this paper, we propose a\ndefinition of base roughness, Ra, which is a function of both the size ratio\nand the packing arrangement of base particles. The function is generalized for\nrandom and regular packing of multi-layered spheres, where the range of\npossible values of Ra is studied, along with the optimal values to create\nmaximum base roughness. The new definition is applied to granular flows down\nchute in both two- and three-dimensional configurations. It is proven to be a\ngood indicator of slip condi- tion, and a transition occurs from slip to\nnon-slip condition as Ra increases. Critical values of Ra are identified for\nthe construction of a non-slip base. The effects of contact parameters on base\nvelocity are studied, and it is shown that while the coefficient of friction is\nless influential, normal damping has more profound effect on base velocity at\nlower values of Ra. The application of present definition to other base\ngeometries is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2016 04:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

The challenge, however, due to the high volume and velocity nature of\nsocial media streams, is in how to follow all posts pertaining to a given event\nover time, a task referred to as story detection. Moreover, there are often\nseveral different stories pertaining to a given event, which we refer to as\nsub-stories and the corresponding task of their automatic detection as\nsub-story detection. This paper proposes hierarchical Dirichlet processes\n(HDP), a probabilistic topic model, as an effective method for automatic\nsub-story detection. HDP can learn sub-topics associated with sub-stories which\nenables it to handle subtle variations in sub-stories. It is compared with\nstate- of-the-art story detection approaches based on locality sensitive\nhashing and spectral clustering. We demonstrate the superior performance of HDP\nfor sub-story detection on real world Twitter data sets using various\nevaluation measures. The ability of HDP to learn sub-topics helps it to recall\nthe sub- stories with high precision. Another contribution of this paper is in\ndemonstrating that the conversational structures within the Twitter stream can\nbe used to improve sub-story detection performance significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2016 06:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-14"}

It has been\ndemonstrated that GMP $\\propto$ Y pop $^{\\beta}$ with $\\beta$ always greater\nthan 1 and close to 1.2. This fundamental finding highlights a universal rule\nthat holds across countries and cultures and might explain the very nature of\ncities. However, in an increasingly connected world, the hypothesis that the\neconomy of a city solely depends on its population might be questionable. Using\ndata for 248 cities in the European Union between 2005 and 2010, we found a\ndouble GMP/pop scaling regime. For West EU cities, $\\beta$ = 1 over the whole\nthe period, while for post-communist cities $\\beta >$1 and increases from\n$\\sim$1.2 to $\\sim$1.4. The evolution of the scaling exponent describes the\nconvergence of post-communist European cities to open and liberal economies. We\npropose a simple model of economic convergence in which, under stable political\nconditions, a linear GMP/pop scaling is expected for all cities. The results\nsuggest that the GMP/pop super-linear scaling represents a phase of economic\ngrowth rather than a steady, universal urban feature. The results also suggest\nthat relationships between cities are embedded in their political and economic\ncontext and cannot be neglected in explanations of cities, urbanization and\nurban economics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2016 08:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

In such a model, a\nrouting protocol consists of three components: a transmission policy, a\nscheduling policy to select the packet to transmit form a set of packets parked\nat a node, and a hearing control mechanism to coordinate transmissions with\nscheduling. For such a setting, we propose a definition of universal stability\nthat takes into account not only the scheduling policies (as in the standard\nwireline adversarial model), but also the transmission policies. First, we show\nthat any scheduling policy that is unstable in the classical wireline\nadversarial model remains unstable in the multi-hop radio network model, even\nin scenarios free of inter- ferences. Then, we show that both SIS and LIS (two\nwell-known universally stable scheduling policies in the wireline adversarial\nmodel) remain stable in the multi-hop radio network model, provided a proactive\nhearing control is used. In contrast, such scheduling policies turn out to be\nunstable when using a reactive hearing control. However, the scheduling policy\nLIS can be enforced to be universally stable provided ties are resolved in a\npermanent manner. Such a situation doesn't hold in the case of SIS, which\nremains unstable regardless of how ties are resolved. Furthermore, for some\ntransmission policies which we call regular, we also show that all scheduling\npolicies that are universally stable when using proactive hearing control\n(which include SIS and LIS) remain universally stable when using reactive\nhearing control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2016 08:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

In this paper,\nwe show how a regulator can use information about the financial network to\ndevise a transaction-specific tax based on a network centrality measure that\ncaptures systemic importance. Since different transactions have different\nimpact on creating systemic risk, they are taxed differently. We call this tax\na Systemic Risk Tax (SRT). We use an equilibrium concept inspired by the\nmatching markets literature to show analytically that this SRT induces a unique\nequilibrium matching of lenders and borrowers that is systemic-risk efficient,\ni.e. it minimizes systemic risk given a certain transaction volume.

This allows the regulator to effectively\nstimulate a `rewiring' of the equilibrium interbank network so as to make it\nmore resilient to insolvency cascades, without sacrificing transaction volume.\nMoreover, we show that a standard financial transaction tax (e.g. a Tobin-like\ntax) has no impact on reshaping the equilibrium financial network because it\ntaxes all transactions indiscriminately.

Recursive distinctioning means just what it says. A pattern of\ndistinctions is given in a space based on a graphical structure (such as a line\nof print or a planar lattice or given graph). Each node of the graph is\noccupied by a letter from some arbitrary alphabet. A specialized alphabet is\ngiven that can indicate distinctions about neighbors of a given node. The\nneighbors of a node are all nodes that are connected to the given node by edges\nin the graph. The letters in the specialized alphabet (call it SA) are used to\ndescribe the states of the letters in the given graph and at each stage in the\nrecursion, letters in SA are written at all nodes in the graph, describing its\nprevious state. The recursive structure that results from the iteration of\ndescriptions is called recursive distinctioning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jun 2016 15:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-23"}
