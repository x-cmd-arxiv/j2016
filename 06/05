Ensuring scalability of\nautomated image captioning systems with respect to the ever increasing volume\nof image and video data is a significant challenge. This paper provides a\nvaluable insight in that the detection of a few significant (top) objects in an\nimage allows one to extract other relevant information such as actions (verbs)\nin the image. We expect this insight to be useful in the design of scalable\nimage captioning systems. We address two parameters by which the scalability of\nimage captioning systems could be quantified, i.e., the traditional algorithmic\ntime complexity which is important given the resource limitations of the user\ndevice and the system development time since the programmers' time is a\ncritical resource constraint in many real-world scenarios.

This\ngeometry--mixing two inputs at a sharp intersection point--takes its\ninspiration from Y-shaped combiners in fluid flow systems, where variations in\nthe input pressures can produce at turbulence and mixing at the intersection.\nWhen current is added to or removed from one of the arms (the sense arm), the\nsuperconducting critical current in the other arm (the bias arm) is modulated.\nThe current in the sense arm can thus be determined by measuring the critical\ncurrent of the bias arm. The dependence of the bias critical current on the\nsense current is possible because current crowding causes the sense current to\ninteract locally with the bias arm. Measurement of the critical current in the\nbias arm does not break the superconducting state of the sense arm or of the\nbottom leg, and thus the signal to be sensed is fully restored after the\nmeasurement process.

On a manually annotated test set we\nfound that 82% of generated sentences are correct, an improvement of 10.3% over\nan LSTM baseline. A qualitative analysis shows that this model is not only\ncapable of shortening input sentences, but also inferring new statements via\nparaphrasing and phrase entailment. We then apply this model recursively to\ninput-output pairs, thereby generating natural language inference chains that\ncan be used to automatically construct an entailment graph from source\nsentences. Finally, by swapping source and target sentences we can also train a\nmodel that given an input sentence invents additional information to generate a\nnew sentence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2016 18:34:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}

Methods:\nWe estimated the R0 of the 2015 ZIKV outbreak in Barranquilla, Colombia,\nthrough an analysis of the exponential rise in clinically identified ZIKV cases\n(n = 359 to the end of November, 2015). Findings: The rate of exponential rise\nin cases was rho=0.076 days-1, with 95 percent CI [0.066,0.087] days-1. We used\na vector-borne disease model with additional direct transmission to estimate\nthe R0; assuming the R0 of sexual transmission alone is less than 1, we\nestimated the total R0 = 3.8 [2.4,5.6], and that the fraction of cases due to\nsexual transmission was 0.23 [0.01,0.47] with 95 percent confidence.\nInterpretation: This is among the first estimates of R0 for a ZIKV outbreak in\nthe Americas, and also among the first quantifications of the relative impact\nof sexual transmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2016 22:25:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 17:42:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2017 16:09:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-17"}

Our system, consisting\nof nonlinear amplitude-phase oscillators arranged in a ring topology with\nreactive nearest neighbor coupling, is simple and connects directly to\nexperimental realizations. We seek to understand how the multiple stable\nsynchronized states connect to each other in state space by applying Gaussian\nwhite noise to each of the oscillators' phases. To do this, we first identify a\nset of locally stable limit cycles at any given coupling strength. For each of\nthese attracting states, we analyze the effect of weak noise via the covariance\nmatrix of deviations around those attractors. We then explore the noise-induced\nattractor switching behavior via numerical investigations. For a ring of three\noscillators we find that an attractor-switching event is always accompanied by\nthe crossing of two adjacent oscillators' phases. For larger numbers of\noscillators we find that the distribution of times required to stochastically\nleave a given state falls off exponentially, and we build an attractor\nswitching network out of the destination states as a coarse-grained description\nof the high-dimensional attractor-basin architecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2016 23:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-02"}

However, most of the existing methods for dehazing are designed\nfor daytime images, and cannot always work well in the nighttime. Different\nfrom the imaging conditions in the daytime, images captured in nighttime haze\ncondition may suffer from non-uniform illumination due to artificial light\nsources, which exhibit low brightness/contrast and color distortion. In this\npaper, we present a new nighttime hazy imaging model that takes into account\nboth the non-uniform illumination from artificial light sources and the\nscattering and attenuation effects of haze. Accordingly, we propose an\nefficient dehazing algorithm for nighttime hazy images. The proposed algorithm\nincludes three sequential steps. i) It enhances the overall brightness by\nperforming a gamma correction step after estimating the illumination from the\noriginal image. ii) Then it achieves a color-balance result by performing a\ncolor correction step after estimating the color characteristics of the\nincident light. iii) Finally, it remove the haze effect by applying the dark\nchannel prior and estimating the point-wise environmental light based on the\nprevious illumination-balance result. Experimental results show that the\nproposed algorithm can achieve illumination-balance and haze-free results with\ngood color rendition ability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2016 04:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}

We observed the Frontier Fields cluster Abell S1063 with MUSE\nover a 2 arcmin^2 field, and combined integral-field spectroscopy with\ngravitational lensing to perform a blind search for intrinsically faint Lya\nemitters (LAEs). We determined in total the redshift of 172 galaxies of which\n14 are lensed LAEs at z=3-6.1. We increased the number of\nspectroscopically-confirmed multiple-image families from 6 to 17 and updated\nour gravitational-lensing model accordingly. The lensing-corrected Lya\nluminosities are with L(Lya) <= 10^41.5 erg/s among the lowest for\nspectroscopically confirmed LAEs at any redshift. We used expanding gaseous\nshell models to fit the Lya line profile, and find low column densities and\nexpansion velocities.

We performed SED\nmodelling to broadband photometry from the U-band through the infrared to\ndetermine the stellar properties of these LAEs.

One way to formalize precision medicine is through a\ntreatment regime, which is a sequence of decision rules, one per stage of\nclinical intervention, that map up-to-date patient information to a recommended\ntreatment. An optimal treatment regime is defined as maximizing the mean of\nsome cumulative clinical outcome if applied to a population of interest. It is\nwell-known that even under simple generative models an optimal treatment regime\ncan be a highly nonlinear function of patient information. Consequently, a\nfocal point of recent methodological research has been the development of\nflexible models for estimating optimal treatment regimes. However, in many\nsettings, estimation of an optimal treatment regime is an exploratory analysis\nintended to generate new hypotheses for subsequent research and not to directly\ndictate treatment to new patients. In such settings, an estimated treatment\nregime that is interpretable in a domain context may be of greater value than\nan unintelligible treatment regime built using \"black-box\" estimation methods.\nWe propose an estimator of an optimal treatment regime composed of a sequence\nof decision rules, each expressible as a list of \"if-then\" statements that can\nbe presented as either a paragraph or as a simple flowchart that is immediately\ninterpretable to domain experts.

The first one called simple\nlow-rank tensor completion via tensor train (SiLRTC-TT) is intimately related\nto minimizing a nuclear norm based on TT rank. The second one is from a\nmultilinear matrix factorization model to approximate the TT rank of a tensor,\nand is called tensor completion by parallel matrix factorization via tensor\ntrain (TMac-TT). A tensor augmentation scheme of transforming a low-order\ntensor to higher-orders is also proposed to enhance the effectiveness of\nSiLRTC-TT and TMac-TT.

Linguistic intuitions are provided, and the importance\nof the Frobenius operators as an addition to the compact closed setting with\nregard to language is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2016 14:26:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2016 00:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-05"}

A particularly striking example of such\nbehavior is seen in the satellite system of the Andromeda galaxy, where around\n80\\% are on the nearside of that galaxy, facing the Milky Way. Motivated by\nthis departure from anisotropy, we examined the spatial distribution of\nsatellites around pairs of galaxies in the SDSS. By stacking tens of thousands\nof satellites around galaxy pairs we found that satellites tend to bulge\ntowards the other central galaxy, preferably occupying the space between the\npair, rather than being spherically or axis-symmetrically distributed around\neach host. The bulging is a function of the opening angle examined and is\nfairly strong -- there are up to $\\sim$10\\% more satellites in the space\nbetween the pair, than expected from uniform. Consequently, it is a\nstatistically very strong signal, being inconsistent with a uniform\ndistribution at the 5$\\sigma$ level. The possibility that the observed signal\nis the result of the overlap of two haloes with extended satellite\ndistributions, is ruled out by testing this hypothesis by performing the same\ntests on isolated galaxies (and their satellites) artificially placed at\nsimilar separations. These findings highlight the unrelaxed and interacting\nnature of galaxies in pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jun 2016 14:30:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}
