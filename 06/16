On the other hand, the temporal variation of the spatial\ndistributions of faculae, network and sunspots follows patterns that are less\nobviously correlated, so that we expect the relation that describes variation\nof the area coverage of different types of magnetic features to vary with the\nposition over the disk. In this work we employ MDI full-disk magnetograms\nacquired during Cycle 23 and at the beginning of Cycle 24 to investigate the\nrelation between the coverage of magnetic elements characterized by different\namounts of magnetic flux and located at different angular distances from disk\ncenter with the sunspot number. In agreement with some previous studies we find\nthat daily data are best described by a quadratic function while data averaged\nover 6-months are best described by a linear function. In both cases the\ncoefficients of the fits show large dependence on the position over the disk\nand the magnetic flux. We also find that toward disk center 6-months averaged\ndata show asymmetries between the ascending and the descending phase.\nImplications for solar irradiance modeling are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 16:39:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

The signal, GW151226, was observed\nby the twin detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave\nObservatory (LIGO) on December 26, 2015 at 03:38:53 UTC. The signal was\ninitially identified within 70 s by an online matched-filter search targeting\nbinary coalescences. Subsequent off-line analyses recovered GW151226 with a\nnetwork signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a significance greater than 5 $\\sigma$.\nThe signal persisted in the LIGO frequency band for approximately 1 s,\nincreasing in frequency and amplitude over about 55 cycles from 35 to 450 Hz,\nand reached a peak gravitational strain of $3.4_{-0.9}^{+0.7} \\times 10^{-22}$.\nThe inferred source-frame initial black hole masses are $14.2_{-3.7}^{+8.3}\nM_{\\odot}$ and $7.5_{-2.3}^{+2.3} M_{\\odot}$ and the final black hole mass is\n$20.8_{-1.7}^{+6.1} M_{\\odot}$.

In this paper we present full results from a\nsearch for binary black hole merger signals with total masses up to $100\nM_\\odot$ and detailed implications from our observations of these systems. Our\nsearch, based on general-relativistic models of gravitational wave signals from\nbinary black hole systems, unambiguously identified two signals, GW150914 and\nGW151226, with a significance of greater than $5\\sigma$ over the observing\nperiod. It also identified a third possible signal, LVT151012, with\nsubstantially lower significance, and with an 87% probability of being of\nastrophysical origin. We provide detailed estimates of the parameters of the\nobserved systems. Both GW150914 and GW151226 provide an unprecedented\nopportunity to study the two-body motion of a compact-object binary in the\nlarge velocity, highly nonlinear regime. We do not observe any deviations from\ngeneral relativity, and place improved empirical bounds on several high-order\npost-Newtonian coefficients. From our observations we infer stellar-mass binary\nblack hole merger rates lying in the range $9-240 \\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\n\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. These observations are beginning to inform astrophysical\npredictions of binary black hole formation rates, and indicate that future\nobserving runs of the Advanced detector network will yield many more\ngravitational wave detections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 16:44:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2016 16:33:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 14:22:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 23 Oct 2018 14:58:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

Grid cells are widely\nbelieved to be involved in path integration, that is, the maintenance of a\nlocation state through the summation of small displacements. We provide\ntheoretical evidence for this assertion by showing that cells with grid-like\ntuning curves are indeed well adapted for the path integration task. In\nparticular we prove that, in one dimension under Gaussian noise, the\nsensitivity of measuring small displacements is maximized by a population of\nneurons whose tuning curves are near-sinusoids -- that is to say, with peaks\nforming a one-dimensional grid. We also show that effective computation of the\ndisplacement is possible through a second population of cells whose sinusoid\ntuning curves are in phase difference from the first. In two dimensions, under\nadditional assumptions it can be shown that measurement sensitivity is\noptimized by the product of two sinusoids, again yielding a grid-like pattern.\nWe discuss the connection of our results to the triangular grid pattern\nobserved in animals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 17:36:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-16"}

A preferred alignment of the gamma-ray\nelongation with the radio lobes was demonstrated by rotating the radio lobes\ntemplate.

However, the conservation of $\\R_c$ holds only after the\nperturbation has reached the adiabatic limit where the constant mode of $\\R_c$\ndominates over the other (usually decaying) mode. In this case, the\nnon-adiabatic pressure perturbation defined in the thermodynamic sense, $\\delta\nP_{nad}\\equiv\\delta P-c_w^2\\delta\\rho$ where $c_w^2=\\dot P/\\dot\\rho$, usually\nbecomes also negligible on superhorizon scales.

Since asymmetric information makes people tempted to\nmisreport their private information for their own benefit, it is of primary\nimportance to understand whether time pressure affects honest behavior. A\ntheory of social heuristics (the Social Heuristics Hypothesis, SHH), predicts\nthat, in case of one-shot interactions, such an effect exists and it is\npositive. The SHH proposes that when people have no time to evaluate all\navailable alternatives, they tend to rely on heuristics, choices that are\noptimal in everyday, repeated interactions and that have been internalized over\ntime; and then, after deliberation, people shift their behavior towards the one\nthat is optimal in the given interaction. Thus, the SHH predicts that time\npressure increases honesty in one-shot interactions (because honesty may be\noptimal in repeated interactions, while dishonesty is always optimal in the\nshort run). However, to the best of our knowledge, no experimental studies have\ntested this prediction. Here, I report a large (N=1,013) study aimed at filling\nthis gap. In this study, participants were given a private information and were\nasked to report it within 5 seconds vs after 30 seconds.

In\n2015, we reported the first \"proof-of-principle\" measurement of the $^{225}$Ra\natomic EDM. Purpose: This work reports on the first of several experimental\nupgrades to improve the statistical sensitivity of our $^{225}$Ra EDM\nmeasurements by orders of magnitude and evaluates systematic effects that\ncontribute to current and future levels of experimental sensitivity. Method:\nLaser-cooled and trapped $^{225}$Ra atoms are held between two high voltage\nelectrodes in an ultra high vacuum chamber at the center of a magnetically\nshielded environment. We observe Larmor precession in a uniform magnetic field\nusing nuclear-spin-dependent laser light scattering and look for a phase shift\nproportional to the applied electric field, which indicates the existence of an\nEDM. The main improvement to our measurement technique is an order of magnitude\nincrease in spin precession time, which is enabled by an improved vacuum system\nand a reduction in trap-induced heating. Results: We have measured the\n$^{225}$Ra atomic EDM to be less than $1.4\\times10^{-23}$ $e$ cm (95%\nconfidence upper limit), which is a factor of 36 improvement over our previous\nresult. Conclusions: Our evaluation of systematic effects shows that this\nmeasurement is completely limited by statistical uncertainty.

The binary to RBN conversion algorithm\npresented here offers a significant reduction in the number of non-zero bits in\nthe resulting RBN encoded data. As a result, it provides a highly\nenergy-efficient technique for data transmission with silent periods for\ntransmitting 0's. We simulated our proposed technique with ideal radio device\ncharacteristics and also with parameters of various commercially available\nradio devices. Experimental results on various benchmark suites show that with\nideal as well as some commercial device characteristics, our proposed\ntransmission scheme requires 69% less energy on an average, compared to the\nenergy based transmission schemes. This makes it very attractive for\napplication scenarios where the devices are highly energy constrained.

This symmetry does not require that the\nassociated gap has nodes, yet specific heat, ultrasound and thermal\nconductivity measurements indicate the presence of nodes in the superconducting\ngap structure of Sr2RuO4. Theoretical scenarios have been proposed to account\nfor the existence of accidental nodes or deep accidental minima within a p-wave\nstate. To elucidate the nodal structure of the gap, it is essential to know\nwhether the lines of nodes (or minima) are vertical (parallel to the tetragonal\nc axis) or horizontal (perpendicular to the c axis). Here, we report thermal\nconductivity measurements on single crystals of Sr2RuO4 down to 50 mK for\ncurrents parallel and perpendicular to the c axis.

Given that the c-axis dispersion\n(warping) of the Fermi surface in Sr2RuO4 varies strongly from surface to\nsurface, the small a-c anisotropy suggests that the line nodes are present on\nall three sheets of the Fermi surface.

Here, we investigate the formation of these objects\nthrough the LMXB channel with emphasis on the proto-WD evolution in\nenvironments with different metallicities.

The occurrence\nof these flashes produces a clear dichotomy in the cooling timescales of ELM\nWDs, which has important consequences e.g. for the age determination of binary\nmillisecond pulsars. Rotational mixing is found to counteract the effect of\ngravitational settling in the surface layers of young, bloated ELM proto-WDs\nand therefore plays a key role in determining their surface chemical\nabundances. We predict that these proto-WDs have helium-rich envelopes through\na significant part of their lifetime, a crucial ingredient for understanding\nthe newly observed ELM proto-WD pulsators. The hydrogen envelope at detachment,\nalthough small compared to the total mass of the WD, contains enough angular\nmomentum such that the spin frequency of the resulting WD on the cooling track\nis well above the orbital frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

For this\nreason, under the assumption of a thermal steady state, it may be used to infer\nthe heating rate and, in turn, the star formation rate in local, as well as in\nhigh redshift systems. In this work, radio and ultraviolet observations of the\nGalactic interstellar medium are used to understand whether C II is indeed a\ngood tracer of the star formation rate. For a sample of high Galactic latitude\nsightlines, direct measurements of the temperature indicate the presence of C\nII in both the cold and the warm phases of the diffuse interstellar gas. The\ncold gas fraction (~ 10 - 50% of the total neutral gas column density) is not\nnegligible even at high Galactic latitude. It is shown that, to correctly\nestimate the star formation rate, C II cooling in both the phases should hence\nbe considered. The simple assumption, that the [C II] line originates only from\neither the cold or the warm phase, significantly underpredicts or overpredicts\nthe star formation rate, respectively. These results are particularly important\nin the context of the Damped Lyman-alpha systems for which a similar method is\noften used to estimate the star formation rate. The derived star formation\nrates in such cases may not be reliable if the temperature of the gas under\nconsideration is not constrained independently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 20:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

In particular, star formation alone simply converts dense\ncloud gas into stars with only a small change to the cloud populations,\nprincipally resulting in a slight decrease in the transient population.\nFeedback, however, has a stronger impact: while it is not generally sufficient\nto entirely destroy the clouds, it does eject gas out of them, increasing the\ngas density in the inter-cloud region. This decreases the number of massive\nclouds, but substantially increases the transient cloud population. We also\nfind that feedback tends to drive a net radial inflow of massive clouds,\nleading to an increase in the star formation rate in the bar region.

Rendezvous, which is the process of establishing\ncontrol communications, is an essential requirement to enable efficient\ncommunication between any two pair of CR nodes. The most popular CR rendezvous\nprotocols are based on quorum systems (QSs).

In this case, we also\nfind the higher-order scaled density moments to increase with time and saturate\nat values significantly larger than one, which corresponds to a uniform density\ndistribution, after the phase separation. The skewness of the quark number\nevent-by-event distribution in a small sub-volume of the system is also found\nto increase, but this feature disappears if the sub-volume is large.

Human body communication (HBC) provides an\nalternate energy-efficient communication technique between on-body wearable\ndevices by using the human body as a conducting medium. This allows order of\nmagnitude lower communication power, compared to WBAN, due to lower loss and\nbroadband signaling. Moreover, HBC is significantly more secure than WBAN, as\nthe information is contained within the human body and cannot be snooped on\nunless the person is physically touched. In this paper, we highlight\napplications of HBC as (1) Social Networking (e.g. LinkedIn/Facebook friend\nrequest sent during Handshaking in a meeting/party), (2) Secure Authentication\nusing human-human or human-machine dynamic HBC and (3) ultra-low power, secure\nBAN using intra-human HBC. One of the biggest technical bottlenecks of HBC has\nbeen the interference (e.g. FM) picked up by the human body acting like an\nantenna.

Supervised knowledge e.g. semantic labels\nor pair-wise relationship) associated to data is capable of significantly\nimproving the quality of hash codes and hash functions. However, confronted\nwith the rapid growth of newly-emerging concepts and multimedia data on the\nWeb, existing supervised hashing approaches may easily suffer from the scarcity\nand validity of supervised information due to the expensive cost of manual\nlabelling. In this paper, we propose a novel hashing scheme, termed\n\\emph{zero-shot hashing} (ZSH), which compresses images of \"unseen\" categories\nto binary codes with hash functions learned from limited training data of\n\"seen\" categories. Specifically, we project independent data labels i.e.\n0/1-form label vectors) into semantic embedding space, where semantic\nrelationships among all the labels can be precisely characterized and thus seen\nsupervised knowledge can be transferred to unseen classes. Moreover, in order\nto cope with the semantic shift problem, we rotate the embedded space to more\nsuitably align the embedded semantics with the low-level visual feature space,\nthereby alleviating the influence of semantic gap. In the meantime, to exert\npositive effects on learning high-quality hash functions, we further propose to\npreserve local structural property and discrete nature in binary codes.\nBesides, we develop an efficient alternating algorithm to solve the ZSH model.\nExtensive experiments conducted on various real-life datasets show the superior\nzero-shot image retrieval performance of ZSH as compared to several\nstate-of-the-art hashing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 02:56:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-17"}

However, realizing this potential requires the development of\ntechniques for retrieving sample moments from magnetic microscopy data. With\nthis goal, we developed a technique for uniquely obtaining the net magnetic\nmoment of geological samples from magnetic microscopy maps of unresolved or\nnearly unresolved magnetization. This technique is particularly powerful for\nanalyzing small, weakly magnetized samples such as meteoritic chondrules and\nterrestrial silicate crystals like zircons. We validated this technique by\napplying it to field maps generated from synthetic sources and also to field\nmaps measured using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)\nmicroscope above geological samples with moments down to 10^-15 Am2. For the\nmost magnetic rock samples, the net moments estimated from the SQUID microscope\ndata are within error of independent moment measurements acquired using lower\nsensitivity standard rock magnetometers. In addition to its superior moment\nsensitivity, SQUID microscope net moment magnetometry also enables the\nidentification and isolation of magnetic contamination and background sources,\nwhich is critical for improving accuracy in paleomagnetic studies of weakly\nmagnetic rocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 08:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

We show that, at leading order, all of\nthese quantities depend on just two post-TOV parameters $\\mu_1$ and $\\chi$, and\nwe discuss the possibility to measure (or set upper bounds on) these\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 09:22:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

However, the\npartitioning of the anthropogenic influence to individual factors, such as\ngreenhouse gases and aerosols, is much less robust. Differences in how forcing\nfactors are applied, in their radiative influence and in models' climate\nsensitivities, substantially influence the response patterns. We find standard\noptimal detection methodologies cannot fully reconcile this response diversity.\nBy selecting a set of experiments to enable the diagnosing of greenhouse gases\nand the combined influence of other anthropogenic and natural factors, we find\nrobust detections of well mixed greenhouse gases across a large ensemble of\nmodels. Of the observed warming over the 20th century of 0.65K/century we find,\nusing a multi model mean not incorporating pattern uncertainty, a well mixed\ngreenhouse gas warming of 0.87 to 1.22K/century. This is partially offset by\ncooling from other anthropogenic and natural influences of -0.54 to\n-0.22K/century. Although better constrained than recent studies, the\nattributable trends across climate models are still wide, with implications for\nobservational constrained estimates of transient climate response. Some of the\nuncertainties could be reduced in future by having more model data to better\nquantify the simulated estimates of the signals and natural variability, by\ndesigning model experiments more effectively and better quantification of the\nclimate model radiative influences. Most importantly, how model pattern\nuncertainties are incorporated into the optimal detection methodology should be\nimproved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 09:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

These systems are generally known as minisuperspace models. One of\ntheir important key features is the invariance of the corresponding reduced\nactions under reparametrizations of the independent variable, a fact that can\nbe seen as the remnant of the general covariance of the full theory. In the\ncase of a system of $n$ degrees of freedom, described by a Lagrangian quadratic\nin velocities, one can use the lapse by either gauge fixing it or letting it be\ndefined by the constraint and subsequently substitute into the rest of the\nequations. In the first case, the system is solvable for $n$ accelerations and\nthe constraint becomes a restriction among constants. In the second case, the\nsystem can only be solved for $n-1$ accelerations and the \"gauge\" freedom is\ntransferred to the choice of one of the scalar degrees of freedom. In this\npaper, we take the second path and express all $n-1$ scalar degrees of freedom\nin terms of the remaining one, say $q$. By considering these $n-1$ degrees of\nfreedom as arbitrary but given functions of $q$, we manage to extract a two\ndimensional pure gauge system consisting of the lapse $N$ and the arbitrary\n$q$: in a way, we decouple the reparametrization invariance from the rest of\nthe equations of motion. The solution of the corresponding quantum two\ndimensional system is used for the definition of a generalized probability for\nevery configuration $f^i (q)$, be it classical or not. The main result is that,\ninterestingly enough, this probability attains its extrema on the classical\nsolution of the initial $n$-dimensional system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 09:50:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2016 11:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-14"}

Increased\nvolume also favors polar distortions, both because competing rotations of the\noxygen octahedra are suppressed and because coulomb repulsion associated with\ncation off-centering is reduced.

However, many times, such social\nnetwork based campaigns perform poorly in practice because the intensity of the\nrecommendations drastically reduces beyond a few hops from the source. A\nnatural strategy for maintaining the intensity is to provide incentives. In\nthis paper, we address the problem of minimizing the cost incurred by the\ncampaigner for incentivizing a fraction of individuals in the social network,\nwhile ensuring that the campaign message reaches a given expected fraction of\nindividuals. We also address the dual problem of maximizing the campaign\npenetration for a resource constrained campaigner. To help us understand and\nsolve the above mentioned problems, we use percolation theory to formally state\nthem as optimization problems. These problems are not amenable to traditional\napproaches because of a fixed point equation that needs to be solved\nnumerically. However, we use results from reliability theory to establish some\nkey properties of the fixed point, which in turn enables us to solve these\nproblems using algorithms that are linearithmic in maximum node degree.\nFurthermore, we evaluate the efficacy of the analytical solution by performing\nsimulations on real world networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 13:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-17"}

Objects at $a\\simeq$~2.764 au are quite dispersed in\nthis orbital element, giving the family a \"crab-like\" appearance. Recent works\nshowed that this feature is caused by the interaction of the family with the\n$s-s_C$ nodal secular resonance with Ceres, that spreads the inclination of\nasteroids near its separatrix. As a consequence, the currently observed\ndistribution of the $v_W$ component of terminal ejection velocities obtained\nfrom inverting Gauss equation is quite leptokurtic, since this parameter mostly\ndepends on the asteroids inclination. The peculiar orbital configuration of the\nAstrid family can be used to set constraints on key parameters describing the\nstrength of the Yarkovsky force, such as the bulk and surface density and the\nthermal conductivity of surface material. By simulating various fictitious\nfamilies with different values of these parameters, and by demanding that the\ncurrent value of the kurtosis of the distribution in $v_W$ be reached over the\nestimated lifetime of the family, we obtained that the thermal conductivity of\nAstrid family members should be $\\simeq$ 0.001 W/m/K, and that the surface and\nbulk density should be higher than 1000 kg/m$^{3}$.

Using the Fourier-Legendre analysis is a technique for\naddressing this problem. We validate this technique with the help of artificial\nhelioseismic data. The analysed data set was obtained by numerically simulating\nthe effect of the meridional flow on the seismic wave field in the full volume\nof the Sun. In this way, a 51.2-hour long time series was generated. The\nresulting surface velocity field is then analyzed in various settings: Two\n$360^\\circ \\times 90^\\circ$ halfspheres, two $120^\\circ \\times 60^\\circ$\npatches on the front and farside of the Sun (North and South, respectively) and\ntwo $120^\\circ \\times 60^\\circ$ patches on the northern and southern frontside\nonly.

A popular method of promoting a\nproduct or even an idea is incentivizing individuals to evangelize the idea\nvigorously by providing them with referral rewards in the form of discounts,\ncash backs, or social recognition. Due to budget constraints on scarce\nresources such as money and manpower, it may not be possible to provide\nincentives for the entire population, and hence incentives need to be allocated\njudiciously to appropriate individuals for ensuring the highest possible\noutreach size.

We also solve the problem of computing the set\nof individuals to be incentivized for maximizing the outreach size for given\ncost budget. The optimization problem turns out to be non trivial; it involves\nquantities that need to be computed by numerically solving a fixed point\nequation.

A spin Hamiltonian gives rise to the spin-half\nmisconception, namely, the blind belief that spin-half magnetic ions do not\npossess magnetic anisotropy that arise from SOC. This misconception is a direct\nconsequence from the limitedness of a spin Hamiltonian that it lacks the\norbital degree of freedom.

Recently, much attention has been given to\nthe link between strict jamming and hyperuniformity in frictionless\nhard-particle packings. Doing so requires one to study very large packings,\nwhich can be difficult to jam properly. We modify the rigorous linear\nprogramming method of Donev et al. [J. Comp. Phys. 197, 139 (2004)] in order to\ntest for jamming in putatively jammed packings of hard-disks in two dimensions.\nWe find that various standard packing protocols struggle to reliably create\npackings that are jammed for even modest system sizes; importantly, these\npackings appear to be jammed by conventional tests. We present evidence that\nsuggests that deviations from hyperuniformity in putative maximally random\njammed (MRJ) packings can in part be explained by a shortcoming in generating\nexactly-jammed configurations due to a type of \"critical slowing down\" as the\nnecessary rearrangements become difficult to realize by numerical protocols.\nAdditionally, various protocols are able to produce packings exhibiting\nhyperuniformity to different extents, but this is because certain protocols are\nbetter able to approach exactly-jammed configurations. Nonetheless, while one\nshould not generally expect exact hyperuniformity for disordered packings with\nrattlers, we find that when jamming is ensured, our packings are very nearly\nhyperuniform, and deviations from hyperuniformity correlate with an inability\nto ensure jamming, suggesting that strict jamming and hyperuniformity are\nindeed linked. This raises the possibility that the ideal MRJ packings have no\nrattlers. Our work provides the impetus for the development of packing\nalgorithms that produce large disordered strictly jammed packings that are\nrattler-free.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 15:36:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

The linear\nresponses are analytically derived in a periodic box under the local WKB\napproximation. Both the kinetic and Ohmic dissipations at the resonant\nfrequencies are calculated and the various parameters are investigated.\nAlthough magnetic pressure may be negligible compared to thermal pressure,\nmagnetic field can be important for the first-order perturbation, e.g.\ndynamical tides. It is found that magnetic field splits the resonant frequency,\nnamely the rotating hydrodynamic flow has only one resonant frequency but the\nrotating MHD flow has two, one positive and the other negative. In the weak\nfield regime the dissipations are asymmetric around the two resonant\nfrequencies and this asymmetry is more striking with a weaker magnetic field.\nIt is also found that both the kinetic and Ohmic dissipations at the resonant\nfrequencies are inversely proportional to the Ekman number and the square of\nwavenumber. The dissipation at the resonant frequency on small scales is almost\nequal to the dissipation at the non-resonant frequencies, namely the resonance\ntakes its effect on the dissipation at intermediate length scales. Moreover,\nthe waves with phase propagation perpendicular to magnetic field are much more\ndamped. It is also interesting to find that the frequency-averaged dissipation\nis constant. This result suggests that in compact objects magnetic effects on\ntidal dissipation should be considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 02:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}
