Our programme includes 67 close binaries, both detached and\nsemi-detached and with M-dwarfs, K-dwarfs, brown dwarfs or white dwarfs\nsecondaries. In total, we have observed more than 650 white dwarf eclipses. We\nuse this sample to search for orbital period variations and aim to identify the\nunderlying cause of these variations. We find that the probability of observing\norbital period variations increases significantly with the observational\nbaseline. In particular, all binaries with baselines exceeding 10 yrs, with\nsecondaries of spectral type K2 -- M5.5, show variations in the eclipse arrival\ntimes that in most cases amount to several minutes. In addition, among those\nwith baselines shorter than 10 yrs, binaries with late spectral type (>M6),\nbrown dwarf or white dwarf secondaries appear to show no orbital period\nvariations. This is in agreement with the so-called Applegate mechanism, which\nproposes that magnetic cycles in the secondary stars can drive variability in\nthe binary orbits. We also present new eclipse times of NN Ser, which are still\ncompatible with the previously published circumbinary planetary system model,\nalthough only with the addition of a quadratic term to the ephemeris.

We investigate these two\nfundamental aspects in a new comparison project using a set of cosmological\nhydrodynamic simulations of the formation and evolution of a Milky Way-size\ngalaxy. In this study, we focus on the comparison of two particle-based\nhydrodynamics methods: the improved smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code\nGadget, and the Lagrangian Meshless Finite-Mass (MFM) code GIZMO.

However, notable\ndifferences are present in a wide range of galaxy properties and their\nevolution, including star formation history, gas content, disk structure and\nkinematics. In particular, there is significant difference in gas properties\nand their evolution between the two simulations. Compared to GIZMO, Gadget\nsimulation produces a larger fraction of cold, dense gas at high redshift which\nfuels rapid star formation and results in a higher stellar mass by $20\\%$ and a\nlower gas fraction by $10\\%$ at $z = 0$, and the resulting gas disk is smoother\nand more coherent in rotation due to damping of turbulent motion by the\nnumerical viscosity in SPH, in contrast to the GIZMO simulation which shows\nmore prominent spiral structure.

This model is based on taking the k-th root of the original sufficient\nstatistics of any univariate exponential family with positive sufficient\nstatistics, including the Poisson and exponential distributions. As in the\nrecent work with square root graphical (SQR) models [Inouye et al.\n2016]---which was restricted to pairwise dependencies---we give the conditions\nof the parameters that are needed for normalization using the radial\nconditionals similar to the pairwise case [Inouye et al. 2016].

The HMM, consisting of states and transitions, forms a fixed backbone\nwith nonadaptive transition probabilities. The SNN, however, implements a\nbiologically based Bayesian computation that derives from the spike\ntiming-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule. The emission (observation)\nprobabilities of the HMM are represented in the SNN and trained with the STDP\nrule. A separate SNN, each with the same architecture, is associated with each\nof the states of the HMM. Because of the STDP training, each SNN implements an\nexpectation maximization algorithm to learn the emission probabilities for one\nHMM state. The model was studied on synthesized spike-train data and also on\nspoken word data. Preliminary results suggest its performance compares\nfavorably with other biologically motivated approaches.

Attempts over the last two decades to\ncalibrate the degree of overshooting with stellar mass using detached\ndouble-lined eclipsing binaries have been largely inconclusive, mainly due to a\nlack of suitable observational data. Here we revisit the question of a possible\nmass dependence of overshooting with a more complete sample of binaries, and\nexamine any additional relation there might be with evolutionary state or metal\nabundance Z. We use a carefully selected sample of 33 double-lined eclipsing\nbinaries strategically positioned in the H-R diagram, with accurate absolute\ndimensions and component masses ranging from 1.2 to 4.4 solar masses. We\ncompare their measured properties with stellar evolution calculations to infer\nsemi-empirical values of the overshooting parameter alpha(ov) for each star.\nOur models use the common prescription for the overshoot distance d(ov) =\nalpha(ov) Hp, where Hp is the pressure scale height at the edge of the\nconvective core as given by the Schwarzschild criterion, and alpha(ov) is a\nfree parameter. We find a relation between alpha(ov) and mass that is defined\nmuch more clearly than in previous work, and indicates a significant rise up to\nabout 2 solar masses followed by little or no change beyond this mass.

Compared to conventional convex optimization\nmethods, it has a much lower complexity and is computationally tractable. In\nthe GAMP framework, the sparse signal and the observation are viewed to be\ngenerated according to some pre-specified probability distributions in the\ninput and output channels. However, the parameters of the distributions are\nusually unknown in practice. In this paper, we propose an extended GAMP\nalgorithm with built-in parameter estimation (PE-GAMP) and present its\nempirical convergence analysis. PE-GAMP treats the parameters as unknown random\nvariables with simple priors and jointly estimates them with the sparse\nsignals. Compared with Expectation Maximization (EM) based parameter estimation\nmethods, the proposed PE-GAMP could draw information from the prior\ndistributions of the parameters to perform parameter estimation. It is also\nmore robust and much simpler, which enables us to consider more complex signal\ndistributions apart from the usual Bernoulli-Gaussian (BGm) mixture\ndistribution. Specifically, the formulations of Bernoulli-Exponential mixture\n(BEm) distribution and Laplace distribution are given in this paper. Simulated\nnoiseless sparse signal recovery experiments demonstrate that the performance\nof the proposed PE-GAMP matches the oracle GAMP algorithm. When noise is\npresent, both the simulated experiments and the real image recovery experiments\nshow that PE-GAMP is still able to maintain its robustness and outperform EM\nbased parameter estimation method when the sampling ratio is small.\nAdditionally, using the BEm formulation of the PE-GAMP, we can successfully\nperform non-negative sparse coding of local image patches and provide useful\nfeatures for the image classification task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2016 21:17:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 21:33:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 16:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-12"}

Naively, this is not a well-defined notion for such a\nnon-equilibrium process, as the particle number at intermediate times depends\non a basis choice of reference states with respect to which particles and\nanti-particles are defined, even though the final late-time particle number is\nindependent of this basis choice. The basis choice is associated with a\nparticular truncation of the adiabatic expansion. The adiabatic expansion is\ndivergent, and we show that if this divergent expansion is truncated at its\noptimal order, a universal time dependence is obtained, confirming a general\nresult of Dingle and Berry. This optimally truncated particle number provides a\nclear picture of quantum interference effects for perturbations with\nnon-trivial temporal sub-structure.

It is widely believed that any quantum theory of gravity would\nreduce to a DSR model at the flat limit when purely gravitational and quantum\nmechanical effects are negligible. Gravity's rainbow is a simple generalization\nof DSR theories to incorporate gravity. In this paper, we show that the\neffective Friedmann equations that are suggested by loop quantum cosmology\n(LQC) can be exactly reobtained in rainbow cosmology setup. The deformed\ngeometry of LQC then completely fixes the modified dispersion relation and\nresults in unique DSR model. In comparison with standard LQC scenario where\nonly the geometry is modified, both of the geometry and matter parts get\nmodifications in our setup. In this respect, we find that the total number of\nmicrostates for the universe is finite which suggests the statistical origin\nfor the energy and entropy density bounds.

First, we highlight convolution with\nupsampled filters, or 'atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense\nprediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the\nresolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional\nNeural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of\nfilters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of\nparameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial\npyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP\nprobes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple\nsampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as\nimage context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object\nboundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models.\nThe commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs\nachieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this\nby combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected\nConditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and\nquantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed \"DeepLab\"\nsystem sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image\nsegmentation task, reaching 79.7% mIOU in the test set, and advances the\nresults on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and\nCityscapes.

In the\nproposed scheme, pilots are transmitted in partial overlap with data to\ndecrease the channel estimation overhead. The RS can detect the source data\nwith minimal destination pilot interference by exploiting the asymptotic\northogonality of massive MIMO channels. Then pilot-data interference can be\neffectively suppressed with assistance of the detected source data in the\ndestination channel estimation. Due to the transmission overlay, the effective\ndata period is extended, hence improving system throughput. Both theoretical\nand simulation results confirm that the proposed pilot-data overlay scheme\noutperforms the conventional separate pilot-data design in the limited\ncoherence time interval scenario. Moreover, asymptotic analyses at high and low\nSNR regions demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme regardless of\nthe coherence interval length.

Flux symmetry and laser\nenergy are calculated by using three dimensional view factor method and laser\nenergy balance in hohlraums. Plasma conditions are analyzed based on the two\ndimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. There is no Ylm (l<=4)\nasymmetry in the six-cylinder-port hohlraum when the influences of laser\nentrance holes (LEHs) and laser spots cancel each other out with suitable\ntarget parameters. A radiation drive with 300 eV and good flux symmetry can be\nachieved with use of laser energy of 2.3 MJ and 500 TW peak power. According to\nthe simulations, the electron temperature and the electron density on the wall\nof laser cone are high and low, respectively, which are similar to those of\nouter cones in the hohlraums on National Ignition Facility (NIF). And the laser\nintensity is also as low as those of NIF outer cones. So the backscattering due\nto laser plasma interaction (LPI) is considered to be negligible.

We extend the concept to\nstatic thermal gradients by recasting the temperature variation as a variation\nin the Euclidean metric. We apply this prescription to determine the Quark\nanti-Quark potential in a system with thermal gradient. A naturally occurring\nQCD medium with thermal gradients is a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). However, the\nQGP evolves in time. Hence, we use a quasi-stationary approximation, which is\napplicable only if the rate of time evolution is slow. The application of our\nproposal to a Quark anti-Quark potential in QGP can be seen as a step towards a\nmore exact theory which would incorporate time varying thermal gradients. The\neffect of a static temperature gradient on the Quark anti-Quark potential is\nanalyzed using a gravity dual model. A non-uniform black string metric is\ndeveloped, by perturbing the Schwarzchild metric, which allows to incorporate\nthe temperature gradient in the dual AdS space. Finally, an expression for the\nQuark anti-Quark potential, in the presence of a static temperature gradient,\nis derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2016 01:54:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 14:06:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 10:52:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 06:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

To identify meaningful\nclusters (communities) in a graph, a density-connected tree is first\nconstructed in a local fashion. Owing to the density-connected tree, Dcut\nallows partitioning a graph into multiple densely tight-knit clusters directly.\nWe demonstrate that our method has several attractive benefits: (a) Dcut\nprovides an intuitive criterion to evaluate the goodness of a graph clustering\nin a more natural and precise way; (b) Built upon the density-connected tree,\nDcut allows identifying the meaningful graph clusters of densely connected\nvertices efficiently; (c) The density-connected tree provides a connectivity\nmap of vertices in a graph from a local density perspective.

While second-population stars, identified by their Na\noverabundance, have been found from the main sequence turn-off up to the tip of\nthe red giant branch in various Galactic GCs, asymptotic giant branch (AGB)\nstars have rarely been targeted. The recent finding that NGC 6752 lacks an\nNa-rich AGB star has thus triggered new studies on AGB stars in GCs, since this\nresult questions our basic understanding of GC formation and stellar evolution\ntheory. In order to compare the Na abundance distributions of AGB and RGB stars\nin Galactic GCs and investigate whether the presence of Na-rich stars on the\nAGB is metallicity-dependent, we obtained the high-resolution spectra with the\nmulti-object high-resolution spectrograph FLAMES on ESO/VLT for a sample of AGB\nand RGB stars in the Galactic GC NGC 2808.

The\nratios of Na-poor first-population to Na-rich second-population stars are 45:55\nin the AGB sample and 48:52 in the RGB sample. NGC 2808 has Na-rich\nsecond-population AGB stars, which turn out to be even more numerous - in\nrelative terms - than their Na-poor AGB counterparts and the Na-rich stars on\nthe RGB. Our findings are well reproduced by the fast rotating massive stars\nscenario and they do not contradict the recent results that there is not an\nNa-rich AGB star in NGC 6752.

Most of the\ncurrently proposed methods therefore do inference in subregions of the brain\nseparately or do approximate inference without comparison to the true posterior\ndistribution. A popular such method, which is now the standard method for\nBayesian single subject analysis in the SPM software, is introduced in Penny et\nal. (2005b). The method processes the data slice-by-slice and uses an\napproximate variational Bayes (VB) estimation algorithm that enforces posterior\nindependence between activity coefficients in different voxels. We introduce a\nfast and practical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme for exact inference\nin the same model, both slice-wise and for the whole brain using a 3D prior on\nactivity coefficients. The algorithm exploits sparsity and uses modern\ntechniques for efficient sampling from high-dimensional Gaussian distributions,\nleading to speed-ups without which MCMC would not be a practical option. Using\nMCMC, we are for the first time able to evaluate the approximate VB posterior\nagainst the exact MCMC posterior, and show that VB can lead to spurious\nactivation. In addition, we develop an improved VB method that drops the\nassumption of independent voxels a posteriori. This algorithm is shown to be\nmuch faster than both MCMC and the original VB for large datasets, with\nnegligible error compared to the MCMC posterior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2016 06:40:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2016 08:40:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-03"}

The test for the existence of a latent\nprocess is important because, if one is present, standard logistic regression\nmethods will produce inconsistent estimates of the regression parameters.\nHowever the score test is non-standard and any serial dependence in the latent\nprocess will require consideration of nuisance parameters which cannot be\nestimated under the null hypothesis of no latent process.

If a latent process is detected,\nconsistent estimation of its variance and the regression parameters can be done\nusing marginal estimation which is easily implemented using generalised linear\nmixed model methods. The test for serial dependence in a latent process does\nnot involve nuisance parameters and is based on the covariances between\nresiduals centered at functions of the latent process conditional on the\nobservations. This requires numerical integration in order to compute the test\nstatistic. Relevant asymptotic results are derived and confirmed using\nsimulation evidence.

Here, we\nshow the combination of recently developed method called dense-EEG source\nconnectivity to identify functional brain networks with excellent temporal and\nspatial resolutions and an algorithm, called SimNet, to compute brain networks\nsimilarity. Two categories of visual stimuli were analysed in this study:\nimmobile and mobile. Networks similarity was assessed within each category\n(intra-condition) and between categories (inter-condition). Results showed high\nsimilarity within each category and low similarity between the two categories.\nA significant difference between similarities computed in the intra and\ninter-conditions was observed at the period of 120-190ms supposed to be related\nto visual recognition and memory access. We speculate that these observations\nwill be very helpful toward understanding the object categorization in the\nhuman brain from a network perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2016 09:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-06"}

In a similar way, H2CO is also formed\nin abstraction reactions involving CH3OH. The dominant methanol H-atom\nabstraction product is expected to be CH2OH, while H-atom additions to H2CO\nshould at least partially proceed through CH3O intermediate radicals. The\noccurrence of H-atom abstraction reactions in ice mantles leads to more\nreactive intermediates (HCO, CH3O and CH2OH) than previously thought, when\nassuming sequential H-atom addition reactions only.

We provide a simplified\nstatic Time-Extended network (STEG), which is of polynomial size to the input\nand whose static flow rates are equivalent to the respective temporal flow of\nthe temporal network, using STEG, we prove that the maximum temporal flow is\nequal to the minimum temporal s-t cut. We further show that temporal flows can\nalways be decomposed into flows, each of which moves only through a journey,\ni.e., a directed path whose successive edges have strictly increasing moments\nof existence. We partially characterise networks with random edge\navailabilities that tend to eliminate the s-t temporal flow. We then consider\nmixed temporal networks, which have some edges with specified availabilities\nand some edges with random availabilities, we show that it is #P-hard to\ncompute the tails and expectations of the maximum temporal flow (which is now a\nrandom variable) in a mixed temporal network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2016 13:56:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 13:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-23"}

In the application of FCMdd and\noriginal ECMdd, a single medoid (prototype), which is supposed to belong to the\nobject set, is utilized to represent one class. For the sake of clarity, this\nkind of ECMdd using a single medoid is denoted by sECMdd. In real clustering\napplications, using only one pattern to capture or interpret a class may not\nadequately model different types of group structure and hence limits the\nclustering performance. In order to address this problem, a variation of ECMdd\nusing multiple weighted medoids, denoted by wECMdd, is presented. Unlike\nsECMdd, in wECMdd objects in each cluster carry various weights describing\ntheir degree of representativeness for that class. This mechanism enables each\nclass to be represented by more than one object. Experimental results in\nsynthetic and real data sets clearly demonstrate the superiority of sECMdd and\nwECMdd.

Highly localized plasmon resonances are formed in the nanogap between\nthe metallic film and nanostripes. The local electric field is dramatically\nenhanced in this subwavelength nanoregion.

Subsequently, single-qubit measurements are performed on each of\nthe ancillas. We describe two continuous variable implementations of the\nprotocol using propagating microwave modes. The first implementation uses\npropagating Schr$\\rm{\\ddot{o}}$dinger cat-states as the flying ancilla qubits,\na joint-photon-number-modulo-2 measurement of the propagating modes for the\ntwo-qubit measurement and homodyne detections as the final single-qubit\nmeasurements. The presence of inefficiencies in realistic quantum systems limit\nthe success-rate of generating high fidelity Bell-states. This motivates us to\npropose a second continuous variable implementation, where we use quantum error\ncorrection to suppress the decoherence due to photon loss to first order. To\nthat end, we encode the ancilla qubits in superpositions of Schr\\\"odinger cat\nstates of a given photon-number-parity, use a joint-photon-number-modulo-4\nmeasurement as the two-qubit measurement and homodyne detections as the final\nsingle-qubit measurements.

The lack of detection of FeK absorption lines,\neclipses or dipping suggests that the accretion disc is observed at a low\ninclination angle. Radio (VLA) observations did not detect any radio\ncounterpart to Swift J174540.7-290015. No evidence for X-ray or radio\nperiodicity is found. The location of the transient was observed also in the\nnear-IR with GROND at MPG/ESO La Silla 2.2m telescope and VLT/NaCo pre- and\npost-outburst.

A strong degeneracy exists between\nthe hardness of the SED and U, which in turn leads to high uncertainties in the\ndetermination of the other parameters, including abundances. One way to resolve\nthe degeneracy is to fix one of the parameters using additional information.\n  For each of the ~ 20000 sources of the CALIFA HII regions catalog, a grid of\nphotoionization models is computed assuming the ionizing SED being described by\nthe underlying stellar population obtained from spectral synthesis modeling.\nThe ionizing SED is then defined as the sum of various stellar bursts of\ndifferent ages and metallicities. This solves the degeneracy between the shape\nof the ionizing SED and U. The nebular metallicity (associated to O/H) is\ndefined using the classical strong line method O3N2 (which gives to our models\nthe status of \"hybrids\"). The remaining free parameters are the abundance ratio\nN/O and the ionization parameter U, which are determined by looking for the\nmodel fitting [NII]/Ha and [OIII]/Hb.
