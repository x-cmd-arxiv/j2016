We first assess the performances of EST in a\nsimple correlated model such as the 3D electron gas. Afterwards, we test its\nefficiency within $\\textit{ab initio}$ quantum Monte Carlo simulations of\nmetallic elements of increasing complexity. We show that EST displays an\noverall good performance in reducing finite-size errors comparable to the\nwidely used twist average technique but at a much lower computational cost,\nsince it involves the evaluation of just one wavefunction. We also demonstrate\nthat the EST method shows similar performances in the calculation of\ncorrelation functions, such as the ionic forces for structural relaxation and\nthe pair radial distribution function in liquid hydrogen. Our conclusions point\nto the usefulness of EST for correlated supercell calculations, our method will\nbe particularly relevant when the physical problem under consideration requires\nlarge periodic cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 16:52:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

A third decoupled RH neutrino, $N_{\\rm DM}$ with mass\n$M_{\\rm DM}$, plays the role of cold dark matter (DM) and is produced by the\nmixing with a source RH neutrino, $N_{\\rm S}$ with mass $M_{\\rm S}$, induced by\nHiggs portal interactions. The same interactions are also responsible for\n$N_{\\rm DM}$ decays. We discuss in detail the constraints coming from DM\nabundance and stability conditions, showing that in the hierarchical case\n($M_{\\rm DM} \\gg M_{\\rm S}$) there is an allowed window on $M_{\\rm DM}$, which\nnecessarily implies a contribution from DM decays to the high-energy neutrino\nflux recently detected by IceCube.

One key insight is\nthat channel recommendation among secondary users can help to take advantage of\nthe inherent correlation structure of spectrum availability in both time and\nspace, and enable users to obtain more informed spectrum opportunities. With\nthis insight, we advocate to leverage the wisdom of crowds, and devise social\nrecommendation aided DSA mechanisms to orient secondary users to make more\nintelligent spectrum access decisions, for both strong and weak network\ninformation cases. We start with the strong network information case where\nsecondary users have the statistical information. To mitigate the difficulty\ndue to the curse of dimensionality in the stochastic game approach, we take the\none-step Nash approach and cast the social recommendation aided DSA decision\nmaking problem at each time slot as a strategic game. We show that it is a\npotential game, and then devise an algorithm to achieve the Nash equilibrium by\nexploiting its finite improvement property. For the weak information case where\nsecondary users do not have the statistical information, we develop a\ndistributed reinforcement learning mechanism for social recommendation aided\nDSA based on the local observations of secondary users only. Appealing to the\nmaximum-norm contraction mapping, we also derive the conditions under which the\ndistributed mechanism converges and characterize the equilibrium therein.\nNumerical results reveal that the proposed social recommendation aided DSA\nmechanisms can achieve superior performance using real social data traces and\nits performance loss in the weak network information case is insignificant,\ncompared with the strong network information case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 19:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-21"}

Let\n$kK_2$ denote the matching of size $k$, that is a graph with $2k$ vertices and\n$k$ disjoint edges. A graph with an induced copy of $kK_2$ contains at least\n$2^k$ maximal independent sets. The other direction was established in a series\nof papers finally yielding $i(G) \\le (n/k)^{2k}$ for a graph $G$ without an\ninduced $(k+1)K_2$. Alekseev proved that $i(G)$ is at most the number of\ninduced matchings of $G$.\n  This work generalises the aforementioned results to clutters. The right\nsubstructures in this setting are minors rather than induced subgraphs. Maximal\nindependent sets of a clutter $\\mathcal{H}$ are in one-to-one correspondence to\nthe sets of its blocker, $b(\\mathcal{H})$, hence $i(\\mathcal{H}) =\n|b(\\mathcal{H})|$. We show that\n  \\[\n  |b(\\mathcal{H})| \\le\n  \\sum_{m=0}^{k \\cdot f(r)}{|\\mathcal{H}| \\choose m} {r \\choose 2}^m\n  \\] for a $(k+1)K_2$-minor-free clutter $\\mathcal{H}$ where $f(r) =\n(2r-3)2^{r-2}$ and $r$ is the maximum size of a set in $\\mathcal{H}$. A key\nstep in the proofs is, similarly to Alekseev's result, showing that\n$i(\\mathcal{H})$ is bounded by the number of a substructure called\nsemi-matching, and then proving a dependence between the number of\nsemi-matchings and the number of minor matchings. Note that similarly to\ngraphs, a clutter containing a $kK_2$ minor has at least $2^k$ maximal\nindependent sets.\n  From a computational perspective, a polynomial number of independent sets is\nparticularly interesting. Our results lead to polynomial algorithms for\nrestricted instances of many problems including Set Cover and k-SAT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 19:32:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-21"}

We\nshow that EAGLE reproduces observed HI mass-environment trends very well, while\nsemi-analytic models typically overpredict the average HI masses in dense\nenvironments. The environmental processes act primarily as an on/off switch for\nthe HI content of satellites with stellar mass Mstar>10^9 Msun. At a fixed\nMstar, the fraction of HI-depleted satellites increases with increasing host\nhalo mass M200 in response to stronger environmental effects, while at a fixed\nM200 it decreases with increasing satellite Mstar as the gas is confined by\ndeeper gravitational potentials. HI-depleted satellites reside mostly, but not\nexclusively, within the virial radius r200 of their host halo. We investigate\nthe origin of these trends by focussing on three environmental mechanisms: ram\npressure stripping by the intra-group medium, tidal stripping by the host halo,\nand satellite-satellite encounters. By tracking back in time the evolution of\nthe HI-depleted satellites, we find that the most common cause of HI removal is\nsatellite encounters. The timescale for HI removal is typically less than 0.5\nGyr. Tidal stripping occurs in halos of M200<10^{14} Msun within half r200,\nwhile the other processes act also in more massive halos, generally within\nr200.

These streams penetrate supersonically through\nthe hot medium encompassed by a stable shock near the virial radius of the\ndark-matter halo. Our long-term goal is to explore the heating and dissipation\nrate of the streams and their fragmentation and possible breakup, in order to\nunderstand how galaxies are fed, and how this affects their star-formation rate\nand morphology. We present here the first step, where we analyze the linear\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) of a cold, dense slab or cylinder flowing\nthrough a hot, dilute medium in the transonic regime. The current analysis is\nlimited to the adiabatic case with no gravity and assuming equal pressure in\nthe stream and the medium. By analytically solving the linear dispersion\nrelation, we find a transition from a dominance of the familiar rapidly growing\nsurface modes in the subsonic regime to more slowly growing body modes in the\nsupersonic regime. The system is parameterized by three parameters: the density\ncontrast between the stream and the medium, the Mach number of stream velocity\nwith respect to the medium, and the stream width with respect to the halo\nvirial radius. We find that a realistic choice for these parameters places the\nstreams near the mode transition, with the KHI exponential-growth time in the\nrange 0.01-10 virial crossing times for a perturbation wavelength comparable to\nthe stream width. We confirm our analytic predictions with idealized\nhydrodynamical simulations. Our linear-KHI estimates thus indicate that KHI may\nin principle be effective in the evolution of streams by the time they reach\nthe galaxy.

Recent breakthroughs\nin ancient DNA sequencing have allowed for complete genome sequencing for two\nspecimens of woolly mammoths (Palkopoulou et al. 2015). One mammoth specimen is\nfrom a mainland population ~45,000 years ago when mammoths were plentiful. The\nsecond, a 4300 yr old specimen, is derived from an isolated population on\nWrangel island where mammoths subsisted with small effective population size\nmore than 43-fold lower than previous populations. These extreme differences in\neffective population size offer a rare opportunity to test nearly neutral\nmodels of genome architecture evolution within a single species. Using these\npreviously published mammoth sequences, we identify deletions, retrogenes, and\nnon-functionalizing point mutations. In the Wrangel island mammoth, we identify\na greater number of deletions, a larger proportion of deletions affecting gene\nsequences, a greater number of candidate retrogenes, and an increased number of\npremature stop codons. This accumulation of detrimental mutations is consistent\nwith genomic meltdown in response to low effective population sizes in the\ndwindling mammoth population on Wrangel island.

Traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) algorithms are characterized by deteriorating mixing times upon\nmesh-refinement, when the finite-dimensional approximations become more\naccurate. Such methods are typically forced to reduce step-sizes as the\ndiscretization gets finer, and thus are expensive as a function of dimension.\nRecently, a new class of MCMC methods with mesh-independent convergence times\nhas emerged. However, few of them take into account the geometry of the\nposterior informed by the data. At the same time, recently developed geometric\nMCMC algorithms have been found to be powerful in exploring complicated\ndistributions that deviate significantly from elliptic Gaussian laws, but are\nin general computationally intractable for models defined in infinite\ndimensions. In this work, we combine geometric methods on a finite-dimensional\nsubspace with mesh-independent infinite-dimensional approaches. Our objective\nis to speed up MCMC mixing times, without significantly increasing the\ncomputational cost per step (for instance, in comparison with the vanilla\npreconditioned Crank-Nicolson (pCN) method). This is achieved by using ideas\nfrom geometric MCMC to probe the complex structure of an intrinsic\nfinite-dimensional subspace where most data information concentrates, while\nretaining robust mixing times as the dimension grows by using pCN-like methods\nin the complementary subspace. The resulting algorithms are demonstrated in the\ncontext of three challenging inverse problems arising in subsurface flow, heat\nconduction and incompressible flow control.

On the experimental side,\nwe present results of the magnetization and dielectric permittivity\nmeasurements in the magnetic field. On the theoretical side, we construct the\nlow-energy Hubbard-type model for the magnetically active Co 3d bands in the\nWannier basis, using the input of first-principles electronic structure\ncalculations, solve this model in the mean-field Hartree-Fock approximation,\nand evaluate the electric polarization in terms of the Berry phase theory. Both\nexperimental and theoretical results suggest that Co4Ta2O9 is magnetically\nsofter than Co4Nb2O9. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the\nantiferromagnetic structure of Co4Ta2O9 can be easier deformed by the external\nmagnetic field, yielding larger polarization. This trend is indeed reproduced\nby our theoretical calculations, but does not seem to be consistent with the\nexperimental behavior of the polarization and dielectric permittivity. Thus, we\nsuggest that there should be a hidden mechanism controlling the ME coupling in\nthese compounds, probably related to the magnetic striction or a spontaneous\nchange of the magnetic structure, which breaks the inversion symmetry.\nFurthermore, we argue that unlike in other ME systems (e.g. Cr2O3), in Co4Nb2O9\nand Co4Ta2O9 there are two crystallographic sublattices, which contribute to\nthe ME effect. These contributions are found to be of the opposite sign and\ntend to compensate each other. The latter mechanism can be also used to control\nand reverse the electric polarization in these compounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 01:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-23"}

We study a sample of eight B[e] stars with uncertain evolutionary\nstatus to shed light on the origin of their circumstellar dust.\n  Methods. We performed a diagnostic analysis on the spectral energy\ndistribution beyond infrared wavelengths, and conducted a census of neighboring\nregion of each target to ascertain its evolutionary status.\n  Results. In comparison to pre-main sequence Herbig stars, these B[e] stars\nshow equally substantial excess emission in the near-infrared, indicative of\nexistence of warm dust, but much reduced excess at longer wavelengths, so the\ndusty envelopes should be compact in size. Isolation from star-forming regions\nexcludes the possibility of their pre-main sequence status. Six of our targets,\nincluding HD 50138, HD 45677, CD-245721, CD-49 3441, MWC 623, and HD 85567,\nhave been previously considered as FS CMa stars, whereas HD 181615/6 and HD\n98922 are added to the sample by this work. We argue that the circumstellar\ngrains of these isolated B[e] stars, already evolved beyond the pre-main\nsequence phase, should be formed in situ. This is in contrast to Herbig stars,\nwhich inherit large grains from parental molecular clouds. It has been thought\nthat HD 98922, in particular, is a Herbig star because of its large infrared\nexcess, but we propose it being in a more evolved stage. Because dust condenses\nout of stellar mass loss in an inside-out manner, the dusty envelope is\nspatially confined, and anisotropic mass flows, or anomalous optical properties\nof tiny grains, lead to the generally low line-of-sight extinction toward these\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 04:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

High angular resolution observations of the cold outer disk are\nlimited; we used ALMA to attempt a first survey of young brown dwarfs in the\n$\\rho$-Oph star-forming region.

With schematic maps, however, this\nsimplification is pushed far beyond the legibility threshold and is instead\nconstrained by functional need and resemblance. Moreover, stylistic geometry is\noften used to convey the schematic nature of the map. In this paper we explore\ndiscretized approaches to computing a schematic shape $S$ for a simple polygon\n$P$. We do so by overlaying a plane graph $G$ on $P$ as the solution space for\nthe schematic shape. Topological constraints imply that $S$ should describe a\nsimple polygon. We investigate two approaches, simple map matching and\nconnected face selection, based on commonly used similarity metrics.\n  With the former, $S$ is a simple cycle $C$ in $G$ and we quantify resemblance\nvia the Fr\\'echet distance. We prove that it is NP-hard to compute a cycle that\napproximates the minimal Fr\\'echet distance over all simple cycles in a plane\ngraph $G$. This result holds even if $G$ is a partial grid graph, if area\npreservation is required and if we assume a given sequence of turns is\nspecified.\n  With the latter, $S$ is a connected face set in $G$, quantifying resemblance\nvia the symmetric difference. Though the symmetric difference seems a less\nstrict measure, we prove that it is NP-hard to compute the optimal face set.\nThis result holds even if $G$ is full grid graph or a triangular or hexagonal\ntiling, and if area preservation is required. Moreover, it is independent of\nwhether we allow the set of faces to have holes or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 09:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

In contrast, in the FBL regime residual\ndecoding errors can not be avoided even when transmitting below the Shannon\nlimit. This makes the scheduling problem at the source more vulnerable to\ntransmission errors, where we investigate the trade-off between the choice of\nso called scheduling weights to avoid transmission errors and the resulting\ncoding rate. We show that the corresponding maximization of the throughput\nunder a reliability constraint can be solved efficiently by iterative\nalgorithms. Nevertheless, the optimal solution requires a recomputation of the\nscheduling weights prior to each transmission. Thus, we also study heuristics\nrelying on choosing the scheduling weights only once.

This is done with the objective to improve the quality of\nservice (QoS) of secondary users by taking advantage of constructive\ninterference in the secondary link. The beamformers are designed to minimize\nthe worst secondary user's symbol error probability (SEP) under constraints on\nthe instantaneous total transmit power, and the power of the instantaneous\ninterference in the primary link. The problem is formulated as a bivariate\nprobabilistic constrained programming (BPCP) problem. We show that the BPCP\nproblem can be transformed for practical SEPs into a convex optimization\nproblem that can be solved, e.g., by the barrier method.

In the\nnon-degenerate case, when the interactions satisfy a uniform $p$-growth\ncondition, the homogenization problem is well-understood. In this paper, we are\ninterested in a degenerate situation, when the interactions neither satisfy a\nuniform growth condition from above nor from below.

However, recognition is only one\naspect for understanding a language, another challenging and interesting task\nis to teach a machine to automatically write (pictographic) Chinese characters.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework by using the recurrent neural network\n(RNN) as both a discriminative model for recognizing Chinese characters and a\ngenerative model for drawing (generating) Chinese characters. To recognize\nChinese characters, previous methods usually adopt the convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) models which require transforming the online handwriting\ntrajectory into image-like representations. Instead, our RNN based approach is\nan end-to-end system which directly deals with the sequential structure and\ndoes not require any domain-specific knowledge. With the RNN system (combining\nan LSTM and GRU), state-of-the-art performance can be achieved on the\nICDAR-2013 competition database. Furthermore, under the RNN framework, a\nconditional generative model with character embedding is proposed for\nautomatically drawing recognizable Chinese characters. The generated characters\n(in vector format) are human-readable and also can be recognized by the\ndiscriminative RNN model with high accuracy. Experimental results verify the\neffectiveness of using RNNs as both generative and discriminative models for\nthe tasks of drawing and recognizing Chinese characters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 12:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

For the numerical solution of those equations, a $C^0$ finite\nelement method cannot apply directly on a moving mesh since the mixed\nderivatives of the finite element approximation may not be defined.

Validation based on Apache Storm demonstrates that our\napproach locates optimal configurations within a limited experimental budget,\nwith an improvement of SPS performance typically of at least an order of\nmagnitude compared to existing configuration algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 12:39:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

Based\non the behavior of active main sequence stars we speculate that the convective\nshells can trigger magnetic activity with a power of about 0.001 times the\nconvective luminosity. Magnetic flux tubes might buoy outward, and deposit\ntheir energy in the outer parts of the envelope. This in turn might lead to the\nexpansion of the envelope and to an enhanced mass loss rate. If a close binary\ncompanion is present, mass transfer might take place and lead to an energetic\noutburst.

In this paper, we investigate the X-ray and IR flux distributions\nof the flare events. Using a self-consistent calculation of the particle\ndistribution, we model the statistical properties of the flares. Based on a\nprevious work on single flares, we consider two families of models: pure\nsynchrotron models and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) models. We investigate\nthe effect of fluctuations in some relevant parameters (e.g. acceleration\nproperties, density, magnetic field) on the flux distributions. The\ndistribution of these parameters is readily derived from the flux distributions\nobserved at different wavelengths. In both scenarios, we find that fluctuations\nof the power injected in accelerated particles plays a major role. This must be\ndistributed as a power-law (with different indices in each model). In the\nsynchrotron dominated scenario, we derive the most extreme values of the\nacceleration power required to reproduce the brightest flares.

Synchronizers, the only traditional\ncountermeasure, exponentially decrease the odds of maintained metastability\nover time. Trading synchronization delay for an increased probability to\nresolve metastability to logical 0 or 1, they do not guarantee success.\n  We propose a fundamentally different approach: It is possible to contain\nmetastability by fine-grained logical masking so that it cannot infect the\nentire circuit. This technique guarantees a limited degree of metastability\nin---and uncertainty about---the output.\n  At the heart of our approach lies a time- and value-discrete model for\nmetastability in synchronous clocked digital circuits. Metastability is\npropagated in a worst-case fashion, allowing to derive deterministic\nguarantees, without and unlike synchronizers. The proposed model permits\npositive results and passes the test of reproducing Marino's impossibility\nresults.

The main ingredient is to prove that\nthe number of independent sets in bipartite graphs with $n$ vertices cannot be\ncomputed in time $exp(o(n))$ unless #ETH fails. In order to prove our results,\nwe use the block interpolation idea by Curticapean [7] and transfer it to\nsystems of linear equations that might not directly correspond to\ninterpolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 14:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

In order to model this\nphenomenon, a model involving a coupling between the local composition and the\nlocal curvature was proposed by Seul and Andelman in 1995. In addition to the\nfamiliar Cahn-Hilliard/Modica-Mortola energy, there are additional `forces'\nthat prevent large domains of homogeneous concentration. This is taken into\naccount by the bending energy of the membrane, which is coupled to the value of\nthe order parameter, and reflects the notion that surface tension associated\nwith a slightly curved membrane influences the localization of phases as the\ngeometry of the lipids has an effect on the preferred placement on the\nmembrane.\n  The main result of the paper is the study of the $\\Gamma$-convergence of this\nfamily of energy functionals, involving nonlocal as well as negative terms.\nSince the minimizers of the limiting energy have minimal interfaces, the\nphysical interpretation is that, within a sufficiently strong interspecies\nsurface tension and a large enough sample size, raft microdomains are not\nformed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 14:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

To correctly understand\nthe elastic modulus $M$, it is therefore necessary to take into account not\nonly the affine modulus $M_A$, but also the non-affine modulus $M_N$ that\narises from the non-affine deformation. In the present work, we study the bulk\n($M=K$) and shear ($M=G$) moduli in static jammed particulate packings over a\nrange of packing fractions $\\varphi$. One novelty of this work is to elucidate\nthe contribution of each vibrational mode to the non-affine $M_N$ through a\nmodal decomposition of the displacement and force fields. In the vicinity of\nthe (un)jamming transition, $\\varphi_{c}$, the vibrational density of states,\n$g(\\omega)$, shows a plateau in the intermediate frequency regime above a\ncharacteristic frequency $\\omega^\\ast$. We illustrate that this unusual feature\napparent in $g(\\omega)$ is reflected in the behavior of $M_N$: As $\\varphi\n\\rightarrow \\varphi_c$, where $\\omega^\\ast \\rightarrow 0$, those modes for\n$\\omega < \\omega^\\ast$ contribute less and less, while contributions from those\nfor $\\omega > \\omega^\\ast$ approach a constant value which results in $M_N$ to\napproach a critical value $M_{Nc}$, as $M_N-M_{Nc} \\sim \\omega^\\ast$. At\n$\\varphi_c$ itself, the bulk modulus attains a finite value $K_c=K_{Ac}-K_{Nc}\n> 0$, such that $K_{Nc}$ has a value that remains below $K_{Ac}$. In contrast,\nfor the critical shear modulus $G_c$, $G_{Nc}$ and $G_{Ac}$ approach the same\nvalue so that the total value becomes exactly zero, $G_c = G_{Ac}-G_{Nc} =0$.\nWe explore what features of the configurational and vibrational properties\ncause such the distinction between $K$ and $G$, allowing us to validate\nanalytical expressions for their critical values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 14:36:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

Central to this\nadvance are devices and materials that support ultra long-lived photonic and\nphononic excitations, providing access to novel regimes of classical and\nquantum dynamics based on tailorable photon-phonon coupling. Silica-based\ndevices have been at the forefront of such innovations for their ability to\nsupport optical excitations persisting for nearly 1 billion cycles, and for\ntheir low optical nonlinearity. Remarkably, acoustic phonon modes can persist\nfor a comparable number of cycles in crystalline solids at cryogenic\ntemperatures, permitting radical enhancement of photon-phonon coupling.\nHowever, it has not been possible to achieve similar phononic coherence times\nin silica, as silica becomes acoustically opaque at low temperatures. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that intrinsic forms of phonon dissipation are greatly\nreduced (by > 90%) using nonlinear saturation with continuous driving fields of\ndisparate frequencies. We demonstrate steady-state phononic spectral hole\nburning for the first time, and show that this technique for controlling\ndissipation in glass produces a wide-band transparency window. These studies\nwere carried out in a micro-scale fiber waveguide where the acoustic\nintensities necessary to manipulate phonon dissipation can be achieved with\noptically generated phonon fields of modest (nW) powers. We developed a simple\nmodel that explains both dissipative and dispersive changes produced by\nphononic saturation. In showing how the dissipative and dispersive properties\nof glasses can be manipulated using external fields, we open the door to\ndynamical phononic switching and the use of glasses as low loss phononic media\nwhich may enable new forms of controllable laser dynamics, information\nprocessing, and precision metrology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 15:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

The efficiency of these tensor-based methods will be\nillustrated with the aid of several different fluid dynamics problems such as\nthe von K\\'arm\\'an vortex street and the simulation of two merging vortices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 15:49:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 13:34:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

Covering arrays are used to test for\ninteractions among components systematically. A two-stage framework, providing\na number of concrete algorithms, is developed for the efficient construction of\ncovering arrays. %Our framework divides the construction in two stages. In the\nfirst stage, a time and memory efficient randomized algorithm covers most of\nthe interactions. In the second stage, a more sophisticated search covers the\nremainder in relatively few tests. In this way, the storage limitations of the\nsophisticated search algorithms are avoided; hence the range of the number of\ncomponents for which the algorithm can be applied is extended, without\nincreasing the number of tests. Many of the framework instantiations can be\ntuned to optimize a memory-quality trade-off, so that fewer tests can be\nachieved using more memory.

The successful application to the\nprecise reconstruction of the momentum vector, to the identification of the ion\nmasses and to the determination of the transport efficiency is demonstrated by\nin-beam tests. In the second part, an overview of the most relevant scientific\nachievements is given. Results from nuclear elastic and inelastic scattering as\nwell as from transfer and charge exchange reactions in a wide range of masses\nof the colliding systems and incident energies are shown.

One example is the recently observed signature of the long\nsearched Giant Pairing Vibration. Finally, the new challenging opportunities to\nuse MAGNEX for future experiments are briefly reported.

The flare was tracked from\ngamma-ray to near-infrared frequencies, including Fermi and Swift data as well\nas photometric and polarimetric data from several observatories. An intensive\nGASP-WEBT collaboration campaign in optical and NIR bands, with an addition of\npreviously unpublished archival data and extension through fall 2015, allows\ncomparison of this outburst with the previous activity period of this blazar in\n2004-2005. We find remarkable similarity between the optical and gamma-ray\nbehaviour of CTA 102 during the outburst, with a time lag between the two light\ncurves of ~1 hour, indicative of co-spatiality of the optical and gamma-ray\nemission regions. The relation between the gamma-ray and optical fluxes is\nconsistent with the SSC mechanism, with a quadratic dependence of the SSC\ngamma-ray flux on the synchrotron optical flux evident in the post-outburst\nstage. However, the gamma-ray/optical relationship is linear during the\noutburst; we attribute this to changes in the Doppler factor. A strong\nharder-when-brighter spectral dependence is seen both the in gamma-ray and\noptical non-thermal emission. This hardening can be explained by convexity of\nthe UV-NIR spectrum that moves to higher frequencies owing to an increased\nDoppler shift as the viewing angle decreases during the outburst stage. The\noverall pattern of Stokes parameter variations agrees with a model of a\nradiating blob or shock wave that moves along a helical path down the jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 11:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

To\nthis end, we propose a topic aware sequence-to-sequence (TA-Seq2Seq) model. The\nmodel utilizes topics to simulate prior knowledge of human that guides them to\nform informative and interesting responses in conversation, and leverages the\ntopic information in generation by a joint attention mechanism and a biased\ngeneration probability. The joint attention mechanism summarizes the hidden\nvectors of an input message as context vectors by message attention,\nsynthesizes topic vectors by topic attention from the topic words of the\nmessage obtained from a pre-trained LDA model, and let these vectors jointly\naffect the generation of words in decoding. To increase the possibility of\ntopic words appearing in responses, the model modifies the generation\nprobability of topic words by adding an extra probability item to bias the\noverall distribution. Empirical study on both automatic evaluation metrics and\nhuman annotations shows that TA-Seq2Seq can generate more informative and\ninteresting responses, and significantly outperform the-state-of-the-art\nresponse generation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 05:47:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 02:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}
