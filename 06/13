It is difficult, however, to achieve lane-level accuracy with\nlow-cost Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers due to the biased\nnoisy pseudo-range measurements. Approaches such as Differential GNSS can\nimprove the accuracy, but usually require an enormous amount of investment in\nbase stations. The emerging connected vehicle technologies provide an\nalternative approach to improving the localization accuracy. It has been shown\nin this paper that localization accuracy can be enhanced by fusing GNSS\ninformation within a group of connected vehicles and matching the configuration\nof the group to a digital map to eliminate the common bias in localization. A\nRao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) was used to jointly estimate the\ncommon biases of the pseudo-ranges and the vehicles positions. Multipath\nbiases, which are non-common to vehicles, were mitigated by a multi-hypothesis\ndetection-rejection approach. The temporal correlation was exploited through\nthe prediction-update process. The proposed approach was compared to the\nexisting static and smoothed static methods in the intersection scenario.\nSimulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduced the estimation\nerror by fifty percent and reduced the estimation variance by two orders of\nmagnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2016 16:17:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2016 04:14:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-01"}

This leads to a constrained weighted least squares problem that\nis solved in a sliding window fashion. Magnetometer information is currently\nonly used for initialisation, while the estimation itself works without\nmagnetometers. The method was tested on simulated, as well as, on real data,\ncaptured from a lower body configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2016 18:42:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-14"}

Typical MRI data sets\nconsist of T1- and T2-weighted imaging (T1WI, T2WI) along with advanced MRI\nparameters of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion weighted imaging\n(PWI) methods. Each of these parameters has distinct radiological-pathological\nmeaning. For example, DWI interrogates the movement of water in the tissue and\nPWI gives an estimate of the blood flow, both are critical measures during the\nevolution of stroke. In order to integrate these data and give an estimate of\nthe tissue at risk or damaged, we have developed advanced machine learning\nmethods based on unsupervised non-linear dimensionality reduction (NLDR)\ntechniques. NLDR methods are a class of algorithms that uses mathematically\ndefined manifolds for statistical sampling of multidimensional classes to\ngenerate a discrimination rule of guaranteed statistical accuracy and they can\ngenerate a two- or three-dimensional map, which represents the prominent\nstructures of the data and provides an embedded image of meaningful\nlow-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. In\nthis manuscript, we develop NLDR methods on high dimensional MRI data sets of\npreclinical animals and clinical patients with stroke. On analyzing the\nperformance of these methods, we observed that there was a high of similarity\nbetween multiparametric embedded images from NLDR methods and the ADC map and\nperfusion map. It was also observed that embedded scattergram of abnormal\n(infarcted or at risk) tissue can be visualized and provides a mechanism for\nautomatic methods to delineate potential stroke volumes and early tissue at\nrisk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2016 01:29:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-14"}

In\nthis paper, we exploit multiple networks with Gaussian graphs to encode the\nconnectivity patterns of a large number of features on the subpopulations. To\nuncover the heterogeneity of these structures across subpopulations, we suggest\na new framework of tuning-free heterogeneity pursuit (THP) via large-scale\ninference, where the number of networks is allowed to diverge. In particular,\ntwo new tests, the chi-based test and the linear functional-based test, are\nintroduced and their asymptotic null distributions are established. Under mild\nregularity conditions, we establish that both tests are optimal in achieving\nthe testable region boundary and the sample size requirement for the latter\ntest is minimal. Both theoretical guarantees and the tuning-free feature stem\nfrom efficient multiple-network estimation by our newly suggested approach of\nheterogeneous group square-root Lasso (HGSL) for high-dimensional\nmulti-response regression with heterogeneous noises. To solve this convex\nprogram, we further introduce a tuning-free algorithm that is scalable and\nenjoys provable convergence to the global optimum.

Recently, a domain-theoretic model of\nnominally-typed OOP was compared to well-known models of structurally-typed\nOOP. Combined, these comparisons provide a clear and deep account for the\nrelation between nominal and structural OO type systems that has not been\npresented before, and they help demonstrate the key value of nominal typing and\nnominal subtyping to OO developers and language designers.\n  We believe a clearer understanding of the key semantic advantage of pure\nnominal OO typing over pure structural OO typing can help remedy the existing\nschism.

Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by\na series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient\nand precisely targeted to the needs of the organism.

For high dimensional data, many regularized\nestimators are proposed under structural assumptions on the true covariance\nmatrix including sparsity. They are shown to be asymptotically consistent and\nrate-optimal in estimating the true covariance matrix and its structure.\nHowever, many of them do not take into account the PDness of the estimator and\nproduce a non-PD estimate. To achieve the PDness, researchers consider\nadditional regularizations (or constraints) on eigenvalues, which make both the\nasymptotic analysis and computation much harder. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple modification of the regularized covariance matrix estimator to make it\nPD while preserving the support. We revisit the idea of linear shrinkage and\npropose to take a convex combination between the first-stage estimator (the\nregularized covariance matrix without PDness) and a given form of diagonal\nmatrix. The proposed modification, which we denote as FSPD (Fixed Support and\nPositive Definiteness) estimator, is shown to preserve the asymptotic\nproperties of the first-stage estimator, if the shrinkage parameters are\ncarefully selected. It has a closed form expression and its computation is\noptimization-free, unlike existing PD sparse estimators. In addition, the FSPD\nis generic in the sense that it can be applied to any non-PD matrix including\nthe precision matrix. The FSPD estimator is numerically compared with other\nsparse PD estimators to understand its finite sample properties as well as its\ncomputational gain. It is also applied to two multivariate procedures relying\non the covariance matrix estimator -- the linear minimax classification problem\nand the Markowitz portfolio optimization problem -- and is shown to\nsubstantially improve the performance of both procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2016 05:21:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 07:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

Although a key to understanding\nsome phenomena may be the Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction, its\nmicroscopic origin is unclear. To clarify the microscopic origin, we\nconstructed a $t_{2g}$-orbital model with the kinetic energy, the\ntrigonal-distortion potential, the multiorbital Hubbard interactions, and the\n$LS$ coupling, and derived the low-energy effective Hamiltonian for a $d^{1}$\nMott insulator with the weak $LS$ coupling.

Those are qualitatively different from the\neven-mirror hopping integrals, existing even with the inversion center. We next\nshow that the second-order perturbation using the kinetic terms leads to the\nferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic super exchange interactions. Then, we\nshow the most important result: the third-order perturbation terms using the\ncombination of the even-mirror hopping integral, the odd-mirror hopping\nintegral, and the $LS$ coupling causes the DM interaction due to the\nmirror-mixing effect, where those hopping integrals are necessary to obtain the\nantisymmetric kinetic exchange and the $LS$ coupling is necessary to excite the\norbital angular momentum at one of two sites.

In the first step, with the extracted hierarchical\nfeatures, a bipartite graph is constructed to describe the content similarity\nfor pixel partition to produce superpixels. In the second step, superpixels in\nthe input/reference image are rematched to form a new superpixel-based\nbipartite graph, and superpixel-level correspondences are generated by a\nbipartite matching.

This severely affects the error-covariance of the EoR\n21-cm power spectrum which is important for predicting the prospects of a\ndetection with ongoing and future experiments. Most earlier works have assumed\nthat the EoR 21-cm signal is a Gaussian random field where (1) the error\nvariance depends only on the power spectrum and the number of Fourier modes in\nthe particular $k$ bin, and (2) the errors in the different $k$ bins are\nuncorrelated.

The idea is to express the mean-density\nprofile as a simple functional form, and obtain the local density by\nderivative. The model involves a concentration parameter c analogous to the NFW\nprofile. More flexibility is provided by a sum of two such functions, with\nconcentrations c_1 and c_2.

The progression of AF with\nage, from short self-terminating episodes to persistence, varies between\nindividuals and is poorly understood. An inability to understand and predict\nvariation in AF progression has resulted in less patient-specific therapy.\nLikewise, it has been a challenge to relate the microstructural features of\nheart muscle tissue (myocardial architecture) with the emergent temporal\nclinical patterns of AF. We use a simple model of activation wavefront\npropagation on an anisotropic structure, mimicking heart muscle tissue, to show\nhow variation in AF behaviour arises naturally from microstructural differences\nbetween individuals. We show that the stochastic nature of progressive\ntransversal uncoupling of muscle strands (e.g., due to fibrosis or gap\njunctional remodelling), as occurs with age, results in variability in AF\nepisode onset time, frequency, duration, burden and progression between\nindividuals. This is consistent with clinical observations. The uncoupling of\nmuscle strands can cause critical architectural patterns in the myocardium.\nThese critical patterns anchor micro-re-entrant wavefronts and thereby trigger\nAF. It is the number of local critical patterns of uncoupling as opposed to\nglobal uncoupling that determines AF progression.

We analyze simulated diffraction\npatterns in terms of the incidence channel, the impact energy associated with\nthe motion normal to the surface, and the relevance of Van der Waals (VdW)\ninteractions. We then contrast our simulations with experimental patterns for\ndifferent incidence conditions. Our most important finding is that, for normal\nenergies lower than 0.5 eV and incidence along the <100> channel, the inclusion\nof Van der Waals interactions in our potential energy surface yields a greatly\nimproved accord between simulations and experiments. This agreement strongly\nsuggests a non-negligible role of Van der Waals interactions in H/LiF(001)\nGIFAD in the low-to-intermediate normal energy regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2016 13:16:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

These\nsolitons mobile in a plane perpendicular to the 1D OL trap can have both\nrepulsive and attractive contact interactions. The dark-in-bright solitons are\nthe excited states of the bright solitons. The solitons, when subject to a\nsmall perturbation, exhibit sustained breathing oscillation. The dark-in-bright\nsolitons can be created by phase imprinting a bright soliton. At medium\nvelocities the collision between two solitons is found to be quasi elastic.The\nresults are demonstrated by a numerical simulation of the three-dimensional\nmean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation in three spatial dimensions employing\nrealistic interaction parameters for a dipolar $^{164}$Dy BEC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2016 13:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-22"}

The operators are generally non-normal, and their matrix\nrepresentation has a characteristic off-diagonal decay. Based on a result of\nChandler-Wilde, Chonchaiya and Lindner for tridiagonal infinite matrices, we\ndemonstrate an efficient algorithm for the computation of upper and lower\nbounds on the pseudospectrum of operators that are merely norm limits of band\nmatrices -- the so-called band-dominated operators. After approximation by a\nband matrix and fixing a parameter $n\\in{\\mathbb N}$, one looks at $n$\nconsecutive columns $\\{k+1,...,k+n\\}$, $k\\in{\\mathbb Z}$, of the corresponding\nmatrix and computes the smallest singular value of that section via QR\nfactorization. We here propose a QR factorization by a sequence of Givens\nrotations in such a way that a large part of the computation can be reused for\nthe factorization of the next submatrix -- when $k$ is replaced by $k+1$. The\ncomputational cost for the next factorization(s) is ${\\mathcal O}(nd)$ as\nopposed to a naive implementation with ${\\mathcal O}(nd^2)$, where $d$ is the\nbandwidth.

ALMA observations of the high-mass star-forming region G35.20-0.74N\nhave revealed the presence of a Keplerian disk in core B rotating about a\nmassive object of 18 Msun, as computed from the velocity field. The luminosity\nof such a massive star would be comparable to (or higher than) the luminosity\nof the whole star-forming region.

To establish the origin of the free-free\nemission from core B and investigate the existence of a binary system at the\ncenter of this massive core and the possible precession of the radio jet.\nMethods. We carried out VLA continuum observations of G35.20-0.74N at 2 cm in\nthe B configuration and at 1.3 cm and 7 mm in the A and B configurations. The\nbandwidth at 7 mm covers the CH3OH maser line at 44.069 GHz. Continuum images\nat 6 and 3.6 cm in the A configuration were obtained from the VLA archive.

This is being done by\nsimulating klystron performances for various cavity parameters including the\nnumber of cavities, inter-cavity distance, and cavity tuning frequencies. The\nsimulation has been done with the FCI (field charge interaction) code aided by\na matlab script for scanning input parameters. Initial set of scan parameters\nwas obtained by benchmarking the E3762 klystron. It was possible to obtain\noptimized design parameters with better efficiency for a cavity system adopting\na multi-cell output cavity. However, the multi-cell output cavity is prone to\nproduce a self-oscillation due to the prolonged (several half RF periods)\nbeam-field interaction along its multiple gaps. We have checked the feasibility\nof the optimization by evaluating the stability of output cavity system. The\nstability is given by the ratio of a beam-loading conductance to the circuit\nconductance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2016 10:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

We obtain general\nrelativistic solutions for neutron and proto-neutron stars endowed with a\npoloidal magnetic field by solving Einstein-Maxwell field equations in a\nself-consistent way. As the neutrino chemical potential decreases in value over\ntime, this alters the chemical equilibrium and the composition inside the star,\nleading to a change in the structure and in the particle population of these\nobjects. We find that the magnetic field deforms the star and significantly\nalters the number of trapped neutrinos in the stellar interior, together with\nstrangeness content and temperature in each evolution stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2016 12:34:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 07:15:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

Here, we show that a large\nclass of spatially-extended dynamical systems driven by intrinsic noise can\nexhibit giant amplification, yielding patterns whose amplitude is comparable to\nthat of deterministic Turing instabilities. The giant amplification results\nfrom the interplay between noise and non-orthogonal eigenvectors of the linear\nstability matrix, yielding transients that grow with time, and which, when\ndriven by the ever-present intrinsic noise, lead to persistent large amplitude\npatterns. This mechanism provides a robust basis for fluctuation-induced\nbiological pattern formation based on the Turing mechanism, without requiring\nfine tuning of diffusion constants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2016 17:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}
