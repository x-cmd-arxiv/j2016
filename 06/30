They lead to a discretization matrix that is\ntypically dense and large: its size and condition number grow with increasing\nfrequency. Yet, high frequency scattering problems are intrinsically local in\nnature, which is well represented by highly localized rays bouncing around.\nAsymptotic methods can be used to reduce the size of the linear system, even\nmaking it frequency independent, by explicitly extracting the oscillatory\nproperties from the solution using ray tracing or analogous techniques.\nHowever, ray tracing becomes expensive or even intractable in the presence of\n(multiple) scattering obstacles with complicated geometries. In this paper, we\nstart from the same discretization that constructs the fully resolved large and\ndense matrix, and achieve asymptotic compression by explicitly localizing the\nGreen's function instead. This results in a large but sparse matrix, with a\nfaster associated matrix-vector product and, as numerical experiments indicate,\na much improved condition number. Though an appropriate localisation of the\nGreen's function also depends on asymptotic information unavailable for general\ngeometries, we can construct it adaptively in a frequency sweep from small to\nlarge frequencies in a way which automatically takes into account a general\nincident wave. We show that the approach is robust with respect to non-convex,\nmultiple and even near-trapping domains, though the compression rate is clearly\nlower in the latter case. Furthermore, in spite of its asymptotic nature, the\nmethod is robust with respect to low-order discretizations such as piecewise\nconstants, linears or cubics, commonly used in applications.

To answer these questions, we propose the Disease\nTrajectory Map (DTM), a novel probabilistic model that learns low-dimensional\nrepresentations of sparse and irregularly sampled time series.

The shear observed in filament channels represents magnetic helicity,\nwhile the smoothness of the coronal loops indicates an apparent lack of\nmagnetic helicity in the rest of the corona. At the same time, models that\nattempt to explain the high temperatures observed in these coronal loops\nrequire magnetic energy, in the form of twist, to be injected at the\nphotosphere. In addition to magnetic energy, this twist also represents\nmagnetic helicity. Unlike magnetic energy, magnetic helicity is conserved under\nreconnection, and is consequently expected to accumulate and be observed in the\ncorona. However, filament channels, rather than the coronal loops, are the\nlocations in the corona where magnetic helicity is observed, and it manifests\nitself in the form of shear, rather than twist. This naturally raises the\nquestion: if magnetic helicity needs to be injected to heat coronal loops, why\nis it only observed in filament channels, while coronal loops are observed to\nbe laminar and smooth? This thesis addresses this question using a series of\nnumerical simulations that demonstrate that magnetic helicity is transported\nthroughout the solar corona by magnetic reconnection in such a way that it\naccumulates above PILs, forming filament channels, and leaving the rest of the\ncorona generally smooth. In the process, it converts magnetic energy into heat,\naccounting for the large observed temperatures. This thesis presents a model\nfor the formation of filament channels in the solar corona and the presence of\nsmooth, hot coronal loops, and shows how the transport of magnetic helicity\nthroughout the solar corona by magnetic reconnection is responsible for both of\nthese phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2016 17:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-30"}

The conventional\nextinction law with a low infrared extinction is characteristic of only a thin\nlayer no farther than 100 pc from the Galactic plane and of two thin layers\nnear $Z=-600$ and $+500$ pc. Far from the Galactic plane, in the Galactic halo,\nthe infrared extinction law is different: the extinction in the $Ks$, $W1$,\n$W2$, $W3$, and $W4$ bands is, respectively, $0.17$, $0.16$, $0.16$, $0.07$,\nand $0.03$ of the extinction in the $V$ band. The accuracy of these\ncoefficients is $0.03$. If the extinction law reflects primarily the grain size\ndistribution, then the fraction of large dust grains far from the Galactic\nplane is greater than that in the circumsolar interstellar medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2016 18:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}

An obvious question is if this should continue to be\nthe focus going forward? To try to assess what are the main trends, what has\nhappened the last 5 years and what may be promising directions for the future a\nsmall CCC sponsored study was launched to have two workshops, one in Washington\nDC (March 5th, 2016) and another in San Francisco, CA (March 11th, 2016).

Recently, this idea has been extended to\ncosmological scales by studies modelling the habitability of the local Universe\nin its entirety (e.g. Dayal et al. 2015; Li & Zhang 2015). However, all of\nthese studies have solely focused on estimating the potentially detrimental\neffects of either Type II supernovae (SNII) or Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs),\nignoring the contributions from Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and active galactic\nnuclei (AGN). In this study we follow two different approaches, based on (i)\nthe amplitude of deleterious radiation and (ii) the total planet-hosting volume\nirradiated by deleterious radiation. We simultaneously track the contributions\nfrom the key astrophysical sources (SNII, SNIa, AGN and GRBs) for the entire\nUniverse, for both scenarios, to determine its habitability through 13.8\nbillion years of cosmic time. We find that SNII dominate the total radiation\nbudget and the volume irradiated by deleterious radiation at any cosmic epoch\nclosely followed by SNIa (that contribute half as much as SNII), with GRBs and\nAGN making up a negligible portion (<1%). Secondly, as a result of the total\nmass in stars (or the total number of planets) slowly building-up with time and\nthe total deleterious radiation density, and volume affected, falling-off after\nthe first 3 billion years, we find that the Universe has steadily increased in\nhabitability through cosmic time. We find that, depending on the exact model\nassumptions, the Universe is 2.5 to 20 times more habitable today compared to\nwhen life first appeared on the Earth 4 billion years ago. We find that this\nincrease in habitability will persist until the final stars die out over the\nnext hundreds of billions of years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2016 19:10:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-30"}

As in the classical theory of hyperbolic equations where a\nnon-convex flux leads to non-classical solution structures, a non-convex linear\ndispersion relation provides an intriguing dispersive hydrodynamic analogue.\nHere, the fifth order Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, also known as the\nKawahara equation, a classical model for shallow water waves, is shown to be a\nuniversal model of Eulerian hydrodynamics with higher order dispersive effects.\nUtilizing asymptotic methods and numerical computations, this work classifies\nthe long-time behavior of solutions for step-like initial data. For convex\ndispersion, the result is a dispersive shock wave (DSW), qualitatively and\nquantitatively bearing close resemblance to the KdV DSW. For non-convex\ndispersion, three distinct dynamic regimes are observed. For small jumps, a\nperturbed KdV DSW with positive polarity and orientation is generated,\naccompanied by small amplitude radiation from an embedded solitary wave leading\nedge, termed a radiating DSW or RDSW. For moderate jumps, a crossover regime is\nobserved with waves propagating forward and backward from the sharp transition\nregion. For jumps exceeding a critical threshold, a new type of DSW is observed\nwe term a translating DSW or TDSW. The TDSW consists of a traveling wave that\nconnects a partial, non-monotonic, negative solitary wave at the trailing edge\nto an interior nonlinear periodic wave. Its speed, a generalized\nRankine-Hugoniot jump condition, is determined by the far-field structure of\nthe traveling wave. The TDSW is resolved at the leading edge by a harmonic\nwavepacket moving with the linear group velocity. The non-classical TDSW\nexhibits features common to both dissipative and dispersive shock waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2016 19:35:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2016 18:04:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 16:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-14"}

A\nstatistically significant correlation between the Eddington ratio,\n{\\lambda}$_{Edd}$, and the X-ray power-law index, {\\Gamma}, observed in\nunobscured AGN offers an estimate of their growth rate from X-ray spectroscopy\n(albeit with large scatter). However, since X-rays undergo reprocessing by\nCompton scattering and photoelectric absorption when the line-of-sight to the\ncentral engine is heavily obscured, the recovery of the intrinsic {\\Gamma} is\nchallenging. Here we study a sample of local, predominantly Compton-thick\nmegamaser AGN, where the black hole mass, and thus Eddington luminosity, are\nwell known. We compile results on X-ray spectral fitting of these sources with\nsensitive high-energy (E> 10 keV) NuSTAR data, where X-ray torus models which\ntake into account the reprocessing effects have been used to recover the\nintrinsic {\\Gamma} values and X-ray luminosities, L$_X$.

This raises the question how similar the neural representation of the\ncommunication sounds is across these gradients of neural preferences, and\nwhether it also changes gradually. Multi-unit cluster spike trains were\nrecorded from guinea pigs presented with a spectrotemporally rich set of eleven\nspecies-specific communication sounds.

We found that\nsimilarity of responses is dependent on the neurons' spatial distance for\nsimilarly and differently frequency-tuned neurons, and that similarity\ndecreases gradually with spatial distance. Significant neural correlations\nexist, and contribute to the response similarity.

The\nHydrodynamic Scaling Model differs from some other treatments of non-dilute\npolymer solutions in that it takes polymer dynamics up to high concentrations\nto be dominated by solvent-mediated hydrodynamic interactions, with chain\ncrossing constraints presumed to create at most secondary corrections. Many\nother models take the contrary stand, namely that chain crossing constraints\ndominate the dynamics of nondilute polymer solutions, while hydrodynamic\ninteractions only create secondary corrections. This article begins with a\nhistorical review. We then consider single-chain behavior, in particular the\nKirkwood-Riseman model; contradictions between the Kirkwood-Riseman and more\nfamiliar Rouse-Zimm models are emphasized. An extended Kirkwood-Riseman model\nthat gives interchain hydrodynamic interactions is developed and applied to\ngenerate pseudovirial series for the self-diffusion coefficient and the\nlow-shear viscosity.

Such ordered granular media represent an interesting new class\nof nonlinear acoustic metamaterials, since they exhibit essentially nonlinear\nacoustics and have been designated as 'sonic vacua' due to the fact that their\ncorresponding speed of sound (as defined in classical acoustics) is zero.This\npaves the way for essentially nonlinear and energy-dependent acoustics with no\ncounterparts in linear theory.

Analyzing the circular geodesic of a point particle in\nstring frame, we obtain the orbital velocity as a function of\n$R/(M_{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\infty}}G)$ which is the dimensionless radial\nvariable normalized by mass. The rotation curve generically features a maximum\nand thus non-Keplerian over a finite range, while becoming asymptotically\nKeplerian at infinity, $R/(M_{\\scriptscriptstyle{\\infty}}G)\\rightarrow \\infty$.\nThe adoption of the string frame rather than Einstein frame is the consequence\nof the fundamental symmetry principle.

We propose monitoring plans for\nknown and unknown teams based on generalizations of the exponentially weighted\nmoving average (EWMA) statistic. For unknown teams, we propose an efficient\nneighborhood-based search to estimate a collection of candidate teams. This\nprocedure dramatically reduces the computational complexity of an exhaustive\nsearch. Our procedure consists of two steps: communication counts between\nactors are first smoothed using a multivariate EWMA strategy. Densely connected\nteams are identified as candidates using a neighborhood search approach. These\ncandidate teams are then monitored using a surveillance plan derived from a\ngeneralized EWMA statistic. Monitoring plans are established for collaborative\nteams, teams with a dominant leader, as well as for global outbreaks. We\nconsider weighted heterogeneous dynamic networks, where the expected\ncommunication count between each pair of actors is potentially different across\npairs and time, as well as homogeneous networks, where the expected\ncommunication count is constant across time and actors. Our monitoring plans\nare evaluated on a test bed of simulated networks as well as on the U.S. Senate\nco-voting network, which models the Senate voting patterns from 1857 to 2015.\nOur analysis suggests that our surveillance strategies can efficiently detect\nrelevant and significant changes in dynamic networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2016 23:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-01"}

We then compare\nthem with theoretical pulsation modes, which correspond to stellar evolutionary\nmodels with various sets of initial metallicity and stellar mass, to find the\nbest-fitting model. Results. There are three multiplets including two complete\ntriplets and one incomplete quintuplet, in which mode identifications for\nspherical harmonic degree $l$ and azimuthal number $m$ are unique. The\ncorresponding rotational period of HD 50844 is found to be\n2.44$^{+0.13}_{-0.08}$ days. The physical parameters of HD 50844 are well\nlimited in a small region by three modes identified as nonradial ones\n($f_{11}$, $f_{22}$, and $f_{29}$) and by the fundamental radial mode\n($f_{4}$). Our results show that the three nonradial modes ($f_{11}$, $f_{22}$,\nand $f_{29}$) are all mixed modes, which mainly represent the property of the\nhelium core. The fundamental radial mode ($f_{4}$) mainly represents the\nproperty of the stellar envelope. In order to fit these four pulsation modes,\nboth the helium core and the stellar envelope must be matched to the actual\nstructure of HD 50844. Finally, the mass of the helium core of HD 50844 is\nestimated to be 0.173 $\\pm$ 0.004 $M_{\\odot}$ for the first time. The physical\nparameters of HD 50844 are determined to be $M=$ 1.81 $\\pm$ 0.01 $M_{\\odot}$,\n$Z=$ 0.008 $\\pm$ 0.001. $T_{\\rm eff}=$ 7508 $\\pm$ 125 K, log$g=$ 3.658 $\\pm$\n0.004, $R=$ 3.300 $\\pm$ 0.023 $R_{\\odot}$, $L=$ 30.98 $\\pm$ 2.39 $L_{\\odot}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2016 01:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in the flare emissions are\ncommonly observed in a wide range of wavelengths. Recent observations have\nfound that fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves are quasi-periodically\nemitted from some flaring sites (quasi-periodic propagating fast-mode\nmagnetoacoustic waves; QPFs). Both of QPPs and QPFs imply a cyclic disturbance\noriginating from the flaring sites. However, the physical mechanisms remain\npuzzling. By performing a set of two-dimensional MHD simulations of a solar\nflare, we discovered the local oscillation above the loops filled with\nevaporated plasma (above-the-loop-top region) and the generation of QPFs from\nsuch oscillating regions. Unlike all previous models for QPFs, our model\nincludes essential physics for solar flares, such as magnetic reconnection,\nheat conduction, and chromospheric evaporation. We revealed that QPFs can be\nspontaneously excited by the above-the-loop-top oscillation. It was found that\nthis oscillation is controlled by the backflow of the reconnection outflow. The\nnew model revealed that flare loops and the above-the-loop-top region are full\nof shocks and waves, which is different from the previous expectations based on\na standard flare model and previous simulations.

So far, it is not clear whether\nthis effect is due to the chirality of the phase and the molecules or only to\nthe chirality of the director field. Here, we report the continuous rotation in\na temperature gradient of nematic droplets of a lyotropic chromonic liquid\ncrystal featuring a twisted bipolar configuration. The achiral nature of the\nmolecular components leads to a random handedness of the spontaneous twist,\nresulting in the coexistence of droplets rotating in the two senses, with\nspeeds proportional to the temperature gradient and inversely proportional to\nthe droplet radius. This result shows that a macroscopic twist of the director\nfield is sufficient to induce a rotation of the droplets, and that the phase\nand the molecules do not need to be chiral. This suggests that one can also\nexplain the Lehmann rotation in cholesteric liquid crystals without introducing\nthe Leslie thermomechanical coupling -- only present in chiral mesophases.

The N(H2O)/N(H2O+) ratios of 1.4-5.6 indicate an origin of\nthe lines in diffuse gas, and the N(OH+)/N(H2O+) ratios of 1.6-3.1 indicate a\nlow H2 fraction (~11%) in the gas.\n  Adopting recent Galactic values for the average gas density and the\nionization efficiency, we find ionization rates for our sample galaxies of\n~3x10^-16 s^-1 which are similar to the value for the Galactic disk, but ~10x\nbelow that of the Galactic Center and ~100x below estimates for AGN from\nexcited-state H3O+ lines. We conclude that the ground-state lines of water and\nits associated ions probe primarily non-nuclear gas in the disks of these\ncentrally active galaxies. Our data thus provide evidence for a decrease in\nionization rate by a factor of ~10 from the nuclei to the disks of galaxies, as\nfound before for the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2016 10:54:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-14"}

Such a soft film impregnated with magnetic particles can be\nmodulated with an external electromagnetic field that produces a vast array of\ntopographical landscapes with varying surface curvature, which, in conjunction\nwith capillarity, can direct and control motion of water droplets efficiently\nand accurately. When a thin layer of oil is present on this film that is\ndeformed locally, a centrosymmetric wedge is formed. A water droplet placed on\nthis oil laden film becomes asymmetrically deformed thus producing a gradient\nof Laplace pressure within the droplet setting it to motion. A simple theory is\npresented that accounts for the droplet speed in terms of such geometric\nvariables as the volume of the droplet and the thickness of the oil film\ncovering the soft elastomeric film, as well as such material variables as the\nviscosity of the oil and interfacial tension of the oil-water interfaces.\nFollowing the verification of the theoretical result using well-controlled\nmodel systems, we demonstrate how the electromagnetically controlled\nelasto-capillary force can be used to manipulate the motion of single and/or\nmultiple droplets on the surface of the elastomeric film and how such\nelementary operations as drop fusion and thermally addressed chemical\ntransformation can be carried out in aqueous droplets. It is expected that the\nresulting drop fluidics would be suitable for digital control of drop motion by\nsimply switching on and off the electromagnetic fields applied at different\npositions underneath the elastomeric film. We anticipate that this method of\ndirecting and manipulating water droplets is poised for its applications in\nvarious biochemical reaction engineering, an example of which is Polymerase\nChain Reaction (PCR).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2016 11:12:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-01"}

This map is\ncompared with the 2D reddening map by Schlegel et al. (1998), the 3D extinction\nmap at high latitudes by Jones et al. (2011), and the analytical extinction\nmodels by Arenou et al. (1992) and Gontcharov (2009). In all cases, we have\nfound good agreement and show that there are no systematic errors in the new\nmap everywhere except the direction toward the Galactic center. We have found\nthat the map by Schlegel et al. (1998) reaches saturation near the Galactic\nequator at $E_{(B-V)}>0.8^m$, has a zero-point error and systematic errors\ngradually increasing with reddening, and among the analytical models those that\ntake into account the extinction in the Gould Belt are more accurate. Our\nextinction map shows that it is determined by reddening variations at low\nlatitudes and $R_V$ variations at high ones. This naturally explains the\ncontradictory data on the correlation or anticorrelation between reddening and\n$R_V$ available in the literature. There is a correlation in a thin layer near\nthe Galactic equator, because both reddening and $R_V$ here increase toward the\nGalactic center. There is an anticorrelation outside this layer, because higher\nvalues of $R_V$ correspond to lower reddening at high and middle latitudes.\nSystematic differences in sizes and other properties of the dust grains in\ndifferent parts of the Galaxy manifest themselves in this way. The largest\nstructures within the nearest kiloparsec, including the Local Bubble, the Gould\nBelt, the Great Tunnel, the Scorpius, Perseus, Orion, and other complexes, have\nmanifested themselves in the constructed map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2016 13:40:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-04"}

For superconductors, the response\nto disorder reveals crucial information about the internal gap symmetries of\nthe condensate, and thereby the pairing mechanism itself. The destruction of\nsuperconductivity by disorder is traditionally described by Abrikosov-Gor'kov\n(AG) theory, which however ignores spatial modulations and ceases to be valid\nwhen impurities interfere, and interactions become important.

According to Unruh's prediction, fluctuations\nmeasured in such a way must be thermal. Moreover, following Takagi's inversion\ntheorem, they will obey the Bose-Einstein distribution, which will smoothly\ntransform into the Fermi-Dirac as one of the dimensions of the lattice is\nreduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2016 14:23:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 08:30:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2016 14:17:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 16:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

Upper and (almost) tight lower\nbounds have been given for the quantum violation of these Bell inequalities in\nterms of number of outputs of the distribution, number of inputs, and the\ndimension of the shared quantum states. In this work, we revisit normalized\nBell inequalities together with another family: inefficiency-resistant Bell\ninequalities. To be inefficiency-resistant, the Bell value must not exceed 1\nfor any local distribution, including those that can abort. This makes the Bell\ninequality resistant to the detection loophole, while a normalized Bell\ninequality is resistant to general local noise. Both these families of Bell\ninequalities are closely related to communication complexity lower bounds. We\nshow how to derive large violations from any gap between classical and quantum\ncommunication complexity, provided the lower bound on classical communication\nis proven using these lower bound techniques. This leads to\ninefficiency-resistant violations that can be exponential in the size of the\ninputs.

An important exception to\nthis rule are states which, while being at high energy, maintain a low entropy.\nSuch states can interestingly still display features of quantum criticality,\nespecially in one dimension. Here, we consider high-energy states in\nanisotropic Heisenberg quantum spin chains obtained by splitting the ground\nstate's magnon Fermi sea into separate pieces. Using methods based on\nintegrability, we provide a detailed study of static and dynamical spin-spin\ncorrelations. These carry distinctive signatures of the Fermi sea splittings,\nwhich would be observable in eventual experimental realizations. Going further,\nwe employ a multi-component Tomonaga-Luttinger model in order to predict the\nasymptotics of static correlations. For this effective field theory, we fix all\nuniversal exponents from energetics, and all non-universal correlation\nprefactors using finite-size scaling of matrix elements. The correlations\nobtained directly from integrability and those emerging from the Luttinger\nfield theory description are shown to be in extremely good correspondence, as\nexpected, for the large distance asymptotics, but surprisingly also for the\nshort distance behavior.

A potential difference applied between certain ionic\nbilayers made from insulating graphitic materials such as BN, ZnO and AlN could\nreduce gap sizes, turning them into useful semiconductors. On the other hand,\nopening of a small semiconducting gap occurs in graphene bilayers under applied\nfield. The aim here is to investigate to what extent substrate induced\nelectron-phonon interactions (EPIs) modify this gap change. We examine EPIs in\nseveral lattice configurations, using a perturbative approach. The typical\neffect of EPIs on the ionic bilayers is an undesirable gap widening. The size\nof this gap change varies considerably with lattice structure and the magnitude\nof the bias. When bias is larger than the non-interacting gap size, EPIs have\nthe smallest effect on the bandgap, especially in configurations with\n$AA^{\\prime}$ and $AB$ structures. Thus careful selection of substrate, lattice\nconfiguration and bias strength to minimise the effects of EPIs could be\nimportant for optimising the properties of electronic devices.

Understanding and\nquantifying these differences is a necessary first step towards developing\npredictive methods derived from network topology. Here, we present a method to\nquantify individual differences in brain functional dynamics by applying\nhypergraph analysis, a method from dynamic network theory. Using a summary\nmetric derived from the hypergraph formalism---hypergraph cardinality---we\ninvestigate individual variations in two separate and complementary data sets.\nThe first data set (\"multi-task\") consists of 77 individuals engaging in four\nconsecutive cognitive tasks. We observed that hypergraph cardinality exhibits\nvariation across individuals while remaining consistent within individuals\nbetween tasks; moreover, one of the memory tasks evinced a marginally\nsignificant correspondence between hypergraph cardinality and age. This finding\nmotivated a similar analysis of the second data set (\"age-memory\"), in which 95\nindividuals of varying ages performed a memory task with a similar structure to\nthe multi-task memory task. With the increased age range in the age-memory data\nset, the correlation between hypergraph cardinality and age correspondence\nbecomes significant. We discuss these results in the context of the well-known\nfinding linking age with network structure, and suggest that age-related\nchanges in brain function can be better understood by taking an integrative\napproach that incorporates information about the dynamics of functional\ninteractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2016 15:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}
