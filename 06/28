If all the scalars are heavy,\nsupersymmetric contribution to the leptonic $g-2$ moments will be significantly\nreduced. On the other hand the Brookhaven experiment indicates a 3sigma\ndeviation from the standard model prediction. Here we analyze the leptonic\n$g-2$ moments in an extended MSSM model with inclusion of a vector like\nleptonic generation which brings in new sources of CP violation. In this work\nwe consider the contributions to the leptonic $g-2$ moments arising from the\nexchange of charginos and neutralinos, sleptons and mirror sleptons, and from\nthe exchange of $W$ and $Z$ bosons and of leptons and mirror leptons. We focus\nspecifically on the $g-2$ moments for the muon and the electron where sensitive\nmeasurements exist. Here it is shown that one can get consistency with the\ncurrent data on $g-2$ under the Higgs boson mass constraint. Dependence of the\nmoments on CP phases from the extended sector are analyzed and it is shown that\nthey are sensitively dependent on the phases from the new sector. It is shown\nthat the corrections to the leptonic moments arising from the extended MSSM\nsector will be non-vanishing even if the SUSY scale extends into the PeV\nregion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 16:03:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

Such devices offer a natural\ntransition between short-term plasticity (STP) and long-term plasticity (LTP).\nIn this work, we show that this property can be exploited to efficiently solve\nnoisy classification tasks.

In attempting to classify the MNIST\ndatabase under the same conditions, conventional ELM obtains 84%\nclassification, the imprinted, uniform device system obtains 88%\nclassification, and the imprinted, variable device system reaches 92%\nclassification.

Research has shown that to adapt incident handling to cloud\ncomputing environments, cloud customers must establish clarity about their\nrequirements on Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) for successful handling of\nincidents and contract CSPs accordingly. Secondly, CSPs must strive to support\nthese requirements and mirror them in their Service Level Agreements. Intrusion\nDetection Systems (IDS) have been used widely to detect malicious behaviors in\nnetwork communication and hosts. Facing new application scenarios in Cloud\nComputing, the IDS approaches yield several problems since the operator of the\nIDS should be the user, not the administrator of the Cloud infrastructure.\nCloud providers need to enable possibilities to deploy and configure IDS for\nthe user - which poses its own challenges. Current research and commercial\nsolutions primarily focus on protecting against Denial of Service attacks and\nattacks against the Cloud's virtual infrastructure. To counter these\nchallenges, we propose a capability that aims to both detect and prevent the\npotential of data exfiltration by using a novel deception-based methodology.

They provide an\nabstract setting for differential geometry by axiomatizing key aspects of the\nsubject which allow the basic theory of these geometric settings to be\ncaptured. Importantly, they have models not only in classical differential\ngeometry and its extensions, but also in algebraic geometry, combinatorics,\ncomputer science, and physics.\n  This paper develops the theory of \"differential bundles\" for such categories,\nconsiders their relation to \"differential objects\", and develops the theory of\nfibrations of tangent categories. Differential bundles generalize the notion of\nsmooth vector bundles in classical differential geometry. However, the\ndefinition departs from the standard one in several significant ways: in\ngeneral, there is no scalar multiplication in the fibres of these bundles, and\nin general these bundles need not be locally trivial.\n  To understand how these differential bundles relate to differential objects,\nwhich are the generalization of vector spaces in smooth manifolds, requires\nsome careful handling of the behaviour of pullbacks with respect to the tangent\nfunctor. This is captured by \"transverse\" and \"display\" systems for tangent\ncategories, which leads one into the fibrational theory of tangent categories.\nA key example of a tangent fibration is provided by the \"display\" differential\nbundles of a tangent category with a display system. Strikingly, in such\nexamples the fibres are Cartesian differential categories demonstrating a --\nnot unexpected -- tight connection between the theory of these categories and\nthat of tangent categories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 17:38:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 14:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-10"}

Here, we develop a novel platform for continuous wave (CW) and\nfemtosecond plasmonic optical tweezers, based on gold-coated black silicon.

We present numerically-evaluated\nsecret-key rates illustrating the feasibility of secure and composable HD-QKD\nover metropolitan-area distances when the system is subjected to the most\npowerful eavesdropping attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 18:17:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2016 19:25:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 11:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-24"}

This makes it a promising candidate for millimeter wave systems,\nwhich require deploying large antenna arrays at both the transmitter and\nreceiver to guarantee sufficient received signal power. Most prior work on\nhybrid precoding focused on narrowband channels and assumed fully-connected\nhybrid architectures. MmWave systems, though, are expected to be wideband with\nfrequency selectivity. In this paper, a closed-form solution for\nfully-connected OFDM-based hybrid analog/digital precoding is developed for\nfrequency selective mmWave systems. This solution is then extended to\npartially-connected but fixed architectures in which each RF chain is connected\nto a specific subset of the antennas.

Based on them, a novel\ntechnique that dynamically constructs the hybrid subarrays based on the\nlong-term channel characteristics is developed.

We use a motivational example from the North American\nCystic Fibrosis (CF) Consortium genetic association study with 3444 individuals\nand 898 family members to illustrate the challenge of computing ancestry scores\nwhen sets of both unrelated individuals and closely-related family members are\nincluded. We propose novel methods to obtain ancestry scores and demonstrate\nthat the proposed methods outperform existing methods. The current standard is\nto compute loadings (left singular vectors) using unrelated individuals and to\ncompute projected scores for remaining family members. However, projected\nancestry scores from this approach suffer from shrinkage toward zero. We\nconsider in turn alternate strategies: (i) within-family data\northogonalization, (ii) matrix substitution based on decomposition of a target\nfamily-orthogonalized covariance matrix, (iii) covariance-preserving whitening,\nretaining covariances between unrelated pairs while orthogonalizing family\nmembers, and (iv) using family-averaged data to obtain loadings.

The path filtering\nprocedure is controlled by one real threshold that determines the accuracy of\nthe PCI energy and is not biased towards any determinant.

We focus on the Antisymmetric Product of\n1-reference orbital Geminal (AP1roG) method combined with an orbital\noptimization protocol presented in [Phys. Rev.

Our numerical analysis covers model systems for strong\ncorrelation: the one-dimensional Hubbard model with periodic boundary condition\nas well as metallic and molecular hydrogen rings. Specifically, the accuracy of\nAP1roG is benchmarked using the single-orbital entropy, the orbital-pair mutual\ninformation as well as the eigenvalue spectrum of the one-orbital and\ntwo-orbital reduced density matrices. Our study indicates that contributions\nfrom singly occupied states become important in the strong correlation regime\nwhich highlights the limitations of the AP1roG method. Furthermore, we examine\nthe effect of orbital rotations within the AP1roG model on correlations between\norbital pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 22:36:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

State-of-the-art\nclimate models, by contrast, typically simulate a moderate decrease in both the\nArctic and Antarctic sea ice covers. However, in each hemisphere there is a\nsmall subset of model simulations that have sea ice trends similar to the\nobservations. Based on this, a number of recent studies have suggested that the\nmodels are consistent with the observations in each hemisphere when simulated\ninternal climate variability is taken into account. Here we examine sea ice\nchanges during 1979-2013 in simulations from the most recent Coupled Model\nIntercomparison Project (CMIP5) as well as the Community Earth System Model\nLarge Ensemble (CESM-LE), drawing on previous work that found a close\nrelationship in climate models between global-mean surface temperature and sea\nice extent. We find that all of the simulations with 1979-2013 Arctic sea ice\nretreat as fast as observed have considerably more global warming than\nobservations during this time period. Using two separate methods to estimate\nthe sea ice retreat that would occur under the observed level of global warming\nin each simulation in both ensembles, we find that simulated Arctic sea ice\nretreat as fast as observed would occur less than 1% of the time. This implies\nthat the models are not consistent with the observations. In the Antarctic, we\nfind that simulated sea ice expansion as fast as observed typically corresponds\nwith too little global warming, although these results are more equivocal.

The conjecture proposes\nan automorphic category associated to a compact Riemann surface X and complex\nreductive group G is equivalent to a spectral category associated to the\nunderlying topological surface S and Langlands dual group G^. The automorphic\ncategory consists of suitable C-sheaves on the moduli stack Bun_G(X) of\nG-bundles on X, while the spectral category consists of suitable O-modules on\nthe character stack Loc_G^(S) of G^-local systems on S. The conjecture is\ncompatible with and constrained by the natural symmetries of both sides coming\nfrom modifications of bundles and local systems. On the one hand, cuspidal\nHecke eigensheaves in the de Rham and Betti sense are expected to coincide, so\nthat one can view the Betti conjecture as offering a different \"integration\nmeasure\" on the same fundamental objects. On the other hand, the Betti spectral\ncategories are more explicit than their de Rham counterparts and one might hope\nthe conjecture is less challenging. The Betti program also enjoys symmetries\ncoming from topological field theory: it is expected to extend to an\nequivalence of four-dimensional topological field theories, and in particular,\nthe conjecture for closed surfaces is expected to reduce to the case of the\nthrice-punctured sphere.

However, in individual materials, a charge/spin/orbital\nordered state of the lowest temperature is normally uniquely determined in\nterms of the lowest-energy state, i.e., the ground state. Here, we summarize\nrecent results showing that under rapid cooling, this principle does not\nnecessarily hold, and thus, the cooling rate is a control parameter of the\nlowest-temperature state beyond the framework of the thermo-equilibrium phase\ndiagram. Although the cooling rate utilized in low-temperature experiments is\ntypically 2*10^-3 - 4*10^-1 K/s, the use of optical/electronic pulses\nfacilitate rapid cooling, such as 10^2-10^3 K/s. Such an unconventionally high\ncooling rate allows some systems to kinetically avoid a first-order phase\ntransition, resulting in a quenched charge/spin state that differs from the\nground state. We also demonstrate that quenched states can be exploited as a\nnon-volatile state variable when designing phase-change memory functions. The\npresent findings suggest that rapid cooling is useful for exploring and\ncontrolling the metastable electronic/magnetic state that is potentially hidden\nbehind the ground state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2016 00:53:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

First, we study a\nsuperthin, LSB galaxy UGC 7321 and show that it does not support discrete\nglobal spiral modes when modeled as a disk-alone system or as a disk plus dark\nmatter system. Even a moderate increase in the stellar central surface density\ndoes not yield any global spiral modes. This naturally explains the observed\nlack of strong large-scale spiral structure in LSBs. An earlier work (Ghosh,\nSaini & Jog, 2016) where the galactic disk was treated as a fluid system for\nsimplicity had shown that the dominant halo could not arrest global modes. We\nfound that this difference arises due to the different dispersion relation used\nin the two cases and which plays a crucial role in the search for global spiral\nmodes. Thus the correct treatment of stars as a collisionless system as done\nhere results in the suppression of global spiral modes, in agreement with the\nobservations.

Our technique replaces the GKLD, with an information\ntheoretic metric - namely the square root of the Jensen-Shannon divergence\n(JSD), which is related to an approximate, symmetrized version of the Poisson\nNLL. We show that this allows for simple proofs of the error bounds. We propose\nand prove interesting statistical properties of the square root of JSD and\nexploit other known ones. Numerical experiments are performed showing the use\nof the technique in signal and image reconstruction from compressed\nmeasurements under Poisson noise. Our technique applies to sparse/ compressible\nsignals in any orthonormal basis, works with high probability for any randomly\ngenerated non-negative and flux-preserving sensing matrix and is proposes an\nestimator whose parameters are purely statistically motivated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2016 05:05:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 10:40:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 13:49:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 07:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

At the national level, high employment is one of the central goals of\nany economic policy, due to its close association with national prosperity. The\nmain goal of this thesis is to highlight the need for frameworks that take into\naccount the complex structure of labor market interactions.

First, we investigate our\nkey hypothesis, which is that opportunity/information flow through weak ties,\nand this is a key determinant of the length of unemployment. We then extend the\nidea of opportunity/information flow to clusters of other economic activities,\nwhere we expect the flow within clusters of related activities to be higher\nthan within isolated activities. This captures the intuition that within\nrelated activities there are more \"capitals\" involved and that such activities\nrequire similar \"capabilities.\" Therefore, more extensive clusters of economic\nactivities should generate greater growth through exploiting the greater flow\nof opportunities and information. We quantify the opportunity/information flow\nusing a complexity measure of two economic activities (i.e. jobs and exports).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2016 05:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

Recently, visual\nattention models have been applied to automatically localize the discriminative\nregions of an image for better capturing critical difference and demonstrated\npromising performance. However, without consideration of the diversity in\nattention process, most of existing attention models perform poorly in\nclassifying fine-grained objects. In this paper, we propose a diversified\nvisual attention network (DVAN) to address the problems of fine-grained object\nclassification, which substan- tially relieves the dependency on\nstrongly-supervised information for learning to localize discriminative regions\ncompared with attentionless models. More importantly, DVAN explicitly pursues\nthe diversity of attention and is able to gather discriminative information to\nthe maximal extent. Multiple attention canvases are generated to extract\nconvolutional features for attention. An LSTM recurrent unit is employed to\nlearn the attentiveness and discrimination of attention canvases. The proposed\nDVAN has the ability to attend the object from coarse to fine granularity, and\na dynamic internal representation for classification is built up by\nincrementally combining the information from different locations and scales of\nthe image. Extensive experiments con- ducted on CUB-2011, Stanford Dogs and\nStanford Cars datasets have demonstrated that the proposed diversified visual\nattention networks achieve competitive performance compared to the state-\nof-the-art approaches, without using any prior knowledge, user interaction or\nexternal resource in training or testing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2016 06:47:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 07:36:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

Particularly challenging is the reliability analysis of systems\nrepresented by computationally costly models, because of the large number of\nmodel evaluations that are typically required to estimate small probabilities\nof failure. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of a newly emerged\nmeta-modelling technique known as low-rank tensor approximations to address\nthis limitation. This technique is especially promising for high-dimensional\nproblems because: (i) the number of unknowns in the generic functional form of\nthe meta-model grows only linearly with the input dimension and (ii) such\napproximations can be constructed by relying on a series of minimization\nproblems of small size independent of the input dimension.

The central idea of heralded noiseless\namplification---a conditional modification of the probability distribution over\nphoton number of an optical quantum state---is suggestive of a parallel with\nweak measurement: in a weak measurement, learning partial information about an\nobservable leads to a conditional back-action of a commensurate size.

The tensor infinite Arnoldi method (TIAR) is a\nKrylov-based method for solving nonlinear eigenvalue problems (NEPs). This\nmethod can be interpreted as an Arnoldi method applied to a linear and infinite\ndimensional eigenvalue problem where the Krylov basis consists of polynomials.\nWe propose new restart techniques for TIAR and analyze efficiency and\nrobustness. More precisely, we consider an extension of TIAR which corresponds\nto generating the Krylov space using not only polynomials but also structured\nfunctions that are sums of exponentials and polynomials, while maintaining a\nmemory efficient tensor representation. We propose two restarting strategies,\nboth derived from the specific structure of the infinite dimensional Arnoldi\nfactorization. One restarting strategy, which we call semi-explicit TIAR\nrestart, provides the possibility to carry out locking in a compact way. The\nother strategy, which we call implicit TIAR restart, is based on the\nKrylov-Schur restart method for linear eigenvalue problem and preserves its\nrobustness. Both restarting strategies involve approximations of the tensor\nstructured factorization in order to reduce complexity and required memory\nresources. We bound the error in the infinite dimensional Arnoldi factorization\nshowing that the approximation does not substantially influence the robustness\nof the restart approach. We illustrate the approaches by applying them to solve\nlarge scale NEPs that arise from a delay differential equation and a wave\npropagation problem. The advantages in comparison to other restart methods are\nalso illustrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2016 08:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

Here, the\nrelationship is studied between this motion and spectroscopic signals measured\nin DNA with a small molecular photoprobe inserted into the base-pair stack. To\nthis end, the earlier computational approach in combination with an analytical\ntheory is applied to the experimental DNA fragment.

A physical mechanism is proposed to explain the\ncoupling between the relaxation of base-pair breathing and the experimental\nresponse signal.

The transmissions thus share a fixed amount of\nresources, i.e., symbols, while facing short blocklengths due to the\nlow-latency requirement. We investigate two distinct relaying strategies,\nnamely best relay selection among the participating terminals and best antenna\nselection at the access point of the network. In both schemes, we incorporate\nthe cost of acquiring instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) at the\naccess point within the transmission deadline. An error probability model is\ndeveloped under the finite blocklength regime to provide accurate performance\nresults. As a reference, this model is compared to the corresponding infinite\nbocklength error model. Both analytical models are validated by simulation. We\nshow that the average Packet Error Rate (PER) over all terminals is convex in\nthe target error probability at each single link.

These Minkowski tensor\nmethods are compared with previous results that utilized a power spectrum\nmethod based on the time-dependent average structure factor. It is shown that\nthe Minkowski tensor methods are superior to the previously used power spectrum\nmethod in the sense of higher sensitivity to changes in domain size. By\nanalysis of the slope of the temporal evolution of Minkowski tensor measures\nqualitative differences between the case of particle interaction with a single\nlength scale compared to particle interactions with two different length scales\n(dominating long range interaction) are revealed. After proper scaling the\ngraphs for the two length scale scenario coincide, pointing towards universal\nbehaviour. The qualitative difference in demixing scenarios is evidenced by\ndistinct demixing behaviour: In the long range dominated cases demixing occurs\nin two stages. At first neighbouring particles agglomerate then domains start\nto merge in cascades. However in the case of only one interaction length scale\nonly agglomeration but no merging of domains can be observed. Thus, Minkowski\nTensor analysis are likely to become a useful tool for further investigation of\nthis (and other) demixing processes. It is capable to reveal (nonlinear) local\ntopological properties, probing deeper than (linear) global power spectrum\nanalysis, however still providing easily interpretable results founded on a\nsolid mathematical framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2016 12:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

A important result of the mutual energy theorem is that the\nadvanced potential can suck energy from the transmitter. This energy is equal\nto the energy received at the receiver. Hence a transmitter can not send any\nenergy out without the receiver. For two remote objects, the energy is\ntransferred only can by the mutual energy of a retarded potential from the\nsource together with an advanced potential from the sink. If the sucked energy\nis discrete, the summation of mutual energy current of the infinite background\natoms or currents, which can be seen as receivers, is a random process.

We develop a complete multiscale model which\nallows us to optimize the number of laser shots needed to write the\nmagnetization of high anisotropy FePt nanoparticles in our experiments. We\nconclude that only angular momentum induced optically by the inverse Faraday\neffect will provide switching with one single femtosecond laser pulse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2016 14:25:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-07"}

While intense discussions in the\nfield were fueled by the complexity of the processes in the past, it now became\nevident that it is a puzzle of many different parts. Rather than giving an\noverview that has been presented in previous reviews on ultrafast processes in\nferromagnets, this perspective will show that with our current depth of\nknowledge the first real applications are on their way: THz spintronics and\nall-optical spin manipulation are becoming more and more feasible. The aim of\nthis perspective is to point out where we can connect the different puzzle\npieces of understanding gathered over 20 years to develop novel applications.\nbased on many observations in a large number of experiments. Differences in the\ntheoretical models arise from the localized and delocalized nature of\nferromagnetism. Transport effects are intrinsically non-local in spintronic\ndevices and at interfaces. We review the need for multiscale modeling to\naddress processes starting from electronic excitation of the spin system on the\npicometer length scale and sub-femtosecond time scale, to spin wave generation,\nand towards the modeling of ultrafast phase transitions that altogether\ndetermine the response time of the ferromagnetic system. Today, our current\nunderstanding gives rise to the first real applications of ultrafast spin\nphysics for ultrafast magnetism control: THz spintronic devices.

Here, we provide\nfurther insight into these correlations by investigating, via molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations, the plastic response of a two-dimensional amorphous\nsolid to artificially triggered local shear transformations. We show that while\nthe plastic response is virtually absent in as-quenched configurations, it\nbecomes apparent if a shear strain was previously imposed on the system.\nPlastic response has a four-fold symmetry which is characteristic of the shear\nstress redistribution following the local transformation.

The APEX telescope was used to perform\na follow-up molecular line survey of SMM3. The following species were\nidentified from the frequency range 218.2-222.2 GHz: $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, SO,\npara-H$_2$CO, and E$_1$-type CH$_3$OH. The on-the-fly mapping observations at\n215.1-219.1 GHz revealed that SMM3 is associated with a dense gas core as\ntraced by DCO$^+$ and p-H$_2$CO. Altogether three different p-H$_2$CO\ntransitions were detected with clearly broadened linewidths (8.2-11 km s$^{-1}$\nin FWHM). The derived p-H$_2$CO rotational temperature, $64\\pm15$ K, indicates\nthe presence of warm gas. We also detected a narrow p-H$_2$CO line (FWHM=0.42\nkm s$^{-1}$) at the systemic velocity. The p-H$_2$CO abundance for the broad\ncomponent appears to be enhanced by two orders of magnitude with respect to the\nnarrow line value ($\\sim3\\times10^{-9}$ versus $\\sim2\\times10^{-11}$). The\ndetected methanol line shows a linewidth similar to those of the broad\np-H$_2$CO lines, which indicates their coexistence. The CO isotopologue data\nsuggest that the CO depletion factor decreases from $\\sim27\\pm2$ towards the\ncore centre to a value of $\\sim8\\pm1$ towards the core edge.

The estimated fragmentation timescale, and the derived chemical\nabundances suggest that SMM3 is a few times $10^5$ yr old, in good agreement\nwith its Class 0 classification inferred from the spectral energy distribution\nanalysis.

For\nupcoming decades, IT industry will inevitably favor software and systems, which\ncan efficiently utilize the new 64-bit hardware resources.

The power and simplicity of WHT has stimulated research efforts and\ninterests in (noisy) sparse WHT within interdisciplinary areas including (but\nis not limited to) signal processing, cryptography. Loosely speaking, sparse\nWHT refers to the case that the number of nonzero Walsh coefficients is much\nsmaller than the dimension; the noisy version of sparse WHT refers to the case\nthat the number of large Walsh coefficients is much smaller than the dimension\nwhile there exists a large number of small nonzero Walsh coefficients. Clearly,\ngeneral Walsh-Hadamard Transform is a first solution to the noisy sparse WHT,\nwhich can obtain all Walsh coefficients larger than a given threshold and the\nindex positions. In this work, we study efficient implementations of very large\ndimensional general WHT. Our work is believed to shed light on noisy sparse\nWHT, which remains to be a big open challenge.

The classical convolution theorem and\nmultiplication formula are only suitable for 2D Fourier transform of\ncomplex-valued signal, and do not hold for QFT of quaternion-valued signal. The\npurpose of this paper is to overcome these problems and establish the\nPlancherel and inversion theorems of QFT in the square integrable signals space\nL2. First, we investigate the behaviours of QFT in the integrable signals space\nL1. Next, we deduce the energy preservation property which extends functions\nfrom L1 to L2 space. Moreover, some other important properties such as modified\nmultiplication formula are also analyzed for QFT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2016 08:02:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 09:07:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-04"}

This paper proposes a novel signal reconstruction method based on\nthe prolate spherical wave functions (PSWFs) and maximum correntropy criterion\n(MCC). The PSWFs are a kind of special functions, which have been proved having\ngood performance in signal reconstruction. However, the existing PSWFs based\nreconstruction methods only consider the mean square error (MSE) criterion as\nthe cost functions. The MSE criterion is sensitive to the non-Gaussian noise,\nsince it is builded up by the Gaussian assumption. Therefore, for the impulsive\nnoise or outliers, the MSE based reconstruction methods will lead to the large\nreconstruction error. The proposed MCC and PSWFs based robust signal\nreconstruction method can reduce the impact of large and non-Gaussian noise.\nThe experimental results on the synthetic signals show that the proposed method\ncan improve the MSE with notable gains in most cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2016 09:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-05"}
