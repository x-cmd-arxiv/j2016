This hybrid model is constructed by allowing\nthe surface flux transport (SFT) simulation described in Lemerle et al. 2015 to\nprovide the poloidal source term to an axisymmetric FTD simulation defined in a\nmeridional plane, which in turn generates the BMRs required by the SFT. A key\naspect of this coupling is the definition of an emergence function describing\nthe probability of BMR emergence as a function of the spatial distribution of\nthe internal axisymmetric magnetic field. We use a genetic algorithm to\ncalibrate this function, together with other model parameters, against observed\ncycle 21 emergence data. We present a reference dynamo solution reproducing\nmany solar cycle characteristics, including good hemispheric coupling, phase\nrelationship between the surface dipole and the BMR-generating internal field,\nand correlation between dipole strength at cycle maximum and peak amplitude of\nthe next cycle. The saturation of the cycle amplitude takes place through the\nquenching of the BMR tilt as a function of the internal field. The observed\nstatistical scatter about the mean BMR tilt, built into the model, acts as a\nsource of stochasticity which dominates amplitude fluctuations. The model thus\ncan produce Dalton-like epochs of strongly suppressed cycle amplitude lasting a\nfew cycles and can even shut off entirely following an unfavorable sequence of\nemergence events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2016 16:59:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 18:38:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 20:45:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

Within\nthese established frameworks, the inverse problem of identifying the source of\nthe propagated signal is challenging, owing to the numerous alternative\npossibilities for signal progression through the network. In real world\nnetworks, the challenge of determining sources is compounded as the true\npropagation dynamics are typically unknown, and when they have been directly\nmeasured, they rarely conform to the assumptions of any of the well-studied\nmodels. In this paper we introduce a method called Network Infusion (NI) that\nhas been designed to circumvent these issues, making source inference practical\nfor large, complex real world networks. The key idea is that to infer the\nsource node in the network, full characterization of diffusion dynamics, in\nmany cases, may not be necessary. This objective is achieved by creating a\ndiffusion kernel that well-approximates standard diffusion models, but lends\nitself to inversion, by design, via likelihood maximization or error\nminimization. We apply NI for both single-source and multi-source diffusion,\nfor both single-snapshot and multi-snapshot observations, and for both\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous diffusion setups. We prove the mean-field\noptimality of NI for different scenarios, and demonstrate its effectiveness\nover several synthetic networks. Moreover, we apply NI to a real-data\napplication, identifying news sources in the Digg social network, and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of NI compared to existing methods. Finally, we\npropose an integrative source inference framework that combines NI with a\ndistance centrality-based method, which leads to a robust performance in cases\nwhere the underlying dynamics are unknown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2016 17:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-24"}

This is the\ncase because the redistribution process may destroy part of the resources, thus\nresulting in socially inefficient allocations. Here we apply a dual-process\napproach to understand the cognitive underpinnings of this fundamental tension.\nWe conducted a set of experiments to examine the extent to which different\nallocation decisions respond to intuition or deliberation. In a newly developed\napproach, we assess intuition and deliberation at both the trait level (using\nthe Cognitive Reflection Test, henceforth CRT) and the state level (through the\nexperimental manipulation of response times).

However, in most symbiotics, the origin of this burning is\nunclear. In symbiotic slow novae, however, it is linked to a past thermonuclear\nrunaway. In June 2015, the symbiotic slow nova AG Peg was seen in only its\nsecond optical outburst since 1850. This recent outburst was of much shorter\nduration and lower amplitude than the earlier eruption, and it contained\nmultiple peaks -- like outbursts in classical symbiotic stars such as Z And. We\nreport Swift X-ray and UV observations of AG Peg made between June 2015 and\nJanuary 2016. The X-ray flux was markedly variable on a time scale of days,\nparticularly during four days near optical maximum, when the X-rays became\nbright and soft. This strong X-ray variability continued for another month,\nafter which the X-rays hardened as the optical flux declined. The UV flux was\nhigh throughout the outburst, consistent with quasi-steady shell burning on the\nwhite dwarf. Given that accretion disks around white dwarfs with shell burning\ndo not generally produce detectable X-rays (due to Compton-cooling of the\nboundary layer), the X-rays probably originated via shocks in the ejecta. As\nthe X-ray photo-electric absorption did not vary significantly, the X-ray\nvariability may directly link to the properties of the shocked material. AG\nPeg's transition from a slow symbiotic nova (which drove the 1850 outburst) to\na classical symbiotic star suggests that shell burning in at least some\nsymbiotic stars is residual burning from prior novae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2016 18:31:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

Prominent qualitative changes in\nencoding have previously been attributed to a specific switch of such a\nbifurcation at the Bogdanov-Takens (BT) point. This study unveils another,\nhighly relevant and so far underestimated transition point: the saddle-node\nloop bifurcation. As we show, this bifurcation turns out to induce even more\ndrastic changes in spike-based coding than the BT transition. This result\narises from a direct effect of the saddle-node loop bifurcation on the limit\ncycle and hence spike dynamics, in contrast to the BT bifurcation, whose\nimmediate influence is exerted upon the subthreshold dynamics and hence only\nindirectly relates to spiking. We specifically demonstrate that the saddle-node\nloop bifurcation (i) ubiquitously occurs in planar neuron models with a\nsaddle-node on invariant cycle onset bifurcation, and (ii) results in a\nsymmetry breaking of the system's phase-response curve. The latter entails\nclose to optimal coding and synchronization properties in event-based\ninformation processing units, such as neurons. The saddle-node loop bifurcation\nleads to a peak in synchronization range and provides an attractive mechanism\nfor the so far unresolved facilitation of high frequencies in neuronal\nprocessing. The derived bifurcation structure is of interest in any system for\nwhich a relaxation limit is admissible, such as Josephson junctions and\nchemical oscillators.

Here, we propose an alternative design\nwhere skyrmions move in two (or more) parallel lanes and the information is\nstored in the lane number of each skyrmion. Such a multilane track can be\nconstructed by controlling the height profile of the nanostrip. Repulsive\nskyrmion-skyrmion interactions in narrow nanostrips guarantee that skyrmions on\ndifferent lanes cannot pass each other. Current pulses can be used to induce a\nlane change. Combining these elements provides a robust, efficient design of\nskyrmion-based storage devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2016 19:13:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2016 09:11:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-14"}

A shock is detected at the sharp outer edge of the\nradio relic, both in the X-ray surface brightness and the temperature profiles.\nThe Mach number is M = 2.54^+0.80_-0.43. The temperature jump at the shock is\nlarger than expected from the density jump, which may indicate that a\ndynamically important magnetic field aligned primarily parallel to the shock\nfront is present. The gas temperature rises gradually over several arc minutes\nwithin the shock region. This could indicate that the shock energy is initially\ndissipated into some mix of thermal and nonthermal (e.g., turbulence)\ncomponents, and that the nonthermal energy decays into heat in the post-shock\nregion. The observed radio relic can be powered if ~0.2% of the energy\ndissipated in the shock goes into the (re)acceleration of relativistic\nelectrons. We show that the observed steepening of the radio spectrum with\ndistance behind the shock is consistent with radiative losses by the\nradio-emitting electrons. However, the radio spectrum immediately behind the\nshock is flatter than expected for linear diffusive shock acceleration of\nthermal electrons.

Here, we present a\nphysically motivated ab initio model for blazar flares based on the results of\nrecent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of relativistic magnetic\nreconnection. PIC simulations demonstrate that quasi-spherical plasmoids filled\nwith high-energy particles and magnetic fields are a self-consistent by-product\nof the reconnection process. By coupling our PIC-based results (i.e., plasmoid\ngrowth, acceleration profile, particle and magnetic content) with a kinetic\nequation for the evolution of the electron distribution function we demonstrate\nthat relativistic reconnection in blazar jets can produce powerful flares whose\ntemporal and spectral properties are consistent with the observations. In\nparticular, our model predicts correlated synchrotron and synchrotron\nself-Compton flares of duration of several hours--days powered by the largest\nand slowest moving plasmoids that form in the reconnection layer. Smaller and\nfaster plasmoids produce flares of sub-hour duration with higher peak\nluminosities than those powered by the largest plasmoids. Yet, the observed\nfluence in both types of flares is similar. Multiple flares with a range of\nflux-doubling timescales (minutes to several hours) observed over a longer\nperiod of flaring activity (days or longer) may be used as a probe of the\nreconnection layer's orientation and the jet's magnetization. Our model shows\nthat blazar flares are naturally expected as a result of magnetic reconnection\nin a magnetically-dominated jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2016 20:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

These high levels of\nbackground nitrate must also be included when estimating SPE enhancements to\nthe deposition of nitrate ions that might eventually be preserved in an ice\ncore. The 1956 SPE results in less than a 5% increase in the column burden of\natmospheric HNO3, not large enough to explain the nitrate spike seen in the\nGISP2H ice core. Even extreme SPE enhancements cannot explain nitrate peaks\n(typically hundreds of percent increases) observed in the ice record\n[Duderstadt et al., 2016]. Realistic mechanisms linking nitrate ions in ice\ncores to SPEs have not been established. It is time to move the search for\nindicators of SPEs away from nitrate ions: Nitrate ions cannot be used as\nproxies for individual SPEs in the ice core record.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2016 20:37:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2016 15:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

Via a general\nscaling model on the system parameters with respect to the relay antenna\nnumber, the asymptotic scaling law of the SINR as a function of the parameter\nscalings is obtained, which shows quantitatively the tradeoff between the\nnetwork parameters and their effect on the network performance.

To do this we\nextend the concept of $\\Phi$-derivability for the self-energy $\\Sigma$ to a\nlarger class of diagrammatic terms in which only some of the Green's function\nlines contain the fully dressed Green's function $G$. We call the corresponding\napproximations for $\\Sigma$ partially $\\Phi$-derivable. A special subclass of\nsuch approximations, which are gauge-invariant, is obtained by dressing loops\nin the diagrammatic expansion of $\\Phi$ consistently with $G$. These\napproximations are number conserving but do not have to fulfill other\nconservation laws, such as the conservation of energy and momentum. From our\nformalism we can easily deduce if commonly used approximations will fulfill the\ncontinuity equation, which implies particle number conservation. We further\nshow how the concept of partial $\\Phi$-derivability plays an important role in\nthe derivation of a generalized sum rule for the particle number, which reduces\nto the Luttinger-Ward theorem in the case of a homogeneous electron gas, and\nthe Friedel sum rule in the case of the Anderson model.

Since the specifications of tasks often\ninvolve necessary conditions for actions, the KoP principle shows that such\nspecifications induce knowledge preconditions for the actions.

CAIs are almost always surrounded by Wark-Lovering Rims\n(WLRs), which are a sequence of thin, mono/bi-mineralic layers of refractory\nminerals, with a total thickness in the range of 1 to 100 microns. Recently,\nsome CAIs have been found that have tektite-like bowl-shapes. To form such\nshapes, the CAI must have travelled through a rarefied gas at hypersonic\nspeeds. We show how CAIs may have been ejected from the inner solar accretion\ndisc via the centrifugal interaction between the solar magnetosphere and the\ninner disc rim. They subsequently punched through the hot, inner disc rim wall\nat hypersonic speeds. This re-entry heating partially or completely evaporated\nthe CAIs. Such evaporation could have significantly increased the metal\nabundances of the inner disc rim. High speed movement through the inner disc\nproduced WLRs. To match the observed thickness of WLRs required metal\nabundances at the inner disc wall that are of order ten times that of standard\nsolar abundances.

Self-interactions between charge fluctuations called holons are not\nscreened, which shows a run-away renormalization group flow, interpreted as\nholons remain gapped. This leads us to consider another fixed point, where the\nspinon Fermi surface can be destabilized across the Mott transition. Based on\nthis conjecture, we reveal the nature of the spin-liquid Mott quantum critical\npoint: Dimensional reduction to one dimension occurs for spin dynamics\ndescribed by spinons. As a result, Landau damping for both spin and charge\ndynamics disappear in the vicinity of the Mott quantum critical point. When the\nflavor number of holons is over its critical value, an interacting fixed point\nappears to be identified with an inverted XY universality class, controlled\nwithin the dimensional regularization technique. On the other hand, a\nfluctuation-driven first order metal-insulator transition results when it is\nbelow the critical number. We propose that the destabilization of a spinon\nFermi surface and the emergence of one-dimensional spin dynamics near the\nspin-liquid Mott quantum critical point can be checked out by spin\nsusceptibility with a $2 k_{F}$ transfer momentum, where $k_{F}$ is a Fermi\nmomentum in the U(1) spin-liquid state: The absence of Landau damping in U(1)\ngauge fluctuations gives rise to a divergent behavior at zero temperature while\nit vanishes in the presence of a spinon Fermi surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2016 02:14:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 01:23:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 14 May 2017 01:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

We prove\nthat our procedure synthesizes general witnesses in that if a witness is found,\nthen for all inhabited input types, there exist values that can make the\nfunction go wrong. Second, we show how to extend this procedure to produce a\nreduction graph that can be used to interactively visualize and debug witness\nexecutions. Third, we evaluate the coverage of our approach on two data sets\ncomprising over 4,500 ill-typed student programs. Our technique is able to\ngenerate witnesses for around 85% of the programs, our reduction graph yields\nsmall counterexamples for over 80% of the witnesses, and a simple heuristic\nallows us to use witnesses to locate the source of type errors with around 70%\naccuracy. Finally, we evaluate whether our witnesses help students understand\nand fix type errors, and find that students presented with our witnesses show a\ngreater understanding of type errors than those presented with a standard error\nmessage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2016 03:42:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Mar 2018 15:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-20"}

The strong dependence of scattering on atomic number Z and the\nrecent developments on position sensitive muon detectors indicate that multiple\nCoulomb scattering could be an excellent candidate for spent nuclear fuel\nimaging. Muons present significant advantages over existing monitoring and\nimaging techniques and can play a central role in monitoring nuclear waste and\nspent nuclear fuel stored in dense well shielded containers. The main purpose\nof this paper is to investigate the applicability of multiple Coulomb\nscattering for imaging of spent nuclear fuel dry casks stored within vertical\nand horizontal commercial storage dry casks. Calculations of muon scattering\nwere performed for various scenarios, including vertical and horizontal fully\nloaded dry casks, half loaded dry casks, dry casks with one row of fuel\nassemblies missing, dry casks with one fuel assembly missing and empty dry\ncasks.

For example in fractional quantum Hall systems, excitations can\ncarry fractional charges while the electrons making up the system have charge\none. An important question is to understand what symmetry fractionalization\n(SF) patterns are possible given different types of topological order and\ndifferent symmetries. A lot of progress has been made recently in classifying\nthe SF patterns, providing deep insight into the strongly correlated\nexperimental signatures of systems like spin liquids and topological\ninsulators. We review recent developments on this topic. First, it was shown\nthat the SF patterns need to satisfy some simple consistency conditions. More\ninteresting, it was realized that some seemingly consistent SF patterns are\nactually `anomalous', i.e. they cannot be realized in strictly 2D systems. We\nreview various methods that have been developed to detect such anomalies.\nApplying such an understanding to 2D spin liquid allows one to enumerate all\npotentially realizable SF patterns and propose numerical and experimental\nprobing methods to distinguish them. On the other hand, the anomalous SF\npatterns were shown to exist on the surface of 3D systems and reflect the\nnontrivial order in the 3D bulk.

When this number\nis bounded above in the global space the same way as in its section-spaces, we\nsay that it is an Extended Chebyshev Piecewise (ECP) space.

The process of stream segregation refers to the capability\nof human listeners to group acoustic signals into sets of distinct auditory\nstreams, corresponding to individual sound sources. The proposed computational\nframework mimics this ability via a probabilistic clustering scheme for joint\nlocalization and segregation. This scheme is based on mixtures of von Mises\ndistributions to model the angular positions of the sound sources surrounding\nthe listener. The distribution parameters are estimated using block-wise\nprocessing of auditory cues extracted from binaural signals. Additionally, the\nproposed system can conduct rotational head movements to improve localization\nand stream segregation performance. Evaluation of the system is conducted in\nscenarios containing multiple simultaneously active speech and non-speech\nsounds placed at different positions relative to the listener.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2016 08:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-27"}

The origin of these fields, their lifetimes, and\ntheir role in shaping the characteristics and evolution of massive stars are\ncurrently not well understood. We compile a catalogue of 389 massive\nmain-sequence stars, 61 of which are magnetic, and derive their fundamental\nparameters and ages. The two samples contain stars brighter than magnitude 9 in\nthe V band and range in mass between 5 and 100 Msun. We find that the\nfractional main-sequence age distribution of all considered stars follows what\nis expected for a magnitude limited sample, while that of magnetic stars shows\na clear decrease towards the end of the main sequence. This dearth of old\nmagnetic stars is independent of the choice of adopted stellar evolution\ntracks, and appears to become more prominent when considering only the most\nmassive stars. We show that the decreasing trend in the distribution is\nsignificantly stronger than expected from magnetic flux conservation. We also\nfind that binary rejuvenation and magnetic suppression of core convection are\nunlikely to be responsible for the observed lack of older magnetic massive\nstars, and conclude that its most probable cause is the decay of the magnetic\nfield, over a time span longer than the stellar lifetime for the lowest\nconsidered masses, and shorter for the highest masses. We then investigate the\nspin-down ages of the slowly rotating magnetic massive stars and find them to\nexceed the stellar ages by far in many cases. The high fraction of very slowly\nrotating magnetic stars thus provides an independent argument for a decay of\nthe magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2016 08:33:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

By mimicking the mechanical\nmotion of calls crawling on a substrate using a pseudopod, we constructed a\nminimal model for migrating cells which gives rise to contact inhibition of\nlocomotion (CIL) naturally. The model cell consists of two disks, one in the\nfront (a pseudopod) and the other one in the back (cell body), connected by a\nfinitely extensible spring. Despite the simplicity of the model, the cells'\ncollective behavior is highly nontrivial, depending on the shape of cells and\nwhether CIL is enabled or not. Cells with a small front circle (i.e. a narrow\npseudopod) form immobile colonies. In contrast, cells with a large front circle\n(i.e. such as a lamellipodium) exhibit coherent migration without any explicit\nalignment mechanism being present in the model. This suggests that crawling\ncells often exhibit broad fronts because it helps them avoid clustering. Upon\nincreasing the density, the cells develop density waves which propagate against\nthe direction of cell migration and finally arrest at higher densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2016 09:41:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 08:36:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 03:20:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 07:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-28"}

Within the\ncontext of stochastic geometry and the physics of disordered materials, this\ncorresponds to the question of relationships between different stochastic\nmodels. In the context of image analysis of synthetic and biological materials,\nthis question is central to the problem of inferring information about\nformation processes from spatial measurements of resulting random structures.\nWe address this question by a theory-based simulation study of shape indices\nderived from Minkowski tensors for a variety of tessellation models. We focus\non the relationship between two indices: an isoperimetric ratio of the\nempirical averages of cell volume and area and the cell elongation quantified\nby eigenvalue ratios of interfacial Minkowski tensors. Simulation data for\nthese quantities, as well as for distributions thereof and for correlations of\ncell shape and volume, are presented for Voronoi mosaics of the Poisson point\nprocess, determinantal and permanental point processes, and Gibbs hard-core and\nrandom sequential absorption processes as well as for Laguerre tessellations of\npolydisperse spheres and STIT- and Poisson hyperplane tessellations. These data\nare complemented by mechanically stable crystalline sphere and disordered\nellipsoid packings and area-minimising foam models. We find that shape indices\nof individual cells are not sufficient to unambiguously identify the generating\nprocess even amongst this limited set of processes. However, we identify\nsignificant differences of the shape indices between many of these tessellation\nmodels. Given a realization of a tessellation, these shape indices can narrow\nthe choice of possible generating processes, providing a powerful tool which\ncan be further strengthened by density-resolved volume-shape correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2016 12:13:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-27"}

We focus on the case with two electrons in the impurity that\nis relevant to Hund's metals. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation we\nderive an effective Kondo model with couplings between the bulk and impurity\nelectrons expressed in terms of spin, orbital, and orbital quadrupole\noperators. The bare spin-spin Kondo interaction is much smaller than the\norbit-orbit and spin-orbital couplings or is even ferromagnetic. Furthermore,\nthe perturbative scaling equations indicate faster renormalization of the\ncouplings related to orbital degrees of freedom compared to spin degrees of\nfreedom. Both mechanisms lead to a slow screening of the local spin moment. The\nmodel thus behaves similarly to the related quantum impurity problem with a\nlarger SU(3) orbital symmetry (Dworin-Narath interaction) where this was first\nobserved. We find that the two problems actually describe the same low-energy\nphysics since the SU(3) symmetry is dynamically established through the\nrenormalization of the splittings of coupling constants to zero. The\nperturbative renormalization group results are corroborated with the\nnumerical-renormalization group (NRG) calculations. The dependence of spin\nKondo temperatures and orbital Kondo temperatures as a function of interaction\nparameters, the hybridization, and the impurity occupancy is calculated and\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2016 12:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-05"}

The linear thermal expansion coefficients (LTEC)\nof two-dimensional honeycomb structured pure graphene, h-BN and B/N doped\ngraphene are studied using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) under\nquasi harmonic approximation. The dynamical matrix and the phonon frequencies\nwere calculated using VASP code in interface with phonopy code. The approach is\nfirst applied to pure graphene to calculate thermal expansion.

The Fourier analysis of the\nout-of-plane fluctuations often applied to characterize the acoustic bending\nmode of graphene is extended to the optical branch, whose polarization vector\nis perpendicular to the graphene layer. This observable is inaccessible in a\ncontinuous elastic model of graphene but it is readily obtained by the\natomistic treatment. Our results suggest that the long-wavelength limit of the\nacoustic out-of-plane fluctuations of a free layer without stress is\nqualitatively similar to that predicted by a harmonic model under a tensile\nstress.

However, manually annotating data is a time-consuming task, which\nthus makes few annotated resources available so far. Unlike audio event\ndetection, automatic audio tagging, a multi-label acoustic event classification\ntask, only relies on weakly labeled data. This is highly desirable to some\npractical applications using audio analysis. In this paper we propose to use a\nfully deep neural network (DNN) framework to handle the multi-label\nclassification task in a regression way. Considering that only chunk-level\nrather than frame-level labels are available, the whole or almost whole frames\nof the chunk were fed into the DNN to perform a multi-label regression for the\nexpected tags. The fully DNN, which is regarded as an encoding function, can\nwell map the audio features sequence to a multi-tag vector. A deep pyramid\nstructure was also designed to extract more robust high-level features related\nto the target tags. Further improved methods were adopted, such as the Dropout\nand background noise aware training, to enhance its generalization capability\nfor new audio recordings in mismatched environments. Compared with the\nconventional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and support vector machine (SVM)\nmethods, the proposed fully DNN-based method could well utilize the long-term\ntemporal information with the whole chunk as the input.

However,\nthe current user profiling approaches have limited success, due to the lack of\na principled way to integrate different types of social relationships of a\nuser, and the reliance on scarcely-available labeled data in building a\nprediction model. In this paper, we present a novel solution termed Collective\nSemi-Supervised Learning (CSL), which provides a principled means to integrate\ndifferent types of social relationship and unlabeled data under a unified\ncomputational framework. The joint learning from multiple relationships and\nunlabeled data yields a computationally sound and accurate approach to model\nuser attributes in social media. Extensive experiments using Twitter data have\ndemonstrated the efficacy of our CSL approach in inferring user attributes such\nas account type and marital status. We also show how CSL can be used to\ndetermine important user features, and to make inference on a larger user\npopulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2016 14:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-27"}

The information molecules released by the transmitter\nnano-machine into the environment can degrade in the channel via a first-order\ndegradation reaction and those that reach the receiver nano-machine can\nparticipate in a reversible bimolecular reaction with receiver receptor\nproteins. Thereby, we distinguish between two scenarios. In the first scenario,\nwe assume that the entire surface of the receiver is covered by receptor\nmolecules.

New stimulants have been provided, thanks to unprecedented\ndegree of control reached in experiments with isolated quantum systems and\nrapid theoretical developments of manybody localization in disordered\ninteracting systems. The proposal of (many-body) eigenstate thermalization (ET)\nfor these systems reinforces the common belief that either interaction or\nextrinsic randomness is required for thermalization. Here, we unveil a quantum\nthermalization mechanism challenging this belief. We find that, provided\none-body quantum chaos is present, as a pure many-body state evolves the arrow\nof time can emerge, even without interaction or randomness. In times much\nlarger than the Ehrenfest time that signals the breakdown of quantum-classical\ncorrespondence, quantum chaotic motion leads to thermal [Fermi-Dirac (FD) or\nBose-Einstein (BE)] distributions and thermodynamics in individual eigenstates.\nOur findings lay dynamical foundation of statistical mechanics and\nthermodynamics of isolated quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2016 03:10:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-28"}

The rational form is the well-known\ndiagonal Pade approximation of $e^x$.

With\nadvancements in healthcare technology and the Internet of Things (IoT), the\ndemand for ultra-dense, ultra-low-power memory is increasing. In this review,\nwe present a comprehensive perspective on the most notable approaches to the\nfabrication of physically flexible memory devices. With the future goal of\nreplacing traditional mechanical hard disks with solid-state storage devices, a\nfully flexible electronic system will need two basic devices: transistors and\nnonvolatile memory. Transistors are used for logic operations and gating memory\narrays, while nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices are required for storing\ninformation in the main memory and cache storage. Since the highest density of\ntransistors and storage structures is manifested in memories, the focus of this\nreview is flexible NVM. Flexible NVM components are discussed in terms of their\nfunctionality, performance metrics, and reliability aspects, all of which are\ncritical components for NVM technology to be part of mainstream consumer\nelectronics, IoT, and advanced healthcare devices. Finally, flexible NVMs are\nbenchmarked and future prospects are provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2016 01:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-28"}

In these states, atoms can not emit photons,\nalthough they have non-zero energy. They are stable and can serve as a\ncontrolled energy reservoir from which photons can be extracted by\ndifferentiated effects on atoms, for example, their spatial separation. Dark\nstates are the simplest example of a subspace free of decoherence in the form\nof a photon flight, and therefore are of interest for quantum computing. It is\nproved that a) the dimension of the subspace of dark states of atoms is the\nCatalan numbers, b) in the RWA approximation, any dark state is a linear\ncombination of tensor products of singlet-type states and the ground states of\nindividual atoms. For the exact model, in the case of the same force of\ninteraction of atoms with the field, the same decomposition is true, and only\nsinglets participate in the products and the dark states can neither emit a\nphoton nor absorb it. The proof is based on the method of quantization of the\namplitude of states of atomic ensembles, in which the roles of individual atoms\nare interchangeable. In such an ensemble there is a possibility of\nmicro-causality: the trajectory of each quantum of amplitude can be uniquely\nassigned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2016 13:31:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2016 10:36:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 18:28:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 17:28:33 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 09:17:48 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 11 Dec 2018 15:18:46 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sun, 3 Mar 2019 07:53:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-05"}

The case of the clock semantics is closely related to a monadic\nsecond order logic of time and probability that is known to be decidable,\nexcept on a set of measure zero.
