Our AO images partially resolve\nthe central star into a binary, whose components are nearly equal in brightness\nand separated by 0.106\" +/- 0.001\". VHS 1256 b occupies nearly the same near-IR\ncolor-magnitude diagram position as HR 8799 bcde and has a comparable L'\nbrightness. However, it has a substantially redder H - M' color, implying a\nrelatively brighter M' flux density than for the HR 8799 planets and suggesting\nthat non-equilibrium carbon chemistry may be less significant in VHS 1256 b. We\nsuccessfully match the entire SED (optical through thermal infrared) for VHS\n1256 b to atmospheric models assuming chemical equilibrium, models which failed\nto reproduce HR 8799 b at 5 microns. Our modeling favors slightly thick clouds\nin the companion's atmosphere, although perhaps not quite as thick as those\nfavored recently for HR 8799 bcde. We estimate that the system is at least\nolder than 200 Myr and the masses of the stars comprising the central binary\nare at least 58 M_Jup each. Moreover, we find some of the properties of VHS\n1256 are inconsistent with the recent suggestion that it is a member of the AB\nDor moving group. Given the possible ranges in distance (12.7 pc vs. 17.1 pc),\nthe lower mass limit for VHS 1256 b ranges from 10.5 - 26.2 M_Jup.

In this work, we calculate the electro-optic\ndevice figure of merit based on the half-wave voltage and linear loss, which is\nimportant for phase modulators and serves as the simplest example of the\napproach. This figure of merit is then related back to the microscopic\nproperties in the context of a dye-doped polymer, and its fundamental limits\nare obtained to provide a target. Surprisingly, the largest figure of merit is\nnot always associated with a large nonlinear-optical response, the quantity\nthat is most often the focus of optimization. An important lesson to materials\ndesign is that the figure of merit alone should be optimized. The best device\nmaterials can have low nonlinearity provided that the loss is low; or, near\nresonance high loss may be desirable because it is accompanied by\nresonantly-enhanced, ultra-large nonlinear response so device lengths are\nshort.

A main feature of this model is the self-consistent yet versatile\ntreatment of element abundances and depletion onto dust grains, which allows\none to relate the observed nebular emission from a galaxy to both gas-phase and\ndust-phase metal enrichment.

The evidence comes from three\ndifferent age indicators, Dn4000, Hdelta and fits to spectral synthesis models,\napplied to their stacked optical spectra. All age indicators consistently show\nthat the stellar populations of compact QGs are older than their normally-sized\ncounterparts. We detect weak [OII] emission in a fraction of QGs, and the\nstrength of the line, when present, is similar between the two samples;\nhowever, compact galaxies exhibit significantly lower frequency of [OII]\nemission than normal ones.

Although both the host halo mass and group-centric\ndistance affect the satellite population, we find that these can be\ncharacterised by a single number, the quenched fraction, such that key features\nof the sSFR-$\\Sigma_{1kpc}$ diagram vary smoothly with this proxy for the\n\"environment\". Particularly, the sSFR of star-forming galaxies decreases\nsmoothly with this quenched fraction, the sSFR of satellites being 0.1 dex\nlower than in the field. Furthermore, $\\Sigma_{1kpc}$ of the transition\ngalaxies (i.e., the \"green valley\" or GV) decreases smoothly with the\nenvironment, by as much as 0.2 dex for $M_* = 10^{9.75-10} M_{\\odot}$ from the\nfield, and decreasing for satellites in larger halos and at smaller radial\ndistances within same-mass halos. We interpret this shift as indicating the\nrelative importance of today's field quenching track vs. the cluster quenching\ntrack. These environmental effects in the sSFR-$\\Sigma_{1kpc}$ diagram are most\nsignificant in our lowest mass range ($9.75 < \\log M_{*}/M_{\\odot} < 10$). One\nfeature that is shared between all environments is that at a given $M_{*}$\nquenched galaxies have about 0.2-0.3 dex higher $\\Sigma_{1kpc}$ than the\nstar-forming population.

Detailed measurements of Nd2-xCexCuO4 show that CO is\npresent in the x = 0.059 to 0.166 range, and that its doping dependent\nwavevector is consistent with the separation between straight segments of the\nFermi surface. The CO onset temperature is highest between x = 0.106 and 0.166,\nbut decreases at lower doping levels, indicating that it is not tied to the\nappearance of antiferromagnetic correlations or the pseudogap. Near optimal\ndoping, where the CO wavevector is also consistent with a previously observed\nphonon anomaly, measurements of the CO below and above the superconducting\ntransition temperature, or in a magnetic field, show that the CO is insensitive\nto superconductivity.

Observations of open clusters have revealed a\nbimodal distribution of the rotation periods of solar-like stars that has\nproven difficult to explain under the existing rubric of magnetic braking.\nRecent studies suggest that magnetic complexity can play an important role in\ncontrolling stellar spin-down rates. However, magnetic morphology is still\nneglected in most rotation evolution models due to the difficulty of properly\naccounting for its effects on wind driving and angular momentum loss. Using\nstate-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamical magnetized wind simulations we study the\neffect that different distributions of the magnetic flux at different levels of\ngeometrical complexity have on mass and angular momentum loss rates. Angular\nmomentum loss rates depend strongly on the level of complexity of the field but\nare independent of the way this complexity is distributed. We deduce the\nanalytical terms representing the magnetic field morphology dependence of mass\nand angular momentum loss rates. We also define a parameter that best\nrepresents complexity for real stars. As a test, we use these analytical\nmethods to estimate mass and angular momentum loss rates for $8$ stars with\nobserved magnetograms and compare them to the simulated results. Magnetic field\ncomplexity provides a natural physical basis for stellar rotation evolution\nmodels requiring a rapid transition between weak and strong spin-down modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2016 20:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Accordingly this holds for bijective analysis, which\ncan be interpreted as stochastic dominance assuming the uniform distribution\nover requests. These techniques have been applied to some online problems, and\nhave provided a clear separation between algorithms whose performance varies\nsignificantly in practice. However, there are situations in which they are not\nreadily applicable due to the fact that they stipulate a stringent relation\nbetween the compared algorithms.\n  In this paper, we propose remedies for these shortcomings. First, we\nestablish sufficient conditions that allow us to prove the bijective optimality\nof a certain class of algorithms for a wide range of problems; we demonstrate\nthis approach in the context of some well-studied online problems. Second, to\naccount for situations in which two algorithms are incomparable or there is no\nclear optimum, we introduce the bijective ratio as a natural extension of\n(exact) bijective analysis. Our definition readily generalizes to stochastic\ndominance. This renders the concept of bijective analysis (and that of\nstochastic dominance) applicable to all online problems, and allows for the\nincorporation of other useful techniques such as amortized analysis. We\ndemonstrate the applicability of the bijective ratio to one of the fundamental\nonline problems, namely the continuous $k$-server problem on metrics such as\nthe line, the circle, and the star. Among other results, we show that the\ngreedy algorithm attains bijective ratios of $O(k)$ consistently across these\nmetrics. These results confirm extensive previous studies that gave evidence of\nthe efficiency of this algorithm on said metrics in practice, which, however,\nis not reflected in competitive analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2016 21:36:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-22"}

We are not aware\nof any previous study of this problem, in this full generality, with a\nsubquadratic bound on the number of pieces.\n  This work extends the recent study by two of the authors (Aronov,\nSharir~2018) on eliminating depth cycles among lines in 3-space. Our approach\nis again algebraic, and makes use of a recent variant of the polynomial\npartitioning technique, due to Guth, which leads to a recursive procedure for\ncutting the triangles. In contrast to the case of lines, our analysis here is\nconsiderably more involved, due to the two-dimensional nature of the objects\nbeing cut, so additional tools, from topology and algebra, need to be brought\nto bear.\n  Our result essentially settles a 35-year-old open problem in computational\ngeometry, motivated by hidden-surface removal in computer graphics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2016 22:11:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Mar 2019 04:39:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-08"}

Our approach builds upon on the\nlocality-sensitive hashing (LSH) framework due to its appealing asymptotic\nsublinear query time for near neighbor search problems in high-dimensional\nspace. A bottleneck of the traditional LSH scheme for solving $r$-NN is that\nits performance is sensitive to data and query-dependent parameters. On\ndatasets whose data distributions have diverse local density patterns, LSH with\ninappropriate tuning parameters can sometimes be outperformed by a simple\nlinear search.\n  In this paper, we introduce a hybrid search strategy between LSH-based search\nand linear search for $r$-NN in high-dimensional space.

This means that we are able to choose the appropriate search\nstrategy between LSH-based search and linear search to achieve better\nperformance. Moreover, the integrated data structure is time efficient and fits\nwell with many recent state-of-the-art LSH-based approaches.

It is generally believed that matter is absorbed into\nblack holes via accretion disks, the state of which depends primarily on the\nmass-accretion rate. When this rate approaches the critical rate (the Eddington\nlimit), thermal instability is supposed to occur in the inner disc, causing\nrepetitive patterns of large-amplitude X-ray variability (oscillations) on\ntimescales of minutes to hours. In fact, such oscillations have been observed\nonly in sources with a high mass accretion rate, such as GRS 1915+105. These\nlarge-amplitude, relatively slow timescale, phenomena are thought to have\nphysical origins distinct from X-ray or optical variations with small\namplitudes and fast ($\\lesssim$10 sec) timescales often observed in other black\nhole binaries (e.g., XTE J1118+480 and GX 339-4). Here we report an extensive\nmulti-colour optical photometric data set of V404 Cygni, an X-ray transient\nsource containing a black hole of nine solar masses (and a conpanion star) at a\ndistance of 2.4 kiloparsecs. Our data show that optical oscillations on\ntimescales of 100 seconds to 2.5 hours can occur at mass-accretion rates more\nthan ten times lower than previously thought. This suggests that the accretion\nrate is not the critical parameter for inducing inner-disc instabilities.\nInstead, we propose that a long orbital period is a key condition for these\nlarge-amplitude oscillations, because the outer part of the large disc in\nbinaries with long orbital periods will have surface densities too low to\nmaintain sustained mass accretion to the inner part of the disc. The lack of\nsustained accretion -- not the actual rate -- would then be the critical factor\ncausing large-amplitude oscillations in long-period systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 05:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-05"}

Unfortunately there are many complexities and underlying\nissues when analysing longitudinal observational data. Due to these\ncomplexities, existing methods for large-scale detection of negative side\neffects using observational data all tend to have issues distinguishing between\nassociation and causality. New methods that can better discriminate causal and\nnon-causal relationships need to be developed to fully utilise the data. In\nthis paper we propose using a set of causality considerations developed by the\nepidemiologist Bradford Hill as a basis for engineering features that enable\nthe application of supervised learning for the problem of detecting negative\nside effects. The Bradford Hill considerations look at various perspectives of\na drug and outcome relationship to determine whether it shows causal traits. We\ntaught a classifier to find patterns within these perspectives and it learned\nto discriminate between association and causality. The novelty of this research\nis the combination of supervised learning and Bradford Hill's causality\nconsiderations to automate the Bradford Hill's causality assessment. We\nevaluated the framework on a drug safety gold standard know as the\nobservational medical outcomes partnership's nonspecified association reference\nset. The methodology obtained excellent discriminate ability with area under\nthe curves ranging between 0.792-0.940 (existing method optimal: 0.73) and a\nmean average precision of 0.640 (existing method optimal: 0.141). The proposed\nfeatures can be calculated efficiently and be readily updated, making the\nframework suitable for big observational data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 05:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-22"}

We propose a measure for\nthe critical patch size as being proportional to the participation ratio (PR)\nof the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the linearized\nFisher dynamics. We obtain the (extinction-survival) phase diagram and the\nprobability distribution function (PDF) of the critical patch sizes for two\ntopologies, namely, the one-dimensional system and the fractal Peano basin. We\nshow that both topologies share the same qualitative features, but the fractal\ntopology requires higher spatial fluctuations to guarantee species survival. We\nperform a finite-size scaling and we obtain the associated scaling exponents.\nIn addition, we show that the PDF of the critical patch sizes has an universal\nshape for the 1D case in terms of the model parameters (diffusion, growth rate,\netc.). In contrast, the diffusion coefficient has a drastic effect on the PDF\nof the critical patch sizes of the fractal Peano basin, and it does not obey\nthe same scaling law of the 1D case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 08:03:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 12:50:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-25"}

Efforts to understand this relationship face the problem of the\nenormous computational complexity involved in evolving a generic state\ncontaining many quanta. In a cosmological context however, certain symmetry\nassumptions on the quantum states allow to simplify the problem. In this paper,\nwe will show how quantum states describing a spatially flat homogeneous and\nisotropic universe can be refined and coarse grained.

At variance with other Low Mass X-ray binaries, this active state\nreaches luminosities of only ~$10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, showing strong, fast\nvariability. In the active state, J1023 displays: i) a high state\n($L_X\\sim7\\times10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$, 0.3-80 keV) occurring ~80% of the time\nand during which X-ray pulsations at the neutron star spin period are detected\n(pulsed fraction ~8%); ii) a low state ($L_X~10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$) during\nwhich pulsations are not detected (~<3%); and iii) a flaring state during which\nsporadic flares occur in excess of ~$10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with no pulsation\ntoo. The transition between the high and the low states is very rapid, on a ~10\ns timescale.

For acoustic waves in a fluid with fluctuations of both density and\ncompressibility (as well as for electromagnetic waves in a medium with\nfluctuation of both permittivity and permeability) the random potential entails\na scalar and an operator contribution. For simplicity, the latter is usually\noverlooked in multiple scattering theory: whatever the type of waves, this\nsimplification amounts to considering the Helmholtz equation with a sound speed\n$c$ depending on position $\\mathbf{r}$. In this work, a radiative transfer\nequation is derived from the wave equation, in order to study energy transport\nthrough a multiple scattering medium. In particular, the influence of the\noperator term on various transport parameters is studied, based on the\ndiagrammatic approach of multiple scattering. Analytical results are obtained\nfor fundamental quantities of transport theory such as the transport mean-free\npath $\\ell^*$, scattering phase function $f$ and anisotropy factor $g$.\nDiscarding the operator term in the wave equation is shown to have a\nsignificant impact on $f$ and $g$, yet limited to the low-frequency regime\ni.e., when the correlation length of the disorder $\\ell_c$ is smaller than or\ncomparable to the wavelength $\\lambda$.

The connectivity is compactly\ndescribed by the persistence diagram. One limitation of the current framework\nis the reliance on metric distances, whereas in many practical applications\nobjects are compared by non-metric dissimilarity measures. Examples are the\nKullback-Leibler divergence, which is commonly used for comparing text and\nimages, and the Itakura-Saito divergence, popular for speech and sound.

This signal is influenced\nby many astrophysical effects, including long range X-ray heating of the\nintergalactic gas. During the preceding Cosmic Dawn era the impact of this\nheating on the 21-cm signal is particularly prominent, especially before spin\ntemperature saturation. We present the largest-volume (349\\,Mpc\ncomoving=244~$h^{-1}$Mpc) full numerical radiative transfer simulations to date\nof this epoch that include the effects of helium and multi-frequency heating,\nboth with and without X-ray sources. We show that X-ray sources contribute\nsignificantly to early heating of the neutral intergalactic medium and, hence,\nto the corresponding 21-cm signal. The inclusion of hard, energetic radiation\nyields an earlier, extended transition from absorption to emission compared to\nthe stellar-only case. The presence of X-ray sources decreases the absolute\nvalue of the mean 21-cm differential brightness temperature. These hard sources\nalso significantly increase the 21-cm fluctuations compared the common\nassumption of temperature saturation. The 21-cm differential brightness\ntemperature power spectrum is initially boosted on large scales, before\ndecreasing on all scales. Compared to the case of the cold, unheated\nintergalactic medium, the signal has lower rms fluctuations and increased\nnon-Gaussianity, as measured by the skewness and kurtosis of the 21-cm\nprobability distribution functions. Images of the 21-cm signal with resolution\naround 11~arcmin still show fluctuations well above the expected noise for deep\nintegrations with the SKA1-Low, indicating that direct imaging of the X-ray\nheating epoch could be feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 11:54:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 18:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

One of the most\nfundamental questions that arise in this context is whether the evolution of a\ngene with one copy in all species can be explained by a given network. In\nmathematical terms, this is often translated in the following way: is a given\nphylogenetic tree contained in a given phylogenetic network? Recently this tree\ncontainment problem has been widely investigated from a computational\nperspective, but most studies have only focused on the topology of the phylo-\ngenies, ignoring a piece of information that, in the case of phylogenetic\ntrees, is routinely inferred by evolutionary analyses: branch lengths. These\nmeasure the amount of change (e.g., nucleotide substitutions) that has occurred\nalong each branch of the phylogeny. Here, we study a number of versions of the\ntree containment problem that explicitly account for branch lengths. We show\nthat, although length information has the potential to locate more precisely a\ntree within a network, the problem is computationally hard in its most general\nform. On a positive note, for a number of special cases of biological\nrelevance, we provide algorithms that solve this problem efficiently. This\nincludes the case of networks of limited complexity, for which it is possible\nto recover, among the trees contained by the network with the same topology as\nthe input tree, the closest one in terms of branch lengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 11:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-07"}

A\ntriangulation method based on STEREO stereoscopic observations is employed to\ndetermine the kinematics of the CME, and the outcome is compared with the\nresult derived from the type II radio burst with a solar wind electron density\nmodel. A Grad-Shafranov technique is applied to Wind in situ data to\nreconstruct the flux-rope structure and compare it with the observation of the\nsolar source region, which helps understand the geo-effectiveness associated\nwith the CME structure. Conclusions are as follows: (1) the CME undergoes an\nimpulsive acceleration, a rapid deceleration before reaching MESSENGER, and\nthen a gradual deceleration out to 1 AU, which should be noticed in CME\nkinematics models; (2) the type II radio burst was probably produced from a\nhigh-density interaction region between the CME-driven shock and a nearby\nstreamer or from the shock flank with lower heights, which implies\nuncertainties in the determination of CME kinematics using solely type II radio\nbursts; (3) the flux-rope orientation and chirality deduced from in situ\nreconstruction at Wind agree with those obtained from solar source\nobservations; (4) the prolonged southward magnetic field near the Earth is\nmainly from the axial component of the largely southward inclined flux rope,\nwhich indicates the importance of predicting both the flux-rope orientation and\nmagnetic field components in geomagnetic activity forecasting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 11:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

However, since the\nthree-body problem of classical celestial mechanics is just an approximation of\na much more complicated setting, where all celestial bodies in the solar system\nare subject to their mutual gravitational interactions, while solar radiation\npressure and other sources of nongravitational perturbations also affect the\ndynamics, it is conceptually desirable to improve the current understanding of\nsolar system dynamics in general relativity, as a first step towards a more\naccurate theoretical study of orbital motion in the weak-gravity regime. For\nthis purpose, starting from the Einstein equations in the de Donder-Lanczos\ngauge, this paper arrives first at the Levi-Civita Lagrangian for the geodesic\nmotion of celestial bodies, showing in detail under which conditions the\neffects of internal structure and finite extension get cancelled in general\nrelativity to first post-Newtonian order. The resulting nonlinear ordinary\ndifferential equations for the motion of planets and satellites are solved for\nthe Earth's orbit about the Sun, written down in detail for the Sun-Earth-Moon\nsystem, and investigated for the case of planar motion of a body immersed in\nthe gravitational field produced by the other bodies (e.g. planets with their\nsatellites). At this stage, we prove an exact property, according to which the\nfourth-order time derivative of the original system leads to a linear system of\nordinary differential equations. This opens an interesting perspective on\nforthcoming research on planetary motions in general relativity within the\nsolar system, although the resulting equations remain a challenge for numerical\nand qualitative studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 12:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

These extensions include adding higher powers\nof Ricci curvature $R$, coupling the Ricci curvature with scalar fields and\ngeneralized functions of $R$. In addition when viewed from the perspective of\nSupergravity (SUGRA) many of these theories may originate from the same SUGRA\ntheory interpreted in different frames. SUGRA therefore serves as a good\nframework for organizing and generalizing theories of gravity beyond General\nRelativity. All these theories when applied to inflation (a rapid expansion of\nearly Universe in which primordial gravitational waves might be generated and\nmight still be detectable by the imprint they left or by the ripples that\npersist today) can have distinct signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background\nradiation temperature and polarization anisotropies.

These models increasingly involve large numbers of unknown\nparameters, have complex structure which can result in substantial evaluation\ntime relative to the needs of the analysis, and need to be compared to observed\ndata. The correct analysis of such models usually requires a global parameter\nsearch, over a high dimensional parameter space, that incorporates and respects\nthe most important sources of uncertainty. This can be an extremely difficult\ntask, but it is essential for any meaningful inference or prediction to be made\nabout any biological system. It hence represents a fundamental challenge for\nthe whole of systems biology.\n  Results: Bayesian statistical methodology for the uncertainty analysis of\ncomplex models is introduced, which is designed to address the high dimensional\nglobal parameter search problem. Bayesian emulators that mimic the systems\nbiology model but which are extremely fast to evaluate are embedded within an\niterative history match: an efficient method to search high dimensional spaces\nwithin a more formal statistical setting, while incorporating major sources of\nuncertainty. The approach is demonstrated via application to two models of\nhormonal crosstalk in Arabidopsis root development, which have 32 rate\nparameters, for which we identify the sets of rate parameter values that lead\nto acceptable matches to observed trend data.

By introducing a binary optimization on the proposed tensor\ntogether with a local binary neighborhood concept, our algorithm better retains\nsharp features and produces smoother umbilical regions than previous\napproaches. On top of that, we provide a stochastic analysis on the different\nkinds of noise based on the average edge length. The quantitative and visual\nresults demonstrate the performance our method is better compared to state of\nthe art smoothing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2016 20:39:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 14:52:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-22"}

The problem addressed this paper is the detection of the community\nstructure from the information of both the network structure and the vertex\nattribute data.

The spatial model shows bifurcations in the\naverage magnetization, similar to what seen in the mean-field approximation,\ninduced by the change of the topology, after rewiring short-range to long-range\nconnection, as predicted by the small-world effect. These coherent periodic and\nchaotic oscillations of the magnetization reflect a certain degree of\nsynchronization of the spins, induced by long-range couplings. Similar\nbifurcations may be induced in the randomly connected model by changing the\ncouplings or the connectivity and also the dilution (degree of asynchronism) of\nthe updating.

These\nsystems are driven by dissipative systems, which lead to fractal assembly and a\nfractal network of charges (with associated quantum potentials) at the\nmolecular scale. At critical levels of charge density and fractal dimension,\nindividual quantum potentials merge to form a charged induced macroscopic\nquantum potential, which act as a structuring force dictating long range order.\nWhilst the system is only partially coherent (i.e. only the bosonic fields are\ncoherent), within these processes many of the phenomena associated with\nstandard quantum theory are recovered, with macroscopic quantum potentials and\nassociated forces having their equivalence in standard quantum mechanics. We\nestablish a testable hypothesis that the development of structures analogous to\nthose found in biological systems, which exhibit macroscopic quantum\nproperties, should lead to increased critical temperatures in high temperature\nsuperconducting materials. If the theory is confirmed it opens up a new,\nsystematic, ab initio approach to the structural development of these types of\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 11:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-24"}
