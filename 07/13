Because of it, the incorporation of the\nWSNs into the Internet of Things and the exponential growth of the latter may\nbe hindered if no control over the data generation is taken. Alternatively,\npart of the sensed data can be predicted without triggering transmissions and\ncongesting the wireless medium. In this work, we analyze and categorize\nexisting prediction-based data reduction mechanisms that have been designed for\nWSNs. Our main contribution is a systematic procedure for selecting a scheme to\nmake predictions in WSNs, based on WSNs' constraints, characteristics of\nprediction methods and monitored data. Finally, we conclude the paper with a\ndiscussion about future challenges and open research directions in the use of\nprediction methods to support the WSNs' growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 17:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}

Stellar populations are the building blocks of galaxies including\nthe Milky Way.

This is done by comparing SSP models against\nobservations of spatially resolved young stellar population in the\ndetermination of its physical properties, i.e. age and metallicity. METHODS.\nIntegral field spectroscopy of a young stellar cluster in the Milky Way, NGC\n3603, is used to study the properties of the cluster both as a resolved and\nunresolved stellar population. The unresolved stellar population is analysed\nusing the H$\\alpha$ equivalent width as an age indicator, and the ratio of\nstrong emission lines to infer metallicity.

Space-based detectors will observe\nlong-lived sources that persist while the detector moves relative to their\nlocation on the sky, using Doppler shifts of the signal to locate the sky\nposition. While these methods improve the pointing capability of a detector or\nnetwork, the angular resolution is still coarse compared to the standards one\nexpects from electromagnetic astronomy. Another technique that can be used for\nsky localization is null-stream pointing. In the case where multiple\nindependent data streams exist, a single astrophysical source of gravitational\nwaves will appear in each of the data streams. Taking the signals from multiple\ndetectors in linear combination with each other, one finds there is a two\nparameter family of coefficients that effectively null the gravitational wave\nsignal; those two parameters are the angles that define the sky location of the\nsource.

We test and validate ROAM on a synthetic test\nbed of a coronal magnetic flux rope and show that it performs well with a\nsignificantly sparse sample of the parameter space. We conclude that our\noptimization method is well-suited for fast and efficient model-data fitting\nand can be exploited for converting coronal polarimetric measurements, such as\nthe ones provided by CoMP, into coronal magnetic field data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 18:32:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}

The produced neutrinos are highly\nboosted in this mass regime.

The causal diamonds\nof HST along time-like geodesics of AdS space-time, fit nicely into the FRW\npatch of AdS space. The coordinate singularity of the FRW patch is identified\nwith the proper time at which the Hilbert space of the causal diamond becomes\ninfinite dimensional. For diamonds much smaller than the AdS radius, RAdS, the\ntime dependent Hamiltonians of HST are the same as those used to describe\nsimilar diamonds in Minkowski space. In particular, they are invariant under\nthe fuzzy analog of volume preserving diffeomorphisms of the holographic\nscreen, which leads to fast scrambling of perturbations on the horizon of a\nblack hole of size smaller than RAdS. We argue that, in order to take a limit\nof this system which converges to a CFT, one must choose Hamiltonians, in a\nrange of proper times of order RAdS, which break this invariance, and become\nlocal in a particular choice of basis for the variables.

Thus the best case scenario from a scientific\nstandpoint (fully informative data) is the worse case scenario from a\ncomputational perspective. In this paper we present an augmented\nLagrangian-type preconditioner based on a block diagonal approximation of the\naugmented upper left block of the KKT operator. The preconditioner requires\nsolvers for two linear subproblems that arise in the augmented KKT operator,\nwhich we expect to be much easier to precondition than the reduced Hessian.\nAnalysis of the spectrum of the preconditioned KKT operator indicates that the\npreconditioner is effective when the regularization is chosen appropriately.

In\nthe paper, we aim at understanding the ad costs from users perspective. We\nutilize app reviews, which are widely recognized as expressions of user\nperceptions, to identify the ad costs concerned by users. Four types of ad\ncosts, i.e., number of ads, memory/CPU overhead, traffic usage, and bettery\nconsumption, have been discovered from user reviews. To verify whether\ndifferent ad integration schemes generate different ad costs, we first obtain\nthe commonly used ad schemes from 104 popular apps, and then design a framework\nnamed IntelliAd to automatically measure the ad costs of each scheme. To\ndemonstrate whether these costs indeed influence users reactions, we finally\nobserve the correlations between the measured ad costs and the user\nperceptions. We discover that the costs related to memory/CPU overhead and\nbattery consumption are more concerned by users, while the traffic usage is\nless concerned by users in spite of its obvious variations among different\nschemes in the experiments.

Using the data\nlikelihood function, the posterior density is then formulated as a mixture\ndensity, and is sampled using a HMC approach (or any other scheme capable of\nsampling multimodal densities in high-dimensional subspaces). The main filter\ndeveloped herein is named \"cluster HMC sampling filter\" (ClHMC).

These \"I-Love-Q\"\nrelations have important implications for astrophysics and gravitational-wave\nastronomy. An interesting problem is whether similar relations hold for other\ncompact objects and how they approach the black-hole limit. To answer these\nquestions, here we investigate the deformation properties of a large class of\nthin-shell gravastars, which are exotic compact objects that do not possess an\nevent horizon nor a spacetime singularity. Working in a small-spin and\nsmall-tidal field expansion, we calculate the moment of inertia, the quadrupole\nmoment, and the (quadrupolar electric) tidal Love number of gravastars with a\npolytropic thin shell. The I-Love-Q relations of a thin-shell gravastar are\ndrastically different from those of an ordinary neutron star. The Love number\nand quadrupole moment are negative for less compact models and the I-Love-Q\nrelations continuously approach the black-hole limit. We consider a variety of\npolytropic equations of state for the matter shell, and find no universality in\nthe I-Love-Q relations. However, we cannot deny the possibility that, similarly\nto the neutron-star case, an approximate universality might emerge for a\nlimited class of equations of state. Finally, we discuss how a measurement of\nthe tidal deformability from the gravitational-wave detection of a\ncompact-binary inspiral can be used to constrain exotic compact objects like\ngravastars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 05:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-14"}

Energizing collisions of O with atmospheric\nsecondary hot atoms, induced by precipitating SW ions and ENAs, are also\nincluded in our consideration. The non-thermal reaction O + H$_2(v,j)\n\\rightarrow$ H + OH$(v',j')$ is described using recent quantum-mechanical\nstate-to-state cross sections, which allow us to predict non-equilibrium\ndistributions of excited rotational and vibrational states $(v',j')$ of OH and\nexpected emission spectra.

M dwarfs are considered ideal targets for Doppler radial velocity\nsearches. Nonetheless, the statistics of frequency of low-mass planets hosted\nby low mass stars remains poorly constrained. Aims. Our M-dwarf radial velocity\nmonitoring with HARPS-N can provide a major contribution to the widening of the\ncurrent statistics through the in-depth analysis of accurate radial velocity\nobservations in a narrow range of spectral sub-types (79 stars, between dM0 to\ndM3). Spectral accuracy will enable us to reach the precision needed to detect\nsmall planets with a few earth masses. Our survey will bring a contribute to\nthe surveys devoted to the search for planets around M-dwarfs, mainly focused\non the M-dwarf population of the northern emisphere, for which we will provide\nan estimate of the planet occurence. Methods. We present here a long duration\nradial velocity monitoring of the M1 dwarf star GJ 3998 with HARPS-N to\nidentify periodic signals in the data. Almost simultaneous photometric\nobservations were carried out within the APACHE and EXORAP programs to\ncharacterize the stellar activity and to distinguish from the periodic signals\nthose due to activity and to the presence of planetary companions. Results. The\nradial velocities have a dispersion in excess of their internal errors due to\nat least four superimposed signals, with periods of 30.7, 13.7, 42.5 and 2.65\ndays. The analysis of spectral indices based on Ca II H & K and Halpha lines\ndemonstrates that the periods of 30.7 and 42.5 days are due to chromospheric\ninhomogeneities modulated by stellar rotation and differential rotation. The\nshorter periods of 13.74 +/- 0.02 d and 2.6498 +/- 0.0008 d are well explained\nwith the presence of two planets, with minimum masses of 6.26 +/- 0.79 MEarth\nand 2.47 +/- 0.27 MEarth and distances of 0.089 AU and 0.029 AU from the host,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 08:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

They account successively for the effects of pileup,\nuniformity of the detector response, and residual data-simulation jet energy\nscale differences. Further corrections, depending on the jet flavor and\ndistance parameter (jet size) R, are also presented. The jet energy resolution\nis measured in data and simulated events and is studied as a function of\npileup, jet size, and jet flavor. Typical jet energy resolutions at the central\nrapidities are 15-20% at 30 GeV, about 10% at 100 GeV, and 5% at 1 TeV.

However, in various scenarios, the value of the output produced by\nan entity may have a tremendous impact on its future. This is for instance the\ncase of tasks such as computing maximal independent sets (MIS) in networks.\nIndeed, a node belonging to the MIS may be later asked more than to a node not\nin the MIS, e.g., because MIS in networks are often used as backbones to\ncollect, transfer, and broadcast information, which is costly. In this paper,\nwe revisit typical local distributed network computing tasks in the framework\nof algorithmic game theory. Specifically, we focus on the construction of\nsolutions for locally checkable labeling (LCL) tasks, which form a large class\nof distributed tasks, including MIS, coloring, maximal matching, etc., and\nwhich have been studied for more than 20 years in distributed computing.\n  Given an LCL task, the nodes are collectively aiming at computing a solution,\nbut, at the individual level, every node plays rationally and selfishly with\nthe objective of optimizing its own profit. Surprisingly, the classical\nframeworks for game theory are not fully appropriate for the purpose of our\nstudy.

A practical model\nin which information about the traffic generated by the CPs' users is not known\nto the MNO is considered. Under such asymmetric information, the incentive\ncontract between the MNO and each CP is properly designed so as to determine\nthe amount of allocated storage to the CP and the charged price by the MNO. The\ncontracts are derived by the MNO in a way to maximize the global benefit of the\nCPs and prevent them from using their private information to manipulate the\noutcome of the caching process.

The epidemic risk is\nquantified by the epidemic threshold of the\nsusceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible model for the propagation of\ncommunicable diseases, i.e. the critical value of disease transmissibility\nabove which the disease turns endemic. We verify for both synthetic and\nempirical data of human interactions that the use of incomplete data sets due\nto spatial sampling leads to the underestimation of the epidemic risk. The bias\nis however smaller than the one obtained by uniformly sampling the same\nfraction of contacts: it depends nonlinearly on the fraction of contacts that\nare recorded and becomes negligible if this fraction is large enough.

This suggests that the 10C\nHERGs are more core dominated than the LERGs.\n  Lower-frequency radio images, linear sizes and spectral indices are used to\nclassify the sources according to their radio morphology; 18 are Fanaroff and\nRiley type I or II sources, a further 13 show some extended emission, and the\nremaining 65 sources are compact and are referred to as FR0 sources. The FR0\nsources are sub-divided into compact, steep-spectrum (CSS) sources (13 sources)\nor GHz-peaked spectrum (GPS) sources (10 sources) with the remaining 42 in an\nunclassified class. FR0 sources are more dominant in the subset of sources with\n15.7-GHz flux densities $<$1 mJy, consistent with the previous result that the\nfainter 10C sources have flatter radio spectra.\n  The properties of the 10C sources are compared to the higher-flux density\nAustralia Telescope 20 GHz (AT20G) survey. The 10C sources are found at similar\nredshifts to the AT20G sources but have lower luminosities. The nature of the\nhigh-frequency selected objects change as flux density decreases; at high flux\ndensities the objects are primarily quasars, while at low flux densities radio\ngalaxies dominate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 12:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

In a typical SRJ scheme, the former set of factors is\nemployed in cycles of $M$ consecutive iterations until a prescribed tolerance\nis reached.

To better replicate the laser physics, averaged\nlaser models that include FSAs with higher-than-third-order nonlinearities have\nbeen introduced.

Single updates consist in concatenations\nof $n$ elementary lozenge rotations at adjacent vertices. The dynamics can also\nbe seen as a reversible stochastic interface evolution. When the update rate is\nchosen proportional to $1/n$, the dynamics is known to enjoy especially nice\nfeatures: a certain Hamming distance between configurations contracts with time\non average and the relaxation time of the Markov chain is diffusive, growing\nlike the square of the diameter of the system. Here, we present another\nremarkable feature of this dynamics, namely we derive, in the diffusive time\nscale, a fully explicit hydrodynamic limit equation for the height function (in\nthe form of a non-linear parabolic PDE). While this equation cannot be written\nas a gradient flow w.r.t. a surface energy functional, it has nice analytic\nproperties, for instance it contracts the $\\mathbb L^2$ distance between\nsolutions. The mobility coefficient $\\mu$ in the equation has non-trivial but\nexplicit dependence on the interface slope and, interestingly, is directly\nrelated to the system's surface free energy. The derivation of the hydrodynamic\nlimit is not fully rigorous, in that it relies on an unproven assumption of\nlocal equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 14:19:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 12:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-28"}

Water-ice is important because it regulates the efficiency\nof dust and planetesimal coagulation, and the formation of comets, ice giants\nand the cores of gas giants. Here we report ALMA images at 0.03-arcsec\nresolution (12 au) of the protoplanetary disk around V883 Ori, a protostar of\n1.3 solar masses that is undergoing an outburst in luminosity arising from a\ntemporary increase in the accretion rate.

However, by constructing\ninterior models for the mass range 0.8-1.6 Msun, we show that Gamma_1s is not\nconstant at stellar surfaces for the effective temperature range with which we\ndeal. Furthermore, the well-known relation between large separation and mean\ndensity also depends on Gamma_1s. Such knowledge is the basis for our aim of\nmodifying scaling relations.

These modular arrays are composed of horn-coupled,\npolarization-sensitive MKIDs, and each pixel has four detectors: two\npolarizations in two spectral bands between 125 and 280 GHz. A horn is used to\nfeed each array element, and a planar orthomode transducer, composed of two\nwaveguide probe pairs, separates the incoming light into two linear\npolarizations. Diplexers composed of resonant-stub band-pass filters separate\nthe radiation into 125 to 170 GHz and 190 to 280 GHz pass bands.

The interaction between chitin and protein critically determines\nthe properties of the composite biological materials. As living organisms\nusually encounter complex ambient conditions like water, pH and ions are\ncritical factors towards the structural integrity of biomaterials. It is\ntherefore essential to study the chitin-protein interface under different\nenvironmental conditions. Here, an atomistic model consisting of a chitin\nsubstrate and a protein filament is constructed, which is regarded as a\nrepresentative of the chitin-protein interface existing in many chitin-based\nbiomaterials. Based on this model, the mechanical properties of chitin-protein\ninterface under different moisture and pH values are investigated through\nmolecular dynamics simulations. The results reveal a weakening effect of water\ntowards the chitin-protein interface, as well as acidity, i.e. the protonated\nprotein forms a stronger adhesion to chitin than that in the alkaline\nenvironment. In addition, the effect from side-chain of protein is studied and\nit is found that certain kinds of amino acid can form hydrophobic connections\nto chitin surface, which means that these peptides partly dodge the weakening\neffect of water. Our observation indicates that terminuses and side-chains in\nprotein are of importance in forming interfacial hydrogen bonds. From our full\natomistic models, we can observe some molecular mechanisms about how protein\ninteracts with chitin in different conditions, which may spotlight the\nengineering on biomaterials with similar interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 03:32:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2016 13:45:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-26"}

We study the topological\nproperties of the mesh networks at different resolutions using the network\nmeasures, namely, node degree, node strength, betweenness centrality and global\nefficiency; and investigate the connectivity of anatomic regions, during a\ncognitive task. We observe significant variations among the network topologies\nobtained for different subbands. We, also, analyze the diversity properties of\nclassifier ensemble, trained by the mesh networks in multiple subbands and\nobserve that the classifiers in the ensemble collaborate with each other to\nfuse the complementary information freed at each subband. We conclude that the\nfMRI data, recorded during a cognitive task, embed diverse information across\nthe anatomic regions at each resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 17:26:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 20:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-13"}

A network's\nconnectivity is the minimum number of nodes, whose removal will cause the\nnetwork disconnected. It is a basic and important measure for the network's\nreliability, hence its overall robustness. Several conditional connectivities\nhave been proposed in the past for the purpose of accurately reflecting various\nrealistic network situations, with extra connectivity being one such\nconditional connectivity.

Due to the degrees of invariance of surfaces and that\nof freedom of joints, these operand polytopes are originally unbounded in most\nof the cases (i.e. polyhedra). Homri et al. proposed the introduction of\nvirtual boundaries (called cap half-spaces) over the unbounded displacements of\neach polyhedron to turn them into 6-polytopes. This decision was motivated by\nthe complexity that operating on polyhedra in R6 supposes. However, that\nstrategy has to face the multiplication of the number of cap half-spaces during\nthe computation of Minkowski sums. In general, the time for computing cap\nfacets is greater than for computing facets representing real limits of bounded\ndisplacements. In order to deal with that, this paper proposes the use of the\ntheory of screws to determine the set of displacements that defines the\npositioning of one surface in relation to another. This set of displacements\ndefines the subspace of R6 in which the polytopes of the respective surfaces\nhave to be projected and operated to avoid calculating facets and vertices\nalong the directions of unbounded displacements. With this new strategy it is\npossible to decrease the complexity of the Minkowski sums by reducing the\ndimension of the operands and consequently reducing the computation time. An\nexample illustrates the method and shows the time reduction during the\ncomputations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 08:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-01"}

Imposing covariance of the gravitational force with respect\nto the Lorentz transformations, we show from a thought experiment that a\nmagnetic-like force must be present whenever two or more bodies are in motion.\nThe exact expression for this gravitomagnetic force is then derived purely from\nspecial relativity and the consequences of such a covariant theory are\ndeveloped. For instance, we show that the gravitomagnetic fields satisfy a\nsystem of differential equations similar to the Maxwell equations of\nelectrodynamics. This implies that the gravitational waves spread out with the\nspeed of light in a flat spacetime, which is in agreement with the recent\nresults concerning the gravitational waves detection. We also propose that the\nvector potential can be associated with the interaction momentum in the same\nway as the scalar potential is usually associated with the interaction energy.\nOther topics are also discussed, for example, the transformation laws for the\nfields, the energy and momentum stored in the gravitomagnetic fields, the\ninvariance of the gravitational mass and so on. We remark that is not our\nintention here to propose an alternative theory of gravitation but, rather,\nonly a first approximation for the gravitational phenomena, so that it can be\napplied whenever the gravitational force can be regarded as an ordinary\neffective force field and special relativity can be used with safety. To make\nthis point clear we present briefly a comparison between our approach and that\nbased on the (linearized) Einstein's theory. Finally, we remark that although\nwe have assumed nothing from the electromagnetic theory, we found that gravity\nand electricity share many properties in common - these similarities, in fact,\nare just a requirement of special relativity that must apply to any physically\n(...)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 20:13:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2016 18:25:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 28 Apr 2018 01:46:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-01"}
