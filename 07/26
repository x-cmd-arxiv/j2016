It is demonstrated that $D=1$ case does not have physically\nviable regimes while $D=2$ has smooth transition from high-energy Kasner to\nanisotropic exponential regime. This transition occurs for two ranges of\n$\\alpha$ and $\\Lambda$: $\\alpha > 0$, $\\Lambda > 0$ with $\\alpha \\Lambda\n\\leqslant 1/2$ and $\\alpha < 0$, $\\Lambda > 0$ with $\\alpha\\Lambda < -3/2$. For\nthe latter case if $\\alpha\\Lambda = -3/2$, extra dimensional part has $h\\to 0$\nand so the size of extra dimensions (in the sense of the scale factor) is\nreaching constant value. We report substantial differences between $D=1$ and\n$D=2$ cases and between these cases and their vacuum counterparts, describe\nfeatures of the cases under study and discuss the origin of the differences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 16:25:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2016 18:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

It has been suggested that self-bound ensembles of\nultracold atoms should exist for atom number densities that are 10^8 times\nlower than in a helium droplet, which is formed from a dense quantum liquid.\nHowever, such ensembles have been elusive up to now because they require forces\nother than the usual zero-range contact interaction, which is either attractive\nor repulsive but never both.

The limited complexity along with parallel enumeration allows\nreal-time operational scheduling of a large number of loads. The simulation\nresults shown in this paper illustrate that relatively short term power\nforecast profiles can be used to effectively schedule dynamic loads with\nvarious dynamic load profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 17:10:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Their interest in inducing basic\nquenching mechanisms have recently been devised in the laser control of\nvibrational cooling through filtration strategies [O. Atabek et al., Phys. Rev.\nA87, 031403(R) (2013)]. A full quantum adiabatic control theory based on the\nadiabatic Floquet Hamiltonian is developed to show how a laser pulse could be\nenvelop-shaped and frequency-chirped so as to protect a given initial\nvibrational state against dissociation, taking advantage from its continuous\ntransport on the corresponding ZWR, all along the pulse duration. As compared\nwith previous control scenarios actually suffering from non-adiabatic\ncontamination, drastically different and much more efficient filtration goals\nare achieved. A semiclassical analysis helps in finding and interpreting a\ncomplete map of ZWRs in the laser parameter plane. In addition, the choice of a\ngiven ZWR path, among the complete series identified by the semiclassical\napproach, amounts to be crucial for the cooling scheme, targeting a single\nvibrational state population left at the end of the pulse, while all others\nhave almost completely decayed. The illustrative example, offering the\npotentiality to be transposed to other diatomics, is Na2 prepared by\nphotoassociation in vibrationally hot but translationally and rotationally cold\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 17:30:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

Given a matrix A of size m by n,\nstate-of-the-art randomized algorithms take O(m * n) time and space to obtain\nits low-rank decomposition. Although quite useful, the need to store or\nmanipulate the entire matrix makes it a computational bottleneck for truly\nlarge and dense inputs. Can we sketch an m-by-n matrix in O(m + n) cost by\naccessing only a small fraction of its rows and columns, without knowing\nanything about the remaining data? In this paper, we propose the cascaded\nbilateral sampling (CABS) framework to solve this problem. We start from\ndemonstrating how the approximation quality of bilateral matrix sketching\ndepends on the encoding powers of sampling. In particular, the sampled rows and\ncolumns should correspond to the code-vectors in the ground truth\ndecompositions. Motivated by this analysis, we propose to first generate a\npilot-sketch using simple random sampling, and then pursue more advanced,\n\"follow-up\" sampling on the pilot-sketch factors seeking maximal encoding\npowers. In this cascading process, the rise of approximation quality is shown\nto be lower-bounded by the improvement of encoding powers in the follow-up\nsampling step, thus theoretically guarantees the algorithmic boosting property.\nComputationally, our framework only takes linear time and space, and at the\nsame time its performance rivals the quality of state-of-the-art algorithms\nconsuming a quadratic amount of resources. Empirical evaluations on benchmark\ndata fully demonstrate the potential of our methods in large scale matrix\nsketching and related areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 18:28:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 14:00:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 03:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-28"}

We study how galaxy morphology changes the relation between the\ninner slope of the galaxy halo density profile, $\\alpha$, and the stellar mass,\n$M_{*}$, or rotation velocity $V_{\\rm rot}$. For this, we use the model of Del\nPopolo (2009) in combination with observed data from the Romanowsky \\& Fall\n(2012) sample of elliptical and spiral galaxies, the Local Group sample\ncompiled by McConnachie (2012), and the simulation results by Cloet-Osselaer et\nal.

The steepening\nhappens in the mass range dominated by non-rotationally supported galaxies\n(e.g., dSphs) and depends on the level of offset in the angular momentum of\nrotationally and non-rotationally dominated galaxies. The steepening is a\nconsequence of the decrease in baryons content, and angular momentum in\nspheroidal dwarf galaxies. We finally compare our result to the SPH simulations\nof Di Cintio. Our result is in qualitatively agreement with their simulations,\nwith the main difference that the inner slope $\\alpha$ at small stellar masses\n($M_* \\lesssim10^{8} M_{\\odot}$) is flatter than that in their simulations. As\na result, the claim that finding a core in dwarf galaxies with masses slightly\nsmaller than $\\simeq 10^6 M_{\\odot}$, (as in the Di Cintio, or Governato,\nsupernovae feedback mechanism) would be a problem for the $\\Lambda$CDM model\nmust be probably revised.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 19:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

The emission line expected for\nPerseus based on the XMM-Newton signal from the large cluster sample under the\ndark matter decay scenario is too faint to be detectable in the Hitomi data.\nHowever, the previously reported 3.5 keV flux from Perseus was anomalously high\ncompared to the sample-based prediction. We find no unidentified line at the\nreported high flux level. Taking into account the XMM measurement uncertainties\nfor this region, the inconsistency with Hitomi is at a 99% significance for a\nbroad dark-matter line and at 99.7% for a narrow line from the gas.

SVDD based K-chart was\nfirst introduced by Sun and Tsung for monitoring multivariate processes when\nunderlying distribution of process parameters or quality characteristics depart\nfrom Normality. The method first trains a SVDD model on data obtained from\nstable or in-control operations of the process to obtain a threshold $R^2$ and\nkernel center a. For each new observation, its Kernel distance from the Kernel\ncenter a is calculated. The kernel distance is compared against the threshold\n$R^2$ to determine if the observation is within the control limits. The\nnon-parametric K-chart provides an attractive alternative to the traditional\ncontrol charts such as the Hotelling's $T^2$ charts when distribution of the\nunderlying multivariate data is either non-normal or is unknown. But there are\nchallenges when K-chart is deployed in practice. The K-chart requires\ncalculating kernel distance of each new observation but there are no guidelines\non how to interpret the kernel distance plot and infer about shifts in process\nmean or changes in process variation.

The stiff spring approximation (SSA)\nof Schulten and coworkers enables to use the work performed along SMD\ntrajectories to obtain the PMF.\n  We discuss and demonstrate how a high spring constant, k, required for the\nvalidity of the SSA can violate another requirement of this theory, i.e., the\nvalidity of Brownian dynamics of the system. Violation of the Brownian\ncondition results in the introduction of kinetic energy contributions to the\nexternal work, performed during SMD simulations.

A common approach to tackle this is to\nforward-model the entire system - from the hardware to the analysis of the data\nproducts. For this purpose, we introduce two newly developed, open-source\nPython packages: the HI Data Emulator (HIDE) and the Signal Extraction and\nEmission Kartographer (SEEK) for simulating and processing single-dish radio\nsurvey data. HIDE forward-models the process of collecting astronomical radio\nsignals in a single-dish radio telescope instrument and outputs pixel-level\ntime-ordered-data. SEEK processes the time-ordered-data, removes artifacts from\nRadio Frequency Interference (RFI), automatically applies flux calibration, and\naims to recover the astronomical radio signal. The two packages can be used\nseparately or together depending on the application. Their modular and flexible\nnature allows easy adaptation to other instruments and data sets. We describe\nthe basic architecture of the two packages and examine in detail the noise and\nRFI modeling in HIDE, as well as the implementation of gain calibration and RFI\nmitigation in SEEK. We then apply HIDE & SEEK to forward-model a Galactic\nsurvey in the frequency range 990 - 1260 MHz based on data taken at the Bleien\nObservatory. For this survey, we expect to cover 70% of the full sky and\nachieve a median signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 5 - 6 in the cleanest\nchannels including systematic uncertainties.

Here, we report\nthe enhancement of T * in SmB6 under the application of tensile strain. With\n0.7% tensile strain we report surface dominated conduction at up to a\ntemperature of 240 K, persisting even after the strain has been removed. This\ncan be explained in the framework of strain-tuned temporal and spatial\nfluctuations of f-electron configurations, which might be generally applied to\nother mixed-valence materials.

Using time-series\nphotometric observations by the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope South\n(KELT-South) project and the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN),\ncombined with archival observations, we present the discovery of two extended\ndimming events of the young star, DM Ori. This young system faded by $\\sim$1.5\nmag from 2000 March to 2002 August and then again in 2013 January until 2014\nSeptember (depth $\\sim$1.7 mag). We constrain the duration of the 2000-2002\ndimming to be $<$ 860 days, and the event in 2013-2014 to be $<$ 585 days,\nseparated by $\\sim$12.5 years. A model of the spectral energy distribution\n(SED) indicates a large infrared excess consistent with an extensive\ncircumstellar disk. Using basic kinematic arguments, we propose that DM Ori is\nlikely being periodically occulted by a feature (possibly a warp or\nperturbation) in its circumstellar disk. In this scenario, the occulting\nfeature is located $>$6 AU from the host star, moving at $\\sim$14.6 km/s, and\nis $\\sim$4.9 AU in width. This localized structure may indicate a disturbance\nsuch as may be caused by a protoplanet early in its formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 20:02:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-01"}

We\nalso searched for neutron-star--black-hole systems with the same neutron star\nparameters, black hole mass $\\in [2,99] M_{\\odot}$ and no restriction on the\nblack hole spin magnitude. We assess the sensitivity of the two LIGO detectors\nto these systems, and find that they could have detected the merger of binary\nneutron star systems with component mass distributions of $1.35\\pm0.13\nM_{\\odot}$ at a volume-weighted average distance of $\\sim$ 70Mpc, and for\nneutron-star--black-hole systems with neutron star masses of $1.4M_\\odot$ and\nblack hole masses of at least $5M_\\odot$, a volume-weighted average distance of\nat least $\\sim$ 110Mpc. From this we constrain with 90% confidence the merger\nrate to be less than 12,600 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ for binary-neutron star systems\nand less than 3,600 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ for neutron-star--black-hole systems.\nWe find that if no detection of neutron-star binary mergers is made in the next\ntwo Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo observing runs we would place significant\nconstraints on the merger rates.

We couple the dual Lagrangians to appropriate background fields\n(including gauge fields, spin$_c$ connections and the metric). The non-trivial\nmaps between the currents and the line operators in the dual theories is\naccounted for by mixing of these fields.

In this paper we investigate a\nsample of 29 well-characterized brown dwarfs and very low mass stars, for which\nHerschel far-infrared fluxes as well as (sub)-mm fluxes are available. We have\nmeasured new Herschel PACS fluxes for 11 objects and complement these with\n(sub)-mm data and Herschel fluxes from the literature. We analyze their\nspectral energy distributions in comparison with results from radiative\ntransfer modeling. Fluxes in the far-infrared are strongly affected by the\nshape and temperature of the disk (and hence stellar luminosity), whereas the\n(sub)-mm fluxes mostly depend on disk mass. Nevertheless, there is a clear\ncorrelation between far-infrared and (sub)-mm fluxes. We argue that the link\nresults from the combination of the stellar mass-luminosity relation and a\nscaling between disk mass and stellar mass. We find strong evidence of dust\nsettling to the disk midplane. The spectral slopes between near- and\nfar-infrared are mostly between $-0.5$ and $-1.2$ in our sample, comparable to\nmore massive T Tauri stars, which may imply that the disk shapes are similar as\nwell, though highly-flared disks are rare among brown dwarfs. We find that dust\ntemperatures in the range of 7-15 K, calculated with\n$T\\approx25\\,(L/L_\\odot)^{0.25}$ K, are appropriate for deriving disk masses\nfrom (sub)-mm fluxes for these low luminosity objects.

In this\nlimit, the population eventually adopts a steady state characterized by\nmutation-selection-drift balance. Although new alleles continue to be explored\nthrough mutation, the statistics of the population, and in particular the\nprobabilities of seeing specific allelic configurations in samples taken from a\npopulation, do not change with time. In the absence of selection, probabilities\nof allelic configurations are given by the Ewens sampling formula, widely used\nin population genetics to detect deviations from neutrality. Here we develop an\nextension of this formula to arbitrary, possibly epistatic, fitness landscapes.\nAlthough our approach is general, we focus on the class of landscapes in which\nalleles are grouped into two, three, or several fitness states. This class of\nlandscapes yields sampling probabilities that are computationally more\ntractable, and can form a basis for the inference of selection signatures from\nsequence data. We demonstrate that, for a sizeable range of mutation rates and\nselection coefficients, the steady-state allelic diversity is not neutral.\nTherefore, it may be used to infer selection coefficients, as well as other key\nevolutionary parameters, using high-throughput sequencing of evolving\npopulations to collect data on locus polymorphisms. We also find that our\ntheory remains sufficiently accurate even if the assumptions such as the\ninfinite allele limit and the \"full connectivity\" assumption in which each\nallele can mutate into any other allele are relaxed. Thus, our framework\nestablishes a theoretical foundation for inferring selection signatures from\nsamples of sequences produced by evolution on epistatic fitness landscapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 20:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

However, the seeding and excitation of the temporal solitons is\nassociated with changes in the intracavity power, that can lead to large\nthermal resonance shifts during the excitation process and render the soliton\nstates in most commonly used resonator platforms short lived. Here we describe\na \"power kicking\" method to overcome this instability by modulating the power\nof the pump laser. A fast modulation triggers the soliton formation, while a\nslow adjustment of the power compensates the thermal effect during the\nexcitation laser scan. With this method also initially very short-lived (100ns)\nsoliton states , as encountered in SiN integrated photonic microresonators, can\nbe brought into a steady state in contrast to techniques reported earlier which\nrelied on an adjustment of the laser scan speed only. Once the soliton state is\nin a steady state it can persist for hours and is thermally self-locked.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 20:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

They travel\nforward in time to meet Lawrence at Berkeley around 1950, teaching them about\nthe how and why of accelerators. Next, they visit Wu at DESY, Hamburg, around\n1980, who explains the strong force. They end up in the LHC tunnel at CERN,\nGeneva, Switzerland in 2012. Two experimentalists tell them about colliders and\nour heroes watch live as the Higgs boson is produced and decays.

Modeling the network traffic patterns of multiplexed ICS streams\nusing Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) for anomaly detection typically\nproduces a very large DFA, and a high false-alarm rate. We introduce a new\nmodeling approach that addresses this gap. Our Statechart DFA modeling includes\nmultiple DFAs, one per cyclic pattern, together with a DFA-selector that\nde-multiplexes the incoming traffic into sub-channels and sends them to their\nrespective DFAs. We demonstrate how to automatically construct the Statechart\nfrom a captured traffic stream. Our unsupervised learning algorithm builds a\nDiscrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) from the stream. Next it splits the symbols\ninto sets, one per multiplexed cycle, based on symbol frequencies and node\ndegrees in the DTMC graph. Then it creates a sub-graph for each cycle, and\nextracts Euler cycles for each sub-graph. The final Statechart is comprised of\none DFA per Euler cycle. The algorithms allow for non-unique symbols, that\nappear in more than one cycle, and also for symbols that appear more than once\nin a cycle.

An adaptive ML-based framework is proposed in order to\noptimize the LTE scheduler operation. The proposed technique targets multiple\nobjective scheduling strategies. The weights of the different objectives are\nadjusted to optimize the resources allocation per transmission based on the UEs\ndemand pattern. In addition, it overcomes the trade-off problem of the\ntraditional scheduling methods. The technique can be used as a generic\nframework with any scheduling strategy. In this paper, Genetic Algorithm-based\n(GA-based) multi- objective scheduler is considered to illustrate the\nefficiency of the proposed adaptive scheduling solution. Results show that\nusing the combination of clustering and classification algorithms along with\nthe GA optimizes the GA scheduler functionality and makes use of the ML process\nto form a closed loop scheduling mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 21:45:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

There is an inherent tradeoff between the\nsparsity parameter $\\delta$ and the stretch function $f$ of the compression\nscheme, but the qualitative nature of this tradeoff has remained a persistent\nopen problem.\n  In this paper we show that the recent additive spanner lower bound of Abboud\nand Bodwin is just the first step in a hierarchy of lower bounds that fully\ncharacterize the asymptotic behavior of the optimal stretch function $f$ as a\nfunction of $\\delta \\in (0,1/3)$. Specifically, for any integer $k\\ge 2$, any\ncompression scheme with size $O(n^{1+\\frac{1}{2^k-1} - \\epsilon})$ has a\nsublinear additive stretch function $f$: $$f(d) = d +\n\\Omega(d^{1-\\frac{1}{k}}).$$ This lower bound matches Thorup and Zwick's (2006)\nconstruction of sublinear additive emulators. It also shows that Elkin and\nPeleg's $(1+\\epsilon,\\beta)$-spanners have an essentially optimal tradeoff\nbetween $\\delta,\\epsilon,$ and $\\beta$, and that the sublinear additive\nspanners of Pettie (2009) and Chechik (2013) are not too far from optimal.\n  To complement these lower bounds we present a new construction of\n$(1+\\epsilon, O(k/\\epsilon)^{k-1})$-spanners with size $O((k/\\epsilon)^{h_k}\nkn^{1+\\frac{1}{2^{k+1}-1}})$, where $h_k < 3/4$.

The large magnitude and\nvariability of VT stems from unclean interfaces, trapped charges in the\nunderlying substrate, and sulfur vacancies created during the mechanical\nexfoliation process. In this study, we demonstrate a simple and reliable oxygen\nplasma treatment, which mitigates the effects of unintentional doping created\nby surface defect cites, such as S vacancies, and surface contamination. This\nplasma treatment restores charge neutrality to the MoS2 and shifts the\nthreshold turn-on voltage towards 0V. Out of the 8 devices measured, all\nexhibit a shift of the FET turn-on voltage from an average of -18.7V to -0.9V.\nThe oxygen plasma treatment passivates these defects, which reduces surface\nscattering, causing increased mobility and improved subthreshold swing. For\nas-prepared devices with low mobilities (~0.01cm2/V.s), we observe up to a\n190-fold increase in mobility after exposure to the oxygen plasma.

In many\nproblem settings one encounters heavily populated phylogenetic trees, where the\nlarge number of leaves encumbers visualization and analysis in the relevant\nevolutionary moduli spaces. To address this issue, we introduce tree\ndimensionality reduction, a structured approach to reducing large phylogenetic\ntrees to a distribution of smaller trees. We prove a stability theorem ensuring\nthat small perturbations of the large trees are taken to small perturbations of\nthe resulting distributions.\n  We then present a series of four biologically motivated applications to the\nanalysis of genomic data, spanning cancer and infectious disease.

When the OFR of the\n$^{173}$Yb atoms occurs, the energy gap between the open and closed channels is\nsmaller by two orders of magnitudes than the van der Waals energy. As a result,\nquantitative accurate results for the low-energy two-body problems can be\nobtained via multi-channel quantum defect theory (MQDT), which is based on the\nexact solution of the Schr$\\ddot{{\\rm o}}$dinger equation with the van der\nWaals potential. In this paper we use the MQDT to calculate the two-atom\nscattering length, effective range, and the binding energy of two-body bound\nstates for the systems with OFR. With these results we further study the\nclock-transition spectrum for the two-body bound states, which can be used to\nexperimentally measure the binding energy. Our results are helpful for the\nquantitative theoretical and experimental researches for the ultracold gases of\nalkali-earth (like) atoms with OFR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 00:54:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

For symmetric noises, however, k-nearest neighbor achieves the\nsame consistent rate as that of noise-free setting, which verifies the\nresistance of k-nearest neighbor to random noisy labels. Motivated by the\ntheoretical analysis, we propose the Robust k-Nearest Neighbor (RkNN) approach\nto deal with noisy labels.

The\nlargest AR in the past 24 years, NOAA AR 12192, crossed the visible disk from\n2014 October 17 to 30, unusually produced more than one hundred flares,\nincluding 32 M-class and 6 X-class ones, but only one small CME. Flares and\nCMEs are believed to be two phenomena in the same eruptive process. Why is such\na flare-rich AR so CME-poor? We compared this AR with other four ARs; two were\nproductive in both and two were inert. The investigation of the photospheric\nparameters based on the SDO/HMI vector magnetogram reveals that the flare-rich\nAR 12192, as the other two productive ARs, has larger magnetic flux, current\nand free magnetic energy than the two inert ARs, but contrast to the two\nproductive ARs, it has no strong, concentrated current helicity along both\nsides of the flaring neutral line, indicating the absence of a mature magnetic\nstructure consisting of highly sheared or twisted field lines. Furthermore, the\ndecay index above the AR 12192 is relatively low, showing strong constraint.\nThese results suggest that productive ARs are always large and have enough\ncurrent and free energy to power flares, but whether or not a flare is\naccompanied by a CME is seemingly related to (1) if there is mature sheared or\ntwisted core field serving as the seed of the CME, (2) if the constraint of the\noverlying arcades is weak enough.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 03:48:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-28"}

An optimal algorithm providing the exact latency-optimal uplink\nscheduling policy is proposed with a polynomial-time complexity. Via numerical\nsimulations, it is shown that the proposed scheduling policy can provide\nseveral times lower network latency over the conventional ones in realistic\nenvironments. In addition, the proposed scheduling policy and its network\nlatency are analyzed asymptotically to provide better insights on the system\nbehavior.

Unfortunately, the\ndiameter of these parts can be significantly larger than the diameter of the\nunderlying network, leading to slow running times. Recent work by [Ghaffari and\nHauepler; SODA'16] showed that this phenomenon can be seen as the broad\nunderlying reason for the pervasive $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n} + D)$ lower bounds that\napply to most optimization problems in the CONGEST model. On the positive side,\nthis work also introduced low-congestion shortcuts as an elegant solution to\ncircumvent this problem in certain topologies of interest. Particularly, they\nshowed that there exist good shortcuts for any planar network and more\ngenerally any bounded genus network. This directly leads to fast $O(D\n\\log^{O(1)} n)$ distributed algorithms for MST and Min-Cut approximation, given\nthat one can efficiently construct these shortcuts in a distributed manner.\n  Unfortunately, the shortcut construction of [Ghaffari and Hauepler; SODA'16]\nrelies heavily on having access to a genus embedding of the network. Computing\nsuch an embedding distributedly, however, is a hard problem - even for planar\nnetworks. No distributed embedding algorithm for bounded genus graphs is in\nsight.\n  In this work, we side-step this problem by defining a restricted and more\nstructured form of shortcuts and giving a novel construction algorithm which\nefficiently finds a shortcut which is, up to a logarithmic factor, as good as\nthe best shortcut that exists for a given network. This new construction\nalgorithm directly leads to an $O(D \\log^{O(1)} n)$-round algorithm for solving\noptimization problems like MST for any topology for which good restricted\nshortcuts exist - without the need to compute any embedding.

However, since an {\\em ab-initio} treatment of even the\nsimplest diatomic systems is beyond today's capabilities approximate\nqualitative descriptions are warranted. In this paper, we develop such a\ntheoretical approach to model the photoelectrons resulting from intense\nlaser-molecule interaction. We present a general theory for symmetric diatomic\nmolecules in the single active electron approximation that, amongst other\ncapabilities, allows adjusting both the internuclear separation and molecular\npotential in a direct and simple way. More importantly we derive an analytic\napproximate solution of the time dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation (TDSE), based\non a generalized strong field approximation (SFA) version. Using that approach\nwe obtain expressions for electrons emitted transition amplitudes from two\ndifferent molecular centres, and accelerated then in the strong laser field.\nOne innovative aspect of our theory is the fact that the dipole matrix elements\nare free from non-physical gauge and coordinate system dependent terms -- this\nis achieved by adapting the coordinate system, in which SFA is performed, to\nthe centre from which the corresponding part of the time dependent wave\nfunction originates. Our analytic results agree very well with the numerical\nsolution of the full three-dimensional TDSE for the H$_2^+$ molecule. Moreover,\nthe theoretical model was applied to describe laser-induced electron\ndiffraction (LIED) measurements of O$_2^+$ molecules, obtained at ICFO, and\nreproduces the main features of the experiment very well. Our approach can be\nextended in a natural way to more complex molecules and multi-electron systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 07:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

To date, the most common choice in this\ncontext it is Gaussian/Gamma mixture models learned through a maximum\nlikelihood (ML) approach; we recently extended such algorithm for mixture\nmodels with inverse-Gamma components. Here, we introduce a fully analytical\nVariational Bayes (VB) learning framework for both Gamma and/or inverse-Gamma\ncomponents. We use synthetic and resting state fMRI data to compare the\nperformance of the ML and VB algorithms in terms of area under the curve and\ncomputational cost. We observed that the ML Gaussian/Gamma model is very\nexpensive specially when considering high resolution images; furthermore, these\nsolutions are highly variable and they occasionally can overestimate the\nactivations severely. The Bayesian Gauss-Gamma is in general the fastest\nalgorithm but provides too dense solutions. The maximum likelihood\nGaussian/inverse-Gamma is also very fast but provides in general very sparse\nsolutions. The variational Gaussian/inverse-Gamma mixture model is the most\nrobust and its cost is acceptable even for high resolution images. Further, the\npresented methodology represents an essential building block that can be\ndirectly used in more complex inference tasks, specially designed to analyse\nMRI-fMRI data; such models include for example analytical variational mixture\nmodels with adaptive spatial regularization or better source models for new\nspatial blind source separation approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 07:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

A novel property is that\nsymmetry breaking in fluctuation spectrum is not necessary for a nonlinear\npoloidal momentum flux. This is fundamentally different from the quasilinear\nReynold stress. Furthermore, the comparison implies that the poloidal rotation\ndrive from the radial gradient of nonlinear momentum flux is comparable to that\nfrom the quasilinear Reynolds force. Nonlinear poloidal momentum transport in\nstrong electrostatic turbulence is thus not negligible for poloidal rotation\ndrive, and so may be significant to transport barrier formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 08:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

The\nnotion of a Markov basis is first introduced by Diaconis and Sturmfels (1998)\nfor conditional testing problems on contingency tables by Markov chain Monte\nCarlo methods. In this method, we make use of a connected Markov chain over the\ngiven conditional sample space to estimate the P-values numerically for various\nconditional tests. A Markov basis plays an importance role in this arguments,\nbecause it guarantees the connectivity of the chain, which is needed for\nunbiasedness of the estimate, for arbitrary conditional sample space. As\nanother important point, a Markov basis is characterized as generators of the\nwell-specified toric ideals of polynomial rings. This connection between\ncommutative algebra and statistics is the main result of Diaconis and Sturmfels\n(1998). After this first paper, a Markov basis is studied intensively by many\nresearchers both in commutative algebra and statistics, which yields an\nattractive field called computational algebraic statistics. In this paper, we\ngive a review of the Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for contingency tables\nand Markov bases, with some fundamental examples.

The present work aimed to computationally study how\nphysical conditions imposed by pathologic valvular anatomy act on AF\nhemodynamics. We simulated AF with different severity grades of left-sided\nvalvular diseases and compared the cardiovascular effects that they exert\nduring AF, compared to lone AF. The fluid dynamics model used here has been\nrecently validated for lone AF and relies on a lumped parameterization of the\nfour heart chambers, together with the systemic and pulmonary circulation.\nThree different grades of severity (mild, moderate, severe) were analyzed for\neach of the four valvulopathies (aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, aortic\nregurgitation, mitral regurgitation). Regurgitation was hemodynamically more\nrelevant than stenosis, as the latter led to inefficient cardiac flow, while\nthe former introduced more drastic fluid dynamics variation. Moreover, mitral\nvalvulopathies were more significant than aortic ones. In case of aortic valve\ndiseases, proper mitral functioning damps out changes at atrial and pulmonary\nlevels. In the case of mitral valvulopathy, the mitral valve lost its\nregulating capability, thus hemodynamic variations almost equally affected\nregions upstream and downstream of the valve. The present study revealed that\nboth mitral and aortic regurgitation strongly affect hemodynamics, followed by\nmitral stenosis, while aortic stenosis has the least impact among the analyzed\nvalvular diseases. The proposed approach can provide new mechanistic insights\nas to which valvular pathologies merit more aggressive treatment of AF.

On the other hand, it opens new paths toward\nefficient attosecond pulse generation, novel imaging of electronic wave\nfunctions, and enhancement of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) intensity. A\nkey feature of HHG in a solid (as compared to the well-understood phenomena of\nHHG in an atomic gas) is the delocalization of the process, whereby an electron\nionized from one site in the periodic lattice may recombine with any other.\nHere, we develop an analytic model, based on the localized Wannier wave\nfunctions in the valence band and delocalized Bloch functions in the conduction\nband. This Wannier-Bloch approach assesses the contributions of individual\nlattice sites to the HHG process, and hence addresses precisely the question of\nlocalization of harmonic emission in solids. We apply this model to investigate\nHHG in a ZnO crystal for two different orientations, corresponding to wider and\nnarrower valence and conduction bands, respectively. Interestingly, for\nnarrower bands, the HHG process shows significant localization, similar to\nharmonic generation in atoms. For all cases, the delocalized contributions to\nHHG emission are highest near the band-gap energy. Our results pave the way to\ncontrolling localized contributions to HHG in a solid crystal, with hard to\noverestimate implications for the emerging area of atto-nanoscience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 10:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-17"}

The spontaneous symmetry breaking is implemented with\ndoublets, triplets and bidoublet scalars. The fermion sector is extended with\nan extra sterile neutrino per generation that helps in implementing the seesaw\nmechanism. The presence of extra particles in the model exactly cancels type-I\nseesaw and allows large value for Dirac neutrino mass matrix $M_D$. The key\nfeature of this work is that all the physical masses and mixing are expressed\nin terms of neutrino oscillation parameters and lightest neutrino mass thereby\nfacilitating to constrain light neutrino masses from $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay.\nWith this large value of $M_D$ new contributions arise due to; i) purely\nleft-handed current via exchange of heavy right-handed neutrinos as well as\nsterile neutrinos, ii) the so called $\\lambda$ and $\\eta$ diagrams. New physics\ncontributions also arise from right-handed currents with right-handed gauge\nboson $W_R$ mass around $3$~TeV.

Each user observes correlated source sequences and\ncommunicates to the relay over rate-limited noiseless links. The relay\nprocesses and broadcasts information to the two users over another rate-limited\nlink. The users then generate a common secret key based on their sources and\ninformation from the relay. In the untrusted relay setting, the goal is to\nestablish key agreement between the two users at the highest key rate without\nleaking information about the key to the relay. We characterize inner and outer\nbounds to the optimal tradeoff between communication and key rates. The inner\nbound is based on the scheme which involves a combination of binning, network\ncoding, and key aggregation techniques. For the trusted relay setting with a\npublic broadcast link, the optimal communication-key rate tradeoff is provided\nfor a special case where the two sources are available losslessly at the relay.\nThe results can be relevant for cloud-based secret key generation services.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 13:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

We use the bulge and disc colours as proxy\nfor their SFRs. We study the mean galaxy bulge-total mass ratio (B/T) as a\nfunction of the residual from the MS ($\\Delta_{MS}$) and find that the\nB/T-$\\Delta_{MS}$ relation exhibits a parabola-like shape with the peak of the\nMS corresponding to the lowest B/Ts at any stellar mass. The lower and upper\nenvelop of the MS are populated by galaxies with similar B/T, velocity\ndispersion and concentration ($R_{90}/R_{50}$) values. Bulges above the MS are\ncharacterised by blue colours or, when red, by a high level of dust\nobscuration, thus indicating that in both cases they are actively star forming.\nWhen on the MS or below it, bulges are mostly red and dead. At stellar masses\nabove $10^{10.5} $M$_{\\odot}$, bulges on the MS or in the green valley tend to\nbe significantly redder than their counterparts in the quiescence region,\ndespite similar levels of dust obscuration. The disc color anti-correlates at\nany mass with the distance from the MS, getting redder when approaching the MS\nlower envelope and the quiescence region. We conclude that the position of a\ngalaxy in the LogSFR-LogM$_{\\star}$ plane depends on the star formation\nactivity of its components: above the MS both bulge and disk are actively star\nforming. The nuclear activity is the first to be suppressed, moving the\ngalaxies on the MS. Once the disk stops forming stars as well, the galaxy moves\nbelow the MS and eventually to the quiescence region. This is confirmed by a\nlarge fraction ($\\sim45\\%$) of passive galaxies with a secure two component\nmorphology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 13:07:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 06:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

However, recent methods for\nsingle image super-resolution (SR) fail to maintain this advantage. They\nutilize CNNs in two decoupled steps, i.e., first upsampling the low resolution\n(LR) image to the high resolution (HR) size with hand-designed techniques\n(e.g., bicubic interpolation), and then applying CNNs on the upsampled LR image\nto reconstruct HR results. In this paper, we seek an alternative and propose a\nnew image SR method, which jointly learns the feature extraction, upsampling\nand HR reconstruction modules, yielding a completely end-to-end trainable deep\nCNN. As opposed to existing approaches, the proposed method conducts upsampling\nin the latent feature space with filters that are optimized for the task of\nimage SR. In addition, the HR reconstruction is performed in a multi-scale\nmanner to simultaneously incorporate both short- and long-range contextual\ninformation, ensuring more accurate restoration of HR images. To facilitate\nnetwork training, a new training approach is designed, which jointly trains the\nproposed deep network with a relatively shallow network, leading to faster\nconvergence and more superior performance. The proposed method is extensively\nevaluated on widely adopted data sets and improves the performance of\nstate-of-the-art methods with a considerable margin. Moreover, in-depth\nablation studies are conducted to verify the contribution of different network\ndesigns to image SR, providing additional insights for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 13:15:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

In addition, we find regions in which the\nbidirectional CDW states coexist. We propose that observation of two CDW states\nindicates a decoupling of the surface Te-layer from the rare-earth block layer\nbelow, and that strain variations in the Te surface layer drive the local CDW\ndirection to the specific unidirectional or, in rare occurrences, bidirectional\nCDW orders observed. This indicates that similar driving mechanisms for CDW\nformation in the bulk, where anisotropic lattice strain energy is important,\nare at play at the surface. In our bias-dependent measurements, we find no\ncontrast inversion for the CDW state between occupied and empty states. This\nfinding differs from other quasi 2-dimensional materials containing a hidden\n1-dimensional character which leads to a favorable Fermi surface nesting\nscenario. Our temperature-dependent measurements provide evidence for localized\nCDW formation above the bulk transition temperature, T$_{cdw}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 13:40:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

In highly parameterised models there\noften exist relationships between parameters over which model predictions are\nidentical, or nearly so. These are known as structural or practical\nunidentifiabilities, respectively. They are hard to diagnose and make reliable\nparameter estimation from data impossible. They furthermore imply the existence\nof an underlying model simplification. We describe a scalable method for\ndetecting unidentifiabilities, and the functional relations defining them, for\ngeneric models. This allows for model simplification, and appreciation of which\nparameters (or functions thereof) cannot be estimated from data. Our algorithm\ncan identify features such as redundant mechanisms and fast timescale\nsubsystems, as well as the regimes in which such approximations are valid. We\nbase our algorithm on a novel quantification of regional parametric\nsensitivity: multiscale sloppiness. Traditionally, the link between parametric\nsensitivity and the conditioning of the parameter estimation problem is made\nlocally, through the Fisher Information Matrix. This is valid in the regime of\ninfinitesimal measurement uncertainty. We demonstrate the duality between\nmultiscale sloppiness and the geometry of confidence regions surrounding\nparameter estimates made where measurement uncertainty is non-negligible.\nFurther theoretical relationships are provided linking multiscale sloppiness to\nthe Likelihood-ratio test. From this, we show that a local sensitivity analysis\n(as typically done) is insufficient for determining the reliability of\nparameter estimation, even with simple (non)linear systems.

This has drastic\nconsequences for the inference of parameters of a model when its dynamics lacks\ndetailed balance. Such non-equilibrium systems occur naturally in applications\nlike neural networks or gene regulatory networks. Here, we focus on the\nparadigmatic asymmetric Ising model and show that we can learn its parameters\nfrom independent samples of the non-equilibrium steady state. We present both\nan exact inference algorithm and a computationally more efficient, approximate\nalgorithm for weak interactions based on a systematic expansion around\nmean-field theory. Obtaining expressions for magnetisations, two- and\nthree-point spin correlations, we establish that these observables are\nsufficient to infer the model parameters. Further, we discuss the symmetries\ncharacterising the different orders of the expansion around the mean field and\nshow how different types of dynamics can be distinguished on the basis of\nsamples from the non-equilibrium steady state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 14:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

We confirm the synchronous\nX-ray/radio switching between a radio-bright (B) and a radio-quiet (Q) mode, in\nwhich the X-ray flux is a factor ~2.4 higher than in the B-mode. We discovered\nX-ray pulsations, with pulsed fraction of 38+/-5% (0.5-2 keV), during the\nB-mode, and confirm their presence in Q-mode, where the pulsed fraction\nincreases with energy from ~20% up to ~65% at 2 keV. We found marginal evidence\nfor an increase in the X-ray pulsed fraction during B-mode on a timescale of\nhours. The Q-mode X-ray spectrum requires a fit with a two-component model\n(either a power-law plus blackbody or the sum of two blackbodies), while the\nB-mode spectrum is well fit by a single blackbody (a single power-law is\nrejected). With a maximum likelihood analysis, we found that in Q-mode the\npulsed emission has a thermal blackbody spectrum with temperature ~3.4x10^6 K\nand the unpulsed emission is a power-law with photon index ~2.5, while during\nB-mode both the pulsed and unpulsed emission can be fit by either a blackbody\nor a power law with similar values of temperature and photon index. A Chandra\nimage shows no evidence for diffuse X-ray emission. These results support a\nscenario in which both unpulsed non-thermal emission, likely of magnetospheric\norigin, and pulsed thermal emission from a small polar cap (~1500 m^2) with a\nstrong non-dipolar magnetic field (~10^{14} G), are present during both radio\nmodes and vary in intensity in a correlated way. This is broadly consistent\nwith the predictions of the partially screened gap model and does not\nnecessarily imply global magnetospheric rearrangements to explain the mode\nswitching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 14:56:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

This dynamic links\nare then used to recognize the human behavioral aspects in the scene. First a\nmodel is developed to identify the human activities in an indoor scene and this\nmodel is dependent on the key features and interlinks between the various\ndynamic events using DPNs. The sub ROI are classified with DPN to associate the\ncombined interlink with a specific human activity. The recognition accuracy\nperformance between indoor (controlled lighting conditions) is compared with\nthe outdoor lighting conditions. The accuracy in outdoor scenes was lower than\nthe controlled environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 03:19:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-21"}

Modern industry has started to produce consumer grade EEG equipment which\nis handy and not too expensive. This gives us an opportunity to use BCI in\neveryday practice. In order to improve the performance of these devices, we\nneed effective algorithms for time series analysis and pattern recognition. We\nhave tested Emotiv Insight headset in a real live environment and we have\nconducted several tests for series of standard wavelets in P300 pattern\nrecognition task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 06:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}
