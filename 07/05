Since graphs of bounded treedepth are more\nrestricted than graphs of bounded tree- or pathwidth, we are interested in the\nalgorithmic utility of this additional structure.\n  On the negative side, we show that every dynamic programming algorithm on\ntreedepth decompositions of depth~$t$ cannot solve Dominating Set with\n$O((3-\\epsilon)^t \\cdot \\log n)$ space for any $\\epsilon > 0$. This result\nimplies the same space lower bound for dynamic programming algorithms on tree\nand path decompositions. We supplement this result by showing a space lower\nbound of $O((3-\\epsilon)^t \\cdot \\log n)$ for 3-Coloring and $O((2-\\epsilon)^t\n\\cdot \\log n)$ for Vertex Cover. This formalizes the common intuition that\ndynamic programming algorithms on graph decompositions necessarily consume a\nlot of space and complements known results of the time-complexity of problems\nrestricted to low-treewidth classes.\n  We then show that treedepth lends itself to the design of branching\nalgorithms. This class of algorithms has in general distinct advantages over\ndynamic programming algorithms: a) They use less space than algorithms based on\ndynamic programming, b) they are easy to parallelize and c) they provide\npossible solutions before terminating.\n  Specifically, we design for Dominating Set a pure branching algorithm that\nruns in time $t^{O(t^2)}\\cdot n$ and uses space $O(t^3 \\log t + t \\log n)$ and\na hybrid of branching and dynamic programming that achieves a running time of\n$O(3^t \\log t \\cdot n)$ while using $O(2^t t \\log t + t \\log n)$ space.\nAlgorithms for 3-Coloring and Vertex Cover with space complexity $O(t \\cdot\n\\log n)$ and time complexity $O(3^t \\cdot n)$ and $O(2^t\\cdot n)$,\nrespectively, are included for completeness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 16:06:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2016 14:04:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-09"}

A difficult problem\narising indoors and outdoors is localizing users over multipath channels.\nLocalization based on angle of arrival (AOA) generally involves a two-step\nprocedure, where signals are first processed to obtain a user's AOA at\ndifferent base stations, followed by triangulation to determine the user's\nposition. In the presence of multipath, the performance of these methods is\ngreatly degraded due to the inability to correctly detect and/or estimate the\nAOA of the line-of-sight (LOS) paths. To counter the limitations of this\ntwo-step procedure which is inherently sub-optimal, we propose a direct\nlocalization approach in which the position of a user is localized by jointly\nprocessing the observations obtained at distributed massive MIMO base stations.\nOur approach is based on a novel compressed sensing framework that exploits\nchannel properties to distinguish LOS from non-LOS signal paths, and leads to\nimproved performance results compared to previous existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 16:10:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-13"}

The fraction of the wind moving\nnearly parallel to the galactic plane carves a hole in the disk which will\ncontract after the end of the SN activity.

The main problem in fitting the data is the lack of low spatial\nfrequencies. This deficiency often leads to a local minimum and to\nnon-plausible solutions. In this work we explore how to obtain low frequency\ninformation for FWI. Our approach involves augmenting FWI with travel time\ntomography, which has low-frequency features. By jointly inverting these two\nproblems we enrich FWI with information that can replace low frequency data. In\naddition, we use high order regularization, in a preliminary inversion stage,\nto prevent high frequency features from polluting our model in the initial\nstages of the reconstruction. This regularization also promotes the\nnon-dominant low-frequency modes that exist in the FWI sensitivity. By applying\na joint FWI and travel time inversion we are able to obtain a smooth model than\ncan later be used to recover a good approximation for the true model. A second\ncontribution of this paper involves the acceleration of the main computational\nbottleneck in FWI--the solution of the Helmholtz equation.

This equation can be efficiently\nsolved using the iterative Fast Sweeping (FS) methods and the direct Fast\nMarching (FM) methods. However, when used for a point source, the original\neikonal equation is known to yield inaccurate numerical solutions, because of a\nsingularity at the source. In this case, the factored eikonal equation is often\npreferred, and is known to yield a more accurate numerical solution. One\napplication that requires the solution of the eikonal equation for point\nsources is travel time tomography. This inverse problem may be formulated using\nthe eikonal equation as a forward problem. While this problem has been solved\nusing FS in the past, the more recent choice for applying it involves FM\nmethods because of the efficiency in which sensitivities can be obtained using\nthem.

To this end, we report observations of\nmagnetoresistance (MR) in vertical Co-graphene-NiFe junctions with 1 to 4\ngraphene layers separating the ferromagnets, and demonstrate that the\ndependence of the MR sign on the number of layers and its inversion at\nrelatively small bias voltages is consistent with spin transport between weakly\ndoped and differently spin-polarized layers of graphene. The proposed\ninterpretation is supported by the observation of an MR sign reversal in biased\nCo-graphene-hBN-NiFe devices and by comprehensive structural characterization.\nOur results suggest a new architecture for vertical devices with electrically\ncontrolled MR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 18:22:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 16:11:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 17:38:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

Notably, we focus on the invasive dynamics of external agents,\nlike bacteria, within a host organism. The former are mapped to a population of\ndefectors that aim to spread in the extracellular medium of the host. In turn,\nthe latter is composed of cells, mapped to a population of cooperators, that\naim to kill pathogens. The cooperative behavior of cells is fundamental for the\nemergence of the living functions of the whole organism, since each one\ncontributes to a specific set of tasks. So, broadly speaking, their\ncontribution can be viewed as a form of energy. When bacteria are spatially\nclose to a cell, the latter can use a fraction of its energy to remove them. On\nthe other hand, when bacteria survive an attack, they absorb the received\nenergy, becoming stronger and more resistant to further attacks. In addition,\nsince bacteria play as defectors, their unique target is to increase their\nwealth, without supporting their own kind. As in many living organisms, the\nhost temperature plays a relevant role in the host-pathogen equilibrium. For\ninstance, in animals like human beings, a neural mechanism triggers the\nincreasing of the body temperature in order to activate the immune system.\nHere, cooperators succeed once bacteria are completely removed while, in the\nopposite scenario, the host undergoes a deep invasive process, like a blood\npoisoning. Results of numerical simulations show that the dynamics of the\nproposed model allow to reach a variety of states. At a very high level of\nabstraction, some of these states seem to be similar to those that can be\nobserved in some living systems.

For the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) on the\nSpitzer Space Telescope, a popular way to handle this is\nBiLinearly-Interpolated Subpixel Sensitivity (BLISS) mapping. As part of a\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), BLISS mapping estimates the sensitivity at\nmany locations (knots) on the pixel, then interpolates to the target star's\ncentroids. We show that such embedded optimization schemes can misfit or bias\nparameters.

We compare standard\nBLISS mapping to a variant where the knots are fit during the MCMC, as well as\nto a polynomial model. Both types of BLISS mapping give similar eclipse depths,\nand we find that standard knots behave like real parameters. Standard BLISS\nmapping is therefore a reasonable shortcut to fitting for knots in an MCMC.\nBLISS maps become inaccurate when the photon noise is low, but typically\napproximate the real sensitivity well. We also find there is no perfect method\nfor choosing the ideal number of BLISS knots to use on given data.

To\nexplain these observations Bastian et al. suggested a scenario in which a\nsecond population is formed by the accretion of enriched material onto the\nlow-mass stars in the initial GC population. The idea is that the low-mass,\npre-main sequence stars sweep up gas expelled by the massive stars of the same\ngeneration into their protoplanetary disc as they move through the GC core. We\nperform simulations with 2 different smoothed particle hydrodynamics codes to\ninvestigate if a low-mass star surrounded by a protoplanetary disc can accrete\nthe amount of enriched material required in this scenario. We focus on the gas\nloading rate onto the disc and star as well as on the lifetime of the disc. We\nfind that the gas loading rate is a factor of 2 smaller than the geometric\nrate, because the effective cross section of the disc is smaller than its\nsurface area. The loading rate is consistent for both codes, irrespective of\nresolution. The disc gains mass in the high resolution runs, but loses angular\nmomentum on a time scale of 10^4 yrs. Two effects determine the loss of\n(specific) angular momentum in our simulations: 1) continuous ram pressure\nstripping and 2) accretion of material with no azimuthal angular momentum. Our\nstudy and previous work suggest that the former, dominant process is mainly\ncaused by numerical rather than physical effects, while the latter is not.

Many galaxies possess two prominent spiral arms, some have\nmore, while others display a many-armed flocculent appearance. Spiral arms are\nassociated with enhanced gas content and star-formation in the disks of\nlow-redshift galaxies, so are important in the understanding of star-formation\nin the local universe. As both the visual appearance of spiral structure, and\nthe mechanisms responsible for it vary from galaxy to galaxy, a reliable method\nfor defining spiral samples with different visual morphologies is required. In\nthis paper, we develop a new debiasing method to reliably correct for\nredshift-dependent bias in Galaxy Zoo 2, and release the new set of debiased\nclassifications. Using these, a luminosity-limited sample of ~18,000 Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey spiral galaxies is defined, which are then further\nsub-categorised by spiral arm number. In order to explore how different spiral\ngalaxies form, the demographics of spiral galaxies with different spiral arm\nnumbers are compared. It is found that whilst all spiral galaxies occupy\nsimilar ranges of stellar mass and environment, many-armed galaxies display\nmuch bluer colours than their two-armed counterparts. We conclude that\ntwo-armed structure is ubiquitous in star-forming disks, whereas many-armed\nspiral structure appears to be a short-lived phase, associated with more\nrecent, stochastic star-formation activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

This approach allows us to identify the\nregime where the inflationary field range is uniquely determined by both the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio and the spectral index. Then, we derive a novel\nfield-range bound, which is two orders of magnitude stronger than the original\none derived by Lyth.

As\nour main theoretical result, we show that if the system is sufficiently ergodic\nthat this data satisfies a strong central limit theorem (as is known to hold\nfor chaotic Lorenz systems), then the governing equations $f$ can be exactly\nrecovered as the solution to an $\\ell_1$ minimization problem -- even if a\nlarge percentage of the data is corrupted by outliers. Numerically, we apply\nthe alternating minimization method to solve the corresponding constrained\noptimization problem. Through several examples of 3D chaotic systems and higher\ndimensional hyperchaotic systems, we illustrate the power, generality, and\nefficiency of the algorithm for recovering governing equations from noisy and\nhighly corrupted measurement data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 22:32:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 04:28:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

The treatment plans are usually evaluated\nwith total RBE-weighted dose, which is however deficient in relevance to the\nbiological effect in the linear-quadratic model due to its quadratic-dose term,\nor the dose-fractionation effect. In this study, we reformulate the\nextrapolated response dose (ERD), or synonymously BED, which normalizes the\ndose-fractionation and cell-repopulation effects as well as the RBE of treating\nradiation, based on inactivation of a single model cell system and a typical\ntreating radiation in carbon-ion RT. The ERD distribution virtually represents\nthe biological effect of the treatment regardless of radiation modality or\nfractionation scheme. We applied the ERD formulation to simplistic model\ntreatments and to a preclinical survey for hypofractionation based on an actual\nprostate-cancer treatment of carbon-ion radiotherapy.

In the\nprostate-cancer case, the ERD distribution was very similar to the\nRBE-weighted-dose distribution of the actual treatment in 12 fractions. With\nhypofractionation, while the RBE-weighted-dose distribution varied\nsignificantly, the ERD distribution was nearly invariant, implying that the\ncarbon-ion radiotherapy would be insensitive to fractionation.

Counterparts of these problems in classical\nsignal/image processing, such as impulse detection and foreground detection,\nhave been studied over the past few decades. We use piecewise-constant graph\nsignals to model localized patterns, where each piece indicates a localized\npattern that exhibits homogeneous internal behavior and the number of pieces\nindicates the number of localized patterns.

In this paper, we\npropose a joint CDN and peer-assisted web content delivery framework to address\nthe delivery failure problem. Different from conventional peer-assisted\napproaches for web content delivery, which mainly focus on alleviating the CDN\nservers bandwidth load, we study how to use a browser-based peer-assisted\nscheme, namely WebRTC, to resolve content delivery failures.

Therefore, it is intriguing to study the\nperformance of strategies implemented in conventional TCPs, which are not\ndedicated for video streaming, e.g., whether chunks are efficiently delivered\nwhen users per- form interactions with the video players. In this paper, we\nconduct mea- surement studies on users chunk requesting traces in DASH from a\nrep- resentative video streaming provider, to investigate users behaviors in\nDASH, and TCP-connection-level traces from CDN servers, to investi- gate the\nperformance of TCP for DASH.

In this paper we show that these changes in the embedding can be\nsystematically calculated in the 2+1 dimensional case by accounting for the\ndeviation of the spacelike geodesics between a spacetime and perturbations over\nit. Here we consider rotating BTZ as perturbation over $AdS_3$ and study\ndeviations of spacelike geodesics in them. We argue that these deviations arise\nnaturally as solutions of a \"generalized geodesic deviation equation\". Using\nthis we perturbatively calculate the changes in HEE upto second order, for\nrotating BTZ. This expression matches with the small system size expansion of\nthe change in HEE obtained by HRT (Hubeny, Rangamani and Takayanagi) proposal\nfor rotating BTZ. We also write an alternative form of entanglement first law\nfor rotating BTZ. To do this one needs to go beyond the leading order in the\nperturbation series discussed above.

The source term is also incorporated in\nthe path energy by means of its squared $L^2$-norm in time of a functional with\nlinear growth in space. This extension of the original transport model enables\nlocal density modulation, which is a desirable feature in applications such as\nimage warping and blending. A key advantage of the use of a functional with\nlinear growth in space is that it allows for singular sources and sinks, which\ncan be supported on points or lines. On a technical level, the $L^2$-norm in\ntime ensures a disintegration of the source in time, which we use to obtain the\nwell-posedness of the model and the existence of geodesic paths. Furthermore, a\nnumerical scheme based on the proximal splitting approach (Papadakis et al.,\n2014) is presented.

The key\ncontribution of this paper is an algorithm to learn the nameable parts of\nobjects automatically, from images obtained by querying Web search engines. The\nkey challenge is the high level of noise in the annotations; to address it, we\npropose a new unified embedding space where the appearance and geometry of\nobjects and their semantic parts are represented uniformly. Geometric\nrelationships are induced in a soft manner by a rich set of nonsemantic\nmid-level anchors, bridging the gap between semantic and non-semantic parts.

Due to their higher\ndensity compared to the carrier fluid, inertial particles tend to form high\nconcentration regions, i.e. clusters, and low concentration regions, i.e.\nvoids, due to the interaction with the turbulence. In this work, we present an\nexperimental investigation of the clustering phenomenon of heavy sub-Kolmogorov\nparticles in homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows. Three control parameters\nhave been varied over significant ranges: $Re_{\\lambda} \\in [170 - 450]$,\n$St\\in [0.1 - 5]$ and volume fraction $\\phi_v\\in [2\\times 10^{-6} - 2\\times\n10^{-5}]$. The scaling of clustering characteristics, such as the distribution\nof Vorono\\\"i areas and the dimensions of cluster and void regions, with the\nthree parameters are discussed. In particular, for the polydispersed size\ndistributions considered here, clustering is found to be enhanced strongly\n(quasi-linearly) by $Re_{\\lambda}$ and noticeably (with a square-root\ndependency) with $\\phi_v$, while the cluster and void sizes, scaled with the\nKolmogorov lengthscale $\\eta$, are driven primarily by $Re_{\\lambda}$.

However, since traditional strategies for a multihoming video CDN are\nsimply designed according to static rules, e.g., simply sending traffic via a\nISP which is the same as the ISP of client, they fail to dynamically allocate\nresources among different ISPs over time. In this paper, we perform measurement\nstudies to demonstrate that such static allocation mechanism is inefficient to\nmake full utilization of multiple ISPs' resources.

If this anomaly generates sufficient\ndifferential stress, it rapidly segregates to the object's center, triggering\nwhole body differentiation. We used an impact melting model based on the\nHugoniot equations, the linear shock-particle velocity relationship, and the\nempirical relationship between shock pressure and distance coupled with a Monte\nCarlo simulation of the late accretion process to determine conditions under\nwhich large impacts trigger differentiation in icy bodies.

The probability increases to 100% by the time surviving\nproto-satellites grow to the mass of Europa.

To\nobtain spatially continuous ground-level PM2.5 concentrations, several models\nestablished by point-surface fusion of ground station and satellite\nobservations have been developed. However, how well do these models perform at\nnational scale in China? Is there space to improve the estimation accuracy of\nPM2.5 concentration? The contribution of this study is threefold. Firstly,\ntaking advantage of the newly established national monitoring network, we\ndevelop a national-scale generalized regression neural network (GRNN) model to\nestimate PM2.5 concentrations. Secondly, different assessment experiments are\nundertaken in time and space, to comprehensively evaluate and compare the\nperformance of the widely used models. Finally, to map the yearly and seasonal\nmean distribution of PM2.5 concentrations in China, a pixel-based merging\nstrategy is proposed. The results indicate that the conventional models (linear\nregression, multiple linear regression, and semi-empirical model) do not\nperform well at national scale, with cross-validation R values of 0.488~0.552\nand RMSEs of 30.80~31.51 {\\mu}g/m3, respectively. In contrast, the more\nadvanced models (geographically weighted regression, back-propagation neural\nnetwork, and GRNN) have great advantages in PM2.5 estimation, with R values\nranging from 0.610 to 0.816 and RMSEs from 20.93 to 28.68 {\\mu}g/m3,\nrespectively. In particular, the proposed GRNN model obtains the best\nperformance. Furthermore, the mapped PM2.5 distribution retrieved from 3-km\nMODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) products, agrees quite well with the station\nmeasurements. The results also show that our study has the capacity to provide\nreasonable information for the global monitoring of PM2.5 pollution in China.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2016 02:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

The Spatial Preferred\nAttachment (SPA) model is a random graph model for complex networks: vertices\nare placed in a metric space, and the link probability depends on the metric\ndistance between vertices, and on their degree. We show that the SPA model\ntypically produces graphs that have small effective diameter, i.e. $O(\\log^2\nn)$, while rumour spreading is relatively slow, namely polynomial in $n$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2016 04:35:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}
