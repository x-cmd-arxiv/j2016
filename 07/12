The accretion process in Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs) can be\nstudied through the analysis of some UV and X-ray emission lines which trace\nhot gas flows and act as diagnostics of the post-shock downfalling plasma. In\nthe UV band, where higher spectral resolution is available, these lines are\ncharacterized by rather complex profiles whose origin is still not clear.\n  Aims. We investigate the origin of UV and X-ray emission at impact regions of\ndensity structured (fragmented) accretion streams.We study if and how the\nstream fragmentation and the resulting structure of the post-shock region\ndetermine the observed profiles of UV and X-ray emission lines.\n  Methods. We model the impact of an accretion stream consisting of a series of\ndense blobs onto the chromosphere of a CTTS through 2D MHD simulations. We\nexplore different levels of stream fragmentation and accretion rates. From the\nmodel results, we synthesize C IV (1550 {\\AA}) and OVIII (18.97 {\\AA}) line\nprofiles.\n  Results. The impacts of accreting blobs onto the stellar chromosphere produce\nreverse shocks propagating through the blobs and shocked upflows. These\nupflows, in turn, hit and shock the subsequent downfalling fragments. As a\nresult, several plasma components differing for the downfalling velocity,\ndensity, and temperature are present altoghether. The profiles of C IV doublet\nare characterized by two main components: one narrow and redshifted to speed\n$\\approx$ 50 km s$^{-1}$ and the other broader and consisting of subcomponents\nwith redshift to speed in the range 200 $\\approx$ 400 km s$^{-1}$. The profiles\nof OVIII lines appear more symmetric than C IV and are redshifted to speed\n$\\approx$ 150 km s$^{-1}$.\n  Conclusions. Our model predicts profiles of C IV line remarkably similar to\nthose observed and explains their origin in a natural way as due to stream\nfragmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2016 16:03:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

Here, we first\ncharacterize the electron-phonon intrinsic contribution to the electronic\nthermal resistivity of graphene as a function of doping using electronic and\nphonon dispersions and electron-phonon couplings calculated from first\nprinciples at the level of density-functional theory and many-body perturbation\ntheory (GW). Then, we include extrinsic electron-impurity scattering using\nlow-temperature experimental estimates. Under these conditions, we find that\nthe in-plane electronic thermal conductivity of doped graphene is ~300 W/mK at\nroom temperature, independently of doping. This result is much larger than\nexpected, and comparable to the total thermal conductivity of typical metals,\ncontributing ~10 % to the total thermal conductivity of bulk graphene. Notably,\nin samples whose physical or domain sizes are of the order of few micrometers\nor smaller, the relative contribution coming from the electronic thermal\nconductivity is more important than in the bulk limit, since lattice thermal\nconductivity is much more sensitive to sample or grain size at these scales.\nLast, when electron-impurity scattering effects are included, we find that the\nelectronic thermal conductivity is reduced by 30 to 70 %.

Instead, NN\nsearches are performed within each class, generating a score per class. A key\nproblem with NN techniques, including NBNN, is that they fail when the data\nrepresentation does not capture perceptual (e.g.~class-based) similarity.

The ABC-SD generates pseudo data from a\nsingle parametric distribution thought to be the true distribution of\nunderlying study data. This single distribution is either an educated guess, or\nit is selected via model selection using posterior probability criterion for\ntesting two or more candidate distributions. Further analysis indicated that\nwhen model selection is used, posterior model probabilities are sensitive to\nthe prior distribution(s) for parameter(s) and dependable on the type of\nreported summary statistics. Method: We propose ABC with Bayesian model\naveraging (ABC-BMA) methodology to estimate mean and standard deviation based\non various sets of other summary statistics reported in published studies. We\nconduct a Monte Carlo simulation study to compare the new proposed ABC-BMA\nmethod with our previous ABC-SD method. Results: In the estimation of standard\ndeviation, ABC-BMA has smaller average relative errors (AREs) than that of\nABC-SD for normal, lognormal, beta, and exponential distributions. For Weibull\ndistribution, ARE of ABC-BMA is larger than that of ABC-SD but <0.05 in small\nsample sizes and moves toward zero as sample size increases. When underlying\ndistribution is highly skewed and available summary statistics are only\nquartiles and sample size, ABC-BMA is recommended but it should be used with\ncaution. Comparison of mean estimation between ABC-BMA and ABC-SD shows similar\npatterns of results as for standard deviation estimation. Conclusion: ABC-BMA\nis easy to implement and it performs even better than our previous ABC-SD\nmethod for estimation of mean and standard deviation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2016 19:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

Based on N-body\nsimulations, we determine this pathway to formation is plausible, and we\nquantify the implications for planet formation in the Alpha Centauri binary. We\nexpect this formation scenario may have truncated the circumstellar disk\nslightly more than a system that formed in the current configuration, but that\nit most likely does not prevent terrestrial planet formation. We simulate\nplanet formation in this system and find that in most scenarios, two or more\nterrestrial planets can be expected around either Alpha Centauri A or B,\norbiting in a region out to approximately 2 AU, assuming planetesimals and\nplanetary embryos are able to first form in the system. Additionally,\nterrestrial planet formation and stability in Proxima Centauri's habitable zone\nis also plausible. However, an absence of planets around these stars may be\nindicative of highly disruptive stellar dynamics in the past.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2016 19:48:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 13:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

We study the TFR of luminous spirals and\nits relation to AM using the EAGLE set of $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological\nsimulations. Matching both relations requires disk sizes to satisfy constraints\ngiven by the concentration of halos and their response to galaxy assembly.\nEAGLE galaxies approximately match these constraints and show a tight\nmass-velocity scaling that compares favourably with the observed TFR.

Detailed simulation of massive star\nformation therefore requires an accurate treatment of radiation. However, all\npublished simulations have either used a diffusion approximation of limited\nvalidity; have only been able to simulate a single star fixed in space, thereby\nsuppressing potentially-important instabilities; or did not provide adequate\nresolution at locations where instabilities may develop. To remedy this we have\ndeveloped a new, highly accurate radiation algorithm that properly treats the\nabsorption of the direct radiation field from stars and the re-emission and\nprocessing by interstellar dust. We use our new tool to perform\nthree-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the collapse of massive\npre-stellar cores with laminar and turbulent initial conditions and properly\nresolve regions where we expect instabilities to grow. We find that mass is\nchanneled to the stellar system via gravitational and Rayleigh-Taylor (RT)\ninstabilities, in agreement with previous results using stars capable of\nmoving, but in disagreement with methods where the star is held fixed or with\nsimulations that do not adequately resolve the development of RT instabilities.\nFor laminar initial conditions, proper treatment of the direct radiation field\nproduces later onset of instability, but does not suppress it entirely provided\nthe edges of radiation-dominated bubbles are adequately resolved. Instabilities\narise immediately for turbulent pre-stellar cores because the initial\nturbulence seeds the instabilities.

Using the 'field\ngalaxy' stellar mass function from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the\nhalo mass function from the $\\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter Bolshoi simulation, we\nfind remarkable agreement between the two.

However, as abundance\nmeasurement techniques have progressed, there has been little standardization\nbetween individual methods and their comparisons. As a result, different\nstellar abundance procedures determine measurements that vary beyond quoted\nerror for the same elements within the same stars (Hinkel et al. 2014). The\npurpose of this paper is to better understand the systematic variations between\nmethods and offer recommendations for producing more accurate results in the\nfuture. We have invited a number of participants from around the world\n(Australia, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and USA) to calculate ten element\nabundances (C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Fe, Ni, Ba, and Eu) using the same stellar\nspectra for four stars (HD361, HD10700, HD121504, HD202206). Each group\nproduced measurements for each of the stars using: 1) their own autonomous\ntechniques, 2) standardized stellar parameters, 3) standardized line list, and\n4) both standardized parameters and line list. We present the resulting stellar\nparameters, absolute abundances, and a metric of data similarity that\nquantifies homogeneity of the data. We conclude that standardization of some\nkind, particularly stellar parameters, improves the consistency between\nmethods. However, because results did not converge as more free parameters were\nstandardized, it is clear there are inherent issues within the techniques that\nneed to be reconciled. Therefore, we encourage more conversation and\ntransparency within the community such that stellar abundance determinations\ncan be reproducible as well as accurate and precise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2016 20:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

This paper investigates the density of\ncodes in the complex Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds equipped with the chordal\ndistance. The choice of distance enables the treatment of the manifolds as\nsubspaces of Euclidean hyperspheres. In this geometry, the densest packings are\nnot necessarily equivalent to maximum-minimum-distance codes. Computing a\ncode's density follows from computing: i) the normalized volume of a metric\nball and ii) the kissing radius, the radius of the largest balls one can pack\naround the codewords without overlapping. First, the normalized volume of a\nmetric ball is evaluated by asymptotic approximations. The volume of a small\nball can be well-approximated by the volume of a locally-equivalent tangential\nball. In order to properly normalize this approximation, the precise volumes of\nthe manifolds induced by their spherical embedding are computed. For larger\nballs, a hyperspherical cap approximation is used, which is justified by a\nvolume comparison theorem showing that the normalized volume of a ball in the\nStiefel or Grassmann manifold is asymptotically equal to the normalized volume\nof a ball in its embedding sphere as the dimension grows to infinity. Then,\nbounds on the kissing radius are derived alongside corresponding bounds on the\ndensity. Unlike spherical codes or codes in flat spaces, the kissing radius of\nGrassmann or Stiefel codes cannot be exactly determined from its minimum\ndistance. It is nonetheless possible to derive bounds on density as functions\nof the minimum distance. Stiefel and Grassmann codes have larger density than\ntheir image spherical codes when dimensions tend to infinity. Finally, the\nbounds on density lead to refinements of the standard Hamming bounds for\nStiefel and Grassmann codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2016 20:10:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 17:03:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 13:51:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 27 Dec 2017 14:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-29"}

We measure the mean\nvalues and covariance matrix of $\\{R$, $l_a$, $\\Omega_b h^2$, $n_s$,\n$log(A_s)$, $\\Omega_k$, $H(z)$, $D_A(z)$, $f(z)\\sigma_8(z)\\}$, which give an\nefficient summary of Planck data and 2-point statistics from BOSS galaxy\nsample, where $R=\\sqrt{\\Omega_m H_0^2}\\,r(z_*)$, and $l_a=\\pi r(z_*)/r_s(z_*)$,\n$z_*$ is the redshift at the last scattering surface, and $r(z_*)$ and\n$r_s(z_*)$ denote our comoving distance to $z_*$ and sound horizon at $z_*$\nrespectively. The advantage of this method is that we do not need to put\ninformative priors on the cosmological parameters that galaxy clustering is not\nable to constrain well, i.e. $\\Omega_b h^2$ and $n_s$. Using our double-probe\nresults, we obtain $\\Omega_m=0.304\\pm0.009$, $H_0=68.2\\pm0.7$, and\n$\\sigma_8=0.806\\pm0.014$ assuming $\\Lambda$CDM; and $\\Omega_k=0.002\\pm0.003$\nand $w=-1.00\\pm0.07$ assuming o$w$CDM. The results show no tension with the\nflat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological paradigm.

The HME corresponds to a special\nlimit of the CQME in which only a cubic nonlinearity in the fast saturable\nabsorber is kept in the model. Here, we use singular perturbation theory to\ndemonstrate that the CQME has a stable high-energy solution for an arbitrarily\nsmall but non-zero quintic contribution to the fast saturable absorber.

While lithium carbides\nwith various compositions have been studied or suggested previously, the\ncrystal structures of these compounds are far from well understood. In this\nwork we present the first comprehensive survey of all ground state (GS)\nstructures of lithium carbides over a broad range of thermodynamic conditions,\nusing \\textit{ab initio} density functional theory (DFT) crystal structure\nsearching methods. Thorough searches were performed for 29 stoichiometries\nranging from Li$_{12}$C to LiC$_{12}$ at 0 GPa as well as 40 GPa. Based on\nformation enthalpies from optimized van der Waals density functional\ncalculations, three thermodynamically stable phases (Li$_4$C$_3$, Li$_2$C$_2$\nand LiC$_{12}$) were identified at 0 GPa, and seven thermodynamically stable\nphases (Li$_8$C, Li$_6$C, Li$_4$C, Li$_8$C$_3$, Li$_2$C, Li$_3$C$_4$, and\nLi$_2$C$_3$) were predicted at 40 GPa. A rich diversity of carbon bonding,\nincluding monomers, dimers, trimers, nanoribbons, sheets and frameworks, was\nfound within these structures, and the dimensionality of carbon connectivity\nexisting within each phase was observed to increase with increasing carbon\nconcentration. Of particular interest, we find that the well-known composition\nLiC$_6$ is actually a metastable one. We also find a unique coexistence of\ncarbon monomers and dimers within the predicted thermodynamically stable phase\nLi$_8$C$_3$, and different widths of carbon nanoribbons coexist in a metastable\nphase of Li$_2$C$_2$ (\\textit{Imm}2). Interesting mixed\n\\textit{sp}$^2$-\\textit{sp}$^3$ carbon frameworks are predicted in metastable\nphases with composition LiC$_6$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2016 21:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}

A salient feature of\nscattering on the AF fluctuations is that it is strongly enhanced at the Fermi\nsurface locations where the nesting is perfect (\"hot spots\" or \"hot lines\"). We\nreview derivation of the collision integral for the Boltzmann equation due to\nAF-fluctuations scattering. In the paramagnetic state, the enhanced scattering\nrate near the hot lines leads to anomalous behavior of electronic transport in\nmagnetic field. We explore this behavior by analytically solving Boltzmann\ntransport equation with approximate transition rates.

The magnetic-field dependences are characterized by two very\ndifferent field scales, the lower scale is set by the hot-spot width and the\nhigher scale is set by the total scattering amplitude. A conventional\nmagnetotransport behavior is limited to magnetic fields below the lower scale.\nIn the wide range in between these two scales the longitudinal conductivity has\nlinear dependence on the magnetic field and the Hall conductivity has quadratic\ndependence. The linear dependence of the diagonal component reflects growth of\nthe Fermi-surface area affected by hot spots proportional to the magnetic\nfield.

In such settings, identification is generally not possible without\nimposing additional assumptions. Identification is sometimes possible, however,\nif an instrumental variable (IV) is observed for all subjects which satisfies\nthe exclusion restriction that the IV affects the missingness process without\ndirectly influencing the outcome.

We develop a\npanel regression model using three financial indicators--dividends per share,\ncash flow per share, and book value per share--as explanatory variables for\nshare price. We then estimate individual company fundamentals for each year by\nremoving the time fixed effects from the two-way fixed effects model, which we\nidentified as the best of the panel regression models. One merit of our model\nis that we are able to extract unobservable factors of company fundamentals by\nusing the individual fixed effects.\n  Based on these results, we analyze the market anomaly quantitatively using\nthe divergence rate--the rate of the deviation of share price from a company's\nfundamentals. We find that share prices on average were overvalued in the\nperiod from 2005 to 2007, and were undervalued significantly in 2008, when the\nglobal financial crisis occurred.

We construct features in a hierarchical tree\nstructure, and use a splay operation to reduce the average cost of identifying\nthe root of a feature from $O[\\log L]$ to $O[1]$ ($L$ is the size of a feature)\nwithout additional memory costs. This reduces the overall time complexity of\nmerging trees from $O[L\\log L]$ to $O[L]$, reducing the number of operations\nper splay by orders of magnitude. We next introduce a pruning operation that\nskips merge operations between two fully self-connected KD-tree nodes. This\nimproves the robustness of the algorithm, reducing the number of merge\noperations in high density peaks from $O[\\delta^2]$ to $O[\\delta]$. We show\nthat for cosmological data set the algorithm eliminates more than half of merge\noperations for typically used linking lengths $b \\sim 0.2$ (relative to mean\nseparation). Furthermore, our algorithm is extremely simple and easy to\nimplement on top of an existing pair enumeration code, reusing the optimization\neffort that has been invested in fast correlation function codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 03:24:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 May 2017 19:11:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-02"}

Quantum magnetism is a rapidly evolving field, and recent\ndevelopments reveal that the ground states and low-energy physics of frustrated\nspin systems may develop many exotic behaviors once we leave the regime of\nsemi-classical approaches. The purpose of this article is to introduce these\ndevelopments. The article begins by explaining how semi-classical approaches\nfail once quantum mechanics become important and then describes the alternative\napproaches for addressing the problem. We discuss mainly spin $1/2$ systems,\nand we spend most of our time in this article on one particular set of\nplausible spin liquid states in which spins are represented by fermions. These\nstates are spin-singlet states and may be viewed as an extension of Fermi\nliquid states to Mott insulators, and they are usually classified in the\ncategory of so-called $SU(2)$, $U(1)$ or $Z_2$ spin liquid states. We review\nthe basic theory regarding these states and the extensions of these states to\ninclude the effect of spin-orbit coupling and to higher spin ($S>1/2$) systems.\nTwo other important approaches with strong influences on the understanding of\nspin liquid states are also introduced: (i) matrix product states and projected\nentangled pair states and (ii) the Kitaev honeycomb model.

While varying in sophistication, most model-spectra\ncomparisons fundamentally assume \"1D\" model physics. However, knowledge from\ngeneral circulation models and of solar system planets suggests that planetary\natmospheres are inherently \"3D\" in their structure and composition. We explore\nthe potential biases resulting from standard \"1D\" assumptions within a Bayesian\natmospheric retrieval framework. Specifically, we show how the assumption of a\nsingle 1-dimensional thermal profile can bias our interpretation of the thermal\nemission spectrum of a hot Jupiter atmosphere that is composed of two thermal\nprofiles. We retrieve upon spectra of unresolved model planets as observed with\na combination of $HST$ WFC3+$Spitzer$ IRAC as well as $JWST$ under varying\ndifferences in the two thermal profiles. For WFC3+IRAC, there is a\nsignificantly biased estimate of CH$_4$ abundance using a 1D model when the\ncontrast is 80%. For $JWST$, two thermal profiles are required to adequately\ninterpret the data and estimate the abundances when contrast is greater than\n40%. We also apply this preliminary concept to the recent WFC3+IRAC phase curve\ndata of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b. We see similar behavior as present in our\nsimulated data: while the H$_2$O abundance determination is robust, CH$_4$ is\nartificially well-constrained to incorrect values under the 1D assumption. Our\nwork demonstrates the need to evaluate model assumptions in order to extract\nmeaningful constraints from atmospheric spectra and motivates exploration of\noptimal observational setups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 04:20:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

The amount of thread\nlevel parallelism present in the GPU is limited by the number of resident\nthreads, which in turn depends on the availability of scratchpad memory in its\nstreaming multiprocessor (SM). Since the scratchpad memory is allocated at\nthread block granularity, part of the memory may remain unutilized. In this\npaper, we propose architectural and compiler optimizations to improve the\nscratchpad utilization. Our approach, Scratchpad Sharing, addresses scratchpad\nunder-utilization by launching additional thread blocks in each SM. These\nthread blocks use unutilized scratchpad and also share scratchpad with other\nresident blocks. To improve the performance of scratchpad sharing, we propose\nOwner Warp First (OWF) scheduling that schedules warps from the additional\nthread blocks effectively. The performance of this approach, however, is\nlimited by the availability of the shared part of scratchpad.\n  We propose compiler optimizations to improve the availability of shared\nscratchpad.

Comparative evaluations on the Casablanca and the A2D datasets\nshow that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art techniques: 24% relative improvement for pairwise concept\nclassification in the Casablanca dataset and 9% relative improvement for\nlocalization in the A2D dataset as compared to the most competitive baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 06:49:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}

In fact, models commonly adopted for the log phase that consist\nof autocatalytic chemical components, including ribosomes, can only show\nexponential growth or decay in a population, and phases that halt growth are\nnot realized.

Moreover, the distribution\nof lag time among cells shows an exponential tail, also consistent with\nexperiments.

The periodicity of the single-lined eclipsing\nbinary (SB1) system, as determined from 20 sets of RV observations from PARAS\nand 6 supporting sets of observations from SOPHIE data, is found to be 16.953 d\nas against the 4.24 d period reported from SuperWasp photometry. It is likely\nthat inadequate phase coverage of the transit with SuperWasp photometry led to\nthe incorrect determination of the period for this system. We derive the\nspectral properties of the primary star from the observed stellar spectra: Teff\n= 5125 +/- 67 K, [Fe/H] = 0.1 +/- 0.14 and log g = 4.6 +/- 0.14, indicating a\nK1V primary. Applying the Torres relation to the derived stellar parameters, we\nestimate a primary mass 0.864 +/- 0.097 M_sun and a radius of 0.854 +/- 0.050\nR_sun. We combine RV data with SuperWASP photometry to estimate the mass of the\nsecondary, M_B = 0.098 +/- 0.007 M_sun, and its radius, R_B = 0.127 +/- 0.007\nR_sun, with an accuracy of around 7%. Although the observed radius is found to\nbe consistent with the Baraffe's theoretical models, the uncertainties on the\nmass and radius of the secondary reported here are model dependent and should\nbe used with discretion. Here, we establish this system as a potential\nbenchmark for the study of VLMS objects, worthy of both photometric follow-up\nand the investment of time on high-resolution spectrographs paired with\nlarge-aperture telescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 09:18:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}

During the last\ndecade, machine learning has made spectacular progress, surpassing human\nperformance in complex tasks such as object recognition, car driving, and\ncomputer gaming. However, the central role of prediction in machine learning\navoids progress towards general-purpose artificial intelligence. As one way\nforward, we argue that causal inference is a fundamental component of human\nintelligence, yet ignored by learning algorithms.\n  Causal inference is the problem of uncovering the cause-effect relationships\nbetween the variables of a data generating system. Causal structures provide\nunderstanding about how these systems behave under changing, unseen\nenvironments. In turn, knowledge about these causal dynamics allows to answer\n\"what if\" questions, describing the potential responses of the system under\nhypothetical manipulations and interventions. Thus, understanding cause and\neffect is one step from machine learning towards machine reasoning and machine\nintelligence. But, currently available causal inference algorithms operate in\nspecific regimes, and rely on assumptions that are difficult to verify in\npractice.\n  This thesis advances the art of causal inference in three different ways.\nFirst, we develop a framework for the study of statistical dependence based on\ncopulas and random features. Second, we build on this framework to interpret\nthe problem of causal inference as the task of distribution classification,\nyielding a family of novel causal inference algorithms. Third, we discover\ncausal structures in convolutional neural network features using our\nalgorithms. The algorithms presented in this thesis are scalable, exhibit\nstrong theoretical guarantees, and achieve state-of-the-art performance in a\nvariety of real-world benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 10:32:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}

The angle between the magnetic field vectors at two sides\nof the current sheet was ~ 10{\\deg}. The minimum magnetic field magnitude\nwithin HFA was ~ 1 nT. The shock at two sides of the HFA was\nquasi-perpendicular. Upstream beam was observed on the leading side of the HFA.\nParameters and velocity distributions of solar wind ions and of upstream ions\nobserved on C1 and C3 spacecraft are analyzed separately in order to trace\ntheir changes across the event. The goal of this analysis was to get more\ninformation about the source of upstream beam. The beam evolved from the start\nof its observation till the HFA encounter being initially energetic and nearly\nmono-energetic. Its mean energy continuously decreased and energy spectrum\nwidened as HFA approached spacecraft. First observation of particular energy\nthat diminished with approaching the HFA varied linearly with gyro-radius of\nions. The energy spectra of integrated beam (for all observation) and the\nenergy spectrum of the beam observed just in front of HFA are very similar to\nthe magnetosheath ion energy spectrum observed after bow shock crossing at ~ 1\nhour after observation of the HFA. Lowest energies in the beam were observed\nwithin HFA only. Highest density and pressure of upstream beam are found in the\ncurrent sheet itself. We suggest that the upstream beam is the result of the\nmagnetosheath ions leakage through the region of HFA crossing with the bow\nshock front.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 11:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

Cellular networks are indeed a\nnatural candidate for the data tsunami the IoT is expected to generate in\nconjunction with legacy human-type traffic. However, the random access process\nfor scheduling request represents a major bottleneck to support IoT via LTE\ncellular networks. Accordingly, this paper develops a mathematical framework to\nmodel and study the random access channel (RACH) scalability to accommodate IoT\ntraffic. The developed model is based on stochastic geometry and discrete time\nMarkov chains (DTMC) to account for different access strategies and possible\nsources of inter-cell and intra-cell interferences. To this end, the developed\nmodel is utilized to assess and compare three different access strategies,\nwhich incorporate a combination of transmission persistency, back-off, and\npower ramping. The analysis and the results showcased herewith clearly\nillustrate the vulnerability of the random access procedure as the IoT\nintensity grows.

Deploying more base stations (BSs) improves\nthe spatial frequency utilization, which increases the network capacity.\nHowever, such improvement comes at the expense of shrinking the BSs'\nfootprints, which increases the handover (HO) rate and may diminish the\nforeseen capacity gains. In this paper, we propose a cooperative HO management\nscheme to mitigate the HO effect on throughput gains achieved via cellular\nnetwork densification. The proposed HO scheme relies on skipping HO to the\nnearest BS at some instances along the user's trajectory while enabling\ncooperative BS service during HO execution at other instances. To this end, we\ndevelop a mathematical model, via stochastic geometry, to quantify the\nperformance of the proposed HO scheme in terms of coverage probability and user\nthroughput. The results show that the proposed cooperative HO scheme\noutperforms the always best connected based association at high mobility. Also,\nthe value of BS cooperation along with handover skipping is quantified with\nrespect to the HO skipping only that has recently appeared in the literature.\nParticularly, the proposed cooperative HO scheme shows throughput gains of 12%\nto 27% and 17% on average, when compared to the always best connected and HO\nskipping only schemes at user velocity ranging from 80 km/h to 160 Km/h,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 14:46:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}

Taking the\nGW150914 event detected by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave\nObservatory and the X-ray event detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor\nas an example, we study how the curvature $k$ and the constant curvature radius\n$l$ affect the horizon radii of GW and EMW in the de Sitter and Einstein-de\nSitter models of the universe. This provides an alternative method for probing\nextra dimension through future GW observations of compact binaries and their\nelectromagnetic counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 15:03:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2016 12:40:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 01:41:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-23"}

In this paper, we propose a parsimonious\nmixed-effects model based on HodgeRank, which takes into account both the fixed\neffect that the majority of annotators follows a common linear utility model,\nand the random effect that a small subset of annotators might deviate from the\ncommon significantly and exhibits strongly personalized preferences.

In this paper we review the basic steps that led to the design\nconcepts for the SST-1M camera and the ongoing realization of the first\nprototype, with focus on the innovative solutions adopted for the photodetector\nplane and the readout and trigger parts of the camera. In addition, we report\non results of laboratory measurements on real scale elements that validate the\ncamera design and show that it is capable of matching the CTA requirements of\noperating up to high-moon-light background conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 15:42:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

We investigate the pc scale\nproperties of a sub-sample of radio faint 1FHL sources with the aim to confirm\nthe proposed blazar associations, by revealing a compact high brightness\ntemperature radio core, and we propose new low-frequency counterparts for the\nunassociated gamma-ray sources (UGS). Moreover, we increase the number of 1FHL\nsources with high resolution observations to explore the possible connection\nbetween radio and gamma rays at E >10 GeV. We observed 84 1FHL sources, mostly\nblazars of High Synchrotron Peaked (HSP) type, in the northern sky with the\nVery Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 5 GHz. These sources lack high resolution\nradio observations and have at least one NVSS counterpart within the 95%\nconfidence radius. For those sources without a well identified radio\ncounterpart we exploit the VLBA multiple phase-center correlation capability to\ndiscern among the possible low-frequency candidates. For about 93% of the\nsources of our sample we reveal a compact high brightness temperature radio\ncore, supporting their proposed blazar association. The vast majority of the\ndetected sources are radio weak, with a median VLBI flux density value of 16.3\nmJy. For the detected sources we obtain an average brightness temperature of\nthe order of $2\\times10^{10} \\, \\rm{K}$. We find a compact component for 16\nUGS, for which we propose a new low-frequency association.

With\nhindsight, the reasons can be identified easily enough: either the security\ntask itself is too cumbersome and/or time-consuming, or it creates high\nfriction with the users` primary task. The aim of the research presented here\nis to equip designers who select and implement security mechanisms with a\nmethod for identifying the ``best fit`` security mechanism at the design stage.\nSince many usability problems have been identified with authentication, we\nfocus on ``best fit`` authentication, and present a framework that allows\nsecurity designers not only to model the workload associated with a particular\nauthentication method, but more importantly to model it in the context of the\nuser`s primary task. We draw on results from cognitive psychology to create a\nmethod that allows a designer to understand the impact of a particular\nauthentication method on user productivity and satisfaction. In a validation\nstudy using a physical mockup of an airline check-in kiosk, we demonstrate that\nthe model can predict user performance and satisfaction. Furthermore, design\nexperts suggested personalized order recommendations which were similar to our\nmodel`s predictions. Our model is the first that supports identification of a\nholistic fit between the task of user authentication and the context in which\nit is performed. When applied to new systems, we believe it will help designers\nunderstand the usability impact of their security choices and thus develop\nsolutions that maximize both.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 15:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}
