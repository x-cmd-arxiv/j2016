This scenario extends the well known\ntheory that uses a similar coupling between the Ricci scalar and the baryonic\ncurrent. One appealing feature of the scenario we study is that the predicted\nbaryon asymmetry during a radiation domination era is non-zero.

Our\nsystem combines given and learned knowledge of the structure of a particular\nsituation, and adapts that knowledge to a new situation instance as it actively\nsearches for objects. More specifically, the system learns a set of probability\ndistributions describing spatial and other relationships among relevant\nobjects. The system uses those distributions to iteratively sample object\nproposals on a test image, but also continually uses information from those\nobject proposals to adaptively modify the distributions based on what the\nsystem has detected. We test our approach's ability to efficiently localize\nobjects, using a situation-specific image dataset created by our group. We\ncompare the results with several baselines and variations on our method, and\ndemonstrate the strong benefit of using situation knowledge and active\ncontext-driven localization.

The free material design can be formulated as an\noptimization problem. However, due to its large scale, second-order methods\ncannot solve the free material design problem in reasonable size. We formulate\nthe free material optimization (FMO) problem into a saddle-point form in which\nthe inverse of the stiffness matrix A(E) in the constraint is eliminated. The\nsize of A(E) is generally large, denoted as N by N. This is the first\nformulation of FMO without A(E). We apply the primal-dual subgradient method\n[17] to solve the restricted saddle-point formula. This is the first\ngradient-type method for FMO. Each iteration of our algorithm takes a total of\n$O(N^2)$ foating-point operations and an auxiliary vector storage of size O(N),\ncompared with formulations having the inverse of A(E) which requires $O(N^3)$\narithmetic operations and an auxiliary vector storage of size $O(N^2)$.

The gauge structures of interacting many-body\nsystems, which often present exotic features, are particularly interesting.\nWhile quantum systems are intrinsically linear due to the superposition\nprinciple, nonlinear quantum mechanics can arise as an effective theory for\ninteracting systems (such as condensates of interacting bosons). Here we show\nthat gauge structures similar to curved spacetime can arise in nonlinear\nquantum systems where the superposition principle breaks down.

We show that S2B galaxies exhibit several distinct\nkinematic features, namely: (1) significantly distorted isovelocity contours at\nthe transition region between the two bars, (2) peaks in $\\sigma_\\mathrm{LOS}$\nalong the minor axis of inner bars, which we term \"$\\sigma$-humps\", that are\noften accompanied by ring/spiral-like features of increased\n$\\sigma_\\mathrm{LOS}$, (3) $h_3-\\bar{v}$ anti-correlations in the region of the\ninner bar for certain orientations, and (4) rings of positive $h_4$ when viewed\nat low inclinations.

In order to transmit data\nin such systems we need to cluster them in packages.

Actual\nimplementations of quantum computers will be susceptible to loss in the form of\nphysically faulty qubits. Though these physical faults must negatively affect\nthe computation, we can deal with them by adapting error correction schemes. In\nthis paper We have simulated statically placed single-fault lattices and\nlattices with randomly placed faults at functional qubit yields of 80%, 90% and\n95%, showing practical performance of a defective surface code by employing\nactual circuit constructions and realistic errors on every gate, including\nidentity gates. We extend Stace et al.'s superplaquettes solution against\ndynamic losses for the surface code to handle static losses such as physically\nfaulty qubits. The single-fault analysis shows that a static loss at the\nperiphery of the lattice has less negative effect than a static loss at the\ncenter. The randomly-faulty analysis shows that 95% yield is good enough to\nbuild a large scale quantum computer. The local gate error rate threshold is\n$\\sim 0.3\\%$, and a code distance of seven suppresses the residual error rate\nbelow the original error rate at $p=0.1\\%$. 90% yield is also good enough when\nwe discard badly fabricated quantum computation chips, while 80% yield does not\nshow enough error suppression even when discarding 90% of the chips. We\nevaluated several metrics for predicting chip performance, and found that the\naverage of the product of the number of data qubits and the cycle time of a\nstabilizer measurement of stabilizers gave the strongest correlation with\npost-correction residual error rates.

In this paper, we include such factors to forecast the\nvalue of the Indian rupee vis a vis the US Dollar. Further, factors reflecting\npolitical instability and lack of mechanism for enforcement of contracts that\ncan affect both direct foreign investment and also portfolio investment, have\nbeen incorporated. The explanatory variables chosen are the 3 month Rupee\nDollar futures exchange rate (FX4), NIFTY returns (NIFTYR), Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average returns (DJIAR), Hang Seng returns (HSR), DAX returns (DR),\ncrude oil price (COP), CBOE VIX (CV) and India VIX (IV). To forecast the\nexchange rate, we have used two different classes of frameworks namely,\nArtificial Neural Network (ANN) based models and Time Series Econometric\nmodels. Multilayer Feed Forward Neural Network (MLFFNN) and Nonlinear\nAutoregressive models with Exogenous Input (NARX) Neural Network are the\napproaches that we have used as ANN models. Generalized Autoregressive\nConditional Heteroskedastic (GARCH) and Exponential Generalized Autoregressive\nConditional Heteroskedastic (EGARCH) techniques are the ones that we have used\nas Time Series Econometric methods. Within our framework, our results indicate\nthat, although the two different approaches are quite efficient in forecasting\nthe exchange rate, MLFNN and NARX are the most efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2016 06:17:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-08"}

In case of an invisible watermark, the human eye can not perceive\nany difference in the video, but a watermark extraction application can read\nthe watermark and obtain the embedded information. Although numerous\nmethodologies exist for embedding watermarks, many of them have shortcomings\nwith respect to performance efficiency, especially over a distributed network.\nThis paper proposes and analyses a 2-bit Least Significant Bit (LSB) parallel\nalgorithmic approach for achieving performance efficiency to watermark and\ndistribute videos over a client-server framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2016 12:39:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-15"}
