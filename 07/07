Therefore, an accurate numerical simulation of these phenomena is\nmandatory to correctly model and understand many astrophysical events, such as\nSupernovas, stellar collisions, or planetary formation. In this work, we\nattempt to address many of the problems that the smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) technique has when dealing with subsonic hydrodynamical\ninstabilities or shocks. To that aim we built a new SPH code named SPHYNX, that\nincludes many of the recent advances in the SPH technique and some other new\nones, which we present here. SPHYNX is of Newtonian type and grounded in the\nEuler-Lagrange formulation of the SPH technique. Its distinctive features are:\nthe use of an integral approach to estimating the gradients; the use of a\nflexible family of interpolators called sinc kernels, which suppress pairing\ninstability; and the incorporation of a new type of volume element which\nprovides a better partition of the unity. Unlike other modern formulations,\nwhich consider volume elements linked to pressure, our volume element choice\nrelies on density. SPHYNX conserves mass, linear and angular momentum, energy,\nentropy, and preserves kernel normalization even in strong shocks. The coupling\nbetween the integral approach to calculate gradients and the new family of\nvolume elements reduces the so-called tensile instability. Both features help\nto suppress the damp which often prevents the growth of hydrodynamic\ninstabilities in regular SPH codes. On the whole, SPHYNX has passed the\nverification tests described below. For identical particle setting and initial\nconditions the results were similar (or better in some particular cases) than\nthose obtained with other SPH schemes such as GADGET-2, PSPH or with the recent\ndensity-independent formulation (DISPH) and conservative reproducing kernel\n(CRKSPH) techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2016 16:20:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2016 19:24:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 15:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

Yet how the organization of white matter architecture\nconstrains how the brain transitions from one cognitive state to another\nremains unknown. Here we address this question from a computational perspective\nby defining a brain state as a pattern of activity across brain regions.\nDrawing on recent advances in network control theory, we model the underlying\nmechanisms of brain state transitions as elicited by the collective control of\nregion sets. Specifically, we examine how the brain moves from a specified\ninitial state (characterized by high activity in the default mode) to a\nspecified target state (characterized by high activity in primary sensorimotor\ncortex) in finite time. Across all state transitions, we observe that the\nsupramarginal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule consistently acted as\nefficient, low energy control hubs, consistent with their strong anatomical\nconnections to key input areas of sensorimotor cortex. Importantly, both these\nand other regions in the fronto-parietal, cingulo-opercular, and attention\nsystems are poised to affect a broad array of state transitions that cannot\neasily be classified by traditional notions of control common in the\nengineering literature.

The applicability of this approach is however limited if the\neffects of the Sub-Grid Scales (SGS) of the flow on particle dynamics are\nneglected. In this paper, we propose to take these effects into account by\nmeans of a Lagrangian stochastic SGS model for the equations of particle\nmotion. The model extends to particle-laden flows the velocity-filtered density\nfunction method originally developed for reactive flows. The underlying\nfiltered density function is simulated through a Lagrangian Monte Carlo\nprocedure that solves for a set of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)\nalong individual particle trajectories. The resulting model is tested for the\nreference case of turbulent channel flow, using a hybrid algorithm in which the\nfluid velocity field is provided by LES and then used to advance the SDEs in\ntime. The model consistency is assessed in the limit of particles with zero\ninertia, when \"duplicate fields\" are available from both the Eulerian LES and\nthe Lagrangian tracking. Tests with inertial particles were performed to\nexamine the capability of the model to capture particle preferential\nconcentration and near-wall segregation. Upon comparison with DNS-based\nstatistics, our results show improved accuracy and considerably reduced errors\nwith respect to the case in which no SGS model is used in the equations of\nparticle motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2016 17:09:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 13:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-02"}

We use this case to illustrate some\nof the novelties found for non-planar varieties relative to the case of\npositroids, and describe some of the features that we expect to hold more\ngenerally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2016 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 16:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

Differences between seismic\nobservations and model predictions at individual stations may arise from\nfactors other than structural heterogeneity, such as errors in the assumed\nsource-time function, inaccurate timings, and systematic uncertainties. To\nalleviate the corresponding nonuniqueness in the inverse problem, we construct\ndifferential measurements between stations, thereby reducing the influence of\nthe source signature and systematic errors. We minimize the discrepancy between\nobservations and simulations in terms of the differential measurements made on\nstation pairs.

The\ndouble-difference methodology can be incorporated into the usual adjoint\ntomography workflow by simply pairing up all conventional measurements; the\ncomputational cost of the necessary adjoint simulations is largely unaffected.\nRather than adding to the computational burden, the inversion of\ndouble-difference measurements merely modifies the construction of the adjoint\nsources for data assimilation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2016 20:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-08"}

The data\nindicate that this ratio, after a decline between $0.5-8$ GeV, rises steadily\nwith a trend towards saturation at 200-400GeV. These observations (except for\nthe trend) appear to be in conflict with the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA)\nmechanism, operating in a \\emph{single} supernova remnant (SNR) shock.

The induced electric field expels\npositrons into the upstream plasma where they are shock-accelerated.

Mixing these populations explains the\nincrease in the $e^{+}/e^{-}$ ratio at $E>8$ GeV. It decreases at $E<8$ GeV\nbecause of a subshock weakening which also results from the shock modification.\nContrary to the expelled positrons, most of the antiprotons, electrons, and\nheavier nuclei, are left unaccelerated inside the clumps.

It tells\npeople where activities and locations that interest them are and it allows them\nto share their urban experiences and self-representations. Therefore, any\nanalysis of urban structures and cultures needs to consider social media\nactivity. In our paper, we introduce the novel concept of social media\ninequality. This concept allows us to quantitatively compare patterns in social\nmedia activities between parts of a city, a number of cities, or any other\nspatial areas. We define this concept using an analogy with the concept of\neconomic inequality. Economic inequality indicates how some economic\ncharacteristics or material resources, such as income, wealth or consumption\nare distributed in a city, country or between countries. Accordingly, we can\ndefine social media inequality as the measure of the distribution of\ncharacteristics from social media content shared in a particular geographic\narea or between areas. An example of such characteristics is the number of\nphotos shared by all users of a social network such as Instagram in a given\ncity or city area, or the content of these photos. We propose that the standard\ninequality measures used in other disciplines, such as the Gini coefficient,\ncan also be used to characterize social media inequality.

Together with\nthe geometry of the chain this gives rise to a bond-alternating nearest\nneighbor interaction due to simultaneous attractive and repulsive interactions.\nBecause of the quantum Zeno effect due to the reactive nature of molecules the\nsystem can be treated as hard-core. By tuning the ratio between the\nnearest-neighbor interaction and hopping, various phases can be accessed by\ncontrolling the polarization angle. In the ultra-strong coupling limit, the\nsystem simplifies to a frustrated extended axial Ising model. For the small\ncoupling limit, qualitative discussion of the ordering behavior using effective\nfield theory arguments is provided.

The first method uses experimental data from an\narchetypical system (liquid $^4$He) studied with DINS, which are then\nnumerically deconvoluted using its previously determined intrinsic scattering\nfunction to yield $R_{obs}({Q},E)$. The second approach uses accurate Monte\nCarlo simulations of the ARCS spectrometer, which account for all instrument\ncontributions, coupled to a representative scattering kernel to reproduce the\nexperimentally observed response $S({Q},E)$. Using a delta function as\nscattering kernel, the simulation yields a resolution function $R_{sim}({Q},E)$\nwith comparable lineshape and features as $R_{obs}({Q},E)$, but somewhat\nnarrower due to the ideal nature of the model.

To address the large-scale nature of our problem, both in\nterms of data and vocabulary size, we propose a novel distributed algorithm for\ntraining of the embeddings. Finally, we present an approach for overcoming a\ncold-start problem associated with new ads and queries. We report results of\neditorial evaluation and online tests on actual search traffic. The results\nshow that our approach significantly outperforms baselines in terms of\nrelevance, coverage, and incremental revenue. Lastly, we open-source learned\nquery embeddings to be used by researchers in computational advertising and\nrelated fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 03:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-08"}

Using\nSDSS images of a very large sample of LSB galaxies derived from the literature,\nwe found that the barred fraction is only 8.3%. We imaged twenty five barred\nLSB galaxies in the J, H, K$_S$ wavebands and twenty nine in the K$_S$ band.\nMost of the bars are much brighter than their stellar disks, which appear to be\nvery diffuse. Our image analysis gives deprojected mean bar sizes of\n$R_{b}/R_{25}$ = 0.40 and ellipticities $e$ $\\approx$ 0.45, which are similar\nto bars in high surface brightness galaxies. Thus, although bars are rare in\nLSB galaxies, they appear to be just as strong as bars found in normal\ngalaxies. There is no correlation of $R_{b}/R_{25}$ or $e$ with the relative HI\nor stellar masses of the galaxies. In the (J-K$_S$) color images most of the\nbars have no significant color gradient which indicates that their stellar\npopulation is uniformly distributed and confirms that they have low dust\ncontent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 07:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-08"}

We find that the two are proportional only for large values\nof $J$, whereas in the weak-coupling limit the energy gain is quadratic in $J$,\nwhile the Kondo temperature is exponentially small. The exact relation between\nthe two quantities depends on the detailed form of the density of states of the\nband.

For 1D, there is in addition a sizable\nintermediate-$J$ regime where the Kondo temperature is quadratic in $J$ due to\nthe diverging density of states at the band edge.

Instead\nof simply reconstructing a pixel block from the centers of indexed DCT\ncoefficient quantization bins (hard decoding), soft decoding reconstructs a\nblock by selecting appropriate coefficient values within the indexed bins with\nthe help of signal priors. The challenge thus lies in how to define suitable\npriors and apply them effectively.\n  In this paper, we combine three image priors---Laplacian prior for DCT\ncoefficients, sparsity prior and graph-signal smoothness prior for image\npatches---to construct an efficient JPEG soft decoding algorithm. Specifically,\nwe first use the Laplacian prior to compute a minimum mean square error (MMSE)\ninitial solution for each code block. Next, we show that while the sparsity\nprior can reduce block artifacts, limiting the size of the over-complete\ndictionary (to lower computation) would lead to poor recovery of high DCT\nfrequencies. To alleviate this problem, we design a new graph-signal smoothness\nprior (desired signal has mainly low graph frequencies) based on the left\neigenvectors of the random walk graph Laplacian matrix (LERaG). Compared to\nprevious graph-signal smoothness priors, LERaG has desirable image filtering\nproperties with low computation overhead. We demonstrate how LERaG can\nfacilitate recovery of high DCT frequencies of a piecewise smooth (PWS) signal\nvia an interpretation of low graph frequency components as relaxed solutions to\nnormalized cut in spectral clustering. Finally, we construct a soft decoding\nalgorithm using the three signal priors with appropriate prior weights.\nExperimental results show that our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art soft\ndecoding algorithms in both objective and subjective evaluations noticeably.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 07:31:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

The obtained\npropagator is then used to derive the time evolution equation for the density\nmatrix describing the system.

This microscopic theory allows\nto obtain expression for lateral pressure distribution in bent lipid membrane\nif treating a bending as a small deviation from the flat membrane conformation\nand using perturbation theory with small parameter L0J, where L0 is the\nmonolayer thickness, J is mean curvature of membrane. Because lateral pressure\ndistribution is related to the elastic properties of lipid bilayer [3] then\nfirst spontaneous moment of lateral pressure and the expression for bending\nmodulus may be derived from this theoretical model.

The spectrum shows the absorption signatures (e.g., Fe-UTA,\n\\ion{O}{vii}, and \\ion{Ne}{vii}--\\ion{Ne}{x}) of a photoionized gas outflow\n($N_{\\rm H} \\sim 3.5 \\times 10^{21} \\rm cm^{-2}$, $\\log \\xi \\sim 2.6$, $v_{\\rm\nout}\\sim 3600 \\, \\rm km \\, s^{-1}$) located at the redshift of source. We\nestimate that the gas is located outside the broad line region but within the\nboundaries of the putative torus. This ionized absorber is consistent with the\nX-ray counterpart of a polar scattering outflow reported in the optical band\nfor this source. The kinetic luminosity carried by the outflow is insufficient\nto produce a significant feedback is this quasar. Finally, we show that the\nheavy soft X-ray absorption that was noticed in the past for this source arises\nmostly in the Galactic ISM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 09:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

How does\nlarge-scale brain circuitry constrain states of neuronal activity and\ntransitions between those states? We address these questions using a maximum\nentropy model of brain dynamics informed by white matter tractography. We\ndemonstrate that the most probable brain states -- characterized by minimal\nenergy -- display common activation profiles across brain areas: local\nspatially-contiguous sets of brain regions reminiscent of cognitive systems are\nco-activated frequently. The predicted activation rate of these systems is\nhighly correlated with the observed activation rate measured in a separate\nresting state fMRI data set, validating the utility of the maximum entropy\nmodel in describing neurophysiologial dynamics.

Since lensing involves light bending, we shall first show that the\nsolution adds to Schwarzschild light bending caused by the luminous mass\n($M_{\\ast }$) a positive contribution $+\\gamma R$ contrary to the previous\nresults in the literature, thereby resolving a long standing problem. The cause\nof the error is critically examined. Applying the expressions for light bending\ntogether with an input equating Einstein and Weyl angles, we develop a novel\nalgorithm for separating the luminous component from the total lens mass\n(luminous+dark) within the Einstein radius. Our results indicate that the\nluminous mass estimates differ from the observed total lens masses by a linear\nproportionality factor. In quantitative detail, we observe that the ratios of\nluminous over total lens mass ($f^{\\ast }$) within the Einstein radius of\nindividual galaxies take on values near unity, many of which remarkably fall\ninside or just marginally outside the specified error bars obtained from a\nsimulation based on the Bruzual-Charlot stellar population synthesis model\ntogether with the Salpeter IMF favored on the ground of metallicity\n[Grillo,2009].

These priors are integrated in an energy\nminimization formulation, where the deep neural network learns the unary term,\nthe depth field statistics works as global model constraint and the color-depth\ncorrelation is utilized to enforce the local structure in depth images.\nExtensive experiments on various depth super-resolution benchmark datasets show\nthat our method outperforms the state-of-the-art depth image super-resolution\nmethods with a margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 12:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-08"}

A\nsignificant challenge is the lack of training data, i.e., 2D images of humans\nannotated with 3D poses. Such data is necessary to train state-of-the-art CNN\narchitectures. Here, we propose a solution to generate a large set of\nphotorealistic synthetic images of humans with 3D pose annotations.

The selected images are\nthen combined to generate a new synthetic image by stitching local image\npatches in a kinematically constrained manner. The resulting images are used to\ntrain an end-to-end CNN for full-body 3D pose estimation. We cluster the\ntraining data into a large number of pose classes and tackle pose estimation as\na K-way classification problem. Such an approach is viable only with large\ntraining sets such as ours. Our method outperforms the state of the art in\nterms of 3D pose estimation in controlled environments (Human3.6M) and shows\npromising results for in-the-wild images (LSP).

We\nalso introduce a convolution representation of solutions to the log-KdV\nequation with the Gaussian weight and show that the time evolution in such a\nweighted space is dissipative with the exponential rate of decay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 15:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-08"}

HIRAX has\ntwo primary science goals: to constrain Dark Energy and measure structure at\nhigh redshift, and to study radio transients and pulsars. HIRAX will observe\nunresolved sources of neutral hydrogen via their redshifted 21-cm emission line\n(`hydrogen intensity mapping'). The resulting maps of large-scale structure at\nredshifts 0.8-2.5 will be used to measure Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO).\nHIRAX will improve upon current BAO measurements from galaxy surveys by\nobserving a larger cosmological volume (larger in both survey area and redshift\nrange) and by measuring BAO at higher redshift when the expansion of the\nuniverse transitioned to Dark Energy domination. HIRAX will complement CHIME, a\nhydrogen intensity mapping experiment in the Northern Hemisphere, by completing\nthe sky coverage in the same redshift range. HIRAX's location in the Southern\nHemisphere also allows a variety of cross-correlation measurements with\nlarge-scale structure surveys at many wavelengths.

More than half of groundwater is used to grow crops. This research\nmodels groundwater depletion patterns within a multi-agent system framework.\nIrrigators are modeled as agents in the multi-agent system. The irrigation\nstrategies adopted by the agents are investigated using game theory. A set of\nfive irrigators, growing three crops: corn, sorghum and wheat, have been\nconsidered in this study. To allow groundwater flow, these agents are assumed\nto be located in adjoining farm lands. Irrigators are modeled selfish agents\nthat strategize their irrigation patterns in order to maximize their own\nutilities, i.e. the difference between the total revenue obtained from crop\nsales and the costs incurred, including groundwater extraction costs. Due to\ngroundwater flow, and have no incentive to conserve groundwater. This leads to\nunsustainable depletion of the resource under Nash equilibrium, when no\nirrigator can increase its utility by unilaterally changing its strategy. All\nparameters in this research are representative of Kansas. Recorded\nenvironmental and economic data of the region, along with the DSSAT software,\nhave been used to obtain these futuristic projections. One of the emergent\nphenomena of the simulations is the adoption of crop rotation patterns by the\nirrigators to conserve groundwater. The irrigators grow corn, which is a more\nprofitable yet water intensive crop in one year, and in the next, conserve\nwater by growing sorghum instead. Another emergent outcome of this research is\nthe viability of LEMAs.

For binary logic using the truth values {0,1} logical\nobservables are pairwise commuting projectors. For the truth values {+1,-1} the\noperator system is formally equivalent to that of a composite spin 1/2 system,\nthe logical observables being isometries belonging to the Pauli group. Also in\nthis approach fuzzy logic arises naturally when considering non-eigenvectors.\nThe fuzzy membership function is obtained by the quantum mean value of the\nlogical projector observable and turns out to be a probability measure in\nagreement with recent quantum cognition models. The analogy of many-valued\nlogic with quantum angular momentum is then established. Logical observables\nfor three-value logic are formulated as functions of the Lz observable of the\norbital angular momentum l=1. The representative 3-valued 2-argument logical\nobservables for the Min and Max connectives are explicitly obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 06:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-14"}

These molecules can be found on the surface of Earth and\nMars, in the atmospheres of the larger planets and on many of their satellites,\non asteroids, comets, meteorites, the atmospheres of red giant stars,\ninterstellar nebulae, and in the spiral arms of galaxies. Many of these\nenvironments are expected to be of low temperature and pressure, implying that\nthe Gibbs free energy for the formation of these complex molecules should be\npositive and large, suggesting that their existence could only be attributed to\nnon-equilibrium thermodynamic processes. In this article we first review the\nevidence for the abundance of these molecules in the cosmos and then describe\nhow the ubiquity can be explained from within the framework of non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics on the basis of the catalytic properties of these pigment\nmolecules in dissipating photons of the ultraviolet and visible emission\nspectra of neighboring stars, leading to greater local entropy production. A\nrelation between the maximum wavelength of absorption of these organic pigments\nand the corresponding stellar photon environment, provides a guide to\ndetermining which aromatic compounds are most probable in a given stellar\nneighborhood, a postulate that can be verified on Earth. It is suggested that\nat least some of the baryonic dark matter may be associated with these\nmolecules which emit in the extreme infrared with many, but weak, emission\nlines, thus so far escaping detection. This thermodynamic explanation for the\nubiquity of these organic molecules also has relevance to the possibility of\nlife, both as we know it, and as we may not know it, throughout the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 02:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}
