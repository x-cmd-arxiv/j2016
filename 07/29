It is based on the\nGross-Pitaevskii - nonlinear Schroedinger equation with the cubic\nself-attractive term and a double-well-potential built as an infinitely deep\npotential box split by a narrow (delta-functional) barrier. The barrier's\nstrength, epsilon, is the single free parameter of the scaled form of the\nmodel. It may be implemented in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates and nonlinear\noptics. The SSB bifurcation of the symmetric ground state (GS) is predicted\nanalytically in two limit cases, viz., for deep or weak splitting of the\npotential box by the barrier. For the generic case, a variational approximation\n(VA) is elaborated. The analytical findings are presented along with systematic\nnumerical results. Stability of stationary states is studied through the\ncalculation of eigenvalues for small perturbations, and by means of direct\nsimulations. The GS always undergoes the SSB bifurcation of the supercritical\ntype, as predicted by the VA at moderate values of epsilon, although the VA\nfails at small epsilon, due to inapplicability of the underlying ansatz in that\ncase. However, the latter case is correctly treated by the approximation based\non a soliton ansatz. On top of the GS, the first and second excited states are\nstudied too. The antisymmetric mode (the first excited state) is destabilized\nat a critical value of its norm.

While at the perturbation level one class of models is free from ghosts\nand singularities of the classical equations of motion, in general gradient\ninstabilities are present around the bounce time, because the sign of the\nsquared speed of sound is opposite to the sign of the time derivative of $H$.\nWe discuss how this kind of instabilities could be avoided by modifying the\nLagrangian by introducing Galileion terms in order to prevent a negative\nsquared speed of sound around the bounce.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 16:54:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 18:26:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 02:06:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-16"}

I then focus on the\nproblem of extracting the kinematic when the velocity dispersion $\\sigma$ is\nsmaller than the velocity sampling $\\Delta V$, which is generally, by design,\nclose to the instrumental dispersion $\\sigma_{\\rm inst}$. The standard approach\nconsists of convolving templates with a discretized kernel, while fitting for\nits parameters. This is obviously very inaccurate when $\\sigma<\\Delta V/2$, due\nto undersampling. Oversampling can prevent this, but it has drawbacks. Here I\npresent a more accurate and efficient alternative. It avoids the evaluation of\nthe under-sampled kernel, and instead directly computes its well-sampled\nanalytic Fourier transform, for use with the convolution theorem. A simple\nanalytic transform exists when the kernel is described by the popular\nGauss-Hermite parametrization (which includes the Gaussian as special case) for\nthe line-of-sight velocity distribution. I describe how this idea was\nimplemented in a significant upgrade to the publicly available pPXF software.\nThe key advantage of the new approach is that it provides accurate velocities\nregardless of $\\sigma$.

In these network states a global oscillatory cycle\nmodulates the propensity of neurons to fire. Synchronous activation of neurons\nhas been hypothesized to be a separate channel of signal processing information\nin the brain. A salient question is therefore if and how oscillations interact\nwith spike synchrony and in how far these channels can be considered separate.\nExperiments indeed showed that correlated spiking co-modulates with the static\nfiring rate and is also tightly locked to the phase of beta-oscillations. While\nthe dependence of correlations on the mean rate is well understood in\nfeed-forward networks, it remains unclear why and by which mechanisms\ncorrelations tightly lock to an oscillatory cycle. We here demonstrate that\nsuch correlated activation of pairs of neurons is qualitatively explained by\nperiodically-driven random networks. We identify the mechanisms by which\ncovariances depend on a driving periodic stimulus. Mean-field theory combined\nwith linear response theory yields closed-form expressions for the\ncyclostationary mean activities and pairwise zero-time-lag covariances of\nbinary recurrent random networks. Two distinct mechanisms cause time-dependent\ncovariances: the modulation of the susceptibility of single neurons (via the\nexternal input and network feedback) and the time-varying variances of single\nunit activities. For some parameters, the effectively inhibitory recurrent\nfeedback leads to resonant covariances even if mean activities show\nnon-resonant behavior. Our analytical results open the question of\ntime-modulated synchronous activity to a quantitative analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 18:09:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 09:58:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2017 15:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}

A key requirement of such systems is the need to provide\npredictable real-time performance: the timing correctness of the system should\nbe analyzable at design time with a quantitative metric and guaranteed at\nruntime with high assurance. This requirement of predictability is particularly\nimportant for safety-critical domains such as automobiles, aerospace, defense,\nmanufacturing and medical devices.\n  The work in this dissertation focuses on the challenges arising from the use\nof modern multi-core platforms in CPS. Even as of today, multi-core platforms\nare rarely used in safety-critical applications primarily due to the temporal\ninterference caused by contention on various resources shared among processor\ncores, such as caches, memory buses, and I/O devices. Such interference is hard\nto predict and can significantly increase task execution time, e.g., up to 12x\non commodity quad-core platforms. To address the problem of ensuring timing\npredictability on multi-core platforms, we develop novel analytical and systems\ntechniques in this dissertation. Our proposed techniques theoretically bound\ntemporal interference that tasks may suffer from when accessing shared\nresources. Our techniques also involve software primitives and algorithms for\nreal-time operating systems and hypervisors, which significantly reduce the\ndegree of the temporal interference. Specifically, we tackle the issues of\ncache and memory contention, locking and synchronization, interrupt handling,\nand access control for computational accelerators such as GPGPUs, all of which\nare crucial to achieving predictable real-time performance on a modern\nmulti-core platform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 19:05:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-29"}

In this work, we vary the extragalactic ultraviolet\nbackground for a high-resolution cosmological simulation of a Milky Way-like\ngalaxy and examine the effect on the absorption and emission properties of\nmetals in the CGM. We find that a reduced quasar background brings the column\ndensity predictions into better agreement with recent data. Similarly, when the\nobservationally derived physical properties of the gas are compared to the\nsimulation, we find that the simulation gas is always at temperatures\napproximately 0.5 dex higher. Thus, similar column densities can be produced\nfrom fundamentally different gas. However, emission maps can provide\ncomplementary information to the line-of-sight column densities to better\nderive gas properties.

Surprisingly,\nalthough this phenomenon has been employed for millennia, it still remains\nill-understood. Perhaps the most puzzling feature of supercooled liquids is the\ndramatic increase in their viscosity as the temperature ($T$) is lowered. This\nprecipitous rise has long posed a fundamental theoretical challenge. Numerous\napproaches currently attempt to explain this phenomenon. When present, data\ncollapse points to an underlying simplicity in various branches of science. In\nthis Letter, we report on a 16 decade data collapse of the viscosity of 45\ndifferent liquids of all known types. Specifically, the viscosity of\nsupercooled liquids scaled by their value at their respective equilibrium\nmelting temperature ($\\eta(T)/\\eta(T_{melt}))$ is, for all temperatures\n$T<T_{melt}$, a universal function of $(T_{melt} - T)/(B T)$ where $B$ is a\nconstant that does not change significantly from one liquid to another. This\nexceptionally plain behavior hints at a link between glassy dynamics and the\nconventional equilibrium melting transition in all known supercooled fluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 20:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-01"}

The same scattering has been invoked to\nexplain misalignments of planetary orbital planes with respect to their host\nstar's spin. However, an observational puzzle is presented by Kepler-56, which\nhas two inner planets (b and c) that are nearly coplanar with each other, yet\nare more than 45 degrees inclined to their star's equator. Thus the spin-orbit\nmisalignment might be primordial. Instead, we further develop the hypothesis in\nthe discovery paper, that planets on wider orbits generated misalignment\nthrough scattering, and as a result gently torqued the inner planets away from\nthe equator plane of the star. We integrated the equations of motion for\nKepler-56 b and c along with an unstable outer system initialized with either\ntwo or three Jupiter-mass planets. We address here whether the violent\nscattering that generates large mutual inclinations can leave the inner system\nintact, tilting it gently. In almost all of the cases initially with two outer\nplanets, either the inner planets remain nearly coplanar with each other in the\nstar's equator plane, or they are scattered violently to high mutual\ninclination and high spin-orbit misalignment. On the contrary, of the systems\nwith three unstable outer planets, a spin-orbit misalignment large enough to\nexplain the observations is generated 28% of the time for coplanar inner\nplanets, which is consistent with the observed frequency of this phenomenon\nreported so far.

Agreement between disk rotation and jet rotation\ndetermined from optical lines has been verified in two cases and rejected in\none case. Meanwhile, the NUV lines, which may trace faster and more collimated\ninner spines of the jet than optical lines, either agree or show no clear\nindication. We propose to perform this test on the fourth system, Th 28. We\npresent ALMA high angular resolution Band 7 continuum, 12CO(3-2) and 13CO(2-1)\nobservations of the circumstellar disk around the T Tauri star Th 28. We were\nable to detect, in CO and continuum, clear signatures of a disk in Keplerian\nrotation around Th28. The 12CO emission is resolved, allowing us to derive\nestimates of disk position angle and inclination. The large velocity separation\nof the peaks in 12CO, combined with the resolved extent of the emission,\nindicate a central stellar mass in the range 1-2 Msun. The rotation sense of\nthe disk is well detected in both 13CO and 12CO emission lines, and this\ndirection is opposite to that implied by the transverse Doppler shifts measured\nin the optical lines of the jet. The Th 28 system is the second system where\ncounter-rotation between the disk and the optical jet is detected. These\nfindings imply either that optical transverse velocity gradients detected with\nHST do not trace jet rotation or that modeling the flow with the steady\nassumption is not valid. In both cases jet rotation studies that rely solely on\noptical lines are not suitable to derive the launching radius of the jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 21:42:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 19:56:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 16:12:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

We used high angular\nresolution images of the SiO(2-1) and HCN(1-0) emission lines obtained with the\nIRAM plateau de Bure (PdBI) interferometer and combined with data from the IRAM\n30 m radiotelescope.

We show that there exists the variation of JK\ncovariance over realizations of mock lensing measurements, while the average JK\ncovariance over mocks can give a reasonably accurate estimation of the true\ncovariance up to separations comparable with the size of JK subregion. The\nscatter in JK covariances is found to be $\\sim10\\%$ after we subtract the\nlensing measurement around random points. However, the JK method tends to\nunderestimate the covariance at the larger separations, more increasingly for a\nsurvey with a higher number density of source galaxies. We apply our method to\nthe the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data, and show that the 48 mock SDSS\ncatalogs nicely reproduce the signals and the JK covariance measured from the\nreal data.

In these devices the Coulomb potential of an atom\ncreates a localised electron state with a large charging energy and\nconsiderable orbital level spacings, enabling robust charge capturing\nprocesses. In these single-atom pumps, the confinement potential is hardly\naffected by the periodic driving of the system. This is in contrast to the\noften used gate-defined quantum dot pumps, for which a strongly time-dependent\npotential leads to significantly different charge pumping processes. Here we\ndescribe the behaviour and the performance of an atomic, single parameter,\nelectron pump. This is done by considering the loading, isolating and unloading\nof one electron at the time, on a phosphorous atom embedded in a silicon double\ngate transistor. The most important feature of the atom pump is its very\nisolated ground state, which can be populated through the fast loading of much\nhigher lying excited states and a subsequent fast relaxation proces. This leads\nto a substantial increase in pumping accuracy, and is opposed to the adverse\nrole of excited states as observed for quantum dot pumps due to non-adiabatic\nexcitations.

Iterative reconstruction methods that utilize the additional prior\ncan suppress artifacts and improve image quality, but unfortunately require\nincreased computation time. An interesting way is to restrain the artifacts in\nthe images reconstructed from the practical filtered back projection (FBP)\nmethod. Frikel and Quinto have proved that the streak artifacts in FBP results\ncould be characterized. It indicates that the artifacts created by FBP method\nhave specific and similar characteristics in a stationary limited-angle\nscanning configuration. Based on this understanding, this work aims at\ndeveloping a method to extract and suppress specific artifacts of FBP\nreconstructions for limited-angle tomography. A data-driven learning-based\nmethod is proposed based on a deep convolutional neural network. An end-to-end\nmapping between the FBP and artifact-free images is learned and the implicit\nfeatures involving artifacts will be extracted and suppressed via nonlinear\nmapping. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations of experimental results\nindicate that the proposed method show a stable and prospective performance on\nartifacts reduction and detail recovery for limited angle tomography. The\npresented strategy provides a simple and efficient approach for improving image\nquality of the reconstruction results from limited projection data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 07:31:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

Instead of handling this insufficiency with a linearly\nweighted attention mechanism, in this paper, we propose to use a recurrent\nneural network (RNN) as an alternative (Cseq2seq-I). During decoding,\nCseq2seq-I cyclically feeds the previous decoding state back to the encoder as\nthe initial state of the RNN, and reencodes source representations to produce\ncontext vectors. We surprisingly find that the introduced RNN succeeds in\ndynamically detecting translationrelated source tokens according to the partial\ntarget sequence. Based on this finding, we further hypothesize that the partial\ntarget sequence can act as a feedback to improve the understanding of the\nsource sequence. To test this hypothesis, we propose cyclic\nsequence-to-sequence learning (Cseq2seq-II) which differs from the seq2seq only\nin the reintroduction of previous decoding state into the same encoder. We\nfurther perform parameter sharing on Cseq2seq-II to reduce parameter redundancy\nand enhance regularization. In particular, we share the weights of the encoder\nand decoder, and two targetside word embeddings, making Cseq2seq-II equivalent\nto a single conditional RNN model, with 31% parameters pruned but even better\nperformance. Cseq2seq-II not only preserves the simplicity of seq2seq but also\nyields comparable and promising results on machine translation tasks.\nExperiments on Chinese- English and English-German translation show that\nCseq2seq achieves significant and consistent improvements over seq2seq and is\nas competitive as the attention-based seq2seq model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 08:35:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Nov 2018 21:59:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-27"}

The survey covers the full frequency\nrange from 329 to 363 GHz (0.8 mm) with additional targeted observations at 3.0\nand 1.3 mm. More than 10,000 features are detected toward one component in the\nprotostellar binary. Glycolaldehyde, its isomers, methyl formate and acetic\nacid, and its reduced alcohol, ethylene glycol, are clearly detected. For\nethylene glycol both lowest state conformers, aGg' and gGg', are detected, the\nlatter for the first time in the ISM. The abundance of glycolaldehyde is\ncomparable to or slightly larger than that of ethylene glycol. In comparison to\nthe Galactic Center, these two species are over-abundant relative to methanol,\npossibly an indication of formation at low temperatures in CO-rich ices. Both\n13C and deuterated isotopologues of glycolaldehyde are detected, also for the\nfirst time ever in the ISM. For the deuterated species, a D/H ratio of\napproximately 5% is found with no differences between the deuteration in the\ndifferent functional groups of glycolaldehyde. Measurements of the 13C-species\nlead to a 12C:13C ratio of approximately 30, lower than the typical ISM value.\nThis low ratio may reflect an enhancement of 13CO in the ice due to either\nion-molecule reactions in the gas before freeze-out or differences in the\ntemperatures where 12CO and 13CO ices sublimate. The results reinforce the\nimportance of low-temperature grain surface chemistry for the formation of\nprebiotic molecules seen here in the gas after sublimation of the entire ice\nmantle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 09:10:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

The pipeline detected 128 signals, and the weakest signal\ninjected and detected has a GW strain amplitude of ~10^-24, assuming one month\nof gapless data collected by a single advanced detector. We also provide\nsensitivity estimations, which show that, for a single- detector data covering\none month of observation time, depending on the source orbital Doppler\nmodulation, we can detect signals with an amplitude of ~7x10^-25.

Our data\nsupport a picture in which the Curie terms arise from oxygen disorder in the\nCu-O chains. This agrees with published work on polycrystalline samples where\nthe sample cooling rate was varied, but here we show that the Curie plots\nflatten out above 200 K. We identify small effects of charge density wave (CDW)\ninstabilities in the temperature ($T$) derivative of the in-plane\nsusceptibility $d\\chi_{ab}(T)/dT$ and discuss their $x$-dependence. For\n$x=$0.67 we make a detailed comparison with published high energy X-ray\ndiffraction data using a minimal model involving Fermi arcs, thereby obtaining\nvalues for the CDW energy gap and the Helmholtz free energy in a coherence\nvolume. At 80 and 100 K the latter is comparable with, or smaller than $k_BT$\nrespectively, highlighting the probable importance of thermal fluctuations. We\nnote that the effect of the Lorentz force on charge carriers in the Fermi arcs\ncould provide a simple mechanism for enhancing the CDWs in high magnetic\nfields, as suggested by recent experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 10:28:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2016 13:36:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

In\nthis paper, we investigate the impact of delayed feedback on the dynamics of\nthe Classical Car-Following Model (CCFM).

First, we derive a\nsufficient condition for local stability of the CCFM in no-delay and\nsmall-delay regimes using. Next, we derive the necessary and sufficient\ncondition for local stability of the CCFM for an arbitrary delay. We then\ndemonstrate that the transition of traffic flow from the locally stable to the\nunstable regime occurs via a Hopf bifurcation, thus resulting in limit cycles\nin system dynamics. Physically, these limit cycles manifest as back-propagating\ncongestion waves on highways. In the context of human-driven vehicles, our work\nprovides phenomenological insight into the impact of reaction delays on the\nemergence and evolution of traffic congestion. In the context of self-driven\nvehicles, our work has the potential to provide design guidelines for control\nalgorithms running in self-driven cars to avoid undesirable phenomena.\nSpecifically, designing control algorithms that avoid jerky vehicular movements\nis essential. Hence, we derive the necessary and sufficient condition for\nnon-oscillatory convergence of the CCFM.

Furthermore, potential applications\nof the radio technique in high-energy astroparticle physics are discussed. Due\nto the successful operation of digital radio experiments and due to the\nimproved quantitative understanding of the emission, radio detection is back on\nthe list of promising techniques for extensive air showers. With a threshold of\nabout 100 PeV radio detectors are particularly useful to study the\nhighest-energy galactic cosmic rays and ultra-high-energy extragalactic\nparticles of all types. Various antenna arrays like LOPES, CODALEMA, AERA,\nLOFAR, and Tunka-Rex have shown that radio measurements can compete in\nprecision with other techniques, in particular for the arrival direction, the\nenergy, and the position of the shower maximum. The scientific potential of the\nradio technique seems to be maximum in combination with particle detectors,\nwhich increases the total accuracy for air-shower measurements. This is crucial\nfor a better separation of different primary particles, like gamma-ray photons,\nneutrinos, or different types of nuclei. In addition to air-showers the radio\ntechnique can be used for particle cascades in dense media. Several pioneering\nexperiments like ARA, ARIANNA, and ANITA are currently searching for cascades\ninduced by ultra-high-energy neutrinos in ice. Moreover, several future\nprojects aim at both, high-energy cosmic-rays and neutrinos. SKA will search\nfor neutrino and cosmic-ray initiated cascades in the lunar regolith and\nprovide unprecedented detail for air-shower measurements.

Numerous particle flow filters have\nbeen proposed based on different assumptions concerning the flow dynamics.\nApproximations are needed in the implementation of all of these filters; as a\nresult the articles do not exactly match a sample drawn from the desired\nposterior distribution.

Many new social networks try to attract users of\nother existing networks to increase the number of their users. Once a user\n(called source user) of a social network (called source network) joins a new\nsocial network (called target network), a new inter-network link (called anchor\nlink) is formed between the source and target networks. In this paper, we\nconcentrated on predicting the formation of such anchor links between\nheterogeneous social networks. Unlike conventional link prediction problems in\nwhich the formation of a link between two existing users within a single\nnetwork is predicted, in anchor link prediction, the target user is missing and\nwill be added to the target network once the anchor link is created. To solve\nthis problem, we use meta-paths as a powerful tool for utilizing heterogeneous\ninformation in both the source and target networks. To this end, we propose an\neffective general meta-path-based approach called Connector and Recursive\nMeta-Paths (CRMP). By using those two different categories of meta-paths, we\nmodel different aspects of social factors that may affect a source user to join\nthe target network, resulting in the formation of a new anchor link.

To obtain the channel state information (CSI) at the BS\nin FDD systems, the downlink channel has to be estimated by users via downlink\ntraining and then fed back to the BS. For FDD large-scale MIMO systems, the\noverhead for downlink training and CSI uplink feedback could be prohibitively\nhigh, which presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we study the\nbehavior of the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimator when the channel\ncovariance matrix has a low-rank or an approximate low-rank structure. Our\ntheoretical analysis reveals that the amount of training overhead can be\nsubstantially reduced by exploiting the low-rank property of the channel\ncovariance matrix. In particular, we show that the MMSE estimator is able to\nachieve exact channel recovery in the asymptotic low-noise regime, provided\nthat the number of pilot symbols in time is no less than the rank of the\nchannel covariance matrix. We also present an optimal pilot design for the\nsingle-user case, and an asymptotic optimal pilot design for the multi-user\nscenario. Lastly, we develop a simple model-based scheme to estimate the\nchannel covariance matrix, based on which the MMSE estimator can be employed to\nestimate the channel. The proposed scheme does not need any additional training\noverhead.

We\nfind that the most pronounced shape resonances are generated for weakly coupled\nsuperconductors, while approaching the strong coupling regime the shape\nresonances are rounded by a mixing of the subbands due to the large energy gaps\nextending over large energy scales. Finally, we find that the spatial profile,\ntransverse to the nanofilm, of the superconducting gap acquires a flat behavior\nin the shape resonance region, indicating that a robust and uniform multigap\nsuperconducting state can arise at resonance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 15:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-04"}

In the existing experimental works, situations where all\nsubjects are connected with each other through direct visual and auditory\ncoupling, and social interaction affects their coordination, have been\ninvestigated. Here, we study coordination in human ensembles via a novel\ncomputer-based set-up that enables individuals to coordinate each other's\nmotion from a distance so as to minimize the influence of social interaction.\nThe proposed platform makes it possible to implement different visual\ninteraction patterns among the players, so that participants take into\nconsideration the motion of a designated subset of the others. This allows the\nevaluation of the exclusive effects on coordination of the structure of\ninterconnections among the players and their own dynamics. Our set-up enables\nalso the deployment of virtual players to investigate dyadic interaction\nbetween a human and a virtual agent, as well as group synchronization in mixed\nteams of human and virtual agents. We use this novel set-up to study\ncoordination both in dyads and in groups over different structures of\ninterconnections, with and without virtual agents. We find that, in dual\ninteraction, virtual players manage to interact with participants in a\nhuman-like fashion, thus confirming findings in previous work. We also observe\nthat, in group interaction, the level of coordination among humans in the\nabsence of direct visual and auditory coupling depends on the structure of\ninterconnections among participants. This confirms, as recently suggested in\nthe literature, that different coordination levels are achieved over diverse\nvisual pairings in the presence and in the absence of social interaction. We\npresent preliminary experimental results on the effect on group coordination of\ndeploying virtual computer agents in the human ensemble.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 14:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}
