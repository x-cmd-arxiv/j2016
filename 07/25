Despite its theoretical appeal, the\nimplementation of a convex risk function remains difficult, as there is little\nguidance regarding how a convex risk function should be chosen so that it also\nwell represents one's own risk preferences. In this paper, we address this\nissue through the lens of inverse optimization. Specifically, given solution\ndata from some (forward) risk-averse optimization problems we develop an\ninverse optimization framework that generates a risk function that renders the\nsolutions optimal for the forward problems. The framework incorporates the\nwell-known properties of convex risk functions, namely, monotonicity,\nconvexity, translation invariance, and law invariance, as the general\ninformation about candidate risk functions, and also the feedbacks from\nindividuals, which include an initial estimate of the risk function and\npairwise comparisons among random losses, as the more specific information. Our\nframework is particularly novel in that unlike classical inverse optimization,\nno parametric assumption is made about the risk function, i.e. it is\nnon-parametric. We show how the resulting inverse optimization problems can be\nreformulated as convex programs and are polynomially solvable if the\ncorresponding forward problems are polynomially solvable. We illustrate the\nimputed risk functions in a portfolio selection problem and demonstrate their\npractical value using real-life data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2016 22:00:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 16:44:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

We investigate how much revenue is lost when a\nsingle static price is used instead for all buyers and goods, and prove upper\nbounds on the ratio between the maximum revenue from dynamic prices and that\nfrom static prices. These bounds are tight for all values of $k$ and $n$ and\nvary depending on a regularity property of the underlying distribution. For\ngeneral distributions we obtain a ratio of $2-k/n$, for regular distributions a\nratio that increases in $n$ and is bounded from above by $1/(1-k^k/(e^{k}k!))$,\nwhich is roughly $1/(1-1/(\\sqrt{2\\pi k}))$.

The collectivity depends on the details of\nthe shell structure around the Fermi levels, in particular the presence of the\norbitals that have the enhanced transition matrix elements of the non-axial\nquadrupole excitation. Quite recently, a sudden decrease in the excitation\nenergy of the $\\gamma$ vibration was observed at RIKEN RIBF for the\nneutron-rich Dy isotopes at $N=106$. Purpose: In the present work, by studying\nsystematically the microscopic structure of the $\\gamma$ vibration in the\nneutron-rich Dy isotopes with $N=98-114$, we try to understand the mechanism of\nthe observed softening. Methods: The low-frequency modes of excitation in the\nneutron-rich rare-earth nuclei are described based on nuclear\ndensity-functional theory. We employ the Skyrme energy-density functionals\n(EDF) in the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculation for the ground states and in\nthe Quasiparticle Random-Phase Approximation (QRPA) for the excitations.\nResults: The lowering of the excitation energy around $N=106$ is reproduced\nwell by employing the SkM* and SLy4 functionals.

In this work, we assess the\naccuracy in measuring the NS mass ($M_{ns}$) for the GWs from BH-NS binaries\nadopting the Advanced LIGO sensitivity with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10. By\nusing the Fisher matrix method, we calculate the measurement errors ($\\sigma$)\nin $M_{ns}$ assuming the NS mass of $1 \\leq M_{ns}/M_{\\odot} \\leq 2$ and low\nmass BHs with the range of $4 \\leq M_{bh}/M_{\\odot} \\leq 10$. We used the\nTaylorF2 waveform model where the spins are aligned with the orbital angular\nmomentum, but here we only consider the BH spins.

In recent years, there have been indications that\nrandomness-efficient parallel repetition (also called derandomized parallel\nrepetition) might be possible for games with large degree, circumventing the\nimpossibility result of Feige and Kilian. In particular, Dinur and Meir\n(CCC'11) construct games with large degree whose repetition can be derandomized\nusing a theorem of Impagliazzo, Kabanets and Wigderson (SICOMP'12).

This paper studies broadcast and multiple access channels where\nmultiple receivers experience unequal fading block lengths, and channel state\ninformation (CSI) is not available at the transmitter(s), or for free at any\nreceiver. In other words, the cost of acquiring CSI at the receiver is fully\naccounted for in the degrees of freedom. In the broadcast channel, the method\nof product superposition is employed to find the achievable degrees of freedom.\nWe start with unequal coherence intervals with integer ratios. As long as the\ncoherence time is at least twice the number of transmit and receive antennas,\nthese degrees of freedom meet the upper bound in four cases: when the\ntransmitter has fewer antennas than the receivers, when all receivers have the\nsame number of antennas, when the coherence time of one receiver is much\nshorter than all others, or when all receivers have identical block fading\nintervals. The degrees of freedom region of the broadcast under identical\ncoherence times was also previously unknown and is settled by the results of\nthis paper. The disparity of coherence times leads to gains that are distinct\nfrom those arising from other techniques such as spatial multiplexing or\nmulti-user diversity; this class of gains is denoted coherence diversity. The\ninner bounds are further extended to the case of multiple receivers\nexperiencing fading block lengths of arbitrary ratio or alignment. Also, in the\nmultiple access channel with unequal coherence times, achievable and outer\nbounds on the degrees of freedom are obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 05:51:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-26"}

Rich features such as the suppressed Cooper\npairings, large quasiparticle density and non-monotonically tunable momentum\ncurrent can be realized by varying the superconducting velocity. In the\ndegenerate regime, the quasiparticle Fermi surface is composed by two arcs,\nreferred to as Fermi arcs, which are contributed by the electron- and hole-like\nbranches. The D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation is explored, and intriguing\nphysics is revealed when the Fermi arc emerges. Specifically, when the order\nparameter tends to zero, it is found that the branch-mixing scattering is\nforbidden in the quasi-electron band. When the condensation process associated\nwith the annihilation of the quasi-electron and quasi-hole is {\\em slow}, this\nindicates that the electron- and hole-like Fermi arcs in the quasi-electron\nband are independent. The open structure of the Fermi arc leads to the nonzero\nangular-average of the effective magnetic field due to the spin-orbit coupling,\nwhich acts as an effective Zeeman field. This Zeeman field leads to the spin\noscillations even in the strong scattering regime. Moreover, in the strong\nscattering regime, we show that the open structure of the Fermi arc also leads\nto the insensitiveness of the spin relaxation to the momentum scattering, in\ncontrast to the conventional motional narrowing situation.

Within a whole, individual\ncities possess different degrees of wholeness, defined by Christopher Alexander\nas a life-giving order or simply a living structure. To characterize the\nwholeness and in particular to advocate for wholeness as an effective design\nprinciple, this paper develops a geographic representation that views cities as\na whole. This geographic representation is topology-oriented, so fundamentally\ndiffers from existing geometry-based geographic representations. With the\ntopological representation, all cities are abstracted as individual points and\nput into different hierarchical levels, according to their sizes and based on\nhead/tail breaks - a classification scheme and visualization tool for data with\na heavy tailed distribution. These points of different hierarchical levels are\nrespectively used to create Thiessen polygons. Based on polygon-polygon\nrelationships, we set up a complex network. In this network, small polygons\npoint to adjacent large polygons at the same hierarchical level and contained\npolygons point to containing polygons across two consecutive hierarchical\nlevels.

A\ncritical question at relay R is as follows: \"Given channel gain ratio $\\eta =\nh_A/h_B$, where $h_A$ and $h_B$ are the complex channel gains from nodes A and\nB to relay R, respectively, what is the optimal coefficients $(\\alpha,\\beta)$\nthat minimizes the symbol error rate (SER) of $w_N=\\alpha w_A+\\beta w_B$ when\nwe attempt to detect $w_N$ in the presence of noise?\" Our contributions with\nrespect to this question are as follows: (1) We put forth a general\nGaussian-integer formulation for complex linear PNC in which $\\alpha,\\beta,w_A,\nw_B$, and $w_N$ are elements of a finite field of Gaussian integers, that is,\nthe field of $\\mathbb{Z}[i]/q$ where $q$ is a Gaussian prime. Previous vector\nformulation, in which $w_A$, $w_B$, and $w_N$ were represented by\n$2$-dimensional vectors and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ were represented by $2\\times\n2$ matrices, corresponds to a subcase of our Gaussian-integer formulation where\n$q$ is real prime only. Extension to Gaussian prime $q$, where $q$ can be\ncomplex, gives us a larger set of signal constellations to achieve different\nrates at different SNR. (2) We show how to divide the complex plane of $\\eta$\ninto different Voronoi regions such that the $\\eta$ within each Voronoi region\nshare the same optimal PNC mapping $(\\alpha_{opt},\\beta_{opt})$. We uncover the\nstructure of the Voronoi regions that allows us to compute a minimum-distance\nmetric that characterizes the SER of $w_N$ under optimal PNC mapping\n$(\\alpha_{opt},\\beta_{opt})$. Overall, the contributions in (1) and (2) yield a\ntoolset for a comprehensive understanding of complex linear PNC in\n$\\mathbb{Z}[i]/q$.

The goal is to remove a minimum weight\nset of edges in $G$ such that there is no path from $s$ to $t$ in the remaining\ngraph for any $(s,t) \\in F$. UMulC admits an $O(\\log k)$-approximation where\n$k$ is the vertex cover size of $H$ while the best known approximation for\nDMulC is $\\min\\{k, \\tilde{O}(n^{11/23})\\}$.

Motivated by both concrete instances from\napplications and abstract considerations, we consider the role that the\nstructure of the demand graph $H$ plays in determining the approximability of\nMulticut.\n  In undirected graphs our main result is a $2$-approximation in $n^{O(t)}$\ntime when the demand graph $H$ excludes an induced matching of size $t$.

Often, these physical and biological processes are observed with errors,\nin which case the most natural way to model such data is via regression where\nthe mean function is defined by an ordinary differential equation believed to\nprovide an understanding of the underlying process. These regression based\ndynamical models are called differential equation models. Parameter inference\nfrom differential equation models poses computational challenges mainly due to\nthe fact that analytic solutions to most differential equations are not\navailable. In this paper, we propose an approximation method for obtaining the\nposterior distribution of parameters in differential equation models. The\napproximation is done in two steps. In the first step, the solution of a\ndifferential equation is approximated by the general one-step method which is a\nclass of numerical methods for ordinary differential equations including the\nEuler and the Runge-Kutta procedures; in the second step, nuisance parameters\nare marginalized using Laplace approximation.

For a theoretical support\nof the proposed method, we prove that the Laplace approximated posterior\nconverges to the actual posterior under certain conditions and analyze the\nrelation between the order of numerical error and its Laplace approximation.\nThe proposed method is tested on simulated data sets and compared with the\nother existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 11:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-26"}

The price-response of the\naggregation is modeled by an optimization problem that is characterized by a\nset of marginal utility curves and minimum and maximum power consumption\nlimits. The task of estimating these parameters is addressed using a\ngeneralized inverse optimization scheme that, in turn, requires solving a\nnonconvex mathematical program. We introduce a solution method that overcomes\nthe nonconvexities by solving instead two linear problems with a penalty term,\nwhich is statistically adjusted by using a cross-validation algorithm. The\nproposed methodology is data-driven and leverages information from regressors,\nsuch as time and weather variables, to account for changes in the parameter\nestimates. The power load of a group of heating, ventilation, and air\nconditioning systems in buildings is simulated, and the results show that the\naggregate demand of the group can be successfully captured by the proposed\nmodel, making it suitable for short-term forecasting purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 11:16:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-26"}

The resolution of the survey is of\norder 10 arcsec and the best rms noise at the centre of each pointing is of\norder $100\\,\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at 323 MHz and $50\\,\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at 608\nMHz. We present a catalogue of 1815 and 687 field sources detected above\n$5\\,\\sigma_{\\rm rms}$ at 323 and 608 MHz, respectively. A total of 440 sources\nwere detected at both frequencies, corresponding to a total unique source count\nof 2062 sources. We compare the results with previous surveys and showcase a\nsample of extended extragalactic objects. Although no further YSOs were\ndetected in addition to the target YSOs based on our source finding criteria,\nthese data can be useful for targeted manual searches, studies of radio\ngalaxies or to assist in the calibration of future observations with the Low\nFrequency Array (LOFAR) towards these regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 12:42:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

Particularly\nimportant from this perspective is the amount of olivine excavated from the\nvestan mantle by impacts, as this constrains both the interior structure of\nVesta and the number of major impacts the asteroid suffered during its life.\nThe NASA Dawn mission revealed that olivine is present on Vesta's surface in\nlimited quantities, concentrated in small patches at a handful of sites and\ninterpreted as the result of the excavation of endogenous olivine. Later works\nraised the possibility that the olivine had an exogenous origin, based on the\ngeologic and spectral features of the deposits. In this work we quantitatively\nexplore the proposed scenario of a exogenous origin for the detected olivine to\ninvestigate whether its presence on Vesta can be explained as a natural outcome\nof the collisional history of the asteroid. We took advantage of the impact\ncontamination model previously developed to study the origin and amount of dark\nand hydrated materials observed by Dawn on Vesta, which we updated by\nperforming dedicated hydrocode impact simulations. We show that the exogenous\ndelivery of olivine by impacts can offer a viable explanation for the currently\nidentified olivine-rich sites without violating the constraint posed by the\nlack of global olivine signatures on Vesta. Our results indicate that no mantle\nexcavation is in principle required to explain the observations of the Dawn\nmission and support the idea that the vestan crust could be thicker than\nindicated by simple geochemical models based on the Howardite-Eucrite-Diogenite\nfamily of meteorites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 13:17:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 10:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-29"}

This\npoints to a typical density for the HI emitting gas of 10$^{11}$cm$^{-3}$ and\nshows that a significant amount of this gas lies at regions near the dust\nsublimation radius, consistent with theoretical predictions. We also confirm\nthat in many objects the line ratios are far from case B, the best-fit\nintrinsic broad-line H$\\alpha$/H$\\beta$ ratios being in the range 2.5-6.6 as\nderived with our photoionization modeling scheme.

We then used the pitch angle and the Sersic index distributions\nin order to estimate the SMBH mass function for our volume-limited sample. The\nobservational simplicity of our approach relies on the empirical relation\nbetween the mass of the central (SMBH) and the Sersic index (Graham et al.\n2007) for an early-type galaxy or the logarithmic spiral arm pitch angle\n(Berrier et al. 2013) for a spiral galaxy. Our SMBH mass function agrees well\nat the high-mass end with previous values in the literature. At the low-mass\nend, while inconsistencies exist in previous works that still need to be\nresolved, our work is more in line with expectations based on modeling of black\nhole evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 15:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

While ASI does not\ncurrently exist, some scholars propose that it could be created sometime in the\nfuture, and furthermore that its creation could cause a severe global\ncatastrophe, possibly even resulting in human extinction. Given the high\nstakes, it is important to analyze ASI risk and factor the risk into decisions\nrelated to ASI research and development.

The model uses the established risk and decision analysis\nmodeling paradigms of fault trees and influence diagrams in order to depict\ncombinations of events and conditions that could lead to AI catastrophe, as\nwell as intervention options that could decrease risks. The events and\nconditions include select aspects of the ASI itself as well as the human\nprocess of ASI research, development, and management.
