While its OB members are well studied, its low-mass population has\nreceived little attention. We present high-spatial resolution Chandra ACIS-I\nX-ray data, where we detect 1613 point X-ray sources. Our main aim is to\nclarify global properties of NGC6231 down to low masses through a detailed\nmembership assessment, and to study the cluster stars' spatial distribution,\nthe origin of their X-ray emission, the cluster age and formation history, and\ninitial mass function. We use X-ray data, complemented by optical/IR data, to\nestablish cluster membership. The spatial distribution of different stellar\nsubgroups also provides highly significant constraints on cluster membership,\nas does the distribution of X-ray hardness. We perform spectral modeling of\ngroup-stacked X-ray source spectra. We find a large cluster population down to\n~0.3 Msun (complete to ~1 Msun), with minimal non-member contamination, with a\ndefinite age spread (1-8 Myrs) for the low-mass PMS stars. We argue that\nlow-mass cluster stars also constitute the majority of the few hundreds\nunidentified X-ray sources. We find mass segregation for the most massive\nstars. The fraction of circumstellar-disk bearing members is found to be ~5%.\nPhotoevaporation of disks under the action of massive stars is suggested by the\nspatial distribution of the IR-excess stars. We also find strong Halpha\nemission in 9% of cluster PMS stars. The dependence of X-ray properties on\nmass, stellar structure, and age agrees with extrapolations based on other\nyoung clusters. The cluster initial mass function, computed over ~2 dex in\nmass, has a slope Gamma~-1.14. The total mass of cluster members above 1 Msun\nis 2280 Msun, and the inferred total mass is 4380 Msun. We also study the\npeculiar, hard X-ray spectrum of the Wolf-Rayet star WR79.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 16:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

In order to eliminate selection effects, we use\ncross-matched sub-samples containing only luminous blazars. We compare the\nthree main existing methods, namely those based on the emission of radio lobes,\non spectral fitting, and on radio core shift. We find the average jet power\nobtained for identical samples with the radio-lobe method is $\\sim10$ times\nlower than that from the spectral fitting. In turn, the power from spectral\nfitting is compatible with that from core-shift modelling for plausible\nparameters of the latter. We also consider a phenomenological estimator based\non the {\\gamma}-ray luminosity. We examine uncertainties of those methods and\ndiscuss two alternative hypotheses. In one, the blazar-fit and core-shift\nmethods are assumed to be correct, and the lower power from radio lobes is\ncaused by intermittency of accretion.

Many of these linear systems are sparse; i.e., most\nof the elements in the coefficient matrix are zero. Direct methods based on\nmatrix factorizations are sometimes needed to ensure accurate solutions. For\nexample, accurate solution of sparse linear systems is needed in shift-invert\nLanczos to compute interior eigenvalues. The performance and resource usage of\nsparse matrix factorizations are critical to time-to-solution and maximum\nproblem size solvable on a given platform. In many applications, the\ncoefficient matrices are symmetric, and exploiting symmetry will reduce both\nthe amount of work and storage cost required for factorization. When the\nfactorization is performed on large-scale distributed memory platforms,\ncommunication cost is critical to the performance of the algorithm. At the same\ntime, network topologies have become increasingly complex, so that modern\nplatforms exhibit a high level of performance variability. This makes\nscheduling of computations an intricate and performance-critical task. In this\npaper, we investigate the use of an asynchronous task paradigm, one-sided\ncommunication and dynamic scheduling in implementing sparse Cholesky\nfactorization (symPACK) on large-scale distributed memory platforms.

Theoretical\nmodels predict a positive correlation between heat redistribution efficiency\nand temperature for tidally locked planets; however, recent HST WASP-43b\nspectroscopic phase curve results are inconsistent with current predictions.\nUsing the Spitzer Space Telescope, we obtained a total of three phase curve\nobservations of WASP-43b (P=0.813 days) at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. The first 3.6\nmicron visit exhibits spurious nightside emission that requires invoking\nunphysical conditions in our cloud-free atmospheric retrievals. The two other\nvisits exhibit strong day-night contrasts that are consistent with the HST\ndata. To reconcile the departure from theoretical predictions, WASP-43b would\nneed to have a high-altitude, nightside cloud/haze layer blocking its thermal\nemission. Clouds/hazes could be produced within the planet's cool, nearly\nretrograde mid-latitude flows before dispersing across its nightside at high\naltitudes. Since mid-latitude flows only materialize in fast-rotating\n($\\lesssim1$ day) planets, this may explain an observed trend connecting\nmeasured day-night contrast with planet rotation rate that matches all current\nSpitzer phase curve results.

These transitions involve interesting topological\ntransformations in which the defects recombine to form new structures.\nSurprisingly, the defects do not approach each other by taking the shorter\ndistance route (geodesic), but by following intricate paths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2016 08:15:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

Moreover, from ${\\rm sp\\,}\\Gamma$ we can define the so-called\npredistance polynomials $p_0,\\ldots,p_d\\in {\\mathbb R}_d[x]$, with ${\\rm dgr\\,}\np_i=i$, $i=0,\\ldots,d$, which are orthogonal with respect to the scalar product\n$\\langle f, g\\rangle_{\\Gamma} =\\frac{1}{n}{\\rm tr\\,}(f(A)g(A))$ and normalized\nin such a way that $\\|p_i\\|_{\\Gamma}^2=p_i(\\lambda_0)$. They can be seen as a\ngeneralization for any graph of the distance polynomials of a distance-regular\ngraph. Going further, we consider the preintersection numbers $\\xi_{ij}^h$ for\n$i,j,h\\in\\{0,\\ldots,d\\}$, which generalize the intersection numbers of a\ndistance-regular graph, and they are the Fourier coefficients of $p_ip_j$ in\nterms of the basis $\\{p_h\\}_{0\\le h\\le d}$. The aim of this paper is to show\nthat, for any graph $\\Gamma$, the information contained in its spectrum,\npredistance polynomials, and preintersection numbers is equivalent. Also, we\ngive some characterizations of distance-regularity which are based on the above\nconcepts. For instance, we comment upon the so-called spectral excess theorem\nstating that a connected regular graph $G$ is distance-regular if and only if\nits spectral excess, which is the value of $p_d$ at $\\lambda_0$, equals the\naverage excess, that is, the mean of the numbers of vertices at extremal\ndistance $d$ from every vertex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2016 08:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-02"}

This study is conducted in two different cases. When channel\nstate information (CSI) is not available at the MIMO transmitter,\nimplementation of TAS is difficult.

Fucoidans have the advantage of low toxicity and\noral bioavailibiity and are viable drug candidates, preclinical and pilot\nclinical trials show promising results. The availability of robust assays, in\nparticular for analysing the blood levels of fucoidan, is a fundamental\nrequirement for pharmacokinetic analysis in drug development projects. This\ncontribution describes the application of a commercially availbale,\nprotein-free fluorescent probe assay (Heparin Red) for the direct\nquantification of several fucoidans (from Fucus vesiculosus, Macrocystis\npyrifera, and Undaria pinnatifida) in human plasma. By only minor adapation of\nthe established protocol for heparin detection, a concentration range 0,5 to 20\nmicrogram per mL fucoidan can be addressed. A preliminary analysis of matrix\neffects suggests acceptable interindividual variability and no interference by\nendogeneous chondroitin sulfate. This study identifies the Heparin Red assay as\na simple, time-saving mix-and-read method for the quantification of fucoidans\nin human plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2016 12:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-02"}

In particular, it has been pointed out that matter-geometry\ncoupling may be responsible for the recent cosmological dynamics of the\nUniverse, and matter itself may play a more fundamental role in the description\nof the gravitational processes that usually assumed. We study the quantum\ncosmology of the $f(R,T)$ gravity theory, in which the effective Lagrangian of\nthe gravitational field is given by an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar,\nand the trace of the matter energy-momentum tensor, respectively. For the\nbackground geometry we adopt the Friedmann--Robertson--Walker metric, and we\nassume that matter content of the Universe consists of a perfect fluid. We\nobtain the general form of the gravitational Hamiltonian, of the quantum\npotential, and of the canonical momenta, respectively. This allows us to\nformulate the full Wheeler-de Witt equation describing the quantum properties\nof this modified gravity model. As a specific application we consider in detail\nthe quantum cosmology of the $f(R,T)=F^0(R)+\\theta RT$ model, in which $F^0(R)$\nis an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar, and $\\theta $ is a function of\nthe scale factor only. The Hamiltonian form of the equations of motion, and the\nWheeler-de Witt equations are obtained, and a time parameter for the\ncorresponding dynamical system is identified, which allows to formulate the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger--Wheeler--de Witt equation for the quantum-mechanical\ndescription of the model under consideration.

This similarity in intensity makes\nthe isolation and detection of soft plaques very difficult. This work aims to\ndevelop framework for segmentation of vulnerable plaques with minimal user\ndependency.

This definition {\\it\nsimultaneously} captures the three major features of complexity: computational\n(similar to logical depth), descriptional (similar to the Kolmogorov complexity\nand effective complexity) and distributional (similar to statistical\ncomplexity). In addition, the proposed definition is computable and can measure\nboth probabilistic and deterministic forms of objects in a unified manner. The\nproposed definition is based on circuits rather than Turing machines and\n$\\epsilon$-machines. We give several criteria required for organized complexity\nmeasures and show that the proposed definition satisfies all of them for the\nfirst time. We then apply this quantitative definition to formulate a {\\it\nsemantic information theory}. We present the first formal definition of a {\\it\nsemantic information amount}, which is the core concept of the semantic\ninformation theory, that is based only on concretely defined notions. Previous\nsemantic information theories defined this amount under some a priori\ninformation which is not concretely specified. We then unveil several\nfundamental properties in the semantic information theory, e.g., a semantic\nsource coding theorem, semantic channel coding theorem, and effectiveness\ncoding theorem. Although the semantic information theory has a long history of\nresearch going back more than six decades, there has been no study on its\nrelation to organized complexity. This paper offers the first unified paradigm\nof organized complexity and semantic information theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 17:19:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

Unlike previous studies, the ring-collision\neffect is exhaustively considered in our treatment, and the hydrodynamics\napproach is extended to the whole time range.

In this study, we introduce a\nmethodology based on the dynamics of word co-occurrence networks representing\nwritten texts to classify a corpus of 80 texts by 8 authors. The texts were\ndivided into sections with equal number of linguistic tokens, from which time\nseries were created for 12 topological metrics. The series were proven to be\nstationary (p-value>0.05), which permits to use distribution moments as\nlearning attributes. With an optimized supervised learning procedure using a\nRadial Basis Function Network, 68 out of 80 texts were correctly classified,\ni.e. a remarkable 85% author matching success rate. Therefore, fluctuations in\npurely dynamic network metrics were found to characterize authorship, thus\nopening the way for the description of texts in terms of small evolving\nnetworks. Moreover, the approach introduced allows for comparison of texts with\ndiverse characteristics in a simple, fast fashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 20:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-30"}
