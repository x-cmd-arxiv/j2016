Recent research in the\nbroader field of representation learning has led to significant progress in\nautomating prediction by learning the features themselves. However, present\nfeature learning approaches are not expressive enough to capture the diversity\nof connectivity patterns observed in networks. Here we propose node2vec, an\nalgorithmic framework for learning continuous feature representations for nodes\nin networks. In node2vec, we learn a mapping of nodes to a low-dimensional\nspace of features that maximizes the likelihood of preserving network\nneighborhoods of nodes. We define a flexible notion of a node's network\nneighborhood and design a biased random walk procedure, which efficiently\nexplores diverse neighborhoods. Our algorithm generalizes prior work which is\nbased on rigid notions of network neighborhoods, and we argue that the added\nflexibility in exploring neighborhoods is the key to learning richer\nrepresentations. We demonstrate the efficacy of node2vec over existing\nstate-of-the-art techniques on multi-label classification and link prediction\nin several real-world networks from diverse domains.

A central problem in the design of such systems is the need to extract\ninformation locally from sensed data on a severely limited energy budget. This\nnecessitates the design of energy-efficient sensory embedded system. A typical\nsensory embedded system enforces a physical separation between sensing and\ncomputational subsystems - a separation mandated by the differing requirements\nof the sensing and computational functions. As a consequence, the energy\nconsumption in such systems tends to be dominated by the energy consumed in\ntransferring data over the sensor-processor interface (communication energy)\nand the energy consumed in processing the data in digital processor\n(computational energy). In this article, we propose an in-sensor computing\narchitecture which (mostly) eliminates the sensor-processor interface by\nembedding inference computations in the noisy sensor fabric in analog and\nretraining the hyperparameters in order to compensate for non-ideal\ncomputations. The resulting architecture referred to as the Compute Sensor - a\nsensor that computes in addition to sensing - represents a radical departure\nfrom the conventional. We show that a Compute Sensor for image data can be\ndesigned by embedding both feature extraction and classification functions in\nthe analog domain in close proximity to the CMOS active pixel sensor (APS)\narray.

However, in a previous study we reported the\ndiscovery of two embedded clusters (ECs) far away from the Galactic plane\n($\\sim5$ kpc). In our recent star cluster catalogue we provided additional high\nand intermediate latitude cluster candidates. This work aims to clarify if our\nprevious detection of star clusters far away from the disc represents just an\nepisodic event or if the star cluster formation is currently a systematic\nphenomenon in the Galactic halo. We analyse the nature of four clusters found\nin our recent catalogue and report the discovery of three new ECs with\nunusually high latitude and distance from the Galactic disc midplane. All of\nthese clusters are younger than 5 Myr. The high-latitude ECs C 932, C 934, and\nC 939 appear to be related to a cloud complex about 5 kpc below the Galactic\ndisc, under the Local arm. The other clusters are above the disc, C 1074 and C\n1100 with a vertical distance of $\\sim3$ kpc, C 1099 with $\\sim2$ kpc, and C\n1101 with $\\sim1.8$ kpc. According to the derived parameters there occur ECs\nlocated below and above the disc, which is an evidence of widespread star\ncluster formation throughout the Galactic halo. Thus, this study represents a\nparadigm shift, in the sense that a sterile halo becomes now a host of ongoing\nstar formation. The origin and fate of these ECs remain open. There are two\npossibilities for their origin, Galactic fountain or infall. The discovery of\nECs far from the disc suggests that the Galactic halo is more actively forming\nstars than previously thought and since most ECs do not survive the\n\\textit{infant mortality} it may be raining stars from the halo into the disc,\nand/or the halo harbours generations of stars formed in clusters like those\nhereby detected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2016 19:30:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

It has also triggered a new wave of developments in\nthe related fields of generalized linear and bilinear inference problems, that\nhave very diverse applications in signal processing and are furthermore a\nbuilding block of deep neural networks. These problems have in common that they\ncombine a linear mixing step and a nonlinear, probabilistic sensing step,\nproducing indirect measurements of a signal of interest. Such a setting arises\nin problems as different as medical or astronomical imaging, clustering, matrix\ncompletion or blind source separation. The aim of this thesis is to propose\nefficient algorithms for this class of problems and to perform their\ntheoretical analysis. To this end, it uses belief propagation, thanks to which\nhigh-dimensional distributions can be sampled efficiently, thus making a\nBayesian approach to inference tractable. The resulting algorithms undergo\nphase transitions just as physical systems do. These phase transitions can be\nanalyzed using the replica method, initially developed in statistical physics\nof disordered systems. The analysis reveals phases in which inference is easy,\nhard or impossible. These phases correspond to different energy landscapes of\nthe problem. The main contributions of this thesis can be divided into three\ncategories. First, the application of known algorithms to concrete problems:\ncommunity detection, superposition codes and an innovative imaging system.\nSecond, a new, efficient message-passing algorithm for a class of problems\ncalled blind sensor calibration. Third, a theoretical analysis of matrix\ncompressed sensing and of instabilities in Bayesian bilinear inference\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2016 19:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-05"}

In\nthis work we investigate this fragmentation in high-resolution simulations of\njets in the closed-field corona. We study two realizations of the\nembedded-bipole model, whereby impulsive helical outflows are driven by\nreconnection between twisted and untwisted field across the domed fan plane of\na magnetic null. We find that the reconnection region fragments following the\nonset of a tearing-like instability, producing multiple magnetic null points\nand flux-rope structures within the current layer. The flux ropes formed within\nthe weak-field region in the center of the current layer are associated with\n\"blobs\" of density enhancement that become filamentary threads as the flux\nropes are ejected from the layer, whereupon new flux ropes form behind them.\nThis repeated formation and ejection of flux ropes provides a natural\nexplanation for the intermittent outflows, bright blobs of emission, and\nfilamentary structure observed in some jets. Additional observational\nsignatures of this process are discussed. Essentially all jet models invoke\nreconnection between regions of locally closed and locally open field as the\njet-generation mechanism. Therefore, we suggest that this repeated tearing\nprocess should occur at the separatrix surface between the two flux systems in\nall jets.

Our aim is to find the decomposition which minimizes the total\npatch-wise sparseness of the decomposed modes. We propose a\ndomain-decomposition type method, called intrinsic sparse mode decomposition\n(ISMD), which follows the \"local-modes-construction + patching-up\" procedure.\nThe key step in the ISMD is to construct local pieces of the intrinsic sparse\nmodes by a joint diagonalization problem. Thereafter a pivoted Cholesky\ndecomposition is utilized to glue these local pieces together. Optimal sparse\ndecomposition, consistency with different domain decomposition and robustness\nto small perturbation are proved under the so called regular-sparse assumption\n(see Definition 1.2).

In this\nstudy, we developed an algorithm to automatically answer health-related\nquestions based on past questions and answers (QA). We also aimed to understand\ninformation embedded within online health content that are good features in\nidentifying valid answers. Our proposed algorithm uses information retrieval\ntechniques to identify candidate answers from resolved QA. In order to rank\nthese candidates, we implemented a semi-supervised leaning algorithm that\nextracts the best answer to a question. We assessed this approach on a curated\ncorpus from Yahoo! Answers and compared against a rule-based string similarity\nbaseline. On our dataset, the semi-supervised learning algorithm has an\naccuracy of 86.2%. UMLS-based (health-related) features used in the model\nenhance the algorithm's performance by proximately 8 %. A reasonably high rate\nof accuracy is obtained given that the data is considerably noisy. Important\nfeatures distinguishing a valid answer from an invalid answer include text\nlength, number of stop words contained in a test question, a distance between\nthe test question and other questions in the corpus as well as a number of\noverlapping health-related terms between questions. Overall, our automated QA\nsystem based on historical QA pairs is shown to be effective according to the\ndata set in this case study. It is developed for general use in the health care\ndomain which can also be applied to other CQA sites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 00:17:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-05"}

Since DRAM memories are expensive, some\nresearchers are suggesting to use other memory systems such as non-volatile\nmemory (NVM) technology to build large-memory computing systems. However,\nwhether the NVM technology can be a viable alternative (either economically and\ntechnically) to DRAM remains an open question. To answer this question, it is\nimportant to consider how to design a memory system from a \"system\nperspective\", that is, incorporating different performance characteristics and\nprice ratios from hybrid memory devices.\n  This paper presents an analytical model of a \"hybrid page cache system\" so to\nunderstand the diverse design space and performance impact of a hybrid cache\nsystem. We consider (1) various architectural choices, (2) design strategies,\nand (3) configuration of different memory devices. Using this model, we provide\nguidelines on how to design hybrid page cache to reach a good trade-off between\nhigh system throughput (in I/O per sec or IOPS) and fast cache reactivity which\nis defined by the time to fill the cache. We also show how one can configure\nthe DRAM capacity and NVM capacity under a fixed budget. We pick PCM as an\nexample for NVM and conduct numerical analysis. Our analysis indicates that\nincorporating PCM in a page cache system significantly improves the system\nperformance, and it also shows larger benefit to allocate more PCM in page\ncache in some cases. Besides, for the common setting of performance-price ratio\nof PCM, \"flat architecture\" offers as a better choice, but \"layered\narchitecture\" outperforms if PCM write performance can be significantly\nimproved in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 01:10:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 07:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-03"}

Departing from the previous\nmethods fusing multiple image descriptors simultaneously, C2F is featured by a\nlayered procedure composed by filtering and refining. In particular, C2F\nconsists of three components. 1) Distractor filtering. With holistic\nrepresentations, noise images are filtered out from the database, so the number\nof candidate images to be used for comparison with the query can be greatly\nreduced. 2) Adaptive weighting. For a certain query, the similarity of\ncandidate images can be estimated by holistic similarity scores in\ncomplementary to the local ones. 3) Candidate refining. Accurate retrieval is\nconducted via local features, combining the pre-computed adaptive weights.\nExperiments are presented on two benchmarks, \\emph{i.e.,} Holidays and Ukbench\ndatasets.

Using these maps\ntogether with cm/mm total intensity and Gamma-ray observations from Fermi/LAT\nfrom 2008-2014, we aimed to determine the location of Gamma-ray emission and to\nexplain the inner-mas structural changes. Observations with the GMVA offer\napproximately double the angular resolution compared with 43 GHz VLBA\nobservations and allow us to observe above the synchrotron self-absorption peak\nfrequency. The jet was spectrally decomposed at multiple locations along the\njet. From this we derived estimates of the magnetic field. How the field\ndecreases down the jet allowed an estimate of the distance to the jet apex and\nan estimate of the magnetic field strength at the jet apex and in the broad\nline region. Combined with accurate kinematics we attempt to locate the site of\nGamma-ray activity, radio flares and spectral changes. Strong Gamma-ray flares\nappeared to originate from either the \"core\" region, a downstream stationary\nfeature, or both, with Gamma-ray activity significantly correlated with radio\nflaring in the downstream quasi-stationary feature. Magnetic field estimates\nwere determined at multiple locations along the jet, with the magnetic field\nfound to be >1.6 G in the \"core\" and >0.4 G in the downstream quasi-stationary\nfeature. We therefore found upper limits on the location of the \"core\" as >6.0\npc from the jet apex and determined an upper limit on the magnetic field near\nthe jet base of the order of thousands of Gauss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 02:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

Specifically, we analyze the distributional\napproximation of linear contrasts $c^{\\top} (\\hat{\\beta}_{\\rho}-\\beta)$, where\n$\\hat{\\beta}_{\\rho}$ is a ridge-regression estimator. When regression\ncoefficients are estimated via least squares, classical results show that RB\nconsistently approximates the laws of contrasts, provided that $p\\ll n$, where\nthe design matrix is of size $n\\times p$. Up to now, relatively little work has\nconsidered how additional structure in the linear model may extend the validity\nof RB to the setting where $p/n\\asymp 1$. In this setting, we propose a version\nof RB that resamples residuals obtained from ridge regression. Our main\nstructural assumption on the design matrix is that it is nearly low rank --- in\nthe sense that its singular values decay according to a power-law profile.\nUnder a few extra technical assumptions, we derive a simple criterion for\nensuring that RB consistently approximates the law of a given contrast. We then\nspecialize this result to study confidence intervals for mean response values\n$X_i^{\\top} \\beta$, where $X_i^{\\top}$ is the $i$th row of the design. More\nprecisely, we show that conditionally on a Gaussian design with near low-rank\nstructure, RB simultaneously approximates all of the laws\n$X_i^{\\top}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\rho}-\\beta)$, $i=1,\\dots,n$. This result is also\nnotable as it imposes no sparsity assumptions on $\\beta$. Furthermore, since\nour consistency results are formulated in terms of the Mallows (Kantorovich)\nmetric, the existence of a limiting distribution is not required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 05:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-05"}

Performance of the\ncode and the impact of the various effects on the retrieved field distribution\nis tested first on the realistic MHD simulations. The best inversion scenario\nis then applied to the real Hinode/SP data. Tests on simulations show: (1) the\nbest choice of node position ensures a decent retrieval of all parameters, (2)\ncode performs well for different configurations of magnetic field, (3) slightly\ndifferent noise level or slightly different defocus included in the spatial PSF\nproduces no significant effect on the results and (4) temporal integration\nshifts the field distribution to the stronger, more horizontally inclined\nfield.

To tackle these limitations,\nin this paper, we propose a dynamic, transparent and privacy-driven access\ncontrol mechanism for textual messages published in OSNs. The notion of\nprivacy-driven is achieved by analyzing the semantics of the messages to be\npublished and, according to that, assessing the degree of sensitiveness of\ntheir contents. For this purpose, the proposed system relies on an automatic\nsemantic annotation mechanism that, by using knowledge bases and linguistic\ntools, is able to associate a meaning to the information to be published. By\nmeans of this annotation, our mechanism automatically detects the information\nthat is sensitive according to the privacy requirements of the publisher of\ndata, with regard to the type of reader that may access such data. Finally, our\naccess control mechanism automatically creates sanitized versions of the users'\npublications according to the type of reader that accesses them. As a result,\nour proposal, which can be integrated in already existing social networks,\nprovides an automatic, seamless and content-driven protection of user\npublications, which are coherent with her privacy requirements and the type of\nreaders that access them. Complementary to the system design, we also discuss\nthe feasibility of the system by illustrating it through a real example and\nevaluate its accuracy and effectiveness over standard approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 09:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-05"}

According to the handedness of this rotation, its \\emph{longitudinal}\nspin angular momentum density is either parallel or antiparallel to the\npropagation of light. However, there are also light waves that are not simply\nplane and carry an electric field that rotates around an axis perpendicular to\nthe propagation direction, thus yielding \\emph{transverse} spin angular\nmomentum density. Electric field configurations of this kind have been\nsuggestively dubbed \"photonic wheels\". It has been recently shown that photonic\nwheels are commonplace in optics as they occur in electromagnetic fields\nconfined by waveguides, in strongly focused beams, in plasmonic and evanescent\nwaves. In this work we establish a general theory of electromagnetic waves\n{propagating along a well defined direction, which carry} transverse spin\nangular momentum density. We show that depending on the shape of {these waves,\nthe} spin density may be either perpendicular to the \\emph{mean} linear\nmomentum (globally transverse spin) or to the linear momentum \\emph{density}\n(locally transverse spin). We find that the latter case generically occurs only\nfor non-diffracting beams, such as the Bessel beams. Moreover, we introduce the\nconcept of \\emph{meridional} Stokes parameters to operationally quantify the\ntransverse spin density. To illustrate our theory, we apply it to the exemplary\ncases of Bessel beams and evanescent waves. These results open a new and\naccessible route to the understanding, generation and manipulation of optical\nbeams with transverse spin angular momentum density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 09:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

Gamma Doradus stars (hereafter gamma Dor stars) are known to exhibit\ngravity- and/or gravito-intertial modes that probe the inner stellar region\nnear the convective core boundary. The non-equidistant spacing of the pulsation\nperiods is an observational signature of the stars' evolution and current\ninternal structure and is heavily influenced by rotation.\n  AIMS. We aim to constrain the near-core rotation rates for a sample of gamma\nDor stars, for which we have detected period spacing patterns.\n  METHODS. We combined the asymptotic period spacing with the traditional\napproximation of stellar pulsation to fit the observed period spacing patterns\nusing chi-squared optimisation. The method was applied to the observed period\nspacing patterns of a sample of stars and used for ensemble modelling.\n  RESULTS. For the majority of stars with an observed period spacing pattern we\nsuccessfully determined the rotation rates and the asymptotic period spacing\nvalues, though the uncertainty margins on the latter were typically large. This\nalso resulted directly in the identification of the modes corresponding with\nthe detected pulsation frequencies, which for most stars were prograde dipole\ngravity and gravito-inertial modes. The majority of the observed retrograde\nmodes were found to be Rossby modes. We further discuss the limitations of the\nmethod due to the neglect of the centrifugal force and the incomplete treatment\nof the Coriolis force.\n  CONCLUSION. Despite its current limitations, the proposed methodology was\nsuccessful to derive the rotation rates and to identify the modes from the\nobserved period spacing patterns.

Here we examine the dynamo\nproperties of such flows in rotating Boussinesq convection. For moderate values\nof the magnetic Reynolds number ($100 \\lesssim Rm \\lesssim 550$, with $Rm$\nbased on the box depth and the convective velocity), a large-scale (i.e.\nsystem-size) magnetic field is generated. The amplitude of the magnetic energy\noscillates in time, nearly out of phase with the oscillating amplitude of the\nlarge-scale vortex. The large-scale vortex is disrupted once the magnetic field\nreaches a critical strength, showing that these oscillations are of magnetic\norigin. The dynamo mechanism relies on those components of the flow that have\nlength scales lying between that of the large-scale vortex and the typical\nconvective cell size; smaller-scale flows are not required. The large-scale\nvortex plays a crucial role in the magnetic induction despite being essentially\ntwo-dimensional; we thus refer to this dynamo as a large-scale-vortex dynamo.\nFor larger magnetic Reynolds numbers, the dynamo is small scale, with a\nmagnetic energy spectrum that peaks at the scale of the convective cells. In\nthis case, the small-scale magnetic field continuously suppresses the\nlarge-scale vortex by disrupting the correlations between the convective\nvelocities that allow it to form. The suppression of the large-scale vortex at\nhigh $Rm$ therefore probably limits the relevance of the large-scale-vortex\ndynamo to astrophysical objects with moderate values of $Rm$, such as planets.\nIn this context, the ability of the large-scale-vortex dynamo to operate at low\nmagnetic Prandtl numbers is of great interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 11:20:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 17:40:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

The dynamics of an initially\nlocalized wave packets are concerned in both classical and quantum cases.

Besides\nobtaining new results we also correct some misleading results from the recent\nliterature. We show that the mean-field critical temperature Tc0 is an\ninterplay between the maximal pairing potential and the FSP-width qc. For\nTc0~100 K the gap (G) is G~16 meV in agreement with ARPES experiments. We find\nthat in leading order Tc0 is mass-independent and there is small oxygen isotope\neffect in next to leading order.

The\nnon-magnetic impurities are pair-weakening in the s-channel and pair-breaking\nin the d-channel.

The EPI-FSP theory predicts a large number of\nlow-laying pairing states (above the ground state) thus causing internal pair\nfluctuations.

In these two schemes, the\none just considers user association, but the other introduces power control to\nmitigate interference and reduce energy consumption while performing user\nassociation. Since the effective rate is closely related to the load of some BS\nand the achievable rate of some user, it can be used as a key factor of\nassociation schemes for load balancing in HCNs. To solve the association\nproblem without power control, we design a one-layer iterative algorithm, which\nconverts the sum-of-ratio form of original optimization problem into a\nparameterized polynomial form. By combining this algorithm with power control\nalgorithm, we propose a two-layer iterative algorithm for the association\nproblem with power control. Specially, the outer layer performs user\nassociation using the algorithm of problem without power control, and the inner\nlayer updates the transmit power of each BS using a power update function\n(PUF). At last, we give some convergence and complexity analyses for the\nproposed algorithms. As shown in simulation results, the proposed schemes have\nsuperior performance than the conventional association, and the scheme with\njoint user association and power control achieves a higher load balancing gain\nand energy efficiency than conventional scheme and other offloading scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 12:29:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-05"}

However, in contrast to cuprates, iron-based\nhigh-$T_{c}$ compounds are multi-orbital systems with Hubbard and Hund\ninteractions, resulting in a rather involved 10-orbital lattice model. Here we\nreview different minimal models that have been proposed to unveil the universal\nfeatures of these systems.

The\nformer, while providing important qualitative insight into the role of the\norbital degrees of freedom, do not distinguish between high-energy and\nlow-energy sectors and, for this reason, generally do not go beyond mean-field.\nThe latter allow one to go beyond mean-field and investigate the interplay\nbetween superconducting and magnetic orders as well as Ising-nematic order.\nHowever, they cannot capture orbital-dependent features like spontaneous\norbital order. We then review recent proposals for a minimal model that\noperates in the band basis but fully incorporates the orbital composition and\nsymmetries of the low-energy excitations. We discuss the results of the\nrenormalization group study of such a model, particularly of the interplay\nbetween superconductivity, magnetism, and spontaneous orbital order, and\ncompare theoretical predictions with experiments on iron pnictides and\nchalcogenides.

For this purpose, we employ\na simplified model considering the merger event of magnetized gaseous disks in\nthe absence of stellar feedback and without a stellar or dark matter component.\nWe show that our model naturally leads to the production of two peaks in the\nevolution of the average magnetic field strength within 5 kpc, within 25 kpc\nand on scales in between 5 and 25 kpc. The latter is consistent with the peak\nin the magnetic field strength reported by Drzazga et al. (2011) in a merger\nsequence of observed galaxies. We show that the peak on the galactic scale and\nin the outer regions is likely due to geometrical effects, as the core of one\ngalaxy enters the outskirts of the other one. In addition, there is a physical\nenhancement of the magnetic field within the central ~5 kpc, reflecting the\nenhancement in density due to efficient angular momentum transport.

We have proposed the \"Variable Double\nPartial Covering (VDPC) model\" to explain the energy spectra and spectral\nvariability of 1H 0707$-$495 (Mizumoto, Ebisawa and Sameshima 2014, PASJ, 66,\n122).

In\nthis paper, we apply the VDPC model to IRAS 13224$-$3809. Consequently, we have\nfound that the VDPC model can explain the observed spectral variations of IRAS\n13224$-$3809 in the 0.5$-$10 keV band. In particular, we can explain the\nobserved Root Mean Square (RMS) spectra (energy dependence of the fractional\nflux variation) in the entire 0.5$-$10 keV band. In addition to the well-known\nsignificant drop in the iron K-band, we have found intriguing iron L-peaks in\nthe RMS spectra when the iron L-edge is particularly deep. This feature, which\nis also found in 1H 0707$-$495, is naturally explained with the VDPC model,\nsuch that the RMS variations increase at the energies where optical depths of\nthe partial absorbers are large. The absorbers have a larger optical depth at\nthe iron L-edge than in the adjacent energy bands, thus a characteristic iron\nL-peak appears. On the other hand, just below the iron K-edge, the optical\ndepth is the lowest and the RMS spectrum has a broad dip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 13:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

A true dynamical symmetry, where the Hamiltonian is block-diagonal\nin subspaces defined by the group, is rare. More likely is a quasidynamical\nsymmetry: states with different quantum numbers (i.e. angular momentum)\nnonetheless sharing similar group-theoretical decompositions. Purpose: We use\ngroup-theoretical decomposition to investigate backbending, an abrupt change in\nthe moment of inertia along the yrast line, in $^{48,49,50}$Cr: prior\nmean-field calculations of these nuclides suggest a change from strongly\nprolate to more spherical configurations as one crosses the backbending and\nincreases in angular momentum. Methods: We decompose configuration-interaction\nshell-model wavefunctions using the SU(2) groups $L$ (total orbital angular\nmomentum) and $S$ (total spin), and the groups SU(3) and SU(4). We do not need\na special basis but only matrix elements of Casimir operators, applied with a\nmodified Lanczos algorithm. Results: We find quasidynamical symmetries, albeit\noften of a different character above and below the backbending, for each group.\nWhile the strongest evolution was in SU(3), the decompositions did not suggest\na decrease in deformation. We point out with a simple example that mean-field\nand SU(3) configurations may give very different pictures of deformation.\nConclusions: Persistent quasidynamical symmetries for several groups allow us\nto identify the members of a band and to characterize how they evolve with\nincreasing angular momentum, especially before and after backbending.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 13:57:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 21:38:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 01:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

In intermittent search the random\nmotion alternates between two or more motility modes, one of which is\nnon-detecting. An example is the slow diffusive motion as the detecting mode\nand fast, directed ballistic motion as the non-detecting mode, which can lead\nto much faster detection than a purely diffusive search. The transition rate\nbetween the diffusive and the ballistic mode (and back) together with the\nprobability distribution of directions for the ballistic motion defines a\nsearch strategy. If these transition rates and/or probability distributions\ndepend on the spatial coordinates within the search domain it is a spatially\ninhomogeneous search strategy, if both are constant, it is a homogeneous one.\nHere we study the efficiency, measured in terms of the mean first-passage time,\nof spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous search strategies for three\nparadigmatic search problems: 1) the narrow escape problem, where the searcher\nhas to find a small area on the boundary of the search domain, 2) reaction\nkinetics, which involves the detection of an immobile target in the interior of\na search domain, and 3) the reaction-escape problem, where the searcher first\nneeds to find a diffusive target before it can escape through a narrow region\non the boundary.

In-falling IVCs are candidates for the\nre-accretion of matter onto the Milky Way. We study the evolution of IVCs at\nthe disk-halo interface, focussing on the transition from atomic to molecular\nIVCs. We compare an atomic IVC to a molecular IVC and characterise their\nstructural differences in order to investigate how molecular IVCs form high\nabove the Galactic plane. With high-resolution HI observations of the\nWesterbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and 12CO(1-0) and 13CO(1-0) observations\nwith the IRAM 30m telescope, we analyse the small-scale structures within the\ntwo clouds.

We conduct a detailed comparison of the HI, FIR, and CO data and\nstudy variations of the $X_\\rm{CO}$ conversion factor. The atomic IVC does not\ndisclose detectable CO emission. The atomic small-scale structure, as revealed\nby the high-resolution HI data, shows low peak HI column densities and low HI\nfluxes as compared to the molecular IVC. The molecular IVC exhibits a rich\nmolecular structure and most of the CO emission is observed at the eastern edge\nof the cloud. There is observational evidence that the molecular IVC is in a\ntransient and, thus, non-equilibrium phase. The average $X_\\rm{CO}$ factor is\nclose to the canonical value of the Milky Way disk. We propose that the two\nIVCs represent different states in a gradual transition from atomic to\nmolecular clouds. The molecular IVC appears to be more condensed allowing the\nformation of H2 and CO in shielded regions all over the cloud. Ram pressure may\naccumulate gas and thus facilitate the formation of H2.

These events with visual peak\nmagnitudes $\\lesssim-21$ are called superluminous SNe (SLSNe). Aims: There are\na few intermediate events which have luminosities between these two classes.\nHere we study one such object, SN 2012aa. Methods: The optical photometric and\nspectroscopic follow-up observations of the event were conducted over a time\nspan of about 120 days. Results: With V_abs at peak ~-20 mag, the SN is an\nintermediate-luminosity transient between regular SNe Ibc and SLSNe. It also\nexhibits an unusual secondary bump after the maximum in its light curve. We\ninterpret this as a manifestation of SN-shock interaction with the CSM. If we\nwould assume a $^{56}$Ni-powered ejecta, the bolometric light curve requires\nroughly 1.3 M_sun of $^{56}$Ni and an ejected mass of ~14 M_sun. This would\nalso imply a high kinetic energy of the explosion, ~5.4$\\times10^{51}$ ergs. On\nthe other hand, the unusually broad light curve along with the secondary peak\nindicate the possibility of interaction with CSM. The third alternative is the\npresence of a central engine releasing spin energy that eventually powers the\nlight curve over a long time. The host of the SN is a star-forming Sa/Sb/Sbc\ngalaxy. Conclusions: Although the spectral properties and velocity evolution of\nSN 2012aa are comparable to those of normal SNe Ibc, its broad light curve\nalong with a large peak luminosity distinguish it from canonical CCSNe,\nsuggesting the event to be an intermediate-luminosity transient between CCSNe\nand SLSNe at least in terms of peak luminosity. We argue that SN 2012aa belongs\nto a subclass where CSM interaction plays a significant role in powering the\nSN, at least during the initial stages of evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 15:10:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

Such a hybrid correlation in\nindividual AGNs is unexpected as it deviates from the Fundamental Plane of AGN\nactivity. Interestingly, a similar correlation pattern is observed in the black\nhole X-ray binary H1743--322, where it has been modelled by switching between\ndifferent modes of accretion. We propose that the flat $L_R$--$L_X$ correlation\nof NGC 7213 is due to the presence of a luminous hot accretion flow, an\naccretion model whose radiative efficiency is sensitive to the accretion rate.\nGiven the low luminosity of the source, $L_X\\sim 10^{-4}$ of the Eddington\nluminosity, the viscosity parameter is determined to be small, $\\alpha\\approx\n0.01$. We also modelled the broad-band spectrum from radio to $\\gamma$-rays,\nthe time lag between the radio and X-ray light curves, and the implied size and\nthe Lorentz factor of the radio jet. We predict that NGC 7213 will enter into a\ntwo-phase accretion regime when $L_X > 1.5 \\times 10^{42}\\, {\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}}$.\nWhen this happens, we predict a softening of the X-ray spectrum with the\nincreasing flux and a steep radio/X-ray correlation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 15:27:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 14:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-14"}

Our goal is to jointly design the optimal input\ncovariances for the multicast message, confidential message and AN, such that\nthe achievable secrecy rate region is maximized subject to the sum power\nconstraint. This secrecy rate region maximization (SRRM) problem is a nonconvex\nvector maximization problem. To handle it, we reformulate the SRRM problem into\na provably equivalent scalar optimization problem and propose a searching\nmethod to find all of its Pareto optimal points. The equivalent scalar\noptimization problem is identified as a secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem\nwith the quality of multicast service (QoMS) constraints. Further, we show that\nthis equivalent QoMS-constrained SRM problem, albeit nonconvex, can be\nefficiently handled based on a two-stage optimization approach, including\nsolving a sequence of semidefinite programs.
