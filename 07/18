The peaks should be split in mass by at least approximately 1.5 MeV.\nThis behavior arises from an enhancement of the effect of isospin violation in\nthe masses of the $D$ and $D^*$ mesons due to apparent suppression of forces\nbetween the mesons depending on the spins of the heavy as well as of the light\nquarks. The suggested double-peak structure can be studied either by direct\nshape measurement in the channels with heavy mesons, or by isospin-violating\ntransitions from $Z_c^\\pm(3885)$ to the states of charmonium plus a light\nmeson.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2016 16:08:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2016 14:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

As proposed in this article, this problem can be\nsignificantly mitigated by reducing the channel thickness meanwhile retaining a\nthick source-channel tunnel junction, thus forming a design with a non-uniform\nbody thickness. Because of the quantum confinement, the thin InAs channel\noffers a large band gap and large effective masses, reducing the ambipolar and\nsource-to-drain tunneling leakage at OFF state. The thick GaSb/InAs tunnel\njunction, instead, offers a low tunnel barrier and small effective masses,\nallowing a large tunnel probability at ON state.

This motivates our study in this paper on a new hybrid\ndecoding scheme where in addition to quantizing and forwarding the received\nsignals for joint decoding at the CP, i.e. forward-and-decode (FaD) as in the\nconventional CRAN, the RRHs can locally decode-and-forward (DaF) the user\nmessages to save the fronthaul capacity. In particular, we consider the uplink\ntransmission in an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based\nUD-CRAN, where the proposed hybrid decoding is performed on each OFDMA\nsub-channel (SC). We study a joint optimization of the processing mode\nselections (DaF or FaD), user-SC assignments and the users' transmit power\nallocations over all SCs to maximize their weighted-sum-rate subject to the\nRRHs' individual fronthaul capacity constraints and the users' individual power\nconstraints.

Further,\nwe propose a low-complexity greedy algorithm which is shown to achieve close to\nthe optimal performance under practical setups.

Based on these developments, a sparse representation-based\nclassification (SRC) has been proposed for a variety of classification and\nrelated tasks, including face recognition. Recently, a class dependent variant\nof SRC was proposed to overcome the limitations of SRC for remote sensing image\nclassification. Traditionally, greedy pursuit based method such as orthogonal\nmatching pursuit (OMP) are used for sparse coefficient recovery due to their\nsimplicity as well as low time-complexity. However, orthogonal least square\n(OLS) has not yet been widely used in classifiers that exploit the sparse\nrepresentation properties of data. Since OLS produces lower signal\nreconstruction error than OMP under similar conditions, we hypothesize that\nmore accurate signal estimation will further improve the classification\nperformance of classifiers that exploiting the sparsity of data. In this paper,\nwe present a classification method based on OLS, which implements OLS in a\nclasswise manner to perform the classification. We also develop and present its\nkernelized variant to handle nonlinearly separable data. Based on two\nreal-world benchmarking hyperspectral datasets, we demonstrate that class\ndependent OLS based methods outperform several baseline methods including\ntraditional SRC and the support vector machine classifier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2016 03:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-19"}

In the presence\nof the charged impurities, the linear magnetoresistance can happen when the\ncharge carriers are mainly from the zeroth (n=0) Landau level. Interestingly,\nthe linear magnetoresistance is very robust against the change of temperature,\nas long as the charge carriers mainly come from the zeroth Landau level. We\ndenote this parameter regime as the high-field regime. On the other hand, the\nlinear magnetoresistance disappears once the charge carriers from the higher\nLandau levels can provide notable contributions. Our analysis indicates that\nthe deviation from the linear magnetoresistance is mainly due to the deviation\nof the longitudinal conductivity from the $1/B$ behavior.

However, when an executable file switches between code regimes\n(e.g. native, encrypted, compressed, text, and padding), there are\ncorresponding shifts in the file's representation as an entropy signal. In this\npaper, we develop a method for automatically quantifying the extent to which\npatterned variations in a file's entropy signal make it \"suspicious.\" In\nExperiment 1, we use wavelet transforms to define a Suspiciously Structured\nEntropic Change Score (SSECS), a scalar feature that quantifies the\nsuspiciousness of a file based on its distribution of entropic energy across\nmultiple levels of spatial resolution. Based on this single feature, it was\npossible to raise predictive accuracy on a malware detection task from 50.0% to\n68.7%, even though the single feature was applied to a heterogeneous corpus of\nmalware discovered \"in the wild.\" In Experiment 2, we describe how\nwavelet-based decompositions of software entropy can be applied to a parasitic\nmalware detection task involving large numbers of samples and features. By\nextracting only string and entropy features (with wavelet decompositions) from\nsoftware samples, we are able to obtain almost 99% detection of parasitic\nmalware with fewer than 1% false positives on good files. Moreover, the\naddition of wavelet-based features uniformly improved detection performance\nacross plausible false positive rates, both in a strings-only model (e.g., from\n80.90% to 82.97%) and a strings-plus-entropy model (e.g. from 92.10% to 94.74%,\nand from 98.63% to 98.90%).

We study effects of viscosity and\nenergy dissipation theoretically on the outflow rate and show that as the\nviscosity or energy dissipation (or both) rises, the prospect of formation of\noutflows is greatly reduced, thereby verifying results obtained through\nobservations and numerical simulations. Indeed, we find that in a dissipative\nviscous flow, shocks in presence of outflows can be produced only if the\nShakura-Sunyaev viscosity parameter {\\alpha} is less than 0.2.

The aim of\nthe study is to gain microscopic insight into the effect of interactions among\nvarious sub populations in the spreading processes of disease over such\nnetworks. The discrete time Markov chain method based upon the susceptible\ninfected susceptible (SIS) model of diseases transmission has been used to\ndescribe the spreading of epidemic over the networks.

In this paper we present a simple and\ndistributed algorithm for graph clustering: for a wide class of graphs that are\ncharacterised by a strong cluster-structure, our algorithm finishes in a\npoly-logarithmic number of rounds, and recovers a partition of the graph close\nto an optimal partition. The main component of our algorithm is an application\nof the random matching model of load balancing, which is a fundamental protocol\nin distributed computing and has been extensively studied in the past 20 years.\nHence, our result highlights an intrinsic and interesting connection between\ngraph clustering and load balancing. At a technical level, we present a purely\nalgebraic result characterising the early behaviours of load balancing\nprocesses for graphs exhibiting a cluster-structure.

The active region emergence was detected in deep layers of\nthe convection zone about 12 hours before the first bipolar magnetic structure\nappeared on the surface, and 2 days before the emergence of most of the\nmagnetic flux. The speed of emergence determined by tracking the flow\ndivergence with depth is about 1.4 km/s, very close to the emergence speed in\nthe deep layers. As the emerging magnetic flux becomes concentrated in sunspots\nlocal converging flows are observed beneath the forming sunspots. These flows\nare most prominent in the depth range 1-3 Mm, and remain converging after the\nformation process is completed. On the larger scale converging flows around\nactive region appear as a diversion of the zonal shearing flows towards the\nactive region, accompanied by formation of a large-scale vortex structure. This\nprocess occurs when a substantial amount of the magnetic flux emerged on the\nsurface, and the converging flow pattern remains stable during the following\nevolution of the active region. The Carrington synoptic flow maps show that the\nlarge-scale subsurface inflows are typical for active regions. In the deeper\nlayers (10-13 Mm) the flows become diverging, and surprisingly strong beneath\nsome active regions.

However very little is\nknown about the reliability and precision of this method, and we are unaware of\nany robust conversion recipe to infer the inclination from the core dominance.\nInvestigating whether or not the radio core dominance parameter R separates the\nquasars from the radio-galaxies in the $z \\ge$~1 3CRR catalog, we found\nexcellent agreement of R with optical type, infrared flux ratios and optical\npolarization. This indicates that probably both R and optical classification\nare very good orientation indicators, and the unified model is strongly\npredictive for these objects. The relative number densities indicate\nhalf-opening angles close to 60$^\\circ$, as expected from large surveys. The\nseparations of optical types according to radio core dominance as well as\nNIR/MIR ratios, which are essentially perfect, means that there can be only a\nsmall dispersion of torus half-opening angles. Also, even though torus dust is\nthought to be clumpy, there is an almost zero probability to see a type-1\nsource at high inclination. Finally, using only the Copernican Principle, i,e,\nthe assumption that solid angle is filled uniformly with source axis\norientations, we estimated a semi-empirical relation between core dominance and\nAGN inclination.

Accurately\nquantifying the noise requires a large number of statistically independent\nmocks for a variety of cosmologies. This is impractical for weak lensing\nsimulations, which are costly for simultaneous requirements of large box size\n(to cover a significant fraction of the past light cone) and high resolution\n(to robustly probe the small scale where most lensing signal resides).\nTherefore fast mock generation methods are desired and are under intensive\ninvestigation.

Lacking an instability, the large transient growth of\nthe roll/streak structure has been invoked to explain its appearance as\nresulting from chance occurrence in the free-stream turbulence (FST) of\nperturbations configured to optimally excite it. However, there is an\nalternative interpretation which is that FST interacts with the roll/streak\nstructure to destabilize it. Statistical state dynamics (SSD) provides analysis\nmethods for studying instabilities of this type which arise from interaction\nbetween the coherent and incoherent components of turbulence. Stochastic\nstructural stability theory (S3T), which implements SSD in the form of a\nclosure at second order, is used to analyze the SSD modes arising from\ninteraction between the coherent streamwise invariant component and the\nincoherent FST component of turbulence. The least stable S3T mode is\ndestabilized at a critical value of a parameter controlling FST intensity and a\nfinite amplitude roll/streak structure arises from this instability through a\nbifurcation in this parameter. Although this bifurcation has analytical\nexpression only in SSD, it is closely reflected in both the dynamically similar\nquasi-linear system, referred to as the restricted non-linear (RNL) system, and\nin DNS. S3T also predicts a second bifurcation at a higher value of the\nturbulent excitation parameter. This second bifurcation is shown to lead to\ntransition to turbulence. Bifurcation from a finite amplitude roll/streak\nequilibrium provides a direct route to the turbulent state through the S3T\nroll/streak instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2016 11:16:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 22:50:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 18:55:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

SSD models with this form are referred to as S3T models and\nself-sustain turbulence with a mean flow and second order perturbation\nstructure similar to that obtained by DNS. The use of a SSD model to study the\nphysical mechanisms underlying turbulence has advantages over the traditional\napproach of studying the dynamics of individual realizations of turbulence. One\nadvantage is that the analytical structure of SSD isolates and directly\nexpresses the interaction between the coherent mean flow and the incoherent\nperturbation components of the turbulence. Isolation of the interaction between\nthese components reveals how this interaction underlies both the maintenance of\nthe turbulence variance by transfer of energy from the externally driven flow\nto the perturbation components as well as the enforcement of the observed\nstatistical mean turbulent state by feedback regulation between the mean and\nperturbation fields. Another advantage of studying turbulence using SSD models\nis that the analytical structure of S3T turbulence can be completely\ncharacterized. For example, turbulence in the S3T system is maintained by a\nparametric growth mechanism. Furthermore, the equilibrium statistical state of\nthe turbulence can be demonstrated to be enforced by feedback regulation in\nwhich transient growth of the incoherent perturbations episodically suppresses\ncoherent streak growth preventing runaway parametric growth of the incoherent\nturbulent component. Using S3T to isolate these parametric growth and feedback\nregulation mechanisms allows a detailed characterization of the dynamics of the\nself-sustaining process in S3T turbulence with compelling implications for\nunderstanding the mechanism of wall-turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2016 11:22:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 05:58:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2017 13:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-28"}

We propose that a\ngeneral player model needs parameters for subjective experience of play,\nincluding: player psychology, game structure, and actions of play. Based on\nthis proposition, we pose three linked research questions: RQ1 what is a\nnecessary and sufficient foundation to a general player model?; RQ2 can such a\nfoundation improve performance of a computational intelligence- based player\nmodel?; and RQ3 can such a player model improve efficacy of adaptive artificial\nintelligence in games?\n  We set out the arguments behind these research questions in each of the three\nessays, presented as three preprints. The third essay, in this preprint,\npresents the argument that adaptive game artificial intelligence will be\nenhanced by a generalised player model. This is because games are inherently\nhuman artefacts which therefore, require some encoding of the human perspective\nin order to effectively autonomously respond to the individual player. The\nplayer model informs the necessary constraints on the adaptive artificial\nintelligence. A generalised player model is not only more efficient than a\nper-game solution, but also allows comparison between games which makes it a\nuseful tool for studying play in general.

We present here the original\nArabic text (MS Ankara, Saib 199) together with our translation and\ninterpretation: Abu Mashar reported that he had observed Venus in (or projected\nonto) the tail of a comet and concluded that the comet was behind Venus,\nbecause he had observed the extinction of Venus due to the cometary tail to be\nnegligible (light of Venus was unimpaired). He then concluded that the comet\nwould be located behind Venus. He also mentioned that others had observed\nJupiter and Saturn in cometary tails, so that those comets would even be\nlocated beyond those two outer planets - in the sphere of the stars. The dates\nof the observed close conjunctions were not mentioned; using known orbital\nelements for a few comets, we found a few close conjunctions between comets and\nplanets from A.D. 770 to 868, but we cannot be sure regarding which\nconjunctions were reported. While the argument of Abu Mashar is not correct (as\ncometary tails are optically thin), parts of the conclusion - namely that\ncomets are outside the Earth atmosphere and beyond the moon - is correct. This\nmay have helped Tycho Brahe to come to his revolutionary conclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2016 11:58:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-19"}

One of\nsuch solutions is Tunable Sparse Network Coding (TSNC), where only few packets\nare combined in each transmissions. The amount of data packets to be combined\nin each transmissions can be set from a density parameter/distribution, which\ncould be eventually adapted. In this work we present an analytical model that\ncaptures the performance of SNC on an accurate way. We exploit an absorbing\nMarkov process where the states are defined by the number of useful packets\nreceived by the decoder, i.e the decoding matrix rank, and the number of\nnon-zero columns at such matrix. The model is validated by means of a thorough\nsimulation campaign, and the difference between model and simulation is\nnegligible. A mean square error less than $4 \\cdot 10^{-4}$ in the worst cases.\nWe also include in the comparison some of more general bounds that have been\nrecently used, showing that their accuracy is rather poor.

To this end we present a detailed theoretical\nanalysis of dielectric tuning of WGMs supported in axisymmetric resonators.\nUsing the Bethe-Schwinger equation and adopting an angular spectrum field\nrepresentation we study the resonance shift and mode broadening of high $Q$\nWGMs when a planar dielectric substrate is brought close to the resonator.\nParticular focus is given to use of a uniaxial substrate with an arbitrarily\naligned optic axis.

Under some specific\nconfigurations for planet 9, this precession can explain the current tilt of\napproximately 6 degrees between the invariant plane of the giant planets and\nthe solar equator. An analytical model is developed to map the evolution of the\ninclination of the inner giant planets' invariant plane as a function of the\nplanet 9's mass, inclination, eccentricity and semimajor axis, and some\nnumerical simulations of the equations of motion of the giant planets and\nplanet 9 are performed to validate our analytical approach.

Our primary focus is on the case where $k$ is\neither a constant or a slowly growing function of $n$ (e.g. $O(\\log n)$ or\n$n^{o(1)}$). Our problems can be interpreted as a special case of three general\nclasses of problems that have been studied separately (balanced graph\npartitioning, Hypergraph Vertex Cover (HVC), and fixed parameter tractability\n(FPT)).\n  Our main result is an $O(\\log k)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-Vertex\nSeperator that runs in time $2^{O(k)} n^{O(1)}$, and an $O(\\log\nk)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-Edge Separator that runs in time\n$n^{O(1)}$. Our result on $k$-Edge Seperator improves the best previous graph\npartitioning algorithm for small $k$. Our result on $k$-Vertex Seperator\nimproves the simple $(k+1)$-approximation from HVC.

With\nadditional ideas from FPT algorithms and graph theory, we present an $O(\\log\nk)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-Path Transversal that runs in time\n$2^{O(k^3 \\log k)} n^{O(1)}$. Previously, the existence of even $(1 -\n\\delta)k$-approximation algorithm for fixed $\\delta > 0$ was open.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2016 15:15:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-19"}

When translated to the description of\nthe black hole interior, this implies that the fine-grained quantum information\nof infalling matter is rapidly diffused across the entire interior while\nclassical observables and coarse-grained geometry remain unaffected. Under the\nassumption that information has diffused throughout the interior, we consider\nthe difficulty of the information-theoretic task that an observer must perform\nafter crossing the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole in order to\nverify a violation of monogamy of entanglement. We find that the time required\nto complete a necessary subroutine of this task, namely the decoding of Bell\npairs from the interior and the late radiation, takes longer than the maximum\namount of time that an observer can spend inside the black hole before hitting\nthe singularity. Therefore, an infalling observer cannot observe monogamy\nviolation before encountering the singularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2016 15:50:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 20:40:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 20:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

One\nof most promising channels to look for their presence is through their\ngravitational interaction with compact objects. Within this context, in this\nthesis I study several mechanisms by which bosonic fields may affect the\ndynamics and structure of black holes and neutron stars. The first part of the\nthesis is devoted to the study of massive spin-2 fields around spherically\nsymmetric black-hole spacetimes. Massive spin-2 fields can be consistently\ndescribed within theories of massive gravity, making it possible to perform a\nsystematic study of the propagation of these fields in curved spacetimes. In\nparticular, I show that due to the presence of additional degrees of freedom in\nthese theories, the structure of black-hole solutions is richer than in General\nRelativity. In the second part of the thesis, I discuss in detail superradiant\ninstabilities in the context of black-hole physics. I show that several\nmechanisms, such as massive bosonic fields and magnetic fields, can turn\nspinning black holes unstable against superradiant modes, which has important\nimplications for astrophysics and for physics beyond the Standard Model. In the\nlast part of this thesis, I present a study of how bosonic dark matter\ncondensates interact gravitationally with compact stars. In particular, I show\nthat stable stellar configurations formed by a perfect fluid and a bosonic\ncondensate exist and can describe the late stages of dark matter accretion onto\nstars, in dark matter rich environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2016 15:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-19"}

Here based on\nproperties of magnetars and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), we address \"Gamma-HFGWs\"\n(with very high-frequency around 10^{20}Hz) caused by ultra-strong EM\nradiations (in the radiation-dominated phase of GRBs fireball) interacting with\nsuper-high magnetar surface magnetic fields (around 10^{11}Tesla). By certain\nparameters of distance and power, the Gamma-HFGWs would have far field energy\ndensity around 10^{-6}, and they would cause perturbed signal EM waves of\naround 10^{-20}Watt/m^2 in planned HFGW detection system based on EM response\nto GWs. Specially, Gamma-HFGWs would possess distinctive envelopes with\ncharacteristic shapes depending on the particular structures of surface\nmagnetic fields of magnetars, which could be exclusive features helpful to\ndistinguish them from background noise. Results obtained suggest that magnetars\ncould involve in possible astrophysical EM sources of GWs in very\nhigh-frequency band, and Gamma-HFGWs would be potential targets for\nobservations in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2016 21:48:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2017 07:45:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 19:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-20"}
