For a discrete-time quantum walk searching a graph for\na marked vertex, however, additional marked vertices can make the search harder\nby causing the system to approximately begin in a stationary state, so the\nsystem fails to evolve. In this paper, we completely characterize the\nstationary states, or 1-eigenvectors, of the quantum walk search operator for\ngeneral graphs and configurations of marked vertices by decomposing their\namplitudes into uniform and flip states. This infinitely expands the number of\nknown stationary states and gives an optimization procedure to find the\nstationary state closest to the initial uniform state of the walk. We further\nprove theorems on the existence of stationary states, with them conditionally\nexisting if the marked vertices form a bipartite connected component and always\nexisting if non-bipartite. These results utilize the standard oracle in\nGrover's algorithm, but we show that a different type of oracle prevents\nstationary states from interfering with the search algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2016 16:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2016 18:59:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-30"}

Hence computing the least solution\nof tilde_Eq(DB) is equivalent to computing M_DB specified by DB.

Such corruption limits the performance of\nimaging or communication schemes. One may then ask the question: is there an\noptimal way of encoding a signal so as to counteract the corruption by the\nmedium? In the ideal situation the answer is given by time reversal: for a\ngiven target or focusing point, in a first step let the target emit a signal\nand then record the signal transmitted to the source antenna, time reverse this\nand use it as the source trace at the source antenna in a second step. This\nsource will give a sharply focused wave at the target location if the source\naperture is large enough. Here we address this scheme in the more practical\nsituation with a limited aperture, time-harmonic signal, and finite-sized\nelements in the source array. Central questions are then the focusing\nresolution and signal-to-noise ratio at the target, their dependence on the\nphysical parameters, and the capacity to focus selectively in the neighborhood\nof the target point and therefore to transmit images.

In particular, the LIGO detectors are most sensitive to\nsources above North America and the Indian Ocean and, as the Earth rotates, the\nsensitive regions are swept across the sky. However, because the detectors do\nnot acquire data uniformly over time, there is a net bias on detectable\nsources' right ascensions. Both LIGO detectors preferentially collect data\nduring their local night; it is more than twice as likely to be local midnight\nthan noon when both detectors are operating. We discuss these selection effects\nand how they impact LIGO's observations and electromagnetic follow-up. Beyond\ngalactic foregrounds associated with seasonal variations, we find that\nequatorial observatories can access over $80\\%$ of the localization\nprobability, while mid-latitudes will access closer to $70\\%$.

Here, we predict a new formula for crossing probabilities of a continuum\nlimit loop-gas model on a planar lattice inside a $2N$-sided polygon. In this\nmodel, boundary loops exit and then re-enter the polygon through its vertices,\nwith exactly one loop passing once through each vertex, and these loops join\nthe vertices pairwise in some specified connectivity through the polygon's\nexterior. The boundary loops also connect the vertices through the interior,\nwhich we regard as a crossing event.

This paper addresses the problem of\nconstructing MDS vector codes which enable exact reconstruction of each code\nblock by downloading small amount of information from the remaining code\nblocks. The repair bandwidth of a code measures the information flow from the\nremaining code blocks during the reconstruction of a single code block.

In the current work we\nhave prepared epitaxial thin films of Sr$_{0.94}$NbO$_{3+{\\delta}}$ and found\nthat the bandgap of this material is ~4.1 eV, which is very large. Surprisingly\nthe carrier density of the conducting phase reaches 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-3}$, which\nis only one order smaller than that of elemental metals and the carrier\nmobility is only 2.47 cm$^2$/(V$\\cdot$s). Contrary to earlier reports, the\nvisible light absorption at 1.8 eV (~688 nm) is due to the bulk plasmon\nresonance, arising from the large carrier density, instead of an interband\ntransition. Excitation of the plasmonic resonance results in a multifold\nenhancement of the lifetime of charge carriers. Thus we propose that the hot\ncharge carriers generated from decay of plasmons produced by optical absorption\nis responsible for the water splitting efficiency of this material under\nvisible light irradiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2016 07:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-20"}

We present labels of size\n$1/4\\log^2n+o(\\log^2n)$, matching (up to low order terms) the recent\n$1/4\\log^2n-O(\\log n)$ lower bound [ICALP'16].\n  Prior to our work, all distance labeling schemes for trees could be\nreinterpreted as universal trees. A tree $T$ is said to be universal if any\ntree on $n$ nodes can be found as a subtree of $T$. A universal tree with $|T|$\nnodes implies a distance labeling scheme with label size $\\log |T|$. In 1981,\nChung et al. proved that any distance labeling scheme based on universal trees\nrequires labels of size $1/2\\log^2 n-\\log n\\cdot\\log\\log n+O(\\log n)$. Our\nscheme is the first to break this lower bound, showing a separation between\ndistance labeling and universal trees.\n  The $\\Theta(\\log^2 n)$ barrier has led researchers to consider distances\nbounded by $k$. The size of such labels was improved from $\\log n+O(k\\sqrt{\\log\nn})$ [WADS'01] to $\\log n+O(k^2(\\log(k\\log n))$ [SODA'03] and then to $\\log\nn+O(k\\log(k\\log(n/k)))$ [PODC'07]. We show how to construct labels whose size\nis $\\min\\{\\log n+O(k\\log((\\log n)/k)),O(\\log n\\cdot\\log(k/\\log n))\\}$. We\ncomplement this with almost tight lower bounds of $\\log n+\\Omega(k\\log(\\log\nn/(k\\log k)))$ and $\\Omega(\\log n\\cdot\\log(k/\\log n))$. Finally, we consider\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate distances. We show that the labeling scheme of\n[ICALP'16] can be easily modified to obtain an $O(\\log(1/\\varepsilon)\\cdot\\log\nn)$ upper bound and we prove a $\\Omega(\\log(1/\\varepsilon)\\cdot\\log n)$ lower\nbound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2016 12:30:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 May 2017 18:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

At the same time, it underwent a\nstrong increase of X-ray flux by one order of magnitude with respect to\narchival measurements. We characterise the X-ray spectral and timing properties\nof NGC 2617 with the aim of studying the physics of a changing-look active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN). We performed a comprehensive timing and spectral\nanalysis of two XMM-Newton pointed observations spaced by one month,\ncomplemented by archival quasi-simultaneous INTEGRAL observations. We found\nthat, to the first order, NGC 2617 looks like a type 1 AGN in the X-ray band\nand, with the addition of a modest reflection component, its continuum can be\nmodelled well either with a power law plus a phenomenological blackbody, a\npartially covered power law, or a double Comptonisation model. Independent of\nthe continuum adopted, in all three cases a column density of a few $10^{23}$\ncm$^{-2}$ of neutral gas covering 20-40\\% of the continuum source is required\nby the data. Most interestingly, absorption structures due to highly ionised\niron have been detected in both observations with a redshift of about $0.1c$\nwith respect to the systemic redshift of the host galaxy. The redshifted\nabsorber can be ascribed to a failed wind/aborted jets component, to\ngravitational redshift effects, and/or to matter directly falling towards the\ncentral supermassive black hole. In either case, we are probing the innermost\naccretion flow around the central supermassive black hole of NGC 2617 and might\nbe even watching matter in a direct inflow towards the black hole itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2016 15:48:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 16:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}
