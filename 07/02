In this paper we\nstudy the explicit counting of degrees of freedom arising from vector\nmultiplets associated to strings suspended between the D3 branes probing the\nS-fold. We propose that, for trivial discrete torsion, there is no vector\nmultiplet associated to $(1,0)$ strings stretched between a brane and its\nimage. We then focus on the case of rank 2 $\\mathcal{N}=3$ theory that enhances\nto $SU(3)$ $\\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM, explicitly spelling out the isomorphism between\nthe BPS-spectrum of the manifestly $\\mathcal{N}=3$ theory and that of three D3\nbranes in flat spacetime. Subsequently, we consider 3-pronged strings in these\nsetups and show how wall-crossing in the S-fold background implies wall\ncrossing in the flat geometry. This can be considered a consistency check of\nthe \\emph{conjectured} SUSY enhancement. We also find that the above\nisomorphism implies that a $(1,0)$ string, suspended between a brane and its\nimage in the S-fold, corresponds to a 3-string junction in the flat geometry.\nThis is in agreement with our claim on the absence of a vector multiplet\nassociated to such $(1,0)$ strings. This is because the 3-string junction in\nflat geometry gives rise to a $1/4$-th BPS multiplet of the $\\mathcal{N}=4$\nalgebra.

A multilevel framework is presented for solving such l1\nregularized sparse optimization problems efficiently. We take advantage of the\nexpected sparseness of the solution, and create a hierarchy of problems of\nsimilar type, which is traversed in order to accelerate the optimization\nprocess. This framework is applied for solving two problems: (1) the sparse\ninverse covariance estimation problem, and (2) l1-regularized logistic\nregression. In the first problem, the inverse of an unknown covariance matrix\nof a multivariate normal distribution is estimated, under the assumption that\nit is sparse. To this end, an l1 regularized log-determinant optimization\nproblem needs to be solved. This task is challenging especially for large-scale\ndatasets, due to time and memory limitations. In the second problem, the\nl1-regularization is added to the logistic regression classification objective\nto reduce overfitting to the data and obtain a sparse model. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate the efficiency of the multilevel framework in\naccelerating existing iterative solvers for both of these problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2016 16:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-04"}

It\nwas found that phosphorene could accommodate up to one Li per P atom (i.e.,\nLi16P16), and the predicted theoretical value of the Li capacity for a single\nlayered phosphorene can reach about 865 mAh/g. Our experimental measurement on\nthe Li capacity for a network of a few layered phosphorene can reach a\nreversible stable value of ~ 453 mAh/g even after 50 cycles. In particular, it\nwas found that, even at the high Li concentration (e.g., x = 1 in LixP), there\nwas no Li clustering and the structure of phosphorene is reversible during the\nlithium intercalation. Our results clearly show that phosphorene has promise as\na novel anode material for high performance Li-ion batteries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2016 17:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-04"}

The planet host\nHATS-19 is a slightly evolved V = 13.0 G0 star with [Fe/H] = 0.240, a mass of\n1.303 Msun, and a radius of 1.75 Rsun. HATS-19b is in an eccentric orbit (e =\n0.30) around this star with an orbital period of 4.5697 days and has a mass of\n0.427 Mjup and a highly inflated radius of 1.66 Rjup. The planet HATS-20b has a\nSaturn-like mass and radius of 0.273 Mjup and 0.776 Rjup respectively. It\norbits the V = 13.8 G9V star HATS-20 (Ms = 0.910 Msun; Rs = 0.892 Rsun) with a\nperiod of 3.7993 days.

With the addition of these three very\ndifferent planets to the growing sample of hot-Saturns, we re-examine the\nrelations between the observed giant planet radii, stellar irradiation, and\nhost metallicity.

To assess the relative influence of various\nphysical parameters on observed planet radii, we train and fit models using\nRandom Forest regression. We find that for hot-Saturns (0.1 < Mp < 0.5 Mjup),\nthe planetary mass and equilibrium temperature play dominant roles in\ndetermining radii. For hot-Jupiters (0.5 < Mp < 2.0 Mjup), the most important\nparameter is equilibrium temperature alone.

Even\nwhen the two mechanisms predict different manners in which the stellar spins\nand orbits are aligned, subsequent internal or external interactions can drive\nmultiple systems towards or away from alignment thus masking their formation\nprocess. Here, we demonstrate that the geometrical and dynamical relationship\nbetween the binary system and its surrounding bulk envelope provide the crucial\ndistinction between fragmentation models. We find that the circumstellar disks\nof the binary protostellar system L1551 IRS 5 are closely parallel not just\nwith each other but also with their surrounding flattened envelope.\nMeasurements of the relative proper motion of the binary components spanning\nnearly 30 yr indicate an orbital motion in the same sense as the envelope\nrotation. Eliminating orbital solutions whereby the circumstellar disks would\nbe tidally truncated to sizes smaller than are observed, the remaining\nsolutions favor a circular or low-eccentricity orbit tilted by up to\n$\\sim$25$^\\circ$ from the circumstellar disks. Turbulence-driven fragmentation\ncan generate local angular momentum to produce a coplanar binary system, but\nwhich bears no particular relationship with its surrounding envelope. Instead,\nthe observed properties conform with predictions for rotationally-driven\nfragmentation. If the fragments were produced at different heights or on\nopposite sides of the midplane in the flattened central region of a rotating\ncore, the resulting protostars would then exhibit circumstellar disks parallel\nwith the surrounding envelope but tilted from the orbital plane as is observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2016 17:28:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

We found that the\nexperimental turning point from double-layer to pseudocapacitive charge storage\nat low scan rates could be explained by the hydrogen adsorption at low\ncoverage. As the electrode voltage becomes more negative, H coverage increases\nand causes the surface structure change, leading to bended OH bonds at the\non-top oxygen atoms and large capacitance. This H coverage-dependent\ncapacitance can explain the high pseudocapacitance of hydrous RuO2. Our work\nhere provides a first principles understanding of the pseudocapacitance for\nRuO2 in particular and for transition-metal oxides in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2016 18:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-05"}

The bound, wide DWD HS 2220$+$2146\n($a\\approx500$ AU) does not conform to this picture: the more massive WD is the\nyounger, hotter of the pair. We show that this discrepancy is unlikely to be\ndue to past mass-transfer phases or to the presence of an unresolved companion.\nInstead, we propose that HS 2220$+$2146 formed through a new wide DWD\nevolutionary channel involving the merger of the inner binary in a hierarchical\ntriple system. The resulting blue straggler and its wide companion then evolved\nindependently, forming the WD pair seen today.

Recently, probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) by B\\\"ocherer et\nal. has been introduced for capacity approaching and rate-adaptive\ncommunication with a bitwise-demapper and binary decoder. Previous work by the\nauthors considered the optimization of protograph based LDPC codes for PAS and\nspecific spectral efficiencies (SEs) to jointly optimize the LDPC code node\ndegrees and the mapping of the coded bits to the bit-interleaved coded\nmodulation (BICM) bit-channels.

Notably, a satisfactory\ndescription of the confinement of gluons is not at our disposal so far. In this\nthesis, the RGZ framework, designed to provide a proper quantization of YM\ntheories by taking into account the existence of the so-called Gribov copies is\nexplored. Successfully introduced in the Landau gauge, the RGZ set up does not\nextend easily to different gauges. The main reason is that a clear formulation\nof the analogue of the Gribov horizon in the Landau gauge is obstructed by\ntechnical difficulties when more sophisticated gauges are chosen. Moreover, the\nRGZ action breaks BRST symmetry explicitly, making the task of extracting gauge\ninvariant results even more difficult. The main goal of the present thesis is\nprecisely to provide a consistent framework to extend the RGZ action to gauges\nthat are connected to Landau gauge via a gauge parameter. Our main result is\nthe reformulation of the theory in the Landau gauge with appropriate variables\nsuch that a non-perturbative BRST symmetry is constructed. This symmetry\ncorresponds to a deformation of the standard BRST symmetry by taking into\naccount non-perturbative effects. This opens a toolbox which allow us to\nexplore what would be the Gribov horizon in different gauges as linear\ncovariant and Curci-Ferrari gauges. Consistency with gauge independence of\nphysical quantities as well as the computation of the gluon propagator in these\ngauges is provided. Remarkably, when lattice or functional methods results are\navailable, we verify very good agreement with our analytical proposal giving\nsupport that it could provide some insights about the non-perturbative regime\nof YM theories.

We determine the magnetic\nsusceptibility of the Hubbard model from simultaneous measurements of the\nin-situ density of both spin components. At half-filling and strong\ninteractions our data approach the Heisenberg model of localized spins with\nantiferromagnetic correlations. Moreover, we observe the disappearance of\nmagnetic correlations when the system is doped away from half-filling. Our\nobservation of the dependence of quantum magnetism on doping paves the way for\nfuture studies on the emergence of pseudogap and pairing phenomena away from\nhalf-filling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2016 20:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

For global optimization, we consider Simulated\nAnnealing (SA), Particle Swarm (PS) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), which rely\nsolely on objective function evaluations; i.e., they do not evaluate the\ngradient in the objective function. By employing early stopping criteria for\nthe global optimization methods, a pseudo-optimum point is obtained. This is\nsubsequently utilized as the initial value by the deterministic Implicit\nFiltering method (IF), which is able to find local extrema in non-smooth\nfunctions, to finish the search in a narrow domain. These new hybrid techniques\ncombining global optimization and Implicit Filtering address difficulties\nassociated with the non-smooth response, and their performances are shown to\nsignificantly decrease the computational time over the global optimization\nmethods alone. To quantify uncertainties associated with the source location\nand intensity, we employ the Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis (DRAM) and\nDiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithms. Marginal\ndensities of the source properties are obtained, and the means of the chains'\ncompare accurately with the estimates produced by the hybrid algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2016 21:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-05"}

Most traditional person identification systems rely on\nlearning a static model on tediously labeled training data. Though labeling\nmanually is an indispensable part of a supervised framework, for a large scale\nidentification system labeling huge amount of data is a significant overhead.\nFor large multi-sensor data as typically encountered in camera networks,\nlabeling a lot of samples does not always mean more information, as redundant\nimages are labeled several times.

To help determine its true nature, we\nobtained infrared spectra of IRAS 19312+1950 in the range 5-550 $\\mu$m using\nthe Herschel and Spitzer space observatories. The Herschel PACS maps exhibit a\ncompact, slightly asymmetric continuum source at 170 $\\mu$m, indicative of a\nlarge, dusty circumstellar envelope. The far-IR CO emission line spectrum\nreveals two gas temperature components: $\\approx0.22M_{\\odot}$ of material at\n$280\\pm18$ K, and $\\approx1.6M_{\\odot}$ of material at $157\\pm3$ K.

The HIFI observations display shocked, high-velocity gas with\noutflow speeds up to 90 km s$^{-1}$ along the line of sight.

In light\nof this reclassification, IRAS 19312+1950 becomes only the 5th high-mass\nprotostar known to exhibit SiO maser activity, and demonstrates that 18 cm OH\nmaser line ratios may not be reliable observational discriminators between\nevolved stars and YSOs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2016 23:09:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

Spatial sparse coding\nalgorithms ($L1$ Regularized Learning and K-SVD) would impose local\nspecialization and a discouragement of multitasking, where the total observed\nactivity in a single voxel originates from a restricted number of possible\nbrain networks.\n  The assumptions of independence, positivity, and sparsity to encode\ntask-related brain networks are compared; the resulting brain networks for\ndifferent constraints are used as basis functions to encode the observed\nfunctional activity at a given time point.

This is indeed the case with\nthe model of Avellaneda and Stoikov (2008), which has been studied extensively.\nWe consider here this model under the condition when the underlying price is\nmean reverting. Our main result is that when time is far from the terminal, the\noptimal price for bid and ask limit orders is constant, which means that it\ndoes not track the underlying price. Numerical simulations confirm this\nbehavior. When the underlying price is mean reverting, then for times\nsufficiently far from terminal, it is more advantageous to focus on the mean\nprice and ignore fluctuations around it. Mean reversion suggests that limit\norders will be executed with some regularity, and this is why they are optimal.\nWe also explore intermediate time regimes where limit order prices are\ninfluenced by the inventory of outstanding orders.

In this paper, the problem of AoA estimation in\nRician flat fading channel under jamming condition is investigated. We consider\nthe scenario in which a receiver with multiple antenna is trying to estimate\nthe AoA of the specular line of sight (LOS) component of signal received from a\ngiven single antenna transmitter using a predefined training sequence. A jammer\nequipped with multiple antennas is trying to interrupt the AoA estimation phase\nby sending an arbitrary signal.

In\nall scenarios, we derive the optimal jammer signal design as well as its\noptimal power allocation policy. The results show the optimality of the\ntraining based Maximum Likelihood (ML) AoA estimator in case of randomly\ngenerated jamming signal. We also show that, the optimal jammer strategy is to\nemit a signal identical to the predefined training sequence turning the\nestimation process into a highest power competition scenario in which the\ndetected AoA is the one for the transmitting entity of higher power.

In such a system, secret sharing scheme is widely adopted, in\nwhich secret data are split into multiple pieces and stored in each server. To\nreconstruct them, the data owner should gather plural pieces. Shamir's (k,\nn)-threshold scheme, in which the data are split into n pieces (shares) for\nstorage and at least k pieces of them must be gathered for reconstruction,\nfurnishes information theoretic security, that is, even if attackers could\ncollect shares of less than the threshold k, they cannot get any information\nabout the data, even with unlimited computing power. Behind this scenario,\nhowever, assumed is that data transmission and authentication must be perfectly\nsecure, which is not trivial in practice. Here we propose a totally information\ntheoretically secure distributed storage system based on a user-friendly\nsingle-password-authenticated secret sharing scheme and secure transmission\nusing quantum key distribution, and demonstrate it in the Tokyo metropolitan\narea.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2016 05:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-05"}

These\nelectronic control units (ECUs) communicate with each other in an in-vehicle\nnetwork that makes the vehicle both safer and easier to drive. Controller Area\nNetworks (CANs) are the current standard for such high quality in-vehicle\ncommunication. Unfortunately, however, CANs do not currently offer protection\nagainst security attacks. In particular, they do not allow for message\nauthentication and hence are open to attacks that replay ECU messages for\nmalicious purposes. Applying the classic cryptographic method of message\nauthentication code (MAC) is not feasible since the CAN data frame is not long\nenough to include a sufficiently long MAC to provide effective authentication.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel identification method, which works in the\nphysical layer of an in-vehicle CAN network. Our method identifies ECUs using\ninimitable characteristics of signals enabling detection of a compromised or\nalien ECU being used in a replay attack. Unlike previous attempts to address\nsecurity issues in the in-vehicle CAN network, our method works by simply\nadding a monitoring unit to the existing network, making it deployable in\ncurrent systems and compliant with required CAN standards. Our experimental\nresults show that the bit string and classification algorithm that we utilized\nyielded more accurate identification of compromised ECUs than any other method\nproposed to date.

Here, we report a novel method to produce\nsuch structures by cloning the 3D shape of nectar drops, found widely in\nnature, using conventional soft lithography.The elementary process involves\ntransfer of a thin patch of the sugar solution coated on a glass slide onto a\nhydrophobic substrate on which this patch evolves into a microdroplet. Upon the\nabsorption of water vapor, such a microdroplet grows linearly with time and its\nfinal size can be controlled by varying its exposure time to water vapor. At\nany stage of the evolution of the size of the drop, its shape can be cloned\nonto a soft elastomer by following the well-known methods of molding and\ncrosslinking the same. A unique new science that emerges in our attempt to\nunderstand the transfer of the sugar patch and its evolution to a spherical\ndrop is the elucidation of the mechanics underlying the contact of a deformable\nsphere against a solid support intervening a thin liquid film. A unique aspect\nof this work is to demonstrate that higher level structures can also be\ngenerated by transferring even smaller nucleation sites on the surface of the\nprimary lenses and then allowing them to grow by absorption of water vapor.\nWhat results at the end is either a well-controlled distribution of smooth\nhemispherical lenses or compound structures that could have potential\napplications in the fundamental studies of contact mechanics, wettability and\neven in optics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2016 13:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-05"}

Conventionally, the loop-back signal at the FD\nrelay is treated as harmful self-interference and needs to be significantly\nsuppressed via both analog- and digital-domain cancellation. However, the\nperformance of the conventional self-interference cancellation approach is\nfundamentally limited due to the quantization error induced by the\nanalog-to-digital converter (ADC) with limited dynamic range. In this paper, we\nconsider an analog filter-and-forward design to help avoid the quantization\nerror, and surprisingly show that the maximum achievable rate of such an FD-FF\nrelay system is in fact regardless of the loop-back channel at the FD relay. We\ncharacterize the maximum achievable rate of this channel by jointly optimizing\nthe transmit power allocation over frequency at the source and the frequency\nresponse of the filter at the relay, subject to their individual power\nconstraints. Although this problem is non-convex, we obtain its optimal\nsolution by applying the Lagrange duality method. By simulations it is shown\nthat the proposed joint source and relay optimization achieves rate gains over\nother heuristic designs, and is also advantageous over the conventional\napproach by cancelling the relay loop-back signal as self-interference,\nespecially when the residual self-interference after cancellation is still\nsignificant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2016 13:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-05"}

Approximate joint triangularizers\nare commonly used in the estimation of the joint eigenstructure of a set of\nmatrices, with applications in signal processing, linear algebra, and tensor\ndecomposition. By assuming the input matrices to be perturbations of\nnoise-free, simultaneously diagonalizable ground-truth matrices, the\napproximate joint triangularizers are expected to be perturbations of the exact\njoint triangularizers of the ground-truth matrices. We provide a priori and a\nposteriori perturbation bounds on the `distance' between an approximate joint\ntriangularizer and its exact counterpart.

Since this theory is hard to find in literature, we have included a\ncomplete treatment in the paper.\n  In the second part of the paper, we study $\\mathbf{Z}_p$-extensions of a\nlocal field $K=k((T))$ of characteristic $p>0$ where $k$ is a finite field.\nLocal class field theory and Artin-Schreier-Witt theory give us the Schmid-Witt\nsymbol $$[\\ ,\\ ): W(K)/\\wp W(K) \\times \\widehat{K^*} \\to\nW(\\mathbf{F}_p)=\\mathbf{Z}_p,$$ which contains the ramification information of\n$\\mathbf{Z}_p$-extensions of $K$. We present a new simplified formula for $[\\\n,\\ )$. This formula allows one to compute ramification groups, conductors and\ndiscriminants in an easy way.\n  In the third part, we study $\\mathbf{Z}_p$-extensions of global function\nfields over a finite field. First, we give a formula for computing the genus in\nsuch a tower. We show that a previously obtained lower bound for the genus\ngrowth in a $\\mathbf{Z}_p$-extension is incorrect and we give a sharp lower\nbound. We also study when the genus behaves in a `stable' way. Finally, we find\nunique representatives of $\\mathbf{Z}_p$-extensions of the rational function\nfield $k(X)$, and compute the genus in such a tower.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2016 15:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-05"}

EVEREST employs a variant of pixel level decorrelation\n(PLD) to remove systematics introduced by the spacecraft's pointing error and a\nGaussian process (GP) to capture astrophysical variability. We apply EVEREST to\nall K2 targets in campaigns 0-7, yielding light curves with precision\ncomparable to that of the original Kepler mission for stars brighter than $K_p\n\\approx 13$, and within a factor of two of the Kepler precision for fainter\ntargets. We perform cross-validation and transit injection and recovery tests\nto validate the pipeline, and compare our light curves to the other de-trended\nlight curves available for download at the MAST High Level Science Products\narchive. We find that EVEREST achieves the highest average precision of any of\nthese pipelines for unsaturated K2 stars. The improved precision of these light\ncurves will aid in exoplanet detection and characterization, investigations of\nstellar variability, asteroseismology, and other photometric studies. The\nEVEREST pipeline can also easily be applied to future surveys, such as the TESS\nmission, to correct for instrumental systematics and enable the detection of\nlow signal-to-noise transiting exoplanets. The EVEREST light curves and the\nsource code used to generate them are freely available online.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2016 15:41:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}
