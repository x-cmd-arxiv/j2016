To date, it is unclear what their physical origins are. Here, we\npresent a multi-instrument investigation of the nature of QPP during the\nimpulsive and decay phases of the X1.0 flare of 28 October 2013. We focus on\nthe character of the fine structure pulsations evident in the soft X-ray time\nderivatives and compare this variability with structure across multiple\nwavelengths including hard X-ray and microwave emission. We find that during\nthe impulsive phase of the flare, high correlations between pulsations in the\nthermal and non-thermal emissions are seen. A characteristic timescale of ~20s\nis observed in all channels and a second timescale of ~55s is observed in the\nnon-thermal emissions. Soft X-ray pulsations are seen to persist into the decay\nphase of this flare, up to 20 minutes after the non-thermal emission has\nceased. We find that these decay phase thermal pulsations have very small\namplitude and show an increase in characteristic timescale from ~40s up to\n~70s. We interpret the bursty nature of the co-existing multi-wavelength QPP\nduring the impulsive phase in terms of episodic particle acceleration and\nplasma heating. The persistent thermal decay phase QPP are most likely\nconnected with compressive MHD processes in the post-flare loops such as the\nfast sausage mode or the vertical kink mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2016 18:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

Consequently, the physical properties of these systems just above\nor below the dynamical glass transition, such as viscosity, can change by many\norders of magnitude over long periods of time following external perturbation.\nDuring this progress towards equilibrium, glassy systems exhibit a history\ndependence that has complicated their study. In previous work, we bridged the\ngap between structure and dynamics in glassy liquids above their dynamical\nglass transition temperatures by introducing a scalar field called \"softness\",\na quantity obtained using machine learning methods. Softness is designed to\ncapture the hidden patterns in relative particle positions that correlate\nstrongly with dynamical rearrangements of particle positions. Here we show that\nthe out-of-equilibrium behavior of a model glassforming system can be\nunderstood in terms of softness. To do this we first demonstrate that the\nevolution of behavior following a temperature quench is a primarily structural\nphenomenon: the structure changes considerably, but the relationship between\nstructure and dynamics remains invariant. We then show that the\nhistory-dependent relaxation time can be robustly computed from structure as\nquantified by softness. Together, these results motivate the use of softness to\ncharacterize the history dependence of glasses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2016 19:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

We\ndemonstrate that in general quark states do not tend to get very broad if their\ncoupling to the continuum increases, but instead they decouple from the latter\nin the large coupling limit. We ascribe this effect to the essentially\nnonperturbative unitarization procedure involved. In the meantime, some quark\nresonances behave very differently and demonstrate collectivity in the sense\nthat their pole trajectories span a wide, as compared to the level spacing,\nregion therefore acquiring contributions from multiple bare poles rather than\nfrom the closest neighbors. While the actual calculations are done within\nparticular, very simplified models, it is argued that the findings might well\nbe general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2016 20:18:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 06:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-15"}

To address this problem, we propose a kinematic-layout-aware\nrandom forest which takes into account the kinematic-layout (\\ie layout and\nskeletons), to maximize the discriminative power of depth image appearance. We\nintegrate the kinematic-layout in the split criteria of random forests to guide\nthe learning process by 1) determining the switch to either the depth\nappearance or the kinematic-layout information, and 2) implicitly closing the\ngap between two distributions obtained by the kinematic-layout and the\nappearance, when the kinematic-layout appears useful.

Recent advances in observing and\nmanipulating charge and heat transport at the nanoscale, and recently developed\ntechniques for monitoring temperature at high temporal and spatial resolution,\nimply the need for considering electron transfer across thermal gradients.\nHere, a theory is developed for the rate of electron transfer and the\nassociated heat transport between donor-acceptor pairs located at sites of\ndifferent temperatures. To this end, through application of a generalized\nmultidimensional transition state theory, the traditional Arrhenius picture of\nactivation energy as a single point on a free energy surface is replaced with a\nbithermal property that is derived from statistical weighting over all\nconfigurations where the reactant and product states are equienergetic. The\nflow of energy associated with the electron transfer process is also examined,\nleading to relations between the rate of heat exchange among the donor and\nacceptor sites as functions of the temperature difference and the electronic\ndriving bias. In particular, we find that an open electron transfer channel\ncontributes to enhanced heat transport between sites even when they are in\nelectronic equilibrium. The presented results provide a unified theory for\ncharge transport and the associated heat conduction between sites at different\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2016 08:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-26"}

While the ESWF\nmakes use of an empirical relation between the coronal hole area observed in\nSolar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) images and\nsolar wind properties at the near-Earth environment, the WSA model establishes\na link between properties of the open magnetic field lines extending from the\nphotosphere to the corona and the background solar wind conditions. We found\nthat both solar wind models are capable of predicting the large-scale features\nof the observed solar wind speed (root-mean-square error, RMSE $\\approx$ 100\nkm/s) but tend to either overestimate (ESWF) or underestimate (WSA) the number\nof high-speed solar wind streams (threat score, TS $\\approx$ 0.37). The\npredicted high-speed streams show typical uncertainties in the arrival time of\nabout 1 day and uncertainties in the speed of about 100 km/s. General\nadvantages and disadvantages of the investigated solar wind models are\ndiagnosed and outlined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2016 14:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

As motivation for this study, we calculate the variance in the\ncapture time of a random walker by a single interior trap and determine this\nquantity to be comparable in magnitude to the mean. This implies that the mean\nis not necessarily reflective of typical capture times and that the full\ndensity must be determined. To solve the underlying diffusion equation, the\nmethod of Laplace transforms is used to obtain an elliptic problem of modified\nHelmholtz type. In the limit of vanishing trap sizes, each trap is represented\nas a Dirac point source which permits the solution of the transform equation to\nbe represented as a superposition of Helmholtz Green's functions.

In\nthis paper, we propose a new model of electroencephalogram (EEG) background\nperiodograms, based on a family of functions which we call generalized van der\nZiel--McWhorter (GVZM) power spectral densities (PSDs). To the best of our\nknowledge, the GVZM PSD function is the only EEG noise model which has\nrelatively few parameters, matches recorded EEG PSD's with high accuracy from 0\nHz to over 30 Hz, and has approximately $1/f^\\theta$ behavior in the\nmid-frequencies without infinities. $Methods$: We validate this model using\nthree approaches. First, we show how GVZM PSDs can arise in population of ion\nchannels in maximum entropy equilibrium. Second, we present a class of mixed\nautoregressive models, which simulate brain background noise and whose\nperiodograms are asymptotic to the GVZM PSD. Third, we present two real-time\nestimation algorithms for steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)\nfrequencies, and analyze their performance statistically. $Results$: In\npairwise comparisons, the GVZM-based algorithms showed statistically\nsignificant accuracy improvement over two well-known and widely-used SSVEP\nestimators. $Conclusion$: The GVZM noise model can be a useful and reliable\ntechnique for EEG signal processing. $Significance$: Understanding EEG noise is\nessential for EEG-based neurology and applications such as real-time\nbrain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which must make accurate control decisions\nfrom very short data epochs.
