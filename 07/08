Recent analysis demonstrated that this\napproach provides a satisfactory description of the experimental data for the\ninclusive hadron production in $pp/pA/AA$ collisions. However, these studies\nare based on the fixed coupling $k_T$ - factorization formula, which does not\ntake into account the running coupling corrections, which are important to set\nthe scales present in the cross section. In this paper we consider the running\ncoupling corrected $k_T$ - factorization formula conjectured some years ago and\ninvestigate the impact of the running coupling corrections on the observables.\nIn particular, the pseudorapidity distributions and charged hadrons\nmultiplicity are calculated considering $pp$, $dAu/pPb$ and $AuAu/PbPb$\ncollisions at RHIC and LHC energies. We compare the corrected running coupling\npredictions with those obtained using the original $k_T$ - factorization\nassuming a fixed coupling or a prescription for the inclusion of the running of\nthe coupling. Considering the Kharzeev - Levin - Nardi unintegrated gluon\ndistribution and a simplified model for the nuclear geometry, we demonstrate\nthat the distinct predictions are similar for the pseudorapidity distributions\nin $pp/pA/AA$ collisions and for the charged hadrons multiplicity in $pp/pA$\ncollisions. On the other hand, the running coupling corrected $k_T$ -\nfactorization formula predicts a smoother energy dependence for $dN/d\\eta$ in\n$AA$ collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 16:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

However, it still\nremains challenging in bridging the semantic gap between visual features and\ntheir underlying semantics and transferring knowledge to semantic categories\nunseen during learning. Unlike most of the existing zero-shot visual\nrecognition methods, we propose a stagewise bidirectional latent embedding\nframework to two subsequent learning stages for zero-shot visual recognition.\nIn the bottom-up stage, a latent embedding space is first created by exploring\nthe topological and labeling information underlying training data of known\nclasses via a proper supervised subspace learning algorithm and the latent\nembedding of training data are used to form landmarks that guide embedding\nsemantics underlying unseen classes into this learned latent space. In the\ntop-down stage, semantic representations of unseen-class labels in a given\nlabel vocabulary are then embedded to the same latent space to preserve the\nsemantic relatedness between all different classes via our proposed\nsemi-supervised Sammon mapping with the guidance of landmarks. Thus, the\nresultant latent embedding space allows for predicting the label of a test\ninstance with a simple nearest-neighbor rule. To evaluate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed framework, we have conducted extensive experiments on four\nbenchmark datasets in object and action recognition, i.e., AwA, CUB-200-2011,\nUCF101 and HMDB51.

For the assumed boundary conditions (cylindrical solid\nwith a non wetting top plane and a wettable side wall) solid and the liquid\nphases can coexist within a certain temperature range.

However, their\npractical applications have been hindered by an unusually large voltage\nhysteresis between charge and discharge voltage-profiles and the consequent low\nenergy efficiency (< 80%). The physical origins of such hysteresis are rarely\nstudied and poorly understood. Here we employ in situ X-ray absorption\nspectroscopy (XAS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),\ndensity-functional-theory (DFT) calculations, and galvanostatic intermittent\ntitration technique (GITT) to first correlate the voltage profile of iron\nfluoride ($FeF_3$), a representative conversion electrode material, with\nevolution and spatial distribution of intermediate phases in the electrode. The\nresults reveal that, contrary to conventional belief, the phase evolution in\nthe electrode is symmetrical during discharge and charge. However, the spatial\nevolution of the electrochemically active phases, which is controlled by\nreaction kinetics, is different. We further propose that the voltage hysteresis\nin the $FeF_3$ electrode is kinetic in nature. It is the result of Ohmic\nvoltage drop, reaction overpotential, and different spatial distributions of\nelectrochemically-active phases (i.e. compositional inhomogeneity). Therefore,\nthe large hysteresis can be expected to be mitigated by rational design and\noptimization of material microstructure and electrode architecture to improve\nthe energy efficiency of lithium-ion batteries based on conversion chemistry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 19:13:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-08"}

In this context, even the\nunlikely idea that astrophysical black holes may have significant charge is\nworth exploring, and here we present results from the simulation of weakly\ncharged black holes as they orbit and merge. Our simulations suggest that a\nblack hole binary with mass comparable to that observed in GW150914 could\nproduce the level of electromagnetic luminosity observed by Fermi GBM\n($10^{49}$ ergs/s) with a non-dimensional charge of $q \\equiv Q/M = 10^{-4}$\nassuming good radiative efficiency.

The\nRayleigh-Jeans approximation to the dust spectrum biases the fitted dust\nspectral index by Delta beta_d = 0.2 and the inflationary B-mode amplitude by\nDelta r = 0.03.

To date global models of Jovian have neglected\nthe presence of the different ion species as well as the tilted nature of the\ndipole axis. This paper reports the results of the first multi-fluid global\nmodeling of these effects in a single self-consistent study for processes\noccurring in the outer magnetosphere. In the inner magnetosphere the model\ndensities are shown to be comparable to observed densities with much of the\ndensity variables due to the wobble. The wobble enables plasma to be\ntransported to higher latitudes and then centrifugal acceleration leads to\nradial transport of the plasma. At the interface between the middle and outer\nmagnetosphere, the wobble produces a sinusoidal modulation of the plasma\nproperties, which yields at a fixed observing point two density peaks, each\nwith the planetary period. However, because of solar wind forcing and the fast\nrotation of Jupiter, torques are exerted on the outer magnetospheric plasma\nsuch that the azimuthal speed between the southern and northern hemispheres are\nunequal. This leads to the asymmetric square wave modulation of the plasma\nproperties in the outer magnetosphere such that only one density peak is seen\neach planetary period in the outer magnetosphere. This differential speed leads\nto reconnection in the tail at the planetary period and enhanced ejection of\nplasma down the tail at the planetary period. These processes could explain the\nperiodicity seen in the New Horizons' data without the need for invoking\narbitrary solar wind conditions. The energetic particles generated by these\nprocesses are shown to map to the arc-like structures seen in the dusk side\nauroral features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 20:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-11"}

One of the main challenges in the\ncrowd-labeling task is to control for or determine in advance the proportion of\nlow-quality/malicious labelers. If that proportion grows too high, there is\noften a phase transition leading to a steep, non-linear drop in labeling\naccuracy as noted by Karger et al. [2014]. To address these challenges, we\npropose a new framework called Expert Label Injected Crowd Estimation (ELICE)\nand extend it to different versions and variants that delay phase transition\nleading to a better labeling accuracy. ELICE automatically combines and boosts\nbulk crowd labels supported by labels from experts for limited number of\ninstances from the dataset. The expert-labels help to estimate the individual\nability of crowd labelers and difficulty of each instance, both of which are\nused to aggregate the labels. Empirical evaluation shows the superiority of\nELICE as compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

This essay argues that to make real progress in\nmitigating future climate change, this status quo must be challenged both\nintellectually and practically. First, it proposes to acknowledge and address\nthe inconsistency between the objectives of a climate regime and the role of\ntransparency as a mean to achieve these objectives. It does so by redefining\ntransparency as the addition of publicity and measurability, which turns it\ninto a credible information generating mechanism for governance. Second, it\nshows how in practice, a global monitoring system of greenhouse gas net\nemissions, based on this new definition of transparency and designed as a\nglobal public good, could provide the necessary knowledge to help frame\ngovernance solutions by providing both credibility and completeness in\nunderstanding the scope of the problem to solve.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 22:57:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-11"}

It is assumed that the\nfluid obeys a Newtonian rheology and Fourier's law of thermal transport with\nconstant, uniform (dynamic) viscosity and thermal conductivity in a uniform\ngravity field. Top and bottom boundaries are maintained at different constant\ntemperatures and we consider here boundary conditions of zero tangential stress\nand impermeable walls. Under these conditions, and with the Boussinesq\napproximation, Rayleigh (1916) first obtained analytically the critical value\n27pi^4/4 for a dimensionless parameter, now known as the Rayleigh number, at\nthe onset of convection. This manuscript describes the changes of the critical\nRayleigh number due to the compressibility of the fluid, measured by the\ndimensionless dissipation parameter D and due to a finite temperature\ndifference between the hot and cold boundaries, measured by a dimensionless\ntemperature gradient a. Different equations of state are examined: ideal gas\nequation, Murnaghan's model and a generic equation of state, which can\nrepresent any possible equation of state. We also consider two variations of\nthis stability analysis. In a so-called quasi-Boussinesq model, we consider\nthat density perturbations are solely due to temperature perturbations. In a\nso-called quasi-anelastic liquid approximation, we consider that entropy\nperturbations are solely due to temperature perturbations. In addition to the\nnumerical Chebyshev-based stability analysis, an analytical approximation is\nobtained when temperature fluctuations are written as a combination of only two\nmodes.

The magnetic field\nlines in the outer acceleration region (OAR) are connected to the neutron star\nsurface (NSS). If copious electron--positron pairs are produced near the NSS,\nsuch pairs flow into the OAR and screen the electric field there. To activate\nthe OAR, the electromagnetic cascade due to the electric field near the NSS\nshould be suppressed. However, since a return current is expected along the\nfield lines through the OAR, the outflow extracted from the NSS alone cannot\nscreen the electric field just above the NSS. In this paper, we analytically\nand numerically study the electric-field screening at the NSS taking into\naccount the effects of the back-flowing particles from the OAR. In certain\nlimited cases, the electric field is screened without significant pair cascade\nif only ultrarelativistic particles ($\\gamma\\gg1$) flow back to the NSS. On the\nother hand, if electron--positron pairs with a significant number density and\nmildly relativistic temperature, expected to distribute in a wide region of the\nmagnetosphere, flow back to the NSS, these particles adjust the current and\ncharge densities, so that the electric field can be screened without pair\ncascade. We obtain the condition for the number density of particles to screen\nthe electric field at the NSS.

As\ndemonstrated by these studies, the equilibrium solutions of the system are\nseparated into two branches: the flux rope sticks to the photosphere for\nsolutions at the lower branch but is suspended in the corona for those at the\nupper branch. Moreover, a solution originally at the lower branch jumps to the\nupper, as the related control parameter increases and reaches a critical value,\nand the associated jump is here referred to as upward catastrophe. The present\npaper advances these studies in three aspects. First, the magnetic field is\nchanged to be force-free. The system still experiences an upward catastrophe\nwith an increase in each control parameter. Secondly, under the force-free\napproximation, there also exists a downward catastrophe, characterized by a\njump of a solution from the upper branch to the lower. Both catastrophes are\nirreversible processes connecting the two branches of equilibrium solutions so\nas to form a cycle. Finally, the magnetic energy in the numerical domain is\ncalculated. It is found that there exists a magnetic energy release for both\ncatastrophes. The Amp\\`{e}re's force, which vanishes everywhere for force-free\nfields, appears only during the catastrophes and does a positive work, which\nserves as a major mechanism for the energy release. The implications of the\ndownward catastrophe and its relevance to solar activities are briefly\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2016 02:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-11"}

The existence of large-scale isotropic inhomogeneities affects the\ndetermination of the cosmological parameters. In particular, from only the\ndistance-redshift relation, we can not dis- tinguish the inhomogeneous\nisotropic universe model from the homogeneous isotropic one, because of the\nambiguity in the cosmological parameters. In this paper, in order to avoid such\nambiguity, we consider three observables, the distance-redshift relation, the\nfluctuation spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation(CMBR) and the\nscale of the baryon acoustic oscillation(BAO), and compare these observables in\ntwo universe models; One is the inhomogeneous isotropic uni- verse model with\nthe cosmological constant and the other is the homogeneous isotropic universe\nmodel with the dark energy other than the cosmological constant. We show that\nthese two universe models can not predict the same observational data of all\nthree observables but the same ones of only two of three, as long as the\nperturbations are adiabatic.

Such analyses cover important applications, e.g.\nresource usage. Examining all traces is well known to be intractable and\ntherefore traditional algorithms reason over an over-approximated set.\nTypically, inaccuracy arises due to inclusion of infeasible paths in this set.\nThus path-sensitivity is one cure. However, there is another reason for the\ninaccuracy: that the cost model, i.e., the way in which the analysis of each\ntrace is quantified, is dynamic. That is, the cost of a trace is dependent on\nthe context in which the trace is executed. Thus the goal of accurate analysis,\nalready challenged by path-sensitivity, is now further challenged by\ncontext-sensitivity.\n  In this paper, we address the problem of quantitative analysis defined over a\ndynamic cost model. Our algorithm is an \"anytime\" algorithm: it generates an\nanswer quickly, but if the analysis resource budget allows, it progressively\nproduces better solutions via refinement iterations. The result of each\niteration remains sound, but importantly, must converge to an exact analysis\nwhen given an unlimited resource budget. In order to be scalable, our algorithm\nis designed to be incremental.

Here, we consider the clinical development of biosimilars\nincluding their evaluation in patients rather than healthy volunteers under a\nsituation where both PK and efficacy parameters are required to demonstrate the\nequivalence. To avoid the risk associated with the failure to confirm\nequivalence, incorporating the new PK trial for PK equivalence within the PK\nportion, which is the early stage for the efficacy part, and sample size\nre-calculation for the efficacy equivalence are considered in the proposed\nmethod. This proposal provides appealing advantages such as a shorter period,\nadditional cost saving, and smaller number of patients required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2016 09:30:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 10:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

For antiferromagnetic coupling, we\nfound that the density drives first-order superfluid-Mott insulator transitions\nfor even and odd lobes. Ferromagnetic Mott insulator and superfluid states were\nobtained with a ferromagnetic coupling, and a tendency to a \"long-range\" order\nwas observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2016 10:36:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 21:25:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-19"}

RISC-V was designed\nas a very small ISA to support a wide range of implementations, and has a less\nmature compiler toolchain. However, we observe that on SPEC CINT2006 RV64G\nexecutes on average 16% more instructions than x86-64, 3% more instructions\nthan IA-32, 9% more instructions than ARMv8, but 4% fewer instructions than\nARMv7.\n  CISC x86 implementations break up complex instructions into smaller internal\nRISC-like micro-ops, and the RV64G instruction count is within 2% of the x86-64\nretired micro-op count. RV64GC, the compressed variant of RV64G, is the densest\nISA studied, fetching 8% fewer dynamic instruction bytes than x86-64.

Combining the\ncompressed RISC-V ISA extension with macro-op fusion provides both the densest\nISA and the fewest dynamic operations retired per program, reducing the\nmotivation to add more instructions to the ISA. This approach retains a single\nsimple ISA suitable for both low-end and high-end implementations, where\nhigh-end implementations can boost performance through microarchitectural\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2016 11:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-11"}

Existing simulations have shown that $\\alpha$-values a\nfew times $10^{-4}$ can be generated. The particle growth in the early planet\nformation phase is determined by the dynamics of dust particles. Here, we\naddress in particular the efficiency of VSI-turbulence in concentrating\nparticles in order to generate overdensities and low collision velocities. We\nperform 3D numerical hydrodynamical simulations of accretion discs around young\nstars that include radiative transport and irradiation from the central star.\nThe motion of particles within a size range of a fraction of mm up to several m\nis followed using standard drag formula. We confirm that under realistic\nconditions the VSI is able to generate turbulence in full 3D protoplanetary\ndiscs. The irradiated disc shows turbulence within 10 to 60au. The mean radial\nmotion of the gas is such that it is directed inward near the midplane and\noutward in the surface layers. We find that large particles drift inward with\nthe expected speed, while small particles can experience phases of outward\ndrift. Additionally, the particles show bunching behaviour with overdensities\nreaching 5 times the average value, which is strongest for dimensionless\nstopping times around unity. Particles in a VSI-turbulent discs are\nconcentrated in large scale turbulent eddies and show low relative speeds that\nallow for growing collisions. The reached overdensities will also allow for the\nonset streaming instabilities further enhancing particle growth. The outward\ndrift for small particles at higher disk elevations allows for the transport of\nprocessed high temperature material in the Solar System to larger distances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2016 11:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

When deploying the learned cost maps,\nthe trajectories generated not only replicate human-like driving behaviour but\nare also demonstrably robust against systematic errors in putative robot\nconfiguration. To achieve this we deploy a Maximum Entropy based, non-linear\nIRL framework which uses Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs) to\nrepresent the cost model underlying expert driving behaviour.

This spectral flow is defined\nas an integer which counts the difference between the number of eigenvalues of\nthe Dirac operator family that flow from negative to non-negative and the\nnumber of eigenvalues that flow from non-negative to negative. Since the bulk\nstates of the insulator are completely gapped and the ground state is assumed\nbeing no more degenerate except the Kramers, they do not contribute to the\nspectral flow and only edge states contribute to. The parity of the number of\nthe Kramers pairs of gapless edge states is exactly the same as that of the\nspectral flow. This reveals the origin of the edge-bulk correspondence, i.e.,\nwhy the edge states can be used to characterize the topological insulators.\nFurthermore, the spectral flow is related to the reduced eta-invariant and thus\ncounts both the discrete ground state degeneracy and the continuous gapless\nexcitations, which distinguishes the topological insulator from the\nconventional band insulator even if the edge states open a gap due to a strong\ninteraction between edge modes.

In a double-slit experiment, when do photons decide to\ntravel by one way or by two ways? Delayed choice experiments seem to indicate\nthat, strangely, it is possible to change the decision of the photons until the\nvery last moment before they are detected. This led Wheeler to his famous\nsentence: No elementary quantum phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is a\nregistered phenomenon, brought to a close by an irreversible act of\namplification. Nevertheless some authors wrote that backward in time effects\nwere needed to explain these results. I will show that in delayed choice\nexperiments involving only one particle, a simple explanation is possible\nwithout invoking any backward in time effect. Delayed choice experiments\ninvolving entangled particles such as the so called quantum eraser can also be\nexplained without invoking any backward in time effect but I will argue that\nthese experiments cannot be accounted for so simply because they rise the whole\nproblem of knowing what a measurement and a collapse are.

It has been\nrecently shown that pulses with these characteristics can be generated in the\nlaboratory [PRL 112, 213901 (2014)]. Through their permanent dipole moment,\nwater molecules are acted upon by the electric field and forced off their\npreferred hydrogen-bond network conformation.

We find that, in the bulk, the operation\nof these mechanisms is strongly dependent on the initial temperature and\ndensity of the system. In low density systems, the equilibration between\nrotational and translational modes is slow due to the lack of collisions\nbetween monomers. As the initial density of the system approaches 1~g/cm$^3$,\nequilibration between rotational and translational modes after the pulse\nbecomes more efficient. In turn, low temperatures hinder the direct energy\ntransfer from the pulse to rotational motion owing to the resulting stiffness\nof the hydrogen bond network.

The magnetic topology contains an\nX-line. We aim to contribute to the overall understanding of MHD wave\npropagation within inhomogeneous media, specifically around X-lines. We\ninvestigate the linearised, 3D MHD equations under the assumptions of ideal and\ncold plasma. We utilise the WKB approximation and Charpit's method during our\ninvestigation. It is found that the behaviour of the fast magnetoacoustic wave\nis entirely dictated by the local, inhomogeneous, equilibrium Alfv\\'en speed\nprofile. All parts of the wave experience refraction during propagation, where\nthe magnitude of the refraction effect depends on the location of an individual\nwave element within the inhomogeneous magnetic field. The X-line, along which\nthe Alfv\\'en speed is identically zero, acts as a focus for the refraction\neffect. There are two main types of wave behaviour: part of the wave is either\ntrapped by the X-line or escapes the system, and there exists a critical\nstarting region around the X-line that divides these two types of behaviour.\nFor the set-up investigated, it is found that $15.5\\%$ of the fast wave energy\nis trapped by the X-line. We conclude that linear, $\\beta=0$ fast\nmagnetoacoustic waves can accumulate along X-lines and thus these will be\nspecific locations of fast wave energy deposition and thus preferential\nheating. The work here highlights the importance of understanding the magnetic\ntopology of a system.

We incorporate\ninformation on prominent auxiliary explanatory factors of the data population\ninto existing architectures as secondary objective/loss blocks that take inputs\nfrom hidden layers during training. Once trained, these secondary circuits can\nbe removed to leave a model with the same architecture as the original, but\nmore generalizable and discerning thanks to its comprehension of data\ninteractions. Since pose is one of the most dominant confounding factors for\nobject recognition, we apply this principle to instantiate a pose-aware deep\nconvolutional neural network and demonstrate that auxiliary pose information\nindeed improves the classification accuracy in our experiments on SAR target\nclassification tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2016 15:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-11"}

Since the miners can hide newly\nmined nodes, they play a game with incomplete information. Here we consider two\nsimplified forms of this game in which the miners have complete information. In\nthe simplest game the miners release every mined block immediately, but are\nstrategic on which blocks to mine. In the second more complicated game, when a\nblock is mined it is announced immediately, but it may not be released so that\nother miners cannot continue mining from it. A miner not only decides which\nblocks to mine, but also when to release blocks to other miners.

The model accounts for water-table effects using the\nlinearised kinematic condition. The model also accounts for inertial effects in\nsource and observation wells. The primary objective of this work is to\ndemonstrate applicability of this semi-analytical model to multi-well and\nmulti-level pneumatic slug tests. The pneumatic perturbation was applied at\ndiscrete intervals in a source well and monitored at discrete vertical\nintervals in observation wells. The source and observation well pairs were\nseparated by distances of up to 4 m. The analysis yielded vertical profiles of\nhydraulic conductivity, specific storage, and specific yield at observation\nwell locations. The hydraulic parameter estimates are compared to results from\nprior pumping and single-well slug tests conducted at the site, as well as to\nestimates from particle size analyses of sediment collected from boreholes\nduring well installation. The results are in general agreement with results\nfrom prior tests and are indicative of a sand and gravel aquifer. Sensitivity\nanalysis show that model identification of specific yield is strongest at\nlate-time. However, the usefulness of late-time data is limited due to the low\nsignal-to-noise ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 19:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-19"}

The experimental studies show that coupling\nfactor 1 (CF1) from spinach chloroplasts has latent ATPase activity, which\nbecome expressed after heat-treatment and incubation with calcium. The\nsigmoidal kinetics observed on the competitive effect of glycerol on water\nsaturating a protein, suggests that the role of the hydration shell in the\ncatalytic mechanism of the CF1-ATPase, modify the number of water molecules\nassociated with the conformational turnover required for active site activity.\nIt is assume that the water associated to the hydrophilic state of the enzyme\nproduces a fit-in of the substrate to form (ES), follow by the catalytic action\nwith product formation (EP). This one induces the dissociation of water and\nincreases the hydrophobic attractions between R-groups. The latter, becomes the\nform of the enzyme interacting with water to form the dissociated free enzyme\n(E) and free product (P). Glycerol dependent suppression of the water dynamics\non two interacting sites configuration shows a change in the\nH-bond-configuration. The thermodynamics modeling requires an energy\nexpenditure of about 4kcal/mol per each H-bond in turnover. Glycerol determined\na turnover of 14 molecules of water released from the active sites to reach the\ninactive form of the enzyme. The entropy generated by turnover of the fit-in\nand -out substrate and product from the protein could be dissipated-out of the\nenzyme-water system itself. Coupling with the surrounding water clusters allows\nto recreate H-bonds. This should involve a decrease in the number of H-bonds\npresent in the clusters. These changes in the mass action capability of the\nwater clusters could eventually become dissipated through a cooling effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 21:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}
