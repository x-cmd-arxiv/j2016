A change in linear polarisation\nacross the H{\\alpha} line, is detected in all objects. Such a line effect\nreveals the fact that stellar photons are scattered off free electrons that are\nnot distributed in a spherically symmetric volume, suggesting the presence of\nsmall disks around these accreting objects. Thanks to the large wavelength\ncoverage, we can report that H{\\alpha} is the spectral line in the optical\nwavelength range that is most sensitive to revealing deviations from spherical\nsymmetry, and the one most likely to show a line effect across the polarisation\nin such cases. Few other spectral lines display changes in polarisation across\nthe line. In addition, H{\\alpha} is the only line which shows an effect across\nits absorption component in some sources. We present a scenario explaining this\nfinding and demonstrate that the detection of the line effect strongly relies\non the number of photons scattered into our line of sight. We highlight the\nspecial case of R Mon, which is the only object in our sample to show many\nlines with a polarisation effect, which is much stronger than in all other\nobjects.

One of the most\nimportant issues encountered when modeling bipartite networks is devising a way\nto obtain a (monopartite) projection on the layer of interest, which preserves\nas much as possible the information encoded into the original bipartite\nstructure. In the present paper we propose an algorithm to obtain\nstatistically-validated projections of bipartite networks, according to which\nany two nodes sharing a statistically-significant number of neighbors are\nlinked. Since assessing the statistical significance of nodes similarity\nrequires a proper statistical benchmark, here we consider a set of four null\nmodels, defined within the exponential random graph framework. Our algorithm\noutputs a matrix of link-specific p-values, from which a validated projection\nis straightforwardly obtainable, upon running a multiple hypothesis testing\nprocedure. Finally, we test our method on an economic network (i.e. the\ncountries-products World Trade Web representation) and a social network (i.e.\nMovieLens, collecting the users' ratings of a list of movies). In both cases\nnon-trivial communities are detected: while projecting the World Trade Web on\nthe countries layer reveals modules of similarly-industrialized nations,\nprojecting it on the products layer allows communities characterized by an\nincreasing level of complexity to be detected; in the second case, projecting\nMovieLens on the films layer allows clusters of movies whose affinity cannot be\nfully accounted for by genre similarity to be individuated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2016 18:22:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 22:34:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 21:01:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 16:42:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-18"}

We further demonstrate that the scrambling behavior of non-circular\nfibers is often complex and introduce a new metric to fully capture non-linear\nscrambling performance, leading to much lower scrambling gain values than are\ntypically reported in the literature (<1000 compared to 10,000 or more). We\nfind that scrambling gain measurements for small-core, non-circular fibers are\noften speckle dominated if the fiber is not agitated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2016 18:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

Current stellar atmosphere models fail to reproduce the\nobserved [OIV]25.9$\\mu m$/[OIII]88$\\mu m$ ratios, which are much higher when\ncompared to the predicted values. Finally, the ([NeIII]15.6$\\mu m$ +\n[NeII]12.8$\\mu m$)/([SIV]10.5$\\mu m$ + [SIII]18.7$\\mu m$) ratio is proposed as\na promising metallicity tracer to be used in obscured objects, where optical\nlines fail to accurately measure the metallicity. The diagnostic power of mid-\nto far-infrared spectroscopy shown here for local galaxies will be of crucial\nimportance to study galaxy evolution during the dust-obscured phase at the peak\nof the star formation and black-hole accretion activity ($1 < z < 4$). This\nstudy will be addressed by future deep spectroscopic surveys with present and\nforthcoming facilities such as JWST, ALMA, and SPICA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2016 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

When following a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\napproach to approximate the posterior distribution in this context, one\ntypically either uses MCMC schemes which target the joint posterior of the\nparameters and some auxiliary latent variables, or pseudo-marginal\nMetropolis--Hastings (MH) schemes. The latter mimic a MH algorithm targeting\nthe marginal posterior of the parameters by approximating unbiasedly the\nintractable likelihood. However, in scenarios where the parameters and\nauxiliary variables are strongly correlated under the posterior and/or this\nposterior is multimodal, Gibbs sampling or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) will\nperform poorly and the pseudo-marginal MH algorithm, as any other MH scheme,\nwill be inefficient for high dimensional parameters. We propose here an\noriginal MCMC algorithm, termed pseudo-marginal HMC, which combines the\nadvantages of both HMC and pseudo-marginal schemes. Specifically, the\npseudo-marginal HMC method is controlled by a precision parameter N,\ncontrolling the approximation of the likelihood and, for any N, it samples the\nmarginal posterior of the parameters.

Methods. From the disk model directly based\non the observations (here divided into the thin and thick stellar disks and the\nHI and H$_2$ disks subcomponents), we produce fitted mass models by combining\nthree Miyamoto-Nagai disk profiles of any \"model order\" (1, 2, or 3) for each\ndisk subcomponent.

A model which includes a ring density\nstructure in the disk, beyond the solar Galactic radius, is also investigated.\nResults. The Galactic mass models return very good matches to the imposed\nobservational constraints.

The proposed methods make use of\nthe fact that the background in each block is usually smoothly varying and can\nbe modeled well by a linear combination of a few smoothly varying basis\nfunctions, while the foreground text and graphics create sharp discontinuity.\nThe algorithms separate the background and foreground pixels by trying to fit\nbackground pixel values in the block into a smooth function using two different\nschemes. One is based on robust regression, where the inlier pixels will be\nconsidered as background, while remaining outlier pixels will be considered\nforeground. The second approach uses a sparse decomposition framework where the\nbackground and foreground layers are modeled with a smooth and sparse\ncomponents respectively. These algorithms have been tested on images extracted\nfrom HEVC standard test sequences for screen content coding, and are shown to\nhave superior performance over previous approaches.

A TI thin film differs from\nthe more typically studied thick TI system in that the former has both a top\nand a bottom surface where the states localized at both surfaces can couple to\neach other due to the finite thickness. In typical spin torque experiments on\nTI thin film systems, the top and bottom surfaces of the film are asymmetric as\nthe former is in contact with a ferromagnetic layer while the latter is\nadjacent to a non magnetic substrate. This may lead to differing (i) potentials\nand (ii) magnetization strengths experienced by the top and bottom surface\nstates. We show, via Kubo formula calculations, that each of these two effects\ncan lead to in-plane spin accumulation perpendicular to the magnetization\ndirection which are otherwise absent in a top-bottom symmetric TI thin film\nsystem.

Much of this comes in the form of linear features which are\nmost often assumed to be well aligned with the direction of the magnetic field\nin the low plasma beta regime thought to dominate the upper chromosphere. We\nuse advanced radiative MHD simulations including the effects of ion-neutral\ninteractions (using the generalized Ohm's law) in the partially ionized\nchromosphere to show that the magnetic field is often not well aligned with\nchromospheric features. This occurs where the ambipolar diffusion is large,\ni.e., ions and neutral populations decouple as the ion-neutral collision\nfrequency drops allowing the field to slip through the neutral population,\ncurrents perpendicular to the field are strong, and thermodynamic timescales\nare longer than or similar to the those of ambipolar diffusion. We find this\noften happens in dynamic spicule or fibril-like features at the top of the\nchromosphere. This has important consequences for field extrapolation methods\nwhich increasingly use such upper chromospheric features to help constrain the\nchromospheric magnetic field: our results invalidate the underlying assumption\nthat these features are aligned with the field. In addition, our results cast\ndoubt on results from 1D hydrodynamic models, which assume that plasma remains\non the same field lines.

In this\nproblem, the transmitter has to choose the transmit power based on the amount\nof stored energy in its battery with the goal of maximizing the average rate\nobtained over time. We model this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP)\nwith the transmitter as the agent, the battery status as the state, the\ntransmit power as the action and the rate obtained as the reward. The average\nreward maximization problem over the MDP can be solved by a linear program (LP)\nthat uses the transition probabilities for the state-action pairs and their\nreward values to choose a power allocation policy. Since the rewards associated\nthe state-action pairs are unknown, we propose two online learning algorithms:\nUCLP and Epoch-UCLP that learn these rewards and adapt their policies along the\nway. The UCLP algorithm solves the LP at each step to decide its current policy\nusing the upper confidence bounds on the rewards, while the Epoch-UCLP\nalgorithm divides the time into epochs, solves the LP only at the beginning of\nthe epochs and follows the obtained policy in that epoch.

However,\navailable methods for continuous instruments have important limitations: they\neither require restrictive parametric assumptions for identification, or else\nrely on modeling both the outcome and treatment process well (and require\nmodeling effect modification by all adjustment covariates). In this work we\ndevelop the first semiparametric doubly robust estimators of the local\ninstrumental variable effect curve, i.e., the effect among those who would take\ntreatment for instrument values above some threshold and not below. In addition\nto being robust to misspecification of either the instrument or\ntreatment/outcome processes, our approach also incorporates information about\nthe instrument mechanism and allows for flexible data-adaptive estimation of\neffect modification.

To measure a\nspin period change, MU Cam is a good candidate because it has a spin\noscillation with a large amplitude enabling measurements with high precision.\nFortunately, in the past the spin period of MU Cam was measured with high\nprecision. To measure the spin period anew, in 2014-2015 we performed extensive\nphotometric observations of MU Cam, spanning a total duration of 208 h within\n46 nights. We found that the spin, sideband and orbital periods are equal to\n1187.16245+/-0.00047 s, 1276.3424+/-0.0022 s and 4.71942+/-0.00016 h,\nrespectively.

During four nights in 2014 April-May MU Cam was fainter\nthan usual by 0.8 mag, and the amplitude of the sideband oscillation was five\ntimes larger, denoting significant fraction of disc-overflow accretion. The\nsideband oscillation showed a double-peaked pulse profile in the normal\nbrightness state. When the star brightness was decreased by 0.8 mag, the\nsideband oscillation showed a single-peaked pulse profile.

Inspired by the principle of majorization minimization, we\nrespectively present the unified frameworks and convergence analysis for the\nGauss-Seidel ADMMs and Jacobian ADMMs, which use different historical\ninformation for the current updating. Our frameworks further generalize\nprevious ADMMs to the ones capable of solving the problems with non-separable\nobjectives by minimizing their separable majorant surrogates. We also show that\nthe bound which measures the convergence speed of ADMMs depends on the\ntightness of the used majorant function. Then several techniques are introduced\nto improve the efficiency of ADMMs by tightening the majorant functions. In\nparticular, we propose the Mixed Gauss-Seidel and Jacobian ADMM (M-ADMM) which\nalleviates the slow convergence issue of Jacobian ADMMs by absorbing merits of\nthe Gauss-Seidel ADMMs. M-ADMM can be further improved by using backtracking,\nwise variable partition and fully exploiting the structure of the constraint.\nBeyond the guarantee in theory, numerical experiments on both synthesized and\nreal-world data further demonstrate the superiority of our new ADMMs in\npractice. Finally, we release a toolbox at https://github.com/canyilu/LibADMM\nthat implements efficient ADMMs for many problems in compressed sensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2016 08:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

In Galilean physics, the universality of free fall implies\nan inertial frame, which in turns implies that the mass m of the falling body\nis omitted. Otherwise, an additional acceleration proportional to m/M would\nrise either for an observer at the centre of mass of the system, or for an\nobserver at a fixed distance from the centre of mass of M. These elementary,\nbut overlooked, considerations fully respect the equivalence principle and the\nidentity of an inertial or a gravitational pull for an observer in the Einstein\ncabin. They value as fore-runners of the self-force and gauge dependency in\ngeneral relativity. The approximate nature of Galilei's law of free fall is\nexplored herein. When stepping into general relativity, we report how the\ngeodesic free fall into a black hole was the subject of an intense debate again\ncentred on coordinate choice. Later, we describe how the infalling mass and the\nemitted gravitational radiation affect the free fall motion of a body. The\ngeneral relativistic self-force might be dealt with to perfectly fit into a\ngeodesic conception of motion. Then, embracing quantum mechanics, real black\nholes are not classical static objects any longer. Free fall has to handle the\nHawking radiation, and leads us to new perspectives on the varying mass of the\nevaporating black hole and on the varying energy of the falling mass. Along the\npaper, we also estimate our findings for ordinary masses being dropped from a\nGalilean or Einsteinian Pisa-like tower with respect to the current state of\nthe art drawn from precise measurements in ground and space laboratories, and\nto the constraints posed by quantum measurements. The appendix describes how\neducation physics and high impact factor journals discuss the free fall.\nFinally, case studies conducted on undergraduate students and teachers are\nreviewed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2016 10:10:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}

We consider a\nrecently proposed extension of covariant Galileon models in the so-called\n\"beyond Horndeski\" scenario, where a breaking of the Vainshtein mechanism is\npossible and, thus, some peculiar observational signatures should be detectable\nand make it distinguishable from general relativity. We apply this model to a\nsample of clusters of galaxies observed under the \\textit{CLASH} survey, using\nboth new data from gravitational lensing events and archival data from X-ray\nintra-cluster hot gas observations. In particular, we use the latter to model\nthe gas density, and then use it as the only ingredient in the matter clusters'\nbudget to calculate the expected lensing convergence map.

Our derivation relies exclusively on the standard quantum\nmechanical update of the system state, through the evaluation of Gaussian\noverlaps. The parametrisation of the conditional dynamics we obtain is novel\nand, at variance with existing alternatives, directly ties in to physical\ndetection schemes.
