Traditional measures of habitat selection and habitat quality require\ndata from resource intensive study designs (e.g., telemetry or mark-recapture).\nOften, managers must evaluate ecological value despite only having data from\nless resource intensive study designs. In this paper, we use occupancy data to\nmeasure habitat quality and habitat selection response for the Puerto Rican\nVireo, an endemic songbird whose population growth is depressed by brood\nparasitism from the Shiny Cowbird. We were interested in how vireo habitat\nquality and vireo habitat selection varied among three land uses (forest,\nshaded coffee plantations, and sun coffee) in Puerto Rico. We estimated vireo\noccupancy probability as a measure of habitat selection, and the probability of\ncowbird occurrence given vireo presence as a measure of habitat quality. To\nestimate the latter, we explored different ways of modeling the occurrence of\nthe two species jointly, and compared these models to independent models using\nmeasures of predictive performance. Vireos preferentially selected forested\nsites and shaded coffee sites over sun coffee sites. By our measure of habitat\nquality, either type of coffee plantation was poor quality, and the forested\nsites were high quality. This suggests that shade coffee may be an ecological\ntrap for the vireo in our study area. One joint model performed best by our\nmeasures of predictive ability, thus showing that the cowbird may not occur\nindependently of the vireo. Vireo population dynamics in our study area may\nbenefit from having large amounts of forest relative to coffee plantations.\nIncorporating species interactions into occupancy models has the potential to\nimprove monitoring for conservation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2016 16:46:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-19"}

As tenants have limited budgets to satisfy their computing\nneeds, it is crucial for them to determine how to purchase different options\nand utilize them (in addition to possible self-owned instances) in a\ncost-effective manner while respecting their response-time targets. In this\npaper, we propose a framework to design policies to allocate self-owned,\non-demand and spot instances to arriving jobs.

Our policies rely on a\nsmall number of parameters and we use an online learning technique to infer\ntheir optimal values. Through numerical simulations, we show the effectiveness\nof our proposed policies, in particular that they achieve a cost reduction of\nup to 64.51% when spot and on-demand instances are considered and of up to\n43.74% when self-owned instances are considered, compared to previously\nproposed or intuitive policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2016 16:51:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2016 20:14:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 14:59:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 18:17:53 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2017 08:01:07 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 21 Jul 2018 18:43:14 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 2019 10:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

Momentum-space resolution is determined by the number of\nnon-hydrodynamic modes included in the moment hierarchy, i.e., by the\ntruncation order. We show that in the FLRW spacetime the non-hydrodynamic modes\ndecouple completely from the hydrodynamic degrees of freedom. This results in\nthe system flowing as an ideal fluid while at the same time producing entropy.\nThe solutions to the nonlinear Boltzmann equation exhibit transient tails of\nthe distribution function with nontrivial momentum dependence. The evolution of\nthis tail is not correctly captured by the relaxation time approximation nor by\nthe linearized Boltzmann equation. However, the latter probes additional\nhigh-momentum details unresolved by the relaxation time approximation. While\nthe expansion of the FLRW spacetime is slow enough for the system to move\ntowards (and not away from) local thermal equilibrium, it is not sufficiently\nslow for the system to actually ever reach complete local equilibrium.\nEquilibration is fastest in the relaxation time approximation, followed, in\nturn, by kinetic evolution with a linearized and a fully nonlinear Boltzmann\ncollision term.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2016 19:22:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 00:44:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

The detection was announced in February 2016, in time\nfor the hundredth anniversary of Einstein's prediction of GWs within the theory\nof general relativity (GR).

Proving a multi-mode\ngeneralization of de Palma et al.'s above mentioned result---i.e., given a\nlower bound on the von Neumann entropy of the input to an $n$-mode lossy\nthermal-noise bosonic channel, an $n$-mode product thermal state input\nminimizes the output entropy---will establish an important special case of the\nconjectured Entropy Photon-number Inequality (EPnI).

Here we describe an analytical procedure to forward model the signal of\nan exoplanet that accounts for both the observing strategy (angular and\nspectral differential imaging) and the data reduction method (Karhunen-Lo\\`eve\nImage Projection algorithm). We use this forward model to measure the position\nof an exoplanet in a Bayesian framework employing Gaussian processes and Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to account for correlated noise.

The\nbulge vertical [Fe/H] gradient, at ~0.5 dex/kpc, appears to be due to a\nchanging mixture of sub-populations (near +0.3 dex and -0.3 dex and one\npossibly near -0.7 dex) with latitude.

Unusual zig-zag abundance trends of\n[Cu/Fe] and [Na/Fe] suggest nucleosynthesis dominated by core-collapse\nsupernovae with metallicity-dependent yields, in the Type~Ia supernova\ntime-delay scenario. Thus, the bulge sub-population compositions resemble the\nlocal thin and thick disks, but at higher [Fe/H], suggesting a radial [Fe/H]\ngradient in both the thin and thick disks, within the solar circle, near -0.04\nto -0.05 dex/kpc. If the bulge was built through accretion of inner disk stars\nby a bar, it appears that the inner thin and thick disk stars, incorporated\ninto the bulge, retained vertical scale heights characteristic of their\nkinematic origin, and resulting in the vertical [Fe/H] gradient and [alpha/Fe]\ntrends seen today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2016 20:09:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2016 19:37:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 19:06:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2016 21:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

Polarized diffuse neutron measurements\nconfirm reports of short-range antiferromagnetic correlations and diffuse\nstreaks of scattering, but major diffuse features are explained as signatures\nof overlapping critical correlations between neighboring Brillouin zones.\nFinally, and critically, this paper presents detailed elastic and inelastic\nmeasurements of magnetic correlations in a single-crystal of MnAl2O4, which\nacts as an unfrustrated analogue to CoAl2O4. The unfrustrated material is shown\nto have a classical continuous phase transition to Neel order at T_N = 39 K,\nwith collective spinwave excitations and Lorentzian-like critical correlations\nwhich diverge at the transition. Direct comparison between the two compounds\nindicates that CoAl2O4 is unique, not in the nature of high-temperature diffuse\ncorrelations, but rather in the nature of the frozen state below T*.

The analysis of ten\norbits of observations of the EPIC/pn instrument show that the detection of\nflares in regions far outside the radiation belt is largely influenced by the\ndifferent orientation of the Earth's magnetosphere respect with XMM-Newton's\norbit, confirming the solar origin of the soft proton population. The Equator-S\nproton spectrum at 70000 km altitude is used for the proton population entering\nthe optics, where a combined multiple and Firsov scattering is used as physics\ninteraction.

The\nparticipants received positive and negative rewards for their correct and\nincorrect decisions, respectively. The stimulus was designed such that\ndecisions based on more accumulated information were more accurate but took\nlonger. Therefore, the total outcome that a participant could achieve during\nthe limited experiments' time depended on her \"decision threshold\", the amount\nof information she needed to make a decision. In the first experiment, two\ntypes of trials were intermixed randomly: hard and easy. Crucially, the hard\ntrials were associated with smaller positive and negative rewards than the easy\ntrials. A cue presented at the beginning of each trial would indicate the type\nof the upcoming trial. The optimal strategy was to adopt a small decision\nthreshold for hard trials. The results showed that several of the participants\ndid not learn this simple strategy. We then investigated how the participants\nadjusted their decision threshold based on the feedback they received in each\ntrial. To this end, we developed and compared 10 computational models for\nadjusting the decision threshold. The models differ in their assumptions on the\nshape of the decision thresholds and the way the feedback is used to adjust the\ndecision thresholds. The results of Bayesian model comparison showed that a\nmodel with time-varying thresholds whose parameters are updated by a\nreinforcement learning algorithm is the most likely model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2016 21:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

We\nconsider frictional and frictionless grains as well as presence and absence of\nacoustic vibrations. Our results suggest that at low and intermediate strain\nrates, persistent shear bands develop only in the absence of vibrations.\nVibrations tend to fluidize the granular network and de-localize slip at these\nrates. Stick-slip is only observed for frictional grains and it is confined to\nthe shear band. At high strain rates, stick-slip disappears and the different\nsystems exhibit similar stress-slip response. Changing the vibration intensity,\nduration or time of application alters the system response and may cause\nlong-lasting rheological changes. We analyse these observations in terms of\npossible transitions between rate strengthening and rate weakening response\nfacilitated by a competition between shear induced dilation and vibration\ninduced compaction.

Similar to\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM) or MIMO-OFDM, LSA can be also combined with OFDM to deal\nwith frequency selectivity in wireless channels. However, such combination\nsuffers from substantially increased complexity proportional to the number of\nantennas in LSA systems. For the conventional implementation of LSA-OFDM, the\nnumber of inverse fast Fourier transforms (IFFTs) increases with the antenna\nnumber since each antenna requires an IFFT for OFDM modulation. Furthermore,\nzero-forcing (ZF) precoding is required in LSA systems to support more users,\nand the required matrix inversion leads to a huge computational burden. In this\npaper, we propose a low-complexity recursive convolutional precoding to address\nthe issues above. The traditional ZF precoding can be implemented through the\nrecursive convolutional precoding in the time domain so that only one IFFT is\nrequired for each user and the matrix inversion can be also avoided.

In open human societies, a mutualistic relationship\narises when a native insider population attracts outsiders with benevolent\nincentives in hope that the additional labor will improve the standard of all.\nA lingering question, however, is the extent to which insiders are willing to\ntolerate outsiders before mutualism slips into antagonism. To test the\nassertion by Karl Popper that unlimited tolerance leads to the demise of\ntolerance, we model a society under a growing incursion from the outside.\nGuided by their traditions of maintaining the social fabric and prizing\ntolerance, the insiders reduce their benevolence toward the growing\nsubpopulation of outsiders but do not invoke punishment.

Although more tolerant insiders maintain some level of\nbenevolence, they may also tacitly support radicals out of fear for the future.\nIf radicals and their tacit supporters achieve a critical majority, herd\nbehavior ensues and the relation between the insider and outsider\nsubpopulations turns antagonistic. To control the risk of unwanted social\ndynamics, we map the parameter space within which the tolerance of insiders is\nin balance with the assimilation of outsiders, the tolerant insiders maintain a\nsustainable majority, and any reduction in benevolence occurs smoothly.

By studying the dynamic correlation functions, we find that\nfor every finite \\alpha two different behaviours can be identified, one typical\nof short-range systems and the other connected with locality violation. The\nlatter behaviour is shown related also with the known power-law decay tails\npreviously observed in the static correlation functions, and originated by\nmodes, having in general energies far from the minima of the spectrum, where\nparticular singularities develop as a consequence of the long-rangedness of the\nsystem. We refer to these modes as to \"singular\" modes, and as to \"singular\ndynamics\" to their dynamics. For the Kitaev model they are manifest, at finite\n\\alpha, in derivatives of the quasiparticle energy, the order of the derivative\nat which the singularity occurs increasing with \\alpha. The features of the\nsingular modes and their physical consequences are clarified by studying an\neffective theory for them and by a critical comparison of the results from this\ntheory with the lattice ones. Moreover, a numerical study of the effects of the\nsingular modes on the time evolution after various types of global quenches is\nperformed. We finally present and discuss the presence of singular modes and\ntheir consequences in interacting long-range systems by investigating in the\nlong-range Ising quantum chain, both in the deep paramagnetic regime and at\ncriticality, where they also play a central role for the breakdown of conformal\ninvariance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 00:05:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 10:40:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-14"}

Generally, the characterization of\nsuch curves, both in Euclidean ($E^3$) and in Lorentz-Minkowski ($E_1^3$)\nspaces, involves an ODE relating curvature and torsion. However, by equipping a\ncurve with a relatively parallel moving frame, Bishop was able to characterize\nspherical curves in $E^3$ through a linear equation relating the coefficients\nwhich dictate the frame motion. Here we apply these ideas to surfaces that are\nimplicitly defined by a smooth function, $\\Sigma=F^{-1}(c)$, by reinterpreting\nthe problem in the context of the metric given by the Hessian of $F$, which is\nnot always positive definite. So, we are naturally led to the study of curves\nin $E_1^3$. We develop a systematic approach to the construction of Bishop\nframes by exploiting the structure of the normal planes induced by the casual\ncharacter of the curve, present a complete characterization of spherical curves\nin $E_1^3$, and apply it to characterize curves that belong to a non-degenerate\nEuclidean quadric. We also interpret the casual character that a curve may\nassume when we pass from $E^3$ to $E_1^3$ and finally establish a criterion for\na curve to lie on a level surface of a smooth function, which reduces to a\nlinear equation when the Hessian is constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 01:17:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2016 23:09:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 05:48:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 04:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-18"}

In addition to cataclysmic events involving black holes, GWs can\nbe triggered by physical processes and systems involving neutron stars.\nProperties of neutron stars are largely determined by the equation of state\n(EOS) of neutron-rich matter, which is the major ingredient in calculating the\nstellar structure and properties of related phenomena, such as gravitational\nwave emission from elliptically deformed pulsars and neutron star binaries.\nAlthough the EOS of neutron-rich matter is still rather uncertain mainly due to\nthe poorly known density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy at high\ndensities, significant progress has been made recently in constraining the\nsymmetry energy using data from terrestrial nuclear laboratories. These\nconstraints could provide useful information on the limits of GWs expected from\nneutron stars. Here after briefly reviewing our previous work on constraining\ngravitational radiation from elliptically deformed pulsars with terrestrial\nnuclear laboratory data in light of the recent gravitational wave detection, we\nestimate the maximum gravitational wave strain amplitude, using an optimistic\nvalue for the breaking strain of the neutron star crust, for 15 pulsars at\ndistances 0.16 kpc to 0.91 kpc from Earth, and find it to be in the range of\n$\\sim[0.2-31.1]\\times 10^{-24}$, depending on the details of the EOS used to\ncompute the neutron star properties. Implications are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 02:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

Outcome tests, however, are known to suffer from the problem of\ninfra-marginality: even absent discrimination, the repayment rates for minority\nand white loan recipients might differ if the two groups have different risk\ndistributions. Thus, at least in theory, outcome tests can fail to accurately\ndetect discrimination. We develop a new statistical test of\ndiscrimination---the threshold test---that mitigates the problem of\ninfra-marginality by jointly estimating decision thresholds and risk\ndistributions via a hierarchical Bayesian latent variable model.

An\nimportant matter underpinning future algorithmic advancements is to develop a\nbetter understanding of the driving force behind successful multitask\nproblem-solving. In this regard, two (seemingly disparate) ideas have been put\nforward, namely, (a) implicit genetic transfer as the key ingredient\nfacilitating the exchange of high-quality genetic material across tasks, and\n(b) population diversification resulting in effective global search of the\nunified search space encompassing all tasks.

More concretely, the IHT approach\ntrains an SDNN through following two alternative phases: (I) perform hard\nthresholding to drop connections with small activations and fine-tune the other\nsignificant filters; (II)~re-activate the frozen connections and train the\nentire network to improve its overall discriminative capability. We verify the\nsuperiority of SDNNs in terms of efficiency and classification performance on\nfour benchmark object recognition datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,\nMNIST and ImageNet. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that IHT can be\napplied for training SDNN based on various CNN architectures such as NIN and\nAlexNet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 06:41:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

Using training data composed of both still images and artificially\nblurred data, CNN is encouraged to learn blur-insensitive features\nautomatically. Second, to enhance robustness of CNN features to pose variations\nand occlusion, we propose a Trunk-Branch Ensemble CNN model (TBE-CNN), which\nextracts complementary information from holistic face images and patches\ncropped around facial components.

However,\nmost existing works ignore such cross-layer heterogeneities when classifying\nsamples of different complexities. For example, if a training sample has\nalready been correctly classified at a specific layer with high confidence, we\nargue that it is unnecessary to enforce rest layers to classify this sample\ncorrectly and a better strategy is to encourage those layers to focus on other\nsamples.\n  In this paper, we propose a layer-wise discriminative learning method to\nenhance the discriminative capability of a deep network by allowing its layers\nto work collaboratively for classification. Towards this target, we introduce\nmultiple classifiers on top of multiple layers. Each classifier not only tries\nto correctly classify the features from its input layer, but also coordinates\nwith other classifiers to jointly maximize the final classification\nperformance. Guided by the other companion classifiers, each classifier learns\nto concentrate on certain training examples and boosts the overall performance.\nAllowing for end-to-end training, our method can be conveniently embedded into\nstate-of-the-art deep networks.

To this aim, our earlier\ncalculations for the radiative electron attachment (REA) rates for C4H-, C6H-,\nand C8H- are employed to generate the corresponding column density ratios of\nanion/neutral (A/N) relative abundances. The latter are then compared with\nthose obtained from observational measurements. The calculations involved the\ntime-dependent solutions of a large network of chemical processes over an\nextended time interval and included a series of runs in which the values of REA\nrates were repeatedly scaled. Macroscopic parameters for the clouds' modeling\nwere also varied to cover a broad range of physical environments. It was found\nthat, within the range and quality of the processes included in the present\nnetwork,and selected from state-of-the-art astrophysical databases, the REA\nvalues required to match the observed A/N ratios needed to be reduced by orders\nof magnitude for C4H- case, while the same rates for C6H- and C8H- only needed\nto be scaled by much smaller factors. The results suggest that the generally\nproposed formation of interstellar anions by REA mechanism is overestimated by\ncurrent models for the C4H- case, for which is likely to be an inefficient path\nto formation. This path is thus providing a rather marginal contribution to the\nobserved abundances of C4H-, the latter being more likely to originate from\nother chemical processes in the network, as we discuss in some detail in the\npresent work.Possible physical reasons for the much smaller differences against\nobservations found instead for the values of the (A/N) ratios in two other,\nlonger members of the series are put forward and analyzed within the\nevolutionary modeling discussed in the present work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 08:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

Our main\nmotivation is the widely accepted idea that the accretion-driven growth of\nsupermassive black holes (SMBHs) in protogalaxies is limited by quasar-mode\nfeedback and gas blow-out. The SMBH masses, $M_{\\rm{BH}}$, should then be\nconnected to the dark-matter potential wells at the redshift $z_{\\rm{qso}}$ of\nthe blow-out. We specifically consider the example of a power-law dependence on\nthe maximum circular speed in a protogalactic dark-matter halo:\n$M_{\\rm{BH}}\\propto V^4_{\\rm{d,pk}}$, as could be expected if quasar-mode\nfeedback were momentum-driven. For halos with a given $V_{\\rm{d,pk}}$ at a\ngiven $z_{\\rm{qso}}\\ge 0$, our model scaling relations give a typical stellar\nvelocity dispersion $\\sigma_{\\rm{ap}}(R_e)$ at $z=0$. Thus, they transform a\ntheoretical $M_{\\rm{BH}}$-$V_{\\rm{d,pk}}$ relation into a prediction for an\nobservable $M_{\\rm{BH}}$-$\\sigma_{\\rm{ap}}(R_e)$ relation.

In\nparticular, we wish to know under which conditions the cloud can be dispersed\nby feedback, which in turn can give us hints as to how feedback regulates the\nstar formation inside the cloud. We perform a suite of radiative\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of a 10^5 solar mass cloud with embedded\nsources of ionising radiation and supernovae, including multiple supernovae and\na hypernova model. A UV source corresponding to 10% of the mass of the cloud is\nrequired to disperse the cloud, suggesting that the star formation efficiency\nshould be on the order of 10%.

However, for focal-plane coronagraph, a\nsmall inner working angle comes necessarily at the cost of a high sensitivity\nto pointing errors. This is the reason why a pointing control system is\nimperative to stabilize the star on the vortex center against pointing drifts\ndue to mechanical flexures, that generally occur during observation due for\ninstance to temperature and/or gravity variations. We have therefore developed\na technique called QACITS (Quadrant Analysis of Coronagraphic Images for\nTip-tilt Sensing), which is based on the analysis of the coronagraphic image\nshape to infer the amount of pointing error. It has been shown that the flux\ngradient in the image is directly related to the amount of tip-tilt affecting\nthe beam. The main advantage of this technique is that it does not require any\nadditional setup and can thus be easily implemented on all current facilities\nequipped with a vortex phase mask. In this paper, we focus on the\nimplementation of the QACITS sensor at Keck/NIRC2, where an L-band AGPM has\nbeen recently commissioned (June and October 2015), successfully validating the\nQACITS estimator in the case of a centrally obstructed pupil. The algorithm has\nbeen designed to be easily handled by any user observing in vortex mode, which\nis available for science in shared risk mode since 2016B.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 09:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

In the clean\nlimit, superconductivity is formed only when the pairing interaction strength\nis greater than some critical value in these materials. Adding random chemical\npotential to the system promotes superconductivity by generating a finite\nfermionic density of states at the Fermi level. In three-dimensional Dirac\nsemimetal, the critical attraction strength is reduced by weak disorder, but\nremains finite. In the other two cases, superconductivity is induced by\narbitrarily weak attraction.

The procedure relies on\nthe methods described in Consolandi et al.

Examining automatically the profiles of 922\nface-on late-type galaxies (B/A >0.7) the procedure found that ~ 36 % are\nbarred. The local bar fraction strongly increases with stellar mass. The sample\nof barred galaxies is used to construct a set of template radial color profiles\nin order to test the impact of the barred galaxy population on the average\ncolor profiles shown by Consolandi et al.

The radial color profile of barred\ngalaxy shows that bars are on average redder than their surrounding disk\nproducing an outside-in gradient toward red in correspondence of their\ncorotation radius. The distribution of the extension of the deprojected length\nof the bar suggests that bars have strong impacts on the gradients of averaged\ncolor profiles. The dependence of the profiles on the mass is consistent with\nthe bar-quenching scenario, i.e. more massive barred galaxies have redder\ncolors (hence older stellar population and suppressed star formation) inside\ntheir corotation radius with respect to their lower mass counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 13:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

Leveraging that model, we motivate and\nintroduce a novel WIPT architecture relying on the superposition of\nmulti-carrier unmodulated and modulated waveforms at the transmitter. The\nsuperposed WIPT waveforms are optimized as a function of the channel state\ninformation so as to characterize the rate-energy region of the whole system.\nAnalysis and numerical results illustrate the performance of the derived\nwaveforms and WIPT architecture and highlight that nonlinearity radically\nchanges the design of WIPT.

Solving such equations using finite volumes or\nDiscontinuous Galerkin requires a numerical flux function which solves local\nRiemann problems at cell interfaces. There are various methods to express the\nnumerical flux function. On the one end, there is the robust but very diffusive\nLax-Friedrichs solver; on the other end the upwind Godunov solver which\nrespects all resulting waves. The drawback of the latter method is the costly\ncomputation of the eigensystem.\n  This work presents a family of simple first order Riemann solvers, named\nHLLX$\\omega$, which avoid solving the eigensystem. The new method reproduces\nall waves of the system with less dissipation than other solvers with similar\ninput and effort, such as HLL and FORCE. The family of Riemann solvers can be\nseen as an extension or generalization of the methods introduced by Degond et\nal. \\cite{DegondPeyrardRussoVilledieu1999}. We only require the same number of\ninput values as HLL, namely the globally fastest wave speeds in both\ndirections, or an estimate of the speeds. Thus, the new family of Riemann\nsolvers is particularly efficient for large systems of conservation laws when\nthe spectral decomposition is expensive to compute or no explicit expression\nfor the eigensystem is available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 14:01:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Aug 2017 22:31:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

We present an innovative artificial neural network (ANN) architecture,\ncalled Generative ANN (GANN), that computes the forward model, that is it\nlearns the function that relates the unknown outputs (stellar atmospheric\nparameters, in this case) to the given inputs (spectra). Such a model can be\nintegrated in a Bayesian framework to estimate the posterior distribution of\nthe outputs. Methods. The architecture of the GANN follows the same scheme as a\nnormal ANN, but with the inputs and outputs inverted. We train the network with\nthe set of atmospheric parameters (Teff, logg, [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe]),\nobtaining the stellar spectra for such inputs. The residuals between the\nspectra in the grid and the estimated spectra are minimized using a validation\ndataset to keep solutions as general as possible. Results. The performance of\nboth conventional ANNs and GANNs to estimate the stellar parameters as a\nfunction of the star brightness is presented and compared for different\nGalactic populations. GANNs provide significantly improved parameterizations\nfor early and intermediate spectral types with rich and intermediate\nmetallicities. The behaviour of both algorithms is very similar for our sample\nof late-type stars, obtaining residuals in the derivation of [Fe/H] and\n[alpha/Fe] below 0.1dex for stars with Gaia magnitude Grvs<12, which accounts\nfor a number in the order of four million stars to be observed by the Radial\nVelocity Spectrograph of the Gaia satellite. Conclusions. Uncertainty\nestimation of computed astrophysical parameters is crucial for the validation\nof the parameterization itself and for the subsequent exploitation by the\nastronomical community.
