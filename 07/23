In this way, complex band\nstructure describes both the bulk-propagating states from conventional band\nstructure and the evanescent states that grow or decay from one unit cell to\nthe next. Even though these latter states are excluded by translational\nsymmetry, they become important when translational symmetry is broken via, for\nexample, a surface or impurity.\n  Many studies over the last 80 years have directly or indirectly developed\ncomplex band structure for an impressive range of applications, but very few\ndiscuss its fundamentals or compare its various results. In this work we build\nupon these previous efforts to expose the physical foundation of complex band\nstructure, which mathematically implies the existence of complex band\nstructure. We find that a material's static and dynamic electronic structure\nare both completely described by complex band structure. Furthermore, we show\nthat complex band structure reflects the minimal, intrinsic information\ncontained in the material's Hamiltonian. These realizations then provide a\ncontext for discussing, comparing, and unifying the different formulations and\napplications of complex band structure that have been developed over the years.\nUltimately, this discussion introduces the idea of examining the amount of\ninformation contained in a material's Hamiltonian so that we can find and\nexploit the minimal information necessary for understanding a material's\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2016 16:12:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-20"}

We provide a theoretical analysis of sparse\nfiltering by evaluating the conditions required to perform covariate shift\nadaptation.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a new algorithm, named periodic\nsparse filtering, and carry out the same theoretical analysis regarding\ncovariate shift adaptation. We show that periodic sparse filtering can perform\nadaptation under the looser and more realistic requirement that the conditional\ndistribution of the labels has a periodic structure, which may be satisfied,\nfor instance, by user-dependent data sets. We experimentally validate our\ntheoretical results on synthetic data.

In classical\nmagnets it is well known that long-range correlations induced by the magnons\nlead to a singular wave-number dependence of the form $1/k^{4-d}$ in all\ndimensions 2<d<4, for both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. At zero\ntemperature we find a profound difference between the two cases. Consistent\nwith naive power counting, the longitudinal susceptibility in a quantum\nantiferromagnet scales as $k^{d-3}$ for 1<d<3, whereas in a quantum ferromagnet\nthe analogous result, $k^{d-2}$, is absent due to a zero scaling function. This\nabsence of a nonanalyticity in the longitudinal susceptibility is due to the\nlack of magnon number fluctuations in the ground state of a quantum\nferromagnet; correlation functions that are sensitive to other fluctuations do\nexhibit the behavior predicted by simple power counting. Also of interest is\nthe dynamical behavior as expressed in the longitudinal part of the dynamical\nstructure factor, which is directly measurable via neutron scattering. For both\nferromagnets and antiferromagnets there is a logarithmic singularity at the\nmagnon frequency with a prefactor that vanishes as $T\\to 0$. In the\nantiferromagnetic case there also is a nonzero contribution at T=0 that is\nmissing for ferromagnets. Magnon damping due to quenched disorder restores the\nexpected scaling behavior of the longitudinal susceptibility in the\nferromagnetic case; it scales as $k^{d-2}$ if the order parameter is not\nconserved, or as $k^d$ if it is. Detailed predictions are made for both two-\nand three-dimensional systems at both T=0 and in the limit of low temperatures,\nand the physics behind the various nonanalytic behaviors is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2016 18:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

We achieve high precision by using a sample of 600,000\nmassive galaxies with spectra from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey\n(BOSS) of the third Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III), covering stellar\nmasses $M_*\\gtrsim10^{11}~M_{\\odot}$. We determine the VDF by projecting the\njoint probability-density function (PDF) of luminosity $L$ and velocity\ndispersion $\\sigma$, i.e. $p(L,\\sigma)$, defined by our previous measurements\nof the RS luminosity function and $L-\\sigma$ relation for this sample. These\nmeasurements were corrected from red--blue galaxy population confusion,\nphotometric blurring, incompleteness and selection effects within a\nforward-modeling framework that furthermore correctly accommodates the low\nspectroscopic signal-to-noise ratio of individual BOSS spectra. Our $z\\sim0.55$\nRS VDF is in overall agreement with the $z\\sim0$ early-type galaxy (ETG) VDF at\n$\\log_{10}\\sigma\\gtrsim2.47$, however the number density of $z=0.55$ RS\ngalaxies that we report is larger than that of $z=0$ ETG galaxies at\n$2.35\\gtrsim\\log_{10}\\sigma\\gtrsim 2.47$. The extrapolation of an\nintermediate-mass L-$\\sigma$ relation towards the high-mass end in previous\nlow-z works may be responsible for this disagreement. Evolutionary\ninterpretation of this comparison is also subject to differences in the way the\nrespective samples are selected; these differences can be mitigated in future\nwork by analyzing $z=0$ SDSS data using the same framework presented in this\npaper. We also provide the sample PDF for the RS population (i.e. uncorrected\nfor incompleteness), which is a key ingredient for gravitational lensing\nanalyses using BOSS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2016 20:00:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 14:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

In a series of seminal papers in\nthe literature, this problem has been investigated under a simplifying model\nwhere myopically selfish players appear sequentially and act once in the game,\nbased on private noisy observations of the system state and public observation\nof past players' actions. It has been shown that there exist information\ncascades where users discard their private information and mimic the action of\ntheir predecessor. In this paper, we provide a framework for studying Bayesian\nlearning dynamics in a more general setting than the one described above. In\nparticular, our model incorporates cases where players are non-myopic and\nstrategically participate for the whole duration of the game, and cases where\nan endogenous process selects which subset of players will act at each time\ninstance. The proposed framework hinges on a sequential decomposition\nmethodology for finding structured perfect Bayesian equilibria (PBE) of a\ngeneral class of dynamic games with asymmetric information, where user-specific\nstates evolve as conditionally independent Markov processes and users make\nindependent noisy observations of their states. Using this methodology, we\nstudy a specific dynamic learning model where players make decisions about\npublic investment based on their estimates of everyone's types. We characterize\na set of informational cascades for this problem where learning stops for the\nteam as a whole. We show that in such cascades, all players' estimates of other\nplayers' types freeze even though each individual player asymptotically learns\nits own true type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2016 21:29:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Apr 2018 01:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

We present a novel\nnetwork meta-architecture that can learn world dynamics from raw, continuous\nvideo. The components of this network can be implemented using any algorithm\nthat possesses three key capabilities: prediction of a signal over time,\nreduction of signal dimensionality (compression), and the ability to use\nsupplementary contextual information to inform the prediction. The presented\narchitecture is highly-parallelized and scalable, and is implemented using\nlocalized connectivity, processing, and learning. We demonstrate an\nimplementation of this architecture where the components are built from\nmulti-layer perceptrons.

Adding dark radiation\nduring big bang nucleosynthesis alters the Friedmann expansion rate causing the\nnuclear reactions to freeze out at a different temperature. This changes the\nfinal light element abundances at the end of BBN. Its influence on the CMB is\nto change the effective expansion rate at the surface of last scattering. We\nfind that our adopted BBN constraints reduce the allowed range for dark\nradiation to between $-12.1\\%$ and $+6.2\\%$ of the ambient background energy\ndensity.

We therefore investigate the rotation curves in BCDs formed from\nmergers between gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxies based on the results of\nnumerical simulations for BCD formation. The principal results are as follows.\nThe dark matter of merging dwarf irregulars undergoes a central concentration\nso that the central density can become up to six times higher than those of the\ninitial dwarf irregulars. However, the more compact dark matter halo alone can\nnot reproduce the gradient differences observed between dwarf irregulars and\nBCDs. We provide further support that the central concentration of gas due to\nrapid gas-transfer to the central regions of dwarf--dwarf mergers is\nresponsible for the observed difference in rotation curve gradients. The BCDs\nwith central gas concentration formed from merging can thus show steeply rising\nrotation curves in their central regions. Such gas concentration is also\nresponsible for central starbursts of BCDs and the high central surface\nbrightness and is consistent with previous BCD studies. We discuss the\nrelationship between rotational velocity gradient and surface brightness, the\ndependence of BCD rotation curves on star formation threshold density,\nprogenitor initial profile, interaction type and merger mass ratio, as well as\npotential evolutionary links between dwarf irregulars, BCDs and compact dwarf\nirregulars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2016 00:41:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 08:53:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 30 Jul 2016 06:00:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 13:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-14"}

AAM models have\nability to represent face images through synthesis using a controllable\nparameterized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model. However, the accuracy\nand robustness of the synthesized faces of AAM are highly depended on the\ntraining sets and inherently on the generalizability of PCA subspaces. This\npaper presents a novel Deep Appearance Models (DAMs) approach, an efficient\nreplacement for AAMs, to accurately capture both shape and texture of face\nimages under large variations. In this approach, three crucial components\nrepresented in hierarchical layers are modeled using the Deep Boltzmann\nMachines (DBM) to robustly capture the variations of facial shapes and\nappearances. DAMs are therefore superior to AAMs in inferencing a\nrepresentation for new face images under various challenging conditions. The\nproposed approach is evaluated in various applications to demonstrate its\nrobustness and capabilities, i.e. facial super-resolution reconstruction,\nfacial off-angle reconstruction or face frontalization, facial occlusion\nremoval and age estimation using challenging face databases, i.e. Labeled Face\nParts in the Wild (LFPW), Helen and FG-NET.

One\ncan be reflected by a proposed paradox that geometrically similar structures\nwith interface cracks under similar loadings may have different failure\nbehaviors. The other one is that the existing fracture parameters of the\noscillatory singular stress field, such as a complex stress intensity factor,\nexhibit some non-objectivity because their phase angle depend on an arbitrarily\nchosen length. Two objective and independent fracture parameters are proposed\nwhich can fully characterize the stress field near the crack tip.

This paper discusses how\nto rigorously realize volume conservation in finite strain regime, especially\nwhen the unloading stress free configuration is not adopted or unique in the\nelastoplastic theories. An accurate condition of volume conservation is\nclarified and used in this paper that the density of a volume element after the\napplied loads are completely removed should be identical to that of the initial\nstress free states. For the elastoplastic theories that adopt the unloading\nstress free configuration (i.e. the intermediate configuration), the accurate\ncondition of volume conservation is satisfied only if specific definitions of\nthe plastic strain rate are used among many other different definitions. For\nthe elastoplastic theories that do not adopt the unloading stress free\nconfiguration, it is even more difficult to realize volume conservation as the\ninformation of the stress free state lacks. To find a universal approach of\nrealizing volume conservation for elastoplastic theories whether or not adopt\nthe unloading stress free configuration, we propose a single assumption that\nthe density of material only depends on the trace of the Cauchy stress, and\ninterestingly find that the zero trace of the plastic stress rate is equivalent\nto the accurate condition of volume conservation. Two strategies are further\nproposed to satisfy the accurate condition of volume conservation: directly and\nslightly revising the tangential stiffness tensor or using a properly chosen\nstress/strain measure and elastic compliance tensor.

A popular and\npowerful approach is to exploit the available moment generating function (or\nLaplace transform) of received signal and interference, whenever it exists, by\napplying the Gil-Pelaez inversion formula. However, with the stochastic\ngeometric modeling, the moment generating function may either be too\ncomplicated to exist in closed-form or at worst may not exist. Toward this end,\nin this paper, we study two alternate ways of evaluating the SINR outage. In\nthe first case, we emphasize the significance of calculating cumulants over\nmoments and exploit the fact that the cumulants of point processes are easily\ncalculable using Campbell's theorem. The SINR outage is then analytically\ncharacterized by Charlier expansion based on Gaussian and Student's\n$t$-distributions and their associated Hermite and Krishnamoorthy polynomials.\nIn the second case, we exploit the saddle point method, which gives a\nsemi-analytical method of calculating the SINR outage, whenever the cumulant\ngenerating function of received signal and interference exists. For the purpose\nof demonstration, we apply these techniques on a downlink cellular network\nmodel where a typical user experiences a coordinated multi-point transmission,\nand the base stations are modeled by homogeneous Poisson point process.

For these applications, an important\nongoing challenge is to develop Riemannian-geometric tools which are adapted to\nstructured covariance matrices. The present paper proposes to meet this\nchallenge by introducing a new class of probability distributions, Gaussian\ndistributions of structured covariance matrices. These are Riemannian analogs\nof Gaussian distributions, which only sample from covariance matrices having a\npreassigned structure, such as complex, Toeplitz, or block-Toeplitz. The\nusefulness of these distributions stems from three features: (1) they are\ncompletely tractable, analytically or numerically, when dealing with large\ncovariance matrices, (2) they provide a statistical foundation to the concept\nof structured Riemannian barycentre (i.e. Fr\\'echet or geometric mean), (3)\nthey lead to efficient statistical learning algorithms, which realise, among\nothers, density estimation and classification of structured covariance\nmatrices. The paper starts from the observation that several spaces of\nstructured covariance matrices, considered from a geometric point of view, are\nRiemannian symmetric spaces. Accordingly, it develops an original theory of\nGaussian distributions on Riemannian symmetric spaces, of their statistical\ninference, and of their relationship to the concept of Riemannian barycentre.\nThen, it uses this original theory to give a detailed description of Gaussian\ndistributions of three kinds of structured covariance matrices, complex,\nToeplitz, and block-Toeplitz.

An oscillation-free scheme is developed for overcoming\nany oscillatory behavior when numerically solving the linear diffusion portion.\nTo demonstrate the ills of stable oscillations, we compare our method using a\nweighted implicit Euler scheme to the Crank-Nicolson method. The\noscillation-free feature and stability of our method are analyzed through a\nlocal linearization. The accuracy of our oscillation-free method is proved and\nits usefulness is further verified through solving a Fisher-type equation where\noscillation-free solutions are successfully produced in spite of random errors\nin the initial conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jul 2016 10:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

Remarkably large delays up to 160 as are observed in N$_2$O, whereas\nthe delays in H$_2$O are all smaller than 50 as in the photon-energy range of\n20-40 eV. These results are interpreted by developing a theory of molecular\nphotoionization delays. The long delays measured in N$_2$O are shown to reflect\nthe population of molecular shape resonances that trap the photoelectron for a\nduration of up to $\\sim$110 as.

By monitoring the surface chemistry of MoS2 upon N2\nplasma exposure using in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we identified\nthe presence of covalently bonded nitrogen in MoS2, where substitution of the\nchalcogen sulfur by nitrogen is determined as the doping mechanism.\nFurthermore, the electrical characterization demonstrates that p-type doping of\nMoS2 is achieved by nitrogen doping, in agreement with theoretical predictions.\nNotably, we found that the presence of nitrogen can induce compressive strain\nin the MoS2 structure, which represents the first evidence of strain induced by\nsubstitutional doping in a transition metal dichalcogenide material. Finally,\nour first principle calculations support the experimental demonstration of such\nstrain, and a correlation between nitrogen doping concentration and compressive\nstrain in MoS2 is elucidated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2016 21:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}
