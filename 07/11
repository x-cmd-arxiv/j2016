However, as the number of PMUs in a power system\nis limited, the traditional supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)\nsystem cannot be replaced by the PMU-based system overnight. Therefore, hybrid\npower state estimation taking advantage of both systems is important. As\nexperiments show that sampling phase errors among PMUs are inevitable in\npractical deployment, this paper proposes a distributed power state estimation\nalgorithm under PMU phase errors. The proposed distributed algorithm only\ninvolves local computations and limited information exchange between\nneighboring areas, thus alleviating the heavy communication burden compared to\nthe centralized approach. Simulation results show that the performance of the\nproposed algorithm is very close to that of centralized optimal hybrid state\nestimates without sampling phase error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2016 16:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

We present an image of Arp 220 at 150 MHz with resolution\n$0.65''\\times0.35''$, sensitivity 0.15 mJy beam$^{-1}$, and integrated flux\ndensity $394\\pm59$ mJy. More than 80% of the detected flux comes from extended\n($6''\\approx$2.2 kpc) steep spectrum ($\\alpha=-0.7$) emission, likely from star\nformation in the molecular disk surrounding the two nuclei. We find elongated\nfeatures extending $0.3''$ (110 pc) and $0.9''$ (330 pc) from the eastern and\nwestern nucleus respectively, which we interpret as evidence for outflows. The\nextent of radio emission requires acceleration of cosmic rays far outside the\nnuclei. We find that a simple three component model can explain most of the\nobserved radio spectrum of the galaxy. When accounting for absorption at 1.4\nGHz, Arp 220 follows the FIR/radio correlation with $q=2.36$, and we estimate a\nstar formation rate of 220 M$_\\odot\\text{yr}^{-1}$. We derive thermal fractions\nat 1 GHz of less than 1% for the nuclei, which indicates that a major part of\nthe UV-photons are absorbed by dust. International LOFAR observations shows\ngreat promise to detect steep spectrum outflows and probe regions of thermal\nabsorption. However, in LIRGs the emission detected at 150 MHz does not\nnecessarily come from the main regions of star formation. This implies that\nhigh spatial resolution is crucial for accurate estimates of star formation\nrates for such galaxies at 150 MHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2016 16:04:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

Typical applications include many popular\nstatistical machine learning methods such as elastic-net regression, ridge\npenalized logistic regression, and sparse additive regression. Existing\noptimization literature has shown that for strongly convex minimization, the\nCBCD-type methods attain iteration complexity of\n$\\mathcal{O}(p\\log(1/\\epsilon))$, where $\\epsilon$ is a pre-specified accuracy\nof the objective value, and $p$ is the number of blocks. However, such\niteration complexity explicitly depends on $p$, and therefore is at least $p$\ntimes worse than the complexity $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ of gradient\ndescent (GD) methods. To bridge this theoretical gap, we propose an improved\nconvergence analysis for the CBCD-type methods. In particular, we first show\nthat for a family of quadratic minimization problems, the iteration complexity\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log^2(p)\\cdot\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ of the CBCD-type methods matches\nthat of the GD methods in term of dependency on $p$, up to a $\\log^2 p$ factor.\nThus our complexity bounds are sharper than the existing bounds by at least a\nfactor of $p/\\log^2(p)$.

The\nmeasure is based on a statistical analysis of simulated forecasts of wave\nheights outside an impact site and how much the forecasts are degraded in\naccuracy when one or more buoys are inoperative. The analysis uses simulated\ntsunami height time series collected at each buoy from selected source segments\nin the Short-term Inundation Forecast for Tsunamis (SIFT) database and involves\na set for 1000 forecasts for each buoy/segment pair at sites just offshore of\nselected impact communities. Random error-producing scatter in the time series\nis induced by uncertainties in the source location, addition of real oceanic\nnoise, and imperfect tidal removal. Comparison with an error-free standard\nleads to root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) for DART buoys located near a\nsubduction zone. The RMSEs indicate which buoy provides the best forecast\n(lowest RMSE) for sections of the zone, under a warning-time constraint for the\nforecasts of 3 hrs. The analysis also shows how the forecasts are degraded\n(larger minimum RMSE among the remaining buoys) when one or more buoys become\ninoperative. The RMSEs also provide a way to assess array augmentation or\nredesign such as moving buoys to more optimal locations. Examples are shown for\nbuoys off the Aleutian Islands and off the West Coast of South America for\nimpact sites at Hilo HI and along the U.S. West Coast (Crescent City CA and\nPort San Luis CA). A simple measure (coded green, yellow or red) of the current\nstatus of the network's ability to deliver accurate forecasts is proposed to\nflag the urgency of buoy repair.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2016 23:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

The main idea is to pose\nactivity detection as a maximum-weight connected subgraph problem. Offline, we\nlearn a binary classifier for an activity category using positive video\nexemplars that are \"trimmed\" in time to the activity of interest. Then, given a\nnovel \\emph{untrimmed} video sequence, we decompose it into a 3D array of\nspace-time nodes, which are weighted based on the extent to which their\ncomponent features support the learned activity model. To perform detection, we\nthen directly localize instances of the activity by solving for the\nmaximum-weight connected subgraph in the test video's space-time graph. We show\nthat this detection strategy permits an efficient branch-and-cut solution for\nthe best-scoring---and possibly non-cubically shaped---portion of the video for\na given activity classifier. The upshot is a fast method that can search a\nbroader space of space-time region candidates than was previously practical,\nwhich we find often leads to more accurate detection.

We show that barycentric subspaces locally define a submanifold of\ndimension k which generalizes geodesic subspaces.Second, we rephrase PCA in\nEuclidean spaces as an optimization on flags of linear subspaces (a hierarchy\nof properly embedded linear subspaces of increasing dimension).

The iron line is generated through continuum photons reflecting off\nthe accretion disk, and its shape is distorted by relativistic motion of the\norbiting plasma and the gravitational pull of the black hole. The physical\norigin of the QPO has long been debated, but is often attributed to\nLense-Thirring precession, a General Relativistic effect causing the inner flow\nto precess as the spinning black hole twists up the surrounding space-time.\nThis predicts a characteristic rocking of the iron line between red and blue\nshift as the receding and approaching sides of the disk are respectively\nilluminated.

Understanding the physical origin of these structures, and whether\nthey can be sustained and transport angular momentum efficiently in\nastrophysical conditions, represents a significant theoretical challenge. The\ndiscovery of simple periodic nonlinear MRI dynamo solutions has recently proven\nuseful in this respect, and has notably served to highlight the role of\nturbulent magnetic diffusion in the seeming decay of the dynamics at low\nmagnetic Prandtl number Pm (magnetic diffusivity larger than viscosity), a\ncommon regime in accretion disks. The connection between these simple\nstructures and the statistical organization reported in turbulent simulations\nremained elusive, though. Here, we report the numerical discovery in moderate\naspect ratio Keplerian shearing boxes of new periodic, incompressible,\nthree-dimensional nonlinear MRI dynamo solutions with a larger dynamical\ncomplexity reminiscent of such simulations. These \"chimera\" cycles are\ncharacterized by multiple MRI-unstable dynamical stages, but their basic\nphysical principles of self-sustainment are nevertheless identical to those of\nsimpler cycles found in azimuthally elongated boxes. In particular, we find\nthat they are not sustained at low Pm either due to subcritical turbulent\nmagnetic diffusion. These solutions offer a new perspective into the transition\nfrom laminar to turbulent instability-driven dynamos, and may prove useful to\ndevise improved statistical models of turbulent accretion disk dynamos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2016 11:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

One of the most important theories for the MDL principle is Barron and\nCover's theory (BC theory), which gives a mathematical justification of the MDL\nprinciple. The original BC theory, however, can be applied to supervised\nlearning only approximately and limitedly. Though Barron et al. recently\nsucceeded in removing a similar approximation in case of unsupervised learning,\ntheir idea cannot be essentially applied to supervised learning in general. To\novercome this issue, an extension of BC theory to supervised learning is\nproposed. The derived risk bound has several advantages inherited from the\noriginal BC theory. First, the risk bound holds for finite sample size. Second,\nit requires remarkably few assumptions. Third, the risk bound has a form of\nredundancy of the two-stage code for the MDL procedure. Hence, the proposed\nextension gives a mathematical justification of the MDL principle to supervised\nlearning like the original BC theory. As an important example of application,\nnew risk and (probabilistic) regret bounds of lasso with random design are\nderived. The derived risk bound holds for any finite sample size $n$ and\nfeature number $p$ even if $n\\ll p$ without boundedness of features in contrast\nto the past work.

Those who listen can only distinguish between silence and the presence\nof at least one beep. We refer to this model as $BL$ (beep or listen). Stronger\nmodels exist where the nodes can detect collision while they are beeping\n($B_{cd}L$), listening ($BL_{cd}$), or both ($B_{cd}L_{cd}$). Beeping models\nare weak in essence and even simple tasks are difficult or unfeasible within.\n  We present a set of generic building blocks (design patterns) which seem to\noccur frequently in the design of beeping algorithms. They include multi-slot\nphases: the fact of dividing the main loop into a number of specialised slots;\nexclusive beeps: having a single node beep at a time in a neighbourhood (within\none or two hops); adaptive probability: increasing or decreasing the\nprobability of beeping to produce more exclusive beeps; internal (resp.\nperipheral) collision detection: for detecting collision while beeping (resp.\nlistening). Based on these patterns, we provide algorithms for a number of\nbasic problems, including colouring, 2-hop colouring, degree computation, 2-hop\nMIS, and collision detection (in $BL$). The patterns make it possible to\nformulate these algorithms in a rather concise and elegant way.

Our result positively resolves an open question posted by Aaronson,\nImpagliazzo and Moshkovitz (CCC 2014).\n  As an application of our birthday repetition theorem, we obtain new\nfine-grained hardness of approximation results for dense CSPs. Specifically, we\nestablish a tight trade-off between running time and approximation ratio for\ndense CSPs by showing conditional lower bounds, integrality gaps and\napproximation algorithms. In particular, for any sufficiently large $i$ and for\nevery $k \\geq 2$, we show the following results:\n  - We exhibit an $O(q^{1/i})$-approximation algorithm for dense Max $k$-CSPs\nwith alphabet size $q$ via $O_k(i)$-level of Sherali-Adams relaxation.\n  - Through our birthday repetition theorem, we obtain an integrality gap of\n$q^{1/i}$ for $\\tilde\\Omega_k(i)$-level Lasserre relaxation for fully-dense Max\n$k$-CSP.\n  - Assuming that there is a constant $\\epsilon > 0$ such that Max 3SAT cannot\nbe approximated to within $(1-\\epsilon)$ of the optimal in sub-exponential\ntime, our birthday repetition theorem implies that any algorithm that\napproximates fully-dense Max $k$-CSP to within a $q^{1/i}$ factor takes\n$(nq)^{\\tilde \\Omega_k(i)}$ time, almost tightly matching the algorithmic\nresult based on Sherali-Adams relaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2016 14:54:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

In doing so, I\nhope to provide a historic context for the original result, as well as an\noutlook on the future of technology derived from these newer developments. An\nemphasis is made in each section to provide a broader conceptual framework for\nunderstanding the consequences of each result in light of the others. This\nframework is intended to be comprehensible even without a deep understanding of\nthe topics themselves.\n  The first three chapters focus more closely on the BosonSampling result\nitself, seeking to understand the computational complexity aspects of passive\nlinear optical networks, and what consequences this may have. Some effort is\nspent discussing a number of issues inherent in the BosonSampling problem that\nlimit the scope of its applicability, and that are still active topics of\nresearch. Finally, we describe two other linear optical settings that inherit\nthe same complexity as BosonSampling. The final chapters focus on how an\nintuitive understanding of BosonSampling has led to developments in optical\nmetrology and other closely related fields. These developments suggest the\nexciting possibility that quantum sensors may be viable in the next few years\nwith only marginal improvements in technology. Lastly, some open problems are\npresented which are intended to lay out a course for future research that would\nallow for a more complete picture of the scalability of the architecture\ndeveloped in these chapters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2016 15:09:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

Our pendulum model, in which the\nrestoring force is the gravity projected along the dipped field lines of the\nmagnetic structure, best explains these oscillations. However, several factors\ncan influence the longitudinal oscillations, potentially invalidating the\npendulum model.

Vibrational mismatch at the interface leads to this interfacial\nthermal resistance, which plays an important role in energy transfer at the\nboundary.

Molecular dynamics\nsimulations have been performed to investigate the effect of CNT diameter on\ninterfacial resistance between carbon nanotube (CNT) and water molecules. This\nwork is an effort to understand the heat transfer phenomenon at the interface\nby quantifying the vibrational mismatch. Analysis of the vibrational spectra of\nCNT and water molecules is done to study the effect of CNT diameter on\ninterfacial resistance. Starting with the initial configuration, and\nequilibrating the system of CNT and water molecules at 300 K and 1 atm, the CNT\ntemperature is raised to 700 K by velocity rescaling. This system is now\nallowed to relax as a micro-canonical ensemble. Based on the lumped capacitance\nanalysis, the time constant of the CNT temperature response is determined,\nwhich is then used to compute the interfacial thermal resistance. The\ninterfacial thermal resistance is observed to be relatively higher for the\nlarger diameter nanotube. This is attributed to the higher vibrational mismatch\nexisting for larger diameter CNT as a result of low overlapping region between\nvibrational density states of CNT and water molecules. For smaller diameter\nCNT, the interfacial thermal resistance is low which results in the efficient\nheat transfer at the interface thus, emphasizing the indispensable role of\nlarger diameter CNTs in the cooling applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2016 10:48:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2016 14:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}
