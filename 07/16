As a\nconsequence, we obtain at once a number of results that have been proved\nindividually for many operators. On the other hand, our theorems provide a\nvariety of new results even for the unweighted case because we do not use any\nrepresentation formula or pointwise bound of the operator as was assumed by\nprevious authors. To extend the operators to Morrey spaces we show different\n(continuous) embeddings of (weighted) Morrey spaces into appropriate\nMuckenhoupt $A_1$ weighted $L_p$ spaces, which enable us to define the\noperators on the considered Morrey spaces by restriction. In this way, we can\navoid the delicate problem of the definition of the operator, often ignored by\nthe authors. In dealing with the extension problem through the embeddings\n(instead of using duality) one is neither restricted in the parameter range of\nthe $p$'s (in particular $p=1$ is admissible and applies to weak-type\ninequalities) nor the operator has to be linear. Another remarkable consequence\nof our results is that vector-valued inequalities in Morrey spaces are\nautomatically deduced.

As a result, an autonomous quantum machine need only be of modest size\nand or energy.

The mean-field model\ndisplays a phase transition that can be either first or second-order, depending\non the amplitude of the field and on the frequency of oscillation. Within this\napproximation the entropy production rate is shown to have a discontinuity when\nthe transition is first-order and to be continuous, with a jump in its first\nderivative, if the transition is second-order. In two dimensions, we find with\nnumerical simulations that the critical behavior of the entropy production rate\nis the same, independent of the frequency and amplitude of the field. Its first\nderivative has a logarithmic divergence at the critical point. This result is\nin agreement with the lack of a first-order phase transition in two dimensions.\nWe analyze a model with a field that changes at stochastic time-intervals\nbetween two values.

Strain is\noften proposed as a method to enhance the performance of oxygen transport\nmaterials, but the magnitude of its effect and its underlying mechanisms are\nnot well-understood, particularly in the widely-used perovskite-structured\noxygen conductors. This work reports on an ab initio prediction of strain\neffects on migration energetics for nine perovskite systems of the form LaBO3,\nwhere B = [Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Ga]. Biaxial strain, as might be\neasily produced in epitaxial systems, is predicted to lead to approximately\nlinear changes in migration energy. We find that tensile biaxial strain reduces\nthe oxygen vacancy migration barrier across the systems studied by an average\nof 66 meV per percent strain for a single selected hop, with a low of 36 and a\nhigh of 89 meV decrease in migration barrier per percent strain across all\nsystems. The estimated range for the change in migration barrier within each\nsystem is approximately 25 meV per percent strain when considering all hops.\nThese results suggest that strain can significantly impact transport in these\nmaterials, e.g., a 2% tensile strain can increase the diffusion coefficient by\nabout three orders of magnitude at 300 K (one order of magnitude at 500 {\\deg}C\nor 773 K) for one of the most strain-responsive materials calculated here\n(LaCrO3). We show that a simple elasticity model, which assumes only dilative\nor compressive strain in a cubic environment and a fixed migration volume, can\nqualitatively but not quantitatively model the strain dependence of the\nmigration energy, suggesting that factors not captured by continuum elasticity\nplay a significant role in the strain response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2016 19:16:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-18"}

Then we\ntrain a recurrent neural network that takes as input sequences of\npseudo-labeled frames and optimizes an objective that encourages both accuracy\non the target frame and consistency across consecutive frames. The approach\nincorporates strong supervision of target frames, weak-supervision on context\nframes, and regularization via a smoothness penalty.

In this\ntest, the stellar mass estimate with the smallest errors yields the highest\namplitude of clustering at fixed number density.

Using the abundance-matching ansatz to connect dark matter halo\nmass to stellar mass, we construct theoretical models of b(Mgal) that match the\nsame stellar mass function but have different amounts of scatter in stellar\nmass at fixed halo mass, sigma_logM. Using this approach, we find\nsigma_logM=0.18^{+0.01}_{-0.02}. This value includes both intrinsic scatter as\nwell as random errors in the stellar masses.

Here we carry out NEMD simulations on a model polyamide RO\nmembrane to understand the mechanisms of transport and rejection of both ionic\nand neutral contaminants in water. We observe that the rejection changes\nnon-monotonously with ion sizes. In particular, the rejection of urea, 2.4 A\nradius, is higher than ethanol, 2.6 A radius, and the rejections for organic\nsolutes, 2.2-2.8 A radius, are lower than Na+, 1.4 A radius, or Cl-, 2.3 A\nradius. We show that this can be explained in terms of the solute accessible\nintermolecular volume in the membrane and the solute-water pair interaction\nenergy. If the smallest open spaces in the membrane's molecular structure are\nall larger than the hydrated solute, then the solute-water pair interaction\nenergy does not matter. However, when the open spaces in the polymeric\nstructure are such that solutes have to shed at least one water molecule to\npass through a portion of the membrane molecular structure, the pair\ninteraction energy governs solute rejection. The high pair interaction energy\nfor water molecules in the solvation shell for ions makes the water molecules\ndifficult to shed, thus enhancing the rejection of ions. On the other hand, the\norganic solute-water interaction energies are governed by the water molecules\nthat are hydrogen bonded to the solute. Urea molecules have more\nhydrogen-bonding sites than alcohol molecules, leading to a higher rejection of\nurea than occurs for ethanol, a molecule of similar size but with fewer\nhydrogen bonding sites. These findings underline the importance of the solute's\nsolvation shell and solute-water-membrane chemistry in the context of reverse\nosmosis, thus providing new insights into solute transport and rejection in RO\nmembranes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2016 23:13:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-19"}

For the GNFW model, we find an average value of\n(minus) the logarithmic inner slope of $\\beta=1.02\\pm0.08$, with an intrinsic\nscatter of $\\sigma_\\beta=0.22\\pm0.07$, while in the Einasto case we constrain\nthe average shape parameter to be $\\alpha=0.29\\pm0.04$ with an intrinsic\nscatter of $\\sigma_\\alpha=0.12\\pm0.04$.

The closure\ndelay is independent of the instrumental and propagation delays and provides\nvaluable additional information about the source structure. We demonstrate the\nuse of this new \"observable\" for the determination of the structure in the\nradio source 0642+449. This source, as one of the defining sources in the\nsecond realization of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF2), is\nfound to have two point-like components with a relative position offset of -426\nmicroarcseconds in right ascension and -66 microarcseconds in declination. The\ntwo components are almost equally bright with a flux-density ratio of 0.92. The\nstandard deviation of closure delays for source 0642+449 was reduced from 139\nps to 90 ps by using this two-component model. Closure delays larger than one\nnanosecond are found to be related to the source structure, demonstrating that\nstructure effects for a source with this simple structure could be up to tens\nof nanoseconds. The method described in this paper does not rely on a priori\nsource structure information, such as knowledge of source structure determined\nfrom direct (Fourier) imaging of the same observations or observations at other\nepochs. We anticipate our study to be a starting point for more effective\ndetermination of the structure effect in VLBI observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2016 05:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

For the SK model\nwe have calculated analytically its complexity (the log of the number of\nminima) for both the annealed case and the quenched case, both for fields above\nand below the de Almeida Thouless (AT) field ($h_{AT} > 0$ for $m>2$). We have\ndone quenches starting from a random initial state by putting spins parallel to\ntheir local fields until convergence and found that in zero field it always\nproduces minima which have zero overlap with each other. For the $m=2$ and\n$m=3$ cases in the SK model the final energy reached in the quench is very\nclose to the energy $E_c$ at which the overlap of the states would acquire\nreplica symmetry breaking features. These minima have marginal stability and\nwill have long-range correlations between them. In the SK limit we have\nanalytically studied the density of states $\\rho(\\lambda)$ of the Hessian\nmatrix in the annealed approximation. Despite the absence of continuous\nsymmetries, the spectrum extends down to zero with the usual $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$\nform for the density of states for $h_{r}<h_{AT}$. However, when\n$h_{r}>h_{AT}$, there is a gap in the spectrum which closes up as $h_{AT}$ is\napproached. For the VB model and the other models our numerical work shows that\nthere always exist some low-lying eigenvalues and there never seems to be a\ngap. There is no sign of the AT transition in the quenched states reached from\ninfinite temperature for any model but the SK model, which is the only model\nwhich has zero complexity above $h_{AT}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2016 09:52:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 09:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

So far, most\nstudies have focused on addressing two questions, namely, how to detect\noverlapping circles and how to detect circles using a combination of network\nstructure and network node attributes. This paper asks an orthogonal research\nquestion, that is, how to detect circles based on network structures that are\n(usually) described by multiple views? Our investigation begins with crawling\nego-networks from Twitter and employing classic techniques to model their\nstructures by six views, including user relationships, user interactions and\nuser content. We then apply both standard and our modified multi-view spectral\nclustering techniques to detect social circles in these ego-networks. Based on\nextensive automatic and manual experimental evaluations, we deliver two major\nfindings: first, multi-view clustering techniques perform better than common\nsingle-view clustering techniques, which only use one view or naively integrate\nall views for detection, second, the standard multi-view clustering technique\nis less robust than our modified technique, which selectively transfers\ninformation across views based on an assumption that sparse network structures\nare (potentially) incomplete. In particular, the second finding makes us\nbelieve a direct application of standard clustering on potentially incomplete\nnetworks may yield biased results. We lightly examine this issue in theory,\nwhere we derive an upper bound for such bias by integrating theories of\nspectral clustering and matrix perturbation, and discuss how it may be affected\nby several network characteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2016 15:00:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2016 02:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

In this article we present DITRAS (DIary-based TRAjectory Simulator),\na framework to simulate the spatio-temporal patterns of human mobility. DITRAS\noperates in two steps: the generation of a mobility diary and the translation\nof the mobility diary into a mobility trajectory. We propose a data-driven\nalgorithm which constructs a diary generator from real data, capturing the\ntendency of individuals to follow or break their routine. We also propose a\ntrajectory generator based on the concept of preferential exploration and\npreferential return. We instantiate DITRAS with the proposed diary and\ntrajectory generators and compare the resulting algorithm with real data and\nsynthetic data produced by other generative algorithms, built by instantiating\nDITRAS with several combinations of diary and trajectory generators. We show\nthat the proposed algorithm reproduces the statistical properties of real\ntrajectories in the most accurate way, making a step forward the understanding\nof the origin of the spatio-temporal patterns of human mobility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2016 11:54:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2017 18:51:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 9 Dec 2017 10:51:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}
