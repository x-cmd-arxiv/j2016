In this \"replica\"\napproach the computation of measures of entanglement generally involves a\nmathematically non-trivial analytic continuation in the number of replicas. In\nthis paper we consider two-point functions of twist fields and their analytic\ncontinuation in the 1+1 dimensional massive (non-compactified) free Boson\ntheory. This is one of the few theories for which all matrix elements of twist\nfields are known so that we may hope to compute correlation functions very\nprecisely. We study two particular two-point functions which are related to the\nlogarithmic negativity of semi-infinite disjoint intervals and to the\nentanglement entropy of one interval. We show that our prescription for the\nanalytic continuation yields results which are in full agreement with conformal\nfield theory predictions in the short-distance limit. We provide numerical\nestimates of universal quantities and their ratios, both in the massless (twist\nfield structure constants) and the massive (expectation values of twist fields)\ntheory. We find that particular ratios are given by divergent form factor\nexpansions. We propose such divergences stem from the presence of logarithmic\nfactors in addition to the expected power-law behaviour of two-point functions\nat short-distances. Surprisingly, at criticality these corrections give rise to\na log(logL) correction to the entanglement entropy of one interval of length L.\nThis hitherto overlooked result is in agreement with results by Calabrese,\nCardy and Tonni and has been independently derived by Blondeau-Fournier and\nDoyon (in preparation).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 16:53:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2016 16:55:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 16:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-16"}

The initial analysis of the subsurface flow maps reconstructed\nfrom the 5 years of SDO/HMI data by time-distance helioseismology reveals the\ngreat potential for studying and understanding of the dynamics of the quiet Sun\nand active regions, and the evolution with the solar cycle. In particular, our\nresults show that the emergence and evolution of active regions are accompanied\nby multi-scale flow patterns, and that the meridional flows display the\nNorth-South asymmetry closely correlating with the magnetic activity. The\nlatitudinal variations of the meridional circulation speed, which are probably\nrelated to the large-scale converging flows, are mostly confined in shallow\nsubsurface layers. Therefore, these variations do not necessarily affect the\nmagnetic flux transport.

Most of the\nexisting works treat the network topology as being exogenously given and study\nunder what conditions an epidemic breaks out and/or extinguishes. However, if\nagents are able to strategically decide their connections according to their\nown self-interest, the network will instead be endogenously formed and\nevolving. In such systems, the epidemic, agents' strategic decisions and the\nnetwork structure become complexly coupled and co-evolve. As a result, existing\nknowledge may no longer be applicable. Built on a continuous time\nSusceptible-Infected-Susceptible epidemic model with strong mixing, this paper\nstudies stochastic epidemic networks consisting of strategic agents, who decide\nthe number of links to form based on a careful evaluation of its current\nobtainable benefit and the potential future cost due to infection by forming\nlinks. A game theoretical framework is developed to analyze such networks and a\nnumber of important insights are obtained. One key result is that whereas an\nepidemic eventually dies out if the effective spreading rate is sufficiently\nlow in exogenously given networks, it never dies out when agents are strategic\nregardless of the effective spreading rate. This property leads to reduced\nachievable system efficiency and considerably different optimal protection\nmechanisms. Without understanding the strategic behavior of agents, significant\nsecurity cost may incur.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 18:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

For traditional\nproblems where the number of observations is large, there exist many well\ndeveloped approaches. Recently, high dimensional low sample size problems are\nbecoming increasingly popular. Margin-based classifiers, such as logistic\nregression, are well established methods in the literature. On the other hand,\nin terms of probability estimation, it is known that for binary classifiers,\nthe commonly used methods tend to under-estimate the norm of the classification\nfunction.

This is primarily caused by\nso-called growth barriers: the direct growth of larger bodies is halted at\ncentimetre-sized objects and particular conditions are required for the\nformation of larger, gravitationally bound planetesimals. We aim to connect\nmodels of dust evolution and planetesimal formation to identify regions of\nprotoplanetary discs that are favourable for the formation of kilometre-sized\nbodies and the first planetary embryos. We combine semi-analytical models of\nviscous protoplanetary disc evolution, dust growth and drift including\nbackreaction of the dust particles on the gas, and planetesimal formation via\nthe streaming instability into one numerical code. We investigate how\nplanetesimal formation is affected by the mass of the protoplanetary disc, its\ninitial dust content, and the stickiness of dust aggregates. We find that the\ndust growth and drift leads to a global redistribution of solids. The pile-up\nof pebbles in the inner disc provides local conditions where the streaming\ninstability is effective. Planetesimals form in an annulus with its inner edge\nlying between 0.3 AU and 1 AU and its width ranging from 0.3 AU to 3 AU. The\nresulting surface density of planetesimals follows a radial profile that is\nmuch steeper than the initial disc profile. These results support formation of\nterrestrial planets in the solar system from a narrow annulus of planetesimals,\nwhich reproduces their peculiar mass ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 20:00:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2016 15:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

A particularly interesting question is whether\nvoid interiors are completely empty or contain a dwarf population. However the\nnearby voids that are most conducive for dwarf searches have large angular\ndiameters, on the order of a steradian, making it difficult to redshift-map a\nstatistically significant portion of their volume to the magnitude limit of\ndwarf galaxies. As part of addressing this problem, we investigate here the\nusefulness of number counts in establishing the best locations to search inside\nnearby (d < 300 Mpc) galaxy voids, utilizing Wolf plots of log(n < m) vs. m as\nthe basic diagnostic. To illustrate expected signatures, we consider the\nsignature of three void profiles, \"cut out\", \"built up\", and \"universal\nprofile\" carved into Monte-Carlo Schechter function models. We then investigate\nthe signatures of voids in the Millennium Run dark matter simulation and the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey. We find in all of these the evidence for cut-out and\nbuilt-up voids is most discernible when the void diameter is similar to the\ndistance to its center. However the density distribution of the universal\nprofile that is characteristic of actual voids is essentially undetectable at\nany distance. A useful corollary of this finding is that galaxy counts are a\nreliable measure of survey completeness and stellar contamination even when\nsampling through significant voids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 21:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-21"}

The basic idea is to reduce the system\nwith varying domains to one in a fixed domain. This is done by a transformation\n(the so-called Hanzawa transformation) and yields a typically nonlocal and\nnonlinear coupled system of (evolution) equations. Well-posedness results can\nthen often be established as soon as it is proved that the relevant\nlinearization is the generator of an analytic semigroup or admits maximal\nregularity. To implement this program, it is necessary to somehow parametrize\nto space of boundaries/domains (typically the space of compact hypersurfaces\n$\\Gamma$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, in the Euclidean setting). This has traditionally\nbeen achieved by means of the already mentioned Hanzawa transformation. The\napproach, while successful, requires the introduction of a smooth manifold\n$\\Gamma_\\infty$ close to the manifold $\\Gamma_0$ in which one cares to\nlinearize. This prevents one to use coordinates in which $\\Gamma_0$ lies at\ntheir \"center\". As a result formul{\\ae} tend to contain terms that would\notherwise not be present were one able to linearize in a neighborhood emanating\nfrom $\\Gamma_0$ instead of from $\\Gamma_\\infty$. In this paper it is made use\nof flows (curves of diffeomorphisms) to obtain a general form of the relevant\nlinearization in combination with an alternative coordinatization of the\nmanifold of hypersurfaces, which circumvents the need for the introduction of a\n\"phantom\" reference manifold $\\Gamma_\\infty$ by, in its place, making use of a\n\"phantom geometry\" on $\\Gamma_0$.

In particular, we focus on the centrosymmetric lattices with\nlocal asymmetry at the lattice sites, e.g., zig-zag, honeycomb, and diamond\nstructures.

Borromean, two-nucleon, halo\nnuclei are candidates of unstable three-fragments projectiles. The model is\nbased on the theory of inclusive breakup reactions commonly employed in the\ntreatment of incomplete fusion and surrogate method.

The tester has to accept with high probability if\nthere is a way to assign values to the erased points such that the resulting\nfunction satisfies P. It has to reject with high probability if, for all\nassignments of values to the erased points, the resulting function has to be\nchanged in at least an epsilon-fraction of the nonerased domain points to\nsatisfy P.\n  We design erasure-resilient property testers for a large class of properties.\nFor some properties, it is possible to obtain erasure-resilient testers by\nusing standard testers as a black box. But there are more challenging\nproperties for which all known testers rely on querying a specific point. If\nthis point is erased, all these testers break. We give efficient\nerasure-resilient testers for several classes of such properties including\nmonotonicity, the Lipschitz property, and convexity. Finally, we describe a\nproperty that can be epsilon-tested with O(1/epsilon) queries in the standard\nmodel, whereas testing it in the erasure-resilient model requires number of\nqueries polynomial in the input size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2016 00:32:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-21"}

The near\nbed transport region is represented by the lower (bedload) layer which has an\narbitrarily constant, vanishing thickness (of approximately ten times the\nsediment particle diameter), and whose average sediment concentration is free\nto vary. Sediment is allowed to enter the upper layer, and so total load may\nalso be simulated, provided that concentrations of suspended sediment remain\nlow. The model conforms with established theories of bedload, and is validated\nsatisfactorily against empirical expressions for sediment transport rates and\nthe morphodynamic experiment of a migrating mining pit by Lee et al. (1993).\nInvestigation into the effect of a local bed gradient on bedload leads to\nderivation of an analytical, physically meaningful expression for morphological\ndiffusion induced by a non-zero local bed slope. Incorporation of the proposed\nmorphological diffusion into a conventional morphodynamic model (defined as a\ncoupling between the shallow water equations, Exner equation and an empirical\nformula for bedload) improves model predictions when applied to the evolution\nof a mining pit, without the need either to resort to special numerical\ntreatment of the equations or to use additional tuning parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2016 04:31:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jan 2018 18:10:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 16:10:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2018 13:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-12"}

SDF starts from superpixel segmentation, which effectively captures prior\ninformation of feature appearances. The feature appearances are beneficial to\nreduce the computational complexity for deterministic fitting methods. SDF also\nincludes two original elements, i.e., a deterministic sampling algorithm and a\nnovel model selection algorithm. The two algorithms are tightly coupled to\nboost the performance of SDF in both speed and accuracy. Specifically, the\nproposed sampling algorithm leverages the grouping cues of superpixels to\ngenerate reliable and consistent hypotheses. The proposed model selection\nalgorithm further makes use of desirable properties of the generated\nhypotheses, to improve the conventional fit-and-remove framework for more\nefficient and effective performance. The key characteristic of SDF is that it\ncan efficiently and deterministically estimate the parameters of model\ninstances in multi-structure data. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed SDF shows superiority over several state-of-the-art fitting methods\nfor real images with single-structure and multiple-structure data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2016 07:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-21"}

As an application, we consider the K-user\nMultiple Access Channels (MAC) with feedback and utilize the obtained results\nto explore the behavior of these systems in terms of the MI. Specializing the\nresults to the additive Gaussian noise MAC, we extend the MI and Minimum Mean\nSquare Error (MMSE) relationship, i.e., I-MMSE to the K-user Gaussian MAC with\nfeedback. In this derivation, we show that the gradient of MI can be decomposed\ninto three distinct parts, where the first part is the MMSE term originated\nfrom noise, and the second and third parts reflect the effects of the\ninterference and feedback, respectively. Then, considering the capacity\nachieving Fourier-Modulated Estimate Correction (F-MEC) strategy of Kramer, we\nshow how feedback compensates the destructive effects of the users'\ninterference in the K-user symmetric Gaussian MAC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2016 09:11:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 06:36:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 06:37:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 2019 20:43:16 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 13:29:31 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2019 09:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-10"}

With the ageing of populations, new un-faced challenges\nare brought to science. The human body is naturally selected to be\nwell-functioning until the age of reproduction to keep the species alive.\nHowever, as the lifespan extends, unseen problems due to the body deterioration\nemerge. There are several age-related diseases with no appropriate treatment;\ntherefore, the complex ageing phenomena needs further understanding.\nImmunosenescence, the ageing of the immune system, is highly correlated to the\nnegative effects of ageing, such as the increase of auto-inflammatory diseases\nand decrease in responsiveness to new diseases. Besides clinical and\nmathematical tools, we believe there is opportunity to further exploit\nsimulation tools to understand immunosenescence.

The shear profile as inferred from\nthe statistics of ellipticity of background galaxies allows to probe the\ncluster intermediate and outer regions thus determining the virial mass\nestimate. However, the mass sheet degeneracy and the need for a large number of\nbackground galaxies motivate the search for alternative tracers which can break\nthe degeneracy among model parameters and hence improve the accuracy of the\nmass estimate. Lensing flexion, i.e. the third derivative of the lensing\npotential, has been suggested as a good answer to the above quest since it\nprobes the details of the mass profile. We investigate here whether this is\nindeed the case considering jointly using weak lensing, magnification and\nflexion. We use a Fisher matrix analysis to forecast the relative improvement\nin the mass accuracy for different assumptions on the shear and flexion signal\n- to - noise (S/N) ratio also varying the cluster mass, redshift, and\nellipticity. It turns out that the error on the cluster mass may be reduced up\nto a factor 2 for reasonable values of the flexion S/N ratio. As a general\nresult, we get that the improvement in mass accuracy is larger for more\nflattened haloes, but extracting general trends is a difficult because of the\nmany parameters at play.

One of the key\nchallenges that this study tries to address is how to classify objects that\nexhibit changes in their behaviour over time, for example how to classify\ncompanies' share price stability over a period of time or how to classify\nstudents' preferences for subjects while they are progressing through school. A\nspecific case the paper considers is the strategy of players in public goods\ngames (as common in economics) across multiple consecutive games. Initial\nclassification starts from expert definitions specifying class allocation for\nplayers based on aggregated attributes of the temporal data. Based on these\ninitial classifications, the optimisation process tries to find an improved\nclassifier which produces the best possible compact classes of objects\n(players) for every time point in the temporal data. The compactness of the\nclasses is measured by a cost function based on internal cluster indices like\nthe Dunn Index, distance measures like Euclidean distance or statistically\nderived measures like standard deviation. The paper discusses the approach in\nthe context of incorporating changing player strategies in the aforementioned\npublic good games, where common classification approaches so far do not\nconsider such changes in behaviour resulting from learning or in-game\nexperience. By using the proposed process for classifying temporal data and the\nactual players' contribution during the games, we aim to produce a more refined\nclassification which in turn may inform the interpretation of public goods game\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2016 11:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-21"}

It is an\nFU Orionis-type object with an atypically low outburst luminosity. Because it\nwas well characterized in the pre-outburst phase, HBC 722 is one of the few\nFUors where we can learn about the physical changes and processes associated\nwith the eruption. We monitored the source in the BVRIJHKs bands from the\nground, and at 3.6 and 4.5 $\\mu$m from space with the Spitzer Space Telescope.\nWe analyzed the light curves and the spectral energy distribution by fitting a\nseries of steady accretion disk models at many epochs. We also analyzed the\nspectral properties of the source based on new optical and infrared spectra. We\nalso mapped HBC 722 and its surroundings at millimeter wavelengths. From the\nlight curve analysis we concluded that the first peak of the outburst in 2010\nSeptember was due to an abrupt increase of the accretion rate in the innermost\npart of the system. This was followed by a long term process, when the\nbrightening was mainly due to a gradual increase of the accretion rate and the\nemitting area. Our new observations show that the source is currently in a\nconstant plateau phase. We found that around the peak the continuum was bluer\nand the H$\\alpha$ profile changed significantly between 2012 and 2013. The\nsource was not detected in the millimeter continuum, but we discovered a\nflattened molecular gas structure with a diameter of 1700 au and mass of 0.3\nM$_{\\odot}$ centered on HBC 722. While the first brightness peak could be\ninterpreted as a rapid fall of piled-up material from the inner disk onto the\nstar, the later monotonic flux rise suggests the outward expansion of a hot\ncomponent according to the theory of Bell & Lin (1994). Our study of HBC 722\ndemonstrated that accretion-related outbursts can occur in young stellar\nobjects even with very low mass disks, in the late Class II phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2016 11:55:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-30"}

When the radiating object is\nrotating like for instance a star, special classes of solutions to Maxwell\nequations are worthwhile to study such as quasi-stationary regimes. Moreover,\nin high-energy astrophysics, strong gravitational and magnetic fields are\npresent especially around rotating neutron stars. In order to study such\nsystems, we designed an algorithm to solve the time-dependent Maxwell equations\nin spherical polar coordinates including general relativity as well as quantum\nelectrodynamical corrections to leading order.

This in turn affects the\nuser experience, in terms of the accuracy of the ranked list of venues,\nespecially for the small screens of mobile devices; misses business\nopportunities; and leads to reduced venues coverage.\n  In this paper, we present CheckInside: a system that can provide a\nfine-grained indoor location-based social network.
