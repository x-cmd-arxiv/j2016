The proposed implementation, called Natural\nSteganography, considers the sensor noise naturally present in the raw images\nand uses the principle that, by the addition of a specific noise the\nsteganographic embedding tries to mimic a change of ISO sensitivity. The\nembedding methodology consists in 1) perturbing the image in the raw domain, 2)\nmodeling the perturbation in the processed domain, 3) embedding the payload in\nthe processed domain. We show that this methodology is easily tractable\nwhenever the processes are known and enables to embed large and undetectable\npayloads.

This equation of state requires\nthat the dynamic for vacuum is due to the energy exchange with the material\nspecies.

We consider a\nchameleon field in a quartic potential and show that the scale-free nature of\nthis potential allows the chameleon to avoid many of the problems encountered\nby runaway potentials. Following inflation, the chameleon field oscillates\naround the minimum of its effective potential, and rapid changes in its\neffective mass excite perturbations via quantum particle production. The\nquartic model, however, only generates high-energy perturbations at comparably\nhigh temperatures and is able remain a well-behaved effective field theory at\nnucleosynthesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 20:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 20:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-09"}

The CWD model\nunifies several starvation mechanisms known to disrupt or stop star formation\ninto one single physical framework. Galaxies begin accreting star-forming gas\nat early times via a network of primordial filaments, simply related to the\npattern of density fluctuations in the initial conditions. But when\nshell-crossing occurs on intergalactic scales, this pattern is disrupted, and\nthe galaxy detaches from its primordial filaments, ending the accretion of cold\ngas. We argue that CWD encompasses known external processes halting star\nformation, such as harassment, strangulation and starvation. On top of these\nexternal processes, internal feedback processes such as AGN contribute to stop\nin star formation as well.\n  By explicitly pointing out the non-linear nature of CWD events we introduce a\nsimple formalism to identify CWD events in N-body simulations.

The model includes\ntunneling between neighboring layers, bias, intra-layer and inter-layer Coulomb\ninteraction among the electrons. We have found that the general pseudospin\nanisotropy classification scheme used in bilayers applies also to the trilayer\nsituation, with the simple crossing corresponding to an easy-axis ferromagnetic\nanisotropy analogy, and the collapse case corresponding to an easy-plane\nferromagnetic analogy.

The model consists of a Gill-Matsuno type\nsteady atmosphere under the longwave approximation coupled via a\nwind-evaporation-sea surface temperature (WES) feedback to a \"slab\" ocean\nmodel. When projected onto basis functions for the atmosphere the system\nsimplifies to a non-normal set of equations that describes the evolution of\nindividual sea surface temperature (SST) modes, with clean separation between\nsymmetric and anti-symmetric modes. The following major findings result from\nanalysis of the system: (i) a transient growth process exists whereby specific\nSST modes propagate toward lower order modes at the expense of the higher-order\nmodes; (ii) the same dynamical mechanisms govern the evolution of symmetric and\nanti-symmetric SST modes except for the lowest-order wave number, where for\nsymmetric structures the atmospheric Kelvin wave plays a critically different\nrole in enhancing decay; and (iii) the WES feedback is positive for all modes\n(with a maximum for the most equatorially confined antisymmetric structure)\nexcept for the most equatorially confined symmetric mode where the Kelvin wave\ngenerates a negative WES feedback. Taken together, these findings explain why\nequatorially anti-symmetric \"dipole\"-like structures may dominate\nthermodynamically coupled ocean / atmosphere variability in the tropics. The\nrole of non-normality as well as the role of realistic mean states in\nmeridional mode variability are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 23:52:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 20:39:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-06"}

Coded caching is a generalization of conventional caching that considers\nthe possibility of coding in the caches and transmitting coded signals from the\nserver. Prior results in this area demonstrate that huge reductions in\ntransmission rates are possible and this makes coded caching an attractive\noption for the next generation of content-delivery networks. However, these\nresults require that each file hosted in the server be partitioned into a large\nnumber (i.e., the subpacketization level) of non-overlapping subfiles. From a\npractical perspective, this is problematic as it means that prior schemes are\nonly applicable when the size of the files is extremely large. In this work, we\npropose a novel coded caching scheme that enjoys a significantly lower\nsubpacketization level than prior schemes, while only suffering a marginal\nincrease in the transmission rate. In particular, for a fixed cache size, the\nscaling with the number of users is such that the increase in transmission rate\nis negligible, but the decrease in subpacketization level is exponential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 00:30:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-28"}

We present four theoretical light curves of the X-ray flash for two\nvery massive white dwarfs (WDs) of 1.380 and 1.385 M_sun and for two recurrence\nperiods of 0.5 and 1 years. The duration of the X-ray flash is shorter for a\nmore massive WD and for a longer recurrence period. The shortest duration of 14\nhours (0.6 days) among the four cases is obtained for the 1.385 M_sun WD with\none year recurrence period. In general, a nova explosion is relatively weak for\na very short recurrence period, which results in a rather slow evolution toward\nthe optical peak. This slow timescale and the predictability of very short\nrecurrence period novae give us a chance to observe X-ray flashes of recurrent\nnovae. In this context, we report the first attempt, using the Swift\nobservatory, to detect an X-ray flash of the recurrent nova M31N 2008-12a (0.5\nor 1 year recurrence period), which resulted in the non-detection of X-ray\nemission during the period of 8 days before the optical detection.

Existing DBS systems are\nopen-loop such that the system parameters are not adjusted automatically based\non patients behavior. Classification of human behavior is an important step in\nthe design of the next generation of DBS systems that are closed-loop. This\npaper presents a classification approach to recognize such behavioral tasks\nusing the subthalamic nucleus (STN) Local Field Potential (LFP) signals. In our\napproach, we use the time-frequency representation (spectrogram) of the raw LFP\nsignals recorded from left and right STNs as the feature vectors. Then these\nfeatures are combined together via Support Vector Machines (SVM) with Multiple\nKernel Learning (MKL) formulation. The MKL-based classification method is\nutilized to classify different tasks: button press, mouth movement, speech, and\narm movement. Our experiments show that the lp-norm MKL significantly\noutperforms single kernel SVM-based classifiers in classifying behavioral tasks\nof five subjects even using signals acquired with a low sampling rate of 10 Hz.\nThis leads to a lower computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 07:28:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

As a consequence of the large\nmuon range the effective area is significantly larger but the field of view is\nrestricted to the Northern Hemisphere. IceCube data from 2009 through 2015 have\nbeen analyzed using a likelihood approach based on the reconstructed muon\nenergy and zenith angle. At the highest neutrino energies between 191 TeV and\n8.3 PeV a significant astrophysical contribution is observed, excluding a\npurely atmospheric origin of these events at $5.6\\,\\sigma$ significance.

We find that the induced spin\nsplitting of the graphene bands is of the order of 10 meV for a monolayer of\nhBN, decreasing in magnitude but alternating in sign by adding each new\ninsulating layer. We find that the proximity exchange can be giant if there is\na resonant $d$ level of the transition metal close to the Dirac point. Our\ncalculations suggest that this effect could be present in Co heterostructures,\nin which a $d$ level strongly hybridizes with the valence-band orbitals of\ngraphene. Since this hybridization is spin dependent, the proximity spin\nsplitting is unusually large, about 10 meV even for two layers of hBN. An\nexternal electric field can change the offset of the graphene and\ntransition-metal orbitals and can lead to a reversal of the sign of the\nexchange parameter. This we predict to happen for the case of two monolayers of\nhBN, enabling electrical control of proximity spin polarization (but also spin\ninjection) in graphene/hBN/Co structures. Nickel-based heterostructures show\nweaker proximity effects than cobalt heterostructures. We introduce two\nphenomenological models to describe the first-principles data. The minimal\nmodel comprises the graphene (effective) $p_z$ orbitals and can be used to\nstudy transport in graphene with proximity exchange, while the $p_z$-$d$ model\nalso includes hybridization with $d$ orbitals, which is important to capture\nthe giant proximity exchange. Crucial to both models is the\npseudospin-dependent exchange coupling, needed to describe the different spin\nsplittings of the valence and conduction bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 08:47:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2016 05:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

We first build an analytical model of\nthe flow induced by a single flagellum in a thin film and then use the model,\nand its extension to multiple flagella, to compare with experimental\nmeasurements. The results we obtain are in agreement with the flagellar\nhypothesis. The model provides further quantitative insight into the flagella\norientations and their spatial distributions as well as the tangential speed\nprofile. In particular, the model suggests that flagella are on average\npointing radially out of the swarm and are not wrapped tangentially.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 10:42:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-28"}

The H$_{2}$ molecule does not emit efficiently in the\ncold interstellar medium, hence the molecular gas content of galaxies is\ntypically inferred using indirect tracers. At low metallicity and in other\nextreme environments, these tracers can be subject to substantial biases. We\npresent a new method of estimating total molecular gas mass in galaxies\ndirectly from pure mid-infrared rotational H$_{2}$ emission. By assuming a\npower-law distribution of H$_{2}$ rotational temperatures, we can accurately\nmodel H$_{2}$ excitation and reliably obtain warm ($T\\!\\gtrsim\\!100$ K) H$_{2}$\ngas masses by varying only the power law's slope. With sensitivities typical of\nSpitzer/IRS, we are able to directly probe the H$_{2}$ content via rotational\nemission down to ~80 K, accounting for ~15% of the total molecular gas mass in\na galaxy. By extrapolating the fitted power law temperature distributions to a\ncalibrated \\emph{single} lower cutoff temperature, the model also recovers the\ntotal molecular content within a factor of ~2.2 in a diverse sample of\ngalaxies, and a subset of broken power law models performs similarly well. In\nULIRGs, the fraction of warm H$_{2}$ gas rises with dust temperature, with some\ndependency on $\\alpha_\\mathrm{CO}$. In a sample of five low metallicity\ngalaxies ranging down to 12+log[O/H]=7.8, the model yields molecular masses up\nto ~100 times larger than implied by CO, in good agreement with other methods\nbased on dust mass and star formation depletion timescale. This technique\noffers real promise for assessing molecular content in the early universe where\nCO and dust-based methods may fail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 11:09:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

Recent works report the evidence for a possible positional correlation\nbetween the reconstructed neutrino arrival directions and the positions in the\nsky of low power, high-energy emitting BL Lac objects (HBL). Assuming that\n$\\gamma$-ray emitting HBL form the bulk of the sources of high-energy neutrinos\nabove 100 TeV, we intend to calculate the number of events expected to be\ndetected for each source by IceCube and KM3NeT. Based on a simple\ntheoretically-motivated framework inspired by the structured jet scenario for\nthese sources, we postulate a direct proportionality between high-energy\n$\\gamma$-ray and neutrino fluxes.

For KM3NeT the calculated rates are higher, with several sources\nwith expected rate exceeding 1 yr$^{-1}$. This, coupled with the improved\nangular resolution, implies that the HBL origin can be effectively tested with\nfew years of observation of KM3NeT (and IceCube Gen2, for which similar\nperformances are foreseen) through the direct association of neutrinos and\nsingle HBL.

With a measured\nrecurrence period of $P_\\mathrm{rec}=351\\pm13$ days (we believe the true value\nto be half of this) and a white dwarf very close to the Chandrasekhar limit,\nM31N 2008-12a has become the leading pre-explosion supernova type Ia progenitor\ncandidate. Following multi-wavelength follow-up observations of the 2013 and\n2014 eruptions, we initiated a campaign to ensure early detection of the\npredicted 2015 eruption, which triggered ambitious ground and space-based\nfollow-up programs. In this paper we present the 2015 detection; visible to\nnear-infrared photometry and visible spectroscopy; and ultraviolet and X-ray\nobservations from the Swift observatory. The LCOGT 2m (Hawaii) discovered the\n2015 eruption, estimated to have commenced at Aug. $28.28\\pm0.12$ UT. The\n2013-2015 eruptions are remarkably similar at all wavelengths. New early\nspectroscopic observations reveal short-lived emission from material with\nvelocities $\\sim13000$ km s$^{-1}$, possibly collimated outflows. Photometric\nand spectroscopic observations of the eruption provide strong evidence\nsupporting a red giant donor. An apparently stochastic variability during the\nearly super-soft X-ray phase was comparable in amplitude and duration to past\neruptions, but the 2013 and 2015 eruptions show evidence of a brief flux dip\nduring this phase. The multi-eruption Swift/XRT spectra show tentative evidence\nof high-ionization emission lines above a high-temperature continuum. Following\nHenze et al. (2015a), the updated recurrence period based on all known\neruptions is $P_\\mathrm{rec}=174\\pm10$ d, and we expect the next eruption of\nM31N 2008-12a to occur around mid-Sep. 2016.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 13:21:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 17:29:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

The processor may stall for a\nconsiderable interval while waiting to access the data stored in the cache\nblocks in LLC, if there are no independent instructions to execute. To provide\naccelerated service to the critical loads requests from LLC, this work\nconcentrates on leveraging the additional capacity offered by replacing\nSRAM-based L2 with Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory (STT-RAM) to\naccommodate frequently accessed cache blocks in exclusive read mode in favor of\nreducing the overall read service time.

As is well\nknown, the presence of virtual particles in vacuum provides the so famous and\npuzzling contributions to the vacuum energy.

However, we argue that\nthese also imply the presence of a mass density of virtual particles in every\nvolume cell of space-time. The most important contribution comes from quantum\ngravity $S^{2}\\times S^{2}$ bubbles, corresponding to virtual black hole pairs.\nThe presence of virtual masses could lead to another paradox: the space-time\nitself would have an intrinsic virtual mass density contribution leading to a\ndisastrous contraction - as is known, no negative masses exist in general\nrelativity. We dub this effect {\\it the cosmological problem of second type}:\nif not other counter-terms existed, the vacuum energy would be inevitably\ndestabilized by virtual-mass contributions. It would be conceivable that the\ncosmological problem of second type could solve the first one. Virtual masses\nrenormalize the vacuum energy to an unpredicted parameter, as in the\nrenormalization procedure of the Standard Model charges.

A thin film\nmodel is employed that accounts for capillarity through a Laplace pressure and\nfor the spatially varying wettability through a Derjaguin (or disjoining)\npressure.

We\nestimate a full 3D mesh and show that 2D joints alone carry a surprising amount\nof information about body shape. The problem is challenging because of the\ncomplexity of the human body, articulation, occlusion, clothing, lighting, and\nthe inherent ambiguity in inferring 3D from 2D. To solve this, we first use a\nrecently published CNN-based method, DeepCut, to predict (bottom-up) the 2D\nbody joint locations. We then fit (top-down) a recently published statistical\nbody shape model, called SMPL, to the 2D joints. We do so by minimizing an\nobjective function that penalizes the error between the projected 3D model\njoints and detected 2D joints. Because SMPL captures correlations in human\nshape across the population, we are able to robustly fit it to very little\ndata. We further leverage the 3D model to prevent solutions that cause\ninterpenetration. We evaluate our method, SMPLify, on the Leeds Sports,\nHumanEva, and Human3.6M datasets, showing superior pose accuracy with respect\nto the state of the art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 14:46:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-28"}

In the inflationary Universe, i.e., de Sitter space, the\nvacuum field fluctuations $\\left< {\\delta \\phi }^{ 2 } \\right>$ enlarge in\nproportion to the Hubble scale $H^{2}$. Therefore, the large inflationary\nvacuum fluctuations of the Higgs field $\\left< {\\delta \\phi }^{ 2 } \\right>$\nare potentially catastrophic to trigger the vacuum transition to the\nnegative-energy Planck-scale vacuum state and cause an immediate collapse of\nthe Universe. However, the vacuum field fluctuations $\\left< {\\delta \\phi }^{ 2\n} \\right>$, i.e., the vacuum expectation values have an ultraviolet divergence,\nand therefore a renormalization is necessary to estimate the physical effects\nof the vacuum transition. Thus, in this paper, we revisit the electroweak\nvacuum instability from the perspective of quantum field theory (QFT) in curved\nspace-time, and discuss the dynamical behavior of the homogeneous Higgs field\n$\\phi$ determined by the effective potential ${ V }_{\\rm eff}\\left( \\phi\n\\right)$ in curved space-time and the renormalized vacuum fluctuations $\\left<\n{\\delta \\phi }^{ 2 } \\right>_{\\rm ren}$ via adiabatic regularization and\npoint-splitting regularization.

A simple\ndynamic model shows how an organization can enter into a self-reinforcing cycle\nof increasing decision workload until the demand for decisions exceeds the\ndecision-making capacity of the organization. We then extend the model to more\ncomplex networked organizations and show that they also experience a form of\nself-reinforcing degradation.

However, no interstellar comets have\never been detected, despite the fact that their hyperbolic orbits would make\nthem readily identifiable as unrelated to the solar system. Moro-Mart\\'in et\nal. 2009 have made a detailed and reasonable estimate of the properties of the\ninterstellar comet population. We extend their estimates of detectability with\na numerical model that allows us to consider \"close\" interstellar comets, e.g.,\nthose that come within the orbit of Jupiter. We include several constraints on\na \"detectable\" object that allow for realistic estimates of the frequency of\ndetections expected from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and other\nsurveys. The influence of several of the assumed model parameters on the\nfrequency of detections is explored in detail.

Using simulated LSST-like astrometric data, we study the\nproblem of orbit determination for these bodies, finding that LSST could\nidentify their orbits as hyperbolic and determine an ephemeris sufficiently\naccurate for follow-up in about 4-7 days.

However, to fully sample\na scene in this way requires at least the same number of correlation\nmeasurements as there are pixels in the reconstructed image. Therefore\nsingle-pixel imaging systems typically exhibit low frame-rates. To mitigate\nthis, a range of compressive sensing techniques have been developed which rely\non a priori knowledge of the scene to reconstruct images from an under-sampled\nset of measurements. In this work we take a different approach and adopt a\nstrategy inspired by the foveated vision systems found in the animal kingdom -\na framework that exploits the spatio-temporal redundancy present in many\ndynamic scenes. In our single-pixel imaging system a high-resolution foveal\nregion follows motion within the scene, but unlike a simple zoom, every frame\ndelivers new spatial information from across the entire field-of-view. Using\nthis approach we demonstrate a four-fold reduction in the time taken to record\nthe detail of rapidly evolving features, whilst simultaneously accumulating\ndetail of more slowly evolving regions over several consecutive frames. This\ntiered super-sampling technique enables the reconstruction of video streams in\nwhich both the resolution and the effective exposure-time spatially vary and\nadapt dynamically in response to the evolution of the scene.

In 10-d spacetimes, general\nparametrizations for generic off-diagonal metrics, nonlinear and linear\nconnections and matter sources, when the equations of motion decouple in very\ngeneral forms are considered. This allows us to construct a variety of exact\nsolutions when the coefficients of fundamental geometric/physical objects\ndepend on all higher dimensional spacetime coordinates via corresponding\nclasses of generating and integration functions, generalized effective sources\nand integration constants. Such generalized solutions are determined by generic\noff-diagonal metrics and nonlinear and/or linear connections. In particular, as\nconfigurations which are warped/compactified to lower dimensions and for\nLevi-Civita connections. The corresponding metrics can have (non) Killing\nand/or Lie algebra symmetries and/or describe (1+2)-d and/or (1+3)-d domain\nwall configurations, with possible warping nearly almost-K\\\"ahler manifolds,\nwith gravitational and gauge instantons for nonlinear vacuum configurations and\neffective polarizations of cosmological and interaction constants encoding\nstring gravity effects. A series of examples of exact solutions describing\ngeneric off-diagonal supergravity modifications to black hole/ ellipsoid and\nsolitonic configurations are provided and analyzed.

In this case back scattering of\nelectrons ($k\\rightarrow -k$) is prohibited by the separation of electron\ncurrents. Thus the slab exhibits zero longitudinal resistance and plateaus of\nHall resistance. When the Fermi level is scanning over a Landau level when the\nmagnetic field increases, however, the electron waves locate around the central\naxis of the slab and overlap each other thus back scattering of electrons takes\nplace frequently. Then longitudinal resistance appears and the Hall resistance\ngoes up from one plateau to a new plateau.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 14:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}
