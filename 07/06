We find that the complete synchronization in\npopulation-I and existence of solitary oscillators which escape from the\nsynchronized group in population-II lead to imperfect synchronized states for\nsufficiently small values of nonisochronicity parameter. Interestingly, on\nincreasing the strength of this parameter further there occurs an onset of\nmixed imperfect synchronized states where the solitary oscillators occur from\nboth the populations. Synchronized oscillators from both the populations are\nlocked to a common average frequency. In both the cases of imperfect\nsynchronized states synchronized oscillators exhibit periodic motion while the\nsolitary oscillators are quasi-periodic in nature. In this region, for\nspatially prepared initial conditions, we can observe the mixed chimera states\nwhere the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized oscillations occur\nfrom both the populations. On the other hand, imperfect synchronized states are\nnot always stable, and they can drift aperiodically due to instability caused\nby an increase of nonisochronicity parameter. We observe that these states are\nrobust to the introduction of frequency mismatch between the two populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2016 16:06:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

By using\nan analogy to a physical model, we study this system in the classical and\nquantum frameworks. Classically, the dynamic optimization problem is equivalent\nto a classical mechanics constrained system, so we must use the Dirac method to\nanalyze it in a correct way. We find that there are two second-class\nconstraints in the model: one fix the momenta associated with the control\nvariables, and the other is a reminder of the optimal control law. The dynamic\nevolution of this constrained system is given by the Dirac's bracket of the\ncanonical variables with the Hamiltonian. This dynamic results to be identical\nto the unconstrained one given by the Pontryagin equations, which are the\ncorrect classical equations of motion for our physical optimization problem. In\nthe same Pontryagin scheme, by imposing a closed-loop $\\lambda$-strategy, the\noptimality condition for the action gives a consistency relation, which is\nassociated to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation of the dynamic programming\nmethod. A similar result is achieved by quantizing the classical model. By\nsetting the wave function $\\Psi(x,t) = e^{iS(x,t)}$ in the quantum\nSchr\\\"odinger equation, a non-linear partial equation is obtained for the $S$\nfunction. For the right-hand side quantization, this is the\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, when $S(x,t)$ is identified with the optimal\nvalue function. Thus, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in Bellman's maximum\nprinciple, can be interpreted as the quantum approach of the optimization\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2016 16:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

The reason is that the plasma has not enough time to reach\npressure equilibrium during the heating and traveling pressure fronts develop.\nThe period is a few minutes for typical solar coronal loops, dictated by the\nsound crossing time in the decay phase.

This anomalous\n$T$-dependence indicates that the superconducting state of Nb$_3$Pd$_x$Se$_7$\nis quasi-two-dimensional in nature. This is further supported by a nearly\ndivergent anisotropy in upper-critical fields, i.e. $\\gamma=\nH_{c2}^{b}/H_{c2}^{a^{\\prime}}$, upon approaching $T_c$.

We\nhave used Multiplicative weight no-regret algorithm to obtain a Coarse\nCorrelated Equilibrium (CCE). Then we consider the case when the users can\ndecode ACK/NACK of each other. In this scenario we provide an algorithm to\nmaximize the weighted sum-utility of all the users and obtain a Pareto optimal\npoint. PP is socially optimal but may be unfair to individual users. Next we\nconsider the case where the users can cooperate with each other so as to\ndisagree with the policy which will be unfair to individual user. We then\nobtain a Nash bargaining solution, which in addition to being Pareto optimal,\nis also fair to each user.\n  Next we study a $K$-user fading multiple access wiretap Channel with CSI of\nEve available to the users.

The latter is a linear PDE which describes the Tracy-Widom functions\ncorresponding to general values of $\\beta$. Using his Lax pair, Rumanov derives\nan explicit formula for the Tracy-Widom $\\beta=6$ function in terms of the\nsecond Painlev\\'e transcendent and the solution of an auxiliary ODE.

In this paper, the\nfirst one in a sequel, we show that Rumanov's Lax-pair can be interpreted as a\ncertain gauge transformation of the standard Lax pair for the second Painlev\\'e\nequation. This gauge transformation though contains functional parameters which\nare defined via some auxiliary nonlinear ODE which is equivalent to the\nauxiliary ODE of Rumanov's formula. The gauge-interpretation of Rumanov's\nLax-pair allows us to highlight the steps of the original Rumanov's method\nwhich needs rigorous justifications in order to make the method complete.

Even if in practice the second order correction\nis small the reducibility of the second order expansion to the first order\nexpansion indicates a degeneracy problem.

Of special\ninterest is the emergence of a whole new hydrodynamic physics via a new\ncritical point in the stellar wind flow, which supersedes the critical point in\nParker's [9] hydrodynamic model. The effect of the stellar rotation is shown to\ncause the new critical point to occur lower in the corona, so the stellar wind\nexperiences a stronger afterburner (as in an aircraft jet engine) action in the\ncorona. For strong rotators, the new critical point is shown to occur at a\nfixed location for a given star, determined only by the basic stellar\nparameters like the mass M and the angular velocity, the variations in the\nstellar wind environment notwithstanding. The stellar rotation leads to\nstronger density fall-off and enhanced acceleration of the stellar wind at\nlarge distances from the star - this effect materializes even close to the\nstar, for strong rotators. The stellar rotation causes the physical throat\nsection of the effective de Laval nozzle associated with the stellar wind flow\nto become narrower, indicative of an enhanced flow acceleration. Thus, the\nstellar rotation leads to tenuous and faster stellar wind flows without change\nin the mass flux, and hence provides an efficient physical mechanism for\nprotostars and strong rotators to lose their angular momentum quickly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2016 19:39:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 19:16:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 19:20:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2018 19:28:55 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 2018 16:47:33 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 23 May 2018 15:25:21 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 12 Sep 2018 19:46:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-17"}

In this paper, we characterize the exact\nsecrecy capacity of the MIMO wiretap channel under transmitter and\nreceiver-side power constraints. We first show that solving this problem is\nequivalent to solving the secrecy capacity of the wiretap channel under a\ndouble-sided correlation matrix constraint on the channel input. We show the\nconverse by extending the channel enhancement technique to our case. We present\ntwo achievable schemes that achieve the secrecy capacity: the first achievable\nscheme uses a Gaussian codebook with a fixed mean, and the second achievable\nscheme uses artificial noise (or cooperative jamming) together with a Gaussian\ncodebook. The role of the mean or the artificial noise is to enable energy\ntransfer without sacrificing from the secure rate. This is the first instance\nof a channel model where either the use of a mean signal or the use of channel\nprefixing via artificial noise is strictly necessary for the MIMO wiretap\nchannel. We then extend our work to consider a maximum receiver-side power\nconstraint. This problem is motivated by cognitive radio applications, where an\nadded goal is to decrease the received signal energy (interference temperature)\nat a receiver.

In particular, we describe\nan algorithm to find a Clifford quantum circuit (CNOTs) to transform any\ntwo-dimensional translation-invariant CSS code on qudits of a prime dimension\nwith code distance being the linear system size, into a tensor product of\nfinitely many copies of the qudit toric code and a product state. Thus, the\nnumber of embedded toric codes is the complete invariant of these CSS codes\nunder local Clifford circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2016 19:59:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 23:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-01"}

We\ncompare the scaling of global momentum and heat transfer. The scaling exponents\nare found to be in agreement with experiments. Mean profiles of the\nroot-mean-square velocity as well as the thermal and kinetic energy dissipation\nrates have growing amplitudes with decreasing Prandtl number which underlies a\nmore vigorous bulk turbulence in the low-Pr regime. The skin-friction\ncoefficient displays a Reynolds-number dependence that is close to that of an\nisothermal, intermittently turbulent velocity boundary layer.

We investigate the scaling\nexponents and find a slight decrease in exponent magnitude for the thermal\nboundary layer thickness as Pr decreases, but find the opposite case for the\nvelocity boundary layer thickness scaling. A growing area fraction of turbulent\npatches close to the heating and cooling plates can be detected by exceeding a\nlocally defined shear Reynolds number threshold.

Specifically, given an $N$-relay\ndiamond network, this problem seeks to derive fundamental guarantees on the\ncapacity of the best $k$-relay subnetwork, as a function of the full network\ncapacity. The main focus of this work is on the case when $k=N-1$ relays are\nselected out of the $N$ possible ones. First, a simple algorithm, which removes\nthe relay with the minimum capacity (i.e., the worst relay), is analyzed and it\nis shown that the remaining $(N-1)$-relay subnetwork has an approximate (i.e.,\noptimal up to a constant gap) HD capacity that is at least half of the\napproximate HD capacity of the full network. This fraction guarantee is shown\nto be tight if only the single relay capacities are known, i.e., there exists a\nclass of Gaussian HD diamond networks with $N$ relays where, by removing the\nworst relay, the subnetwork of the remaining $k=N-1$ relays has an approximate\ncapacity equal to half of the approximate capacity of the full network. Next,\nthis work proves a fundamental guarantee, which improves over the previous\nfraction: there always exists a subnetwork of $k=N-1$ relays that achieves at\nleast a fraction $\\frac{N-1}{N}$ of the approximate capacity of the full\nnetwork. This fraction is proved to be tight and it is shown that any optimal\nschedule of the full network can be used by at least one of the $N$ subnetworks\nof $N-1$ relays to achieve a worst-case performance guarantee of\n$\\frac{N-1}{N}$. Additionally, these results are extended to derive lower\nbounds on the fraction guarantee for general $k \\in [1:N]$. The key steps in\nthe proofs lie in the derivation of properties of submodular functions, which\nprovide a combinatorial handle on the network simplification problem in\nGaussian HD diamond networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2016 00:00:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 19:48:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 18:19:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-11"}

We illustrate our methodology\nwith a particular example in which we study a population with an\noxygen-regulated proliferation rate. Our formulation is based on an\nage-dependent stochastic process. Cells within the population are characterised\nby their age. The age-dependent (oxygen-regulated) birth rate is given by a\nstochastic model of oxygen-dependent cell cycle progression. We then formulate\nan age-dependent birth-and-death process, which dictates the time evolution of\nthe cell population. The population is under a feedback loop which controls its\nsteady state size: cells consume oxygen which in turns fuels cell\nproliferation. We show that our stochastic model of cell cycle progression\nallows for heterogeneity within the cell population induced by stochastic\neffects. Such heterogeneous behaviour is reflected in variations in the\nproliferation rate. Within this set-up, we have established three main results.\nFirst, we have shown that the age to the G1/S transition, which essentially\ndetermines the birth rate, exhibits a remarkably simple scaling behaviour. This\nallows for a huge simplification of our numerical methodology. A further result\nis the observation that heterogeneous populations undergo an internal process\nof quasi-neutral competition. Finally, we investigated the effects of\ncell-cycle-phase dependent therapies (such as radiation therapy) on\nheterogeneous populations. In particular, we have studied the case in which the\npopulation contains a quiescent sub-population. Our mean-field analysis and\nnumerical simulations confirm that, if the survival fraction of the therapy is\ntoo high, rescue of the quiescent population occurs. This gives rise to\nemergence of resistance to therapy since the rescued population is less\nsensitive to therapy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2016 01:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}

The classical Minimum\nMean Square Error (MMSE) is a special case of the MMPE. Several bounds,\nproperties and applications of the MMPE are derived and discussed. The optimal\nMMPE estimator is found for Gaussian and binary input distributions. Properties\nof the MMPE as a function of the input distribution, SNR and order $p$ are\nderived. In particular, it is shown that the MMPE is a continuous function of\n$p$ and SNR. These results are possible in view of interpolation and change of\nmeasure bounds on the MMPE. The `Single-Crossing-Point Property' (SCPP) that\nbounds the MMSE for all SNR values {\\it above} a certain value, at which the\nMMSE is known, together with the I-MMSE relationship is a powerful tool in\nderiving converse proofs in information theory. By studying the notion of\nconditional MMPE, a unifying proof (i.e., for any $p$) of the SCPP is shown. A\ncomplementary bound to the SCPP is then shown, which bounds the MMPE for all\nSNR values {\\it below} a certain value, at which the MMPE is known. As a first\napplication of the MMPE, a bound on the conditional differential entropy in\nterms of the MMPE is provided, which then yields a generalization of the\nOzarow-Wyner lower bound on the mutual information achieved by a discrete input\non a Gaussian noise channel. As a second application, the MMPE is shown to\nimprove on previous characterizations of the phase transition phenomenon that\nmanifests, in the limit as the length of the capacity achieving code goes to\ninfinity, as a discontinuity of the MMSE as a function of SNR. As a final\napplication, the MMPE is used to show bounds on the second derivative of mutual\ninformation, that tighten previously known bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2016 02:08:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-07"}

The highest and lowest order\nterms of the equations are constant-coefficient, positive linear operators,\nwhich suggests a natural preconditioning strategy. Such nonlinear elliptic\nequations often arise from time discretization of parabolic equations that\nmodel various biological and physical phenomena, in particular, liquid\ncrystals, thin film epitaxial growth and phase transformations. The analyses of\nthe schemes involve the characterization of the strictly convex energies\nassociated with the equations. We first give a general framework for PSD in\ngeneric Hilbert spaces. Based on certain reasonable assumptions of the linear\npre-conditioner, a geometric convergence rate is shown for the nonlinear PSD\niteration. We then apply the general the theory to the fourth and sixth-order\nproblems of interest, making use of Sobolev embedding and regularity results to\nconfirm the appropriateness of our pre-conditioners for the regularized\np-Lapacian problems. Our results include a sharper theoretical convergence\nresult for p-Laplacian systems compared to what may be found in existing works.\nWe demonstrate rigorously how to apply the theory in the finite dimensional\nsetting using finite difference discretization methods.

Attosecond physics deals with phenomena\noccurring when ultrashort laser pulses, with duration on the femto- and\nsub-femtosecond time scales, interact with atoms, molecules or solids. The\nlaser-induced electron dynamics occurs natively on a timescale down to a few\nhundred or even tens of attoseconds, which is comparable with the optical\nfield. On the other hand, the second branch involves the manipulation and\nengineering of mesoscopic systems, such as solids, metals and dielectrics, with\nnanometric precision. Although nano-engineering is a vast and well-established\nresearch field on its own, the merger with intense laser physics is relatively\nrecent. In this article we present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical\noverview of physics that takes place when short and intense laser pulses\ninteract with nanosystems, such as metallic and dielectric nanostructures. In\nparticular we elucidate how the spatially inhomogeneous laser induced fields at\na nanometer scale modify the laser-driven electron dynamics. Consequently, this\nhas important impact on pivotal processes such as ATI and HHG. The deep\nunderstanding of the coupled dynamics between these spatially inhomogeneous\nfields and matter configures a promising way to new avenues of research and\napplications. Thanks to the maturity that attosecond physics has reached,\ntogether with the tremendous advance in material engineering and manipulation\ntechniques, the age of atto-nano physics has begun, but it is in the initial\nstage. We present thus some of the open questions, challenges and prospects for\nexperimental confirmation of theoretical predictions, as well as experiments\naimed at characterizing the induced fields and the unique electron dynamics\ninitiated by them with high temporal and spatial resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2016 05:09:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

The key technical difficulty in the study of these dynamics is\nthat the right-hand sides of the equations are discontinuous and thus their\nsolutions must be intended in some generalized sense: in our analysis, we\nconsider both Carath\\'eodory and Krasowskii solutions. We first prove existence\nand completeness of Carath\\'eodory solutions from every initial condition and\nwe highlight a pathological behaviour of Carath\\'eodory solutions, which can\nconverge to points that are not (Carath\\'eodory) equilibria. Notably, such\npoints can be arbitrarily far from consensus and indeed simulations show that\nconvergence to non-consensus configurations is very common. In order to cope\nwith these pathological attractors, we then study Krasowskii solutions. We give\nan estimate of the asymptotic distance of all Krasowskii solutions from\nconsensus and we prove its tightness via an example: this estimate is quadratic\nin the number of agents, implying that quantization can drastically destroy\nconsensus.

Comparing progenitors, descendants, and\ngalaxies selected at fixed number density at each redshift, we find differences\nof up to a factor of three for galaxy and interstellar medium (ISM) masses. The\ndifference is somewhat larger for black hole masses. The scatter in ISM mass\nincreases significantly towards low redshift with all selection techniques. We\nuse the fixed number density technique to study the assembly of dark matter,\ngas, stars, and black holes and the evolution in accretion and star formation\nrates. We find three different regimes for massive galaxies, consistent with\nobservations: at high redshift the gas accretion rate dominates, at\nintermediate redshifts the star formation rate is the highest, and at low\nredshift galaxies grow mostly through mergers. Quiescent galaxies have much\nlower ISM masses (by definition) and much higher black hole masses, but the\nstellar and halo masses are fairly similar. Without active galactic nucleus\n(AGN) feedback, massive galaxies are dominated by star formation down to z=0\nand most of their stellar mass growth occurs in the centre.

At LHC and top RHIC\nenergies, QCD matter is studied at very high temperatures and nearly vanishing\nnet-baryon densities. There is evidence that a Quark-Gluon-Plasma (QGP) was\ncreated at experiments at RHIC and LHC. The transition from the QGP back to the\nhadron gas is found to be a smooth cross over. For larger net-baryon densities\nand lower temperatures, it is expected that the QCD phase diagram exhibits a\nrich structure, such as a first-order phase transition between hadronic and\npartonic matter which terminates in a critical point, or exotic phases like\nquarkyonic matter. The discovery of these landmarks would be a breakthrough in\nour understanding of the strong interaction and is therefore in the focus of\nvarious high-energy heavy-ion research programs. The Compressed Baryonic Matter\n(CBM) experiment at FAIR will play a unique role in the exploration of the QCD\nphase diagram in the region of high net-baryon densities, because it is\ndesigned to run at unprecedented interaction rates. High-rate operation is the\nkey prerequisite for high-precision measurements of multi-differential\nobservables and of rare diagnostic probes which are sensitive to the dense\nphase of the nuclear fireball. The goal of the CBM experiment at SIS100\n(sqrt(s_NN) = 2.7 - 4.9 GeV) is to discover fundamental properties of QCD\nmatter: the phase structure at large baryon-chemical potentials (mu_B > 500\nMeV), effects of chiral symmetry, and the equation-of-state at high density as\nit is expected to occur in the core of neutron stars. In this article, we\nreview the motivation for and the physics programme of CBM, including\nactivities before the start of data taking in 2022, in the context of the\nworldwide efforts to explore high-density QCD matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2016 06:29:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 15:09:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 09:41:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-30"}

First the problem is considered with a charge rotating\naround a conducting cylinder immersed in a homogeneous medium. The surface\ncharge and current densities induced on the cylinder surface are evaluated. A\nformula is derived for the spectral-angular density of the radiation intensity.\nIn the second part, we study the radiation for a charge rotating around a\ndiffraction grating on a cylindrical surface with metallic strips parallel to\nthe cylinder axis. The effect of the grating on the radiation intensity is\napproximated by the surface currents induced on the strips by the field of the\nrotating charge. The expressions are derived for the electric and magnetic\nfields and for the angular density of the radiation intensity on a given\nharmonic. We show that the interference between the synchrotron and\nSmith-Purcell radiations may lead to interesting features. In particular, the\nbehavior of the radiation intensity on large harmonics can be essentially\ndifferent from that for a charge rotating in the vacuum or around a solid\ncylinder.

For given characteristics of the\ncharge, by the choice of the parameters of the diffraction grating, one can\nhave highly directional radiation near the normal to the plane of the charge\nrotation. With decreasing energy, the relative contribution of the synchrotron\nradiation decreases and the Smith-Purcell part is dominant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2016 08:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

The adhesion bonds attract each other and often aggregate into large\nclusters that are central to many biological processes. One possible origin of\nattractive interactions between adhesion bonds is the elastic response of the\nmembranes to their deformation by the bonds. Here, we analyze these\nelasticity-mediated interactions using a novel mean-field approach. Analysis of\nsystems at different densities of bonds, $\\phi$, reveals that the phase diagram\nexhibits a nearly-universal behavior when the temperature $T$ is plotted vs.\nthe scaled density $x=\\phi \\xi^2$, where $\\xi$ is the linear size of the\nmembrane's region affected by a single bond. The critical point $(\\phi_c,T_c)$\nis located at very low densities and slightly below $T_c$ we identify phase\ncoexistence between two low-density phases. Dense domains are observed only\nwhen the height by which the bonds deform the membranes, $h_0$, is much larger\nthan their thermal roughness, $\\Delta$, which occurs at very low temperatures\n$T\\ll T_c$. We conclude that the elasticity-mediated interactions are weak and\ncannot be regarded as responsible for the formation of dense adhesion domains.\nThe weakness of the elasticity-mediated effect and its relevance to dilute\nsystems only can be attributed to the fact that the membrane's elastic energy\nsaturates in the semi-dilute regime, when the typical spacing between the bonds\n$r\\gtrsim \\xi$, i.e., for $x\\lesssim 1$. Therefore, at higher densities, only\nthe mixing entropy of the bonds (which favors uniform distributions) is\nthermodynamically relevant. We discuss the implications of our results to the\nquestion of immunological synapse formation, and demonstrate the\nelasticity-mediated interactions may be involved in the aggregation of these\nsemi-dilute membrane domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2016 08:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-07"}

The present paper\nsuggests that the corrugation of the termination shock, at the onset of\nnon-linearity, may lead towards the desired phenomenology. Non-linear\ncorrugation of the termination shock would convert a fraction of order unity of\nthe incoming ordered magnetic field into downstream turbulence, slowing down\nthe flow to sub-relativistic velocities. The dissipation of turbulence would\nfurther preheat the pair population on short length scales, close to\nequipartition with the magnetic field, thereby reducing the initial high\nmagnetization to values of order unity. Furthermore, it is speculated that the\nturbulence generated by the corrugation pattern may sustain a relativistic\nFermi process, accelerating particles close to the radiation reaction limit, as\nobserved in the Crab nebula. The required corrugation could be induced by the\nfast magnetosonic modes of downstream nebular turbulence; but it could also be\nproduced by upstream turbulence, either carried by the wind or seeded in the\nprecursor by the accelerated particles themselves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2016 09:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

When pairwise similarities are captured by a kernel, the\ndeterminants of submatrices provide a measure of diversity or independence of\nitems within a subset. Matroid theory gives another notion of independence,\nthus giving rise to optimization and sampling questions about Determinantal\nPoint Processes (DPPs) under matroid constraints. Partition constraints, as a\nspecial case, arise naturally when incorporating additional labeling or\nclustering information, besides the kernel, in DPPs. Finding the maximum\ndeterminant submatrix under matroid constraints on its row/column indices has\nbeen previously studied. However, the corresponding question of sampling from\nDPPs under matroid constraints has been unresolved, beyond the simple\ncardinality constrained k-DPPs. We give the first polynomial time algorithm to\nsample exactly from DPPs under partition constraints, for any constant number\nof partitions. We complement this by a complexity theoretic barrier that rules\nout such a result under general matroid constraints. Our experiments indicate\nthat partition-constrained DPPs offer more flexibility and more diversity than\nk-DPPs and their naive extensions, while being reasonably efficient in running\ntime. We also show that a simple greedy initialization followed by local search\ngives improved approximation guarantees for the problem of MAP inference from\nk- DPPs on well-conditioned kernels. Our experiments show that this improvement\nis significant for larger values of k, supporting our theoretical result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2016 10:40:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-07"}

In this review I briefly address recent advances in our\nunderstanding of stellar winds obtained from X-ray observations. The winds of\nOB dwarfs with subtypes later than O9V may be predominantly in a hot phase, and\nX-ray observations offer the best window for their studies. The X-ray\nproperties of OB supergiants are largely determined by the effects of radiative\ntransfer in their clumped stellar winds. The recently suggested method to\ndirectly measure mass-loss rates of O stars by fitting the shapes of X-ray\nemission lines is considered but its validity cannot be confirmed. To obtain\nrobust quantitative information on stellar wind parameters from X-ray\nspectroscopy, a multiwavelength analysis by means of stellar atmosphere models\nis required. Independent groups are now performing such analyses with\nencouraging results. Joint analyses of optical, UV, and X-ray spectra of OB\nsupergiants yield consistent mass-loss rates. Depending on the adopted clumping\nparameters, the empirically derived mass-loss rates are comparable (within a\nfactor of a few) to those predicted by standard recipes (Vink et al. 2001). All\nsufficiently studied O stars display variable X-ray emission that might be\nrelated to corotating interaction regions in their winds.

This\nwork aims to confront the 3 Ms of Chandra X-ray Visionary Program observations\nof this diffuse emission by computing the X-ray emission from these\nhydrodynamic simulations of the colliding WR winds, amid exploring a variety of\nSMBH feedback mechanisms. The major success of the model is that it reproduces\nthe spectral shape from the 2-5 arcsec ring around the SMBH, where most of the\nstellar wind material that is ultimately captured by Sgr A* is shock-heated and\nthermalised.

The flux level of these spectra, as well as 12 $\\times$\n12-arcsec$^2$ images of 4-9 keV, shows that the X-ray flux is tied to the SMBH\nfeedback strength; stronger feedback clears out more hot gas, thereby\ndecreasing the thermal X-ray emission.

At the center of this literature lies the\nquestion of whether there exist fair mechanisms despite strategic behavior of\nthe agents. A fundamental objective function used for measuring fair outcomes\nis the Nash social welfare, defined as the geometric mean of the agent\nutilities. This objective function is maximized by widely known solution\nconcepts such as Nash bargaining and the competitive equilibrium with equal\nincomes. In this work we focus on the question of (approximately) implementing\nthe Nash social welfare. The starting point of our analysis is the Fisher\nmarket, a fundamental model of an economy, whose benchmark is precisely the\n(weighted) Nash social welfare. We begin by studying two extreme classes of\nvaluations functions, namely perfect substitutes and perfect complements, and\nfind that for perfect substitutes, the Fisher market mechanism has a constant\napproximation: at most 2 and at least e1e. However, for perfect complements,\nthe Fisher market does not work well, its bound degrading linearly with the\nnumber of players.\n  Strikingly, the Trading Post mechanism---an indirect market mechanism also\nknown as the Shapley-Shubik game---has significantly better performance than\nthe Fisher market on its own benchmark. Not only does Trading Post achieve an\napproximation of 2 for perfect substitutes, but this bound holds for all\nconcave utilities and becomes arbitrarily close to optimal for Leontief\nutilities (perfect complements), where it reaches $(1+\\epsilon)$ for every\n$\\epsilon > 0$. Moreover, all the Nash equilibria of the Trading Post mechanism\nare pure for all concave utilities and satisfy an important notion of fairness\nknown as proportionality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2016 11:28:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2017 16:24:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 19:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

Young's Law, which\npredicts the equilibrium contact angle of the droplet, also indicates an a\npriori radial force balance for rigid substrates, but not necessarily for soft\nsubstrates which deform under loading.

This approximate theory is the one typically\nadopted in cavity optomechanics and we develop a criterion for its validity.\nHowever, in more general situations the full second-order wave equation\npredicts light dynamics which do not conserve energy, giving rise to parametric\namplification (or reduction) that is forbidden under first order dynamics and\ncan be considered to be the classical counterpart of the dynamical Casimir\neffect.

In this frame, it is found that vortices characterized\nby linear distributions of their radial velocity and arbitrary structures of\ntheir section and azimuthal velocity can be described exactly by a set of\nnonstationary, nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equations. The\nfirst-order problem (i.e., that describing vortices characterized by a linear\nazimuthal velocity field and a quadratic section) consists of a system of 4\ndifferential equations, and each further order introduces in the system three\nadditional ordinary differential equations and two algebraic equations. In\norder to illustrate the behavior of the nonstationary decaying vortices, the\nsystem's solution for the first-order and for the second-order problem is then\nobtained numerically using a Runge-Kutta method. The solutions demonstrate that\ninertial oscillations and an exponential attenuation dominate the vortex\ndynamics: Expansions and shallowings, contractions and deepenings alternate\nduring an exact inertial period while the vortex decays. The dependence of the\nvortex dissipation rate on its initial radius is found to be non-monotonic: It\nis higher for small and large radii. Our analysis adds realism to previous\ntheoretical investigations on mesoscale vortices, represents an ideal tool for\ntesting the accuracy of numerical models in simulating nonlinear, nonstationary\nfrictional frontal phenomena in a rotating ocean, and paves the way to further\nextensions of (semi-) analytical solutions of hydrodynamical geophysical\nproblems to more arbitrary forms and more complex density stratifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2016 15:17:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-07"}

Classical Recursion Theory deals mainly with the properties of\npartial recursive functions. We study several natural decision problems related\nto primitive recursive functions and characterise their degree of\nundecidability.

The origin of W50 is wrapped in the\ninterplay of the wind, supernova remnant and jets. The evolution of the jets on\nthe scales of the nebula is a Rosetta stone for its origin. To disentangle the\nroles of these components, we study physical conditions of the jets propagation\ninside W50, and determine deceleration of the jets. The morphology and\nparameters of the interior of W50 are analyzed using the available observations\nof the eastern X-ray lobe, which traces the jet. In order to estimate\ndeceleration of this jet, we devised a simplistic model of the viscous\ninteraction, via turbulence, of a jet with the ambient medium, which would fit\nmass entrainment from the ambient medium into the jets of the radio galaxy\n3C31, the well studied case of continuously decelerating jets. X-ray\nobservations suggest that the eastern jet persists through W50 as hollow one,\nand is recollimated to the opening $\\sim 30^\\circ$. From the thermal emission\nof the eastern X-ray lobe, we determine a pressure of $P \\sim 3\\cdot 10^{-11}$\nerg/cm$^3$ inside W50. In the frame of a theory of the dynamics of radiative\nsupernova remnants and stellar wind bubbles, this pressure in combination with\nother known parameters restricts W50's origin to a supernova happened $\\sim\n100\\,000$ yr ago.

First of all, I discuss the generalized spin-1/2 equations for\nneutrinos. They have been obtained by means of the Gersten-Sakurai method for\nderivations of arbitrary-spin relativistic equations. Possible physical\nconsequences are discussed. Next, it is easy to check that both Dirac algebraic\nequation $Det (\\hat p - m) =0$ and $Det (\\hat p + m) =0$ for $u-$ and $v-$\n4-spinors have solutions with $p_0= \\pm E_p =\\pm \\sqrt{{\\bf p}^2 +m^2}$. The\nsame is true for higher-spin equations. Meanwhile, every book considers the\nequality $p_0=E_p$ for both $u-$ and $v-$ spinors of the $(1/2,0)\\oplus\n(0,1/2))$ representation only, thus applying the Dirac-Feynman-Stueckelberg\nprocedure for elimination of the negative-energy solutions. The recent work by\nZiino (and, independently, the articles of several others) show that the Fock\nspace can be doubled. We re-consider this possibility on the quantum field\nlevel for $S=1/2$ particles. The third example is: we postulate the\nnon-commutativity of 4-momenta, and we derive the mass splitting in the Dirac\nequation. Some applications are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2016 16:02:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Oct 2018 02:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-10"}

Our approach works at all cosmological scales\n(i.e. sub-horizon and super-horizon ones) and incorporates linear and nonlinear\neffects with respect to energy density fluctuations. We demonstrate that the\nscalar perturbation (i.e. the gravitational potential) as well as the vector\nperturbation can be split into individual contributions from each matter\nsource. Each of these contributions satisfies its own equation. The\nvelocity-independent parts of the individual gravitational potentials are\ncharacterized by a finite time-dependent Yukawa interaction range being the\nsame for each individual contribution. We also obtain the exact form of the\ngravitational potential and vector perturbation related to the discrete matter\nsources. The self-consistency of our approach is thoroughly checked.

Pathological falls\nare usually a result of a compromised motor system, and/or cognition. Very\nlittle research has been conducted on predicting falls based on this premise.\n  Aims: To demonstrate that cognitive and motor tests can be used to create a\nrobust predictive tool for falls.\n  Methods: Three tests of attention and executive function (Stroop, Trail\nMaking, and Semantic Fluency), a measure of physical function (Walk-12), a\nseries of questions (concerning recent falls, surgery and physical function)\nand demographic information were collected from a cohort of 323 patients at a\ntertiary neurological center. The principal outcome was a fall during the\nin-patient stay (n = 54). Data-driven, predictive modelling was employed to\nidentify the statistical modelling strategies which are most accurate in\npredicting falls, and which yield the most parsimonious models of clinical\nrelevance.\n  Results: The Trail test was identified as the best predictor of falls.\nMoreover, addition of any others variables, to the results of the Trail test\ndid not improve the prediction (Wilcoxon signed-rank p < .001). The best\nstatistical strategy for predicting falls was the random forest (Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank p < .001), based solely on results of the Trail test. Tuning of the\nmodel results in the following optimized values: 68% (+- 7.7) sensitivity, 90%\n(+- 2.3) specificity, with a positive predictive value of 60%, when the\nrelevant data is available.\n  Conclusion: Predictive modelling has identified a simple yet powerful machine\nlearning prediction strategy based on a single clinical test, the Trail test.\nPredictive evaluation shows this strategy to be robust, suggesting predictive\nmodelling and machine learning as the standard for future predictive tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2016 17:10:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-03"}
