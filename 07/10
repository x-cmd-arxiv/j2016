In practice, it is common to account for nonresponse under a\nmissing-at-random assumption which although convenient, is rarely appropriate\nwhen nonresponse is nonmonotone. Likelihood and Bayesian missing data\nmethodologies often require specification of a parametric model for the full\ndata law, thus a priori ruling out any prospect for semiparametric inference.\nIn this paper, we propose an all-purpose approach which delivers semiparametric\ninferences when missing data are nonmonotone and not at random. The approach is\nbased on a discrete choice model (DCM) as a means to generate a large class of\nnonmonotone nonresponse mechanisms that are nonignorable. Sufficient conditions\nfor nonparametric identification are given, and a general framework for fully\nparametric and semiparametric inference under an arbitrary DCM is proposed.\nSpecial consideration is given to the case of logit discrete choice nonresponse\nmodel (LDCM) for which we describe generalizations of inverse-probability\nweighting, pattern-mixture estimation, doubly robust estimation and multiply\nrobust estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2016 16:27:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2017 21:23:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2017 13:14:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-20"}

Our interest is in linear approaches to signal recovery, where \"linear\"\nmeans that non-linearity resulting from quantization is ignored and the\nobservations are treated as if they arose from a linear measurement model.\nSpecifically, the focus is on a generalization of a method for one-bit\nobservations due to Plan and Vershynin [\\emph{IEEE~Trans. Inform. Theory,\n\\textbf{59} (2013), 482--494}]. At the heart of the present paper is a precise\ncharacterization of the optimal trade-off between the number of measurements\n$m$ and the bit depth per measurement $b$ given a total budget of $B = m \\cdot\nb$ bits when the goal is to minimize the $\\ell_2$-error in estimating the\nsignal. It turns out that the choice $b = 1$ is optimal for estimating the unit\nvector (direction) corresponding to the signal for any level of additive\nGaussian noise before quantization as well as for a specific model of\nadversarial noise, while the choice $b = 2$ is optimal for estimating the\ndirection and the norm (scale) of the signal. Moreover, Lloyd-Max quantization\nis shown to be an optimal quantization scheme w.r.t. $\\ell_2$-estimation error.\nOur analysis is corroborated by numerical experiments showing nearly perfect\nagreement with our theoretical predictions. The paper is complemented by an\nempirical comparison to alternative methods of signal recovery taking the\nnon-linearity resulting from quantization into account. The results of that\ncomparison point to a regime change depending on the noise level: in a\nlow-noise setting, linear signal recovery falls short of more sophisticated\ncompetitors while being competitive in moderate- and high-noise settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2016 19:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

Here, we demonstrate electrical injection of helically\nspin-polarized current into graphene through a 3D TI in a mechanically stacked\nheterostructure between Bi2Te2Se (a TI) and chemical vapor deposition\n(CVD)-grown graphene, using the spin potentiometric measurement. When a dc\ncurrent is flowing from the TI to graphene, we detect a striking step-like\nvoltage change (spin signal) in both the TI and graphene using ferromagnetic\n(FM) probes. The sign of the spin signal can be reversed by reversing the\ndirection of the dc bias current, and the corresponding amplitude of the spin\nsignal increases linearly with the bias current, indicative of a\ncurrent-induced helical spin polarization in both TI and graphene. In contrast,\nthe graphene itself exhibits usual nonlocal spin valve signal when the spins\nare injected using an FM electrode. We discuss possible origins of the helical\nspin polarization injected into the graphene in our TI/graphene heterostructure\nthat may include TSS as well as the spin-orbit coupled Rashba states.

We estimate that Pop III binaries produce approximately 6 eV of\nenergy in the X-rays per hydrogen atom. We calculate the X-ray background for\ndifferent monochromatic photon energies. KeV X-rays redshift and accumulate to\nproduce a strong X-ray background spectrum extending to roughly 500 eV. The\nX-ray background is strong enough to heat the IGM to ~ 1000 K and to ionize a\nfew percent of the neutral hydrogen. These effects are important for an\nunderstanding of the neutral hydrogen hyperfine transition 21-cm line\nsignatures, the Ly alpha forest, and optical depth of the CMB to Thomson\nscattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2016 21:08:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 16:06:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

Such a code is denoted by the triple\n$(n,m,p)$. It is known that $n<4^m$ for all QRACs and $n<2^m$ for classical\nRACs. These bounds are also known to be tight, as explicit constructions exist\nfor $n=4^m-1$ and $n=2^m-1$ for quantum and classical codes respectively. We\ngeneralize (Q)RACs to a scheme encoding $n$ $d$-levels into $m$ (qu)-$d$-levels\nsuch that any $d$-level can be recovered with the probability for every wrong\noutcome value being less than $\\frac{1}{d}$.

Here, we\nstudy sticky and WS programs from the point of view of the behavior of the\nchase procedure, extending the stickiness property of the chase to that of\ngeneralized stickiness of the chase (gsch-property). With this property we\nspecify the semantic class of GSCh programs, which includes sticky and WS\nprograms, and other syntactic subclasses that we identify. In particular, we\nintroduce joint-weakly-sticky (JWS) programs, that include WS programs. We also\npropose a bottom-up QA algorithm for a range of subclasses of GSCh. The\nalgorithm runs in polynomial time (in data) for JWS programs. Unlike the WS\nclass, JWS is closed under a general magic-sets rewriting procedure for the\noptimization of programs with existential rules. We apply the magic-sets\nrewriting in combination with the proposed QA algorithm for the optimization of\nQA over JWS programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2016 02:56:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

The associated constant-delay DDE, obtained by freezing the state\ndependence, is linear and without recurrent dynamics. With state dependent\ndelay terms, on the other hand, the DDE shows very complicated dynamics. To\ninvestigate this, we perform a bifurcation analysis of the system and present\nits bifurcation diagram in the plane of the two feedback strengths. It is\norganized by Hopf-Hopf bifurcation points that give rise to curves of torus\nbifurcation and associated two-frequency dynamics in the form of invariant tori\nand resonance tongues. We numerically determine the type of the Hopf-Hopf\nbifurcation points by computing the normal form on the center manifold; this\nrequires the expansion of the functional defining the state-dependent DDE in a\npower series whose terms up to order three only contain constant delays. We\nimplemented this expansion and the computation of the normal form coefficients\nin Matlab using symbolic differentiation. Numerical continuation of the torus\nbifurcation curves confirms the correctness of our normal form calculations.\nMoreover, it enables us to compute the curves of torus bifurcations more\nglobally, and to find associated curves of saddle-node bifurcations of periodic\norbits that bound the resonance tongues. The tori themselves are computed and\nvisualized in a three-dimensional projection, as well as the planar trace of a\nsuitable Poincar\\'e section. In particular, we compute periodic orbits on\nlocked tori and their associated unstable manifolds. This allows us to study\ntransitions through resonance tongues and the breakup of a 1:4 locked torus.\nThe work presented here demonstrates that state dependence alone is capable of\ngenerating a wealth of dynamical phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2016 02:58:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2016 15:51:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 17:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

These two methods have completely opposing drawbacks: the former,\nwhile offering realistic scenarios, takes too much time to execute; the latter,\nthough it can be completed in a short amount of time, has no clear correlation\nto safety benefits in the real world. To avoid the aforementioned problems, we\npropose Accelerated Evaluation, focusing on the car-following scenario. The\nstochastic human-controlled vehicle (HV) motions are modeled based on 1.3\nmillion miles of naturalistic driving data collected by the University of\nMichigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment Program. The statistics of the HV\nbehaviors are then modified to generate more intense interactions between HVs\nand AVs to accelerate the evaluation procedure. The Importance Sampling theory\nwas used to ensure that the safety benefits of AVs are accurately assessed\nunder accelerated tests. Crash, injury and conflict rates for a simulated AV\nare simulated to demonstrate the proposed approach.

We\ndefine the concept of thresholding as a process of determining a decision\nboundary in the presence of a tunable parameter. The threshold is the maximum\nvalue of this tunable parameter where the conditions of a certain decision are\nsatisfied. We show that thresholding is applicable not only for linear\nclassifiers but also for non-linear classifiers. We show that this is the\nimplicit assumption for many approaches to deal with class imbalance in linear\nclassifiers. We then extend this paradigm beyond linear classification and show\nhow non-linear classification can be dealt with under this umbrella framework\nof thresholding. The proposed method can be used for outlier detection in many\nreal-life scenarios like in manufacturing. In advanced manufacturing units,\nwhere the manufacturing process has matured over time, the number of instances\n(or parts) of the product that need to be rejected (based on a strict regime of\nquality tests) becomes relatively rare and are defined as outliers. How to\ndetect these rare parts or outliers beforehand? How to detect combination of\nconditions leading to these outliers? These are the questions motivating our\nresearch. This paper focuses on prediction of outliers and conditions leading\nto outliers using classification. We address the problem of outlier detection\nusing classification. The classes are good parts (those passing the quality\ntests) and bad parts (those failing the quality tests and can be considered as\noutliers). The rarity of outliers transforms this problem into a\nclass-imbalanced classification problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2016 07:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

We aim to test the hypothesis that\nIFRS are young AGN, particularly GHz peaked-spectrum (GPS) and compact\nsteep-spectrum (CSS) sources that have a low frequency turnover. We use the\nrich radio data set available for the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey\nfields, covering the frequency range between 150 MHz and 34 GHz with up to 19\nwavebands from different telescopes, and build radio spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) for 34 IFRS.

We find IFRS\nusually follow single power laws down to observed frequencies of around 150\nMHz. Mostly, the radio SEDs are steep, but we also find ultra-steep SEDs.

Our analysis reveals that the fractions of GPS and\nCSS sources in the population of IFRS are consistent with the fractions in the\nbroader RL AGN population.

Our first set of results is motivated by\nthe Bitonic TSP problem: given a set of $n$ points in the plane, compute a\nshortest tour consisting of two monotone chains. It is a classic\ndynamic-programming exercise to solve this problem in $O(n^2)$ time. While the\nnear-quadratic dependency of similar dynamic programs for Longest Common\nSubsequence and Discrete Frechet Distance has recently been proven to be\nessentially optimal under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, we show that\nbitonic tours can be found in subquadratic time. More precisely, we present an\nalgorithm that solves bitonic TSP in $O(n \\log^2 n)$ time and its bottleneck\nversion in $O(n \\log^3 n)$ time. Our second set of results concerns the popular\n$k$-OPT heuristic for TSP in the graph setting. More precisely, we study the\n$k$-OPT decision problem, which asks whether a given tour can be improved by a\n$k$-OPT move that replaces $k$ edges in the tour by $k$ new edges. A simple\nalgorithm solves $k$-OPT in $O(n^k)$ time for fixed $k$. For 2-OPT, this is\neasily seen to be optimal. For $k=3$ we prove that an algorithm with a runtime\nof the form $\\tilde{O}(n^{3-\\epsilon})$ exists if and only if All-Pairs\nShortest Paths in weighted digraphs has such an algorithm. The results for\n$k=2,3$ may suggest that the actual time complexity of $k$-OPT is\n$\\Theta(n^k)$. We show that this is not the case, by presenting an algorithm\nthat finds the best $k$-move in $O(n^{\\lfloor 2k/3 \\rfloor + 1})$ time for\nfixed $k \\geq 3$. This implies that 4-OPT can be solved in $O(n^3)$ time,\nmatching the best-known algorithm for 3-OPT. Finally, we show how to beat the\nquadratic barrier for $k=2$ in two important settings, namely for points in the\nplane and when we want to solve 2-OPT repeatedly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2016 09:55:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

More importantly, it serves as a bridge between the early quantum\nfluctuations and the present-day classical structures. Although the transition\nfrom quantum to classical is still not completely understood till date, there\nare two assumptions made in the inflationary paradigm in this regard:\n  (i) the modes (metric perturbations or fluctuations) behave classically once\nthey are well outside the Hubble radius and,\n  (ii) once they become classical they stay classical and hence can be\ndescribed by standard perturbation theory after they re-enter the Hubble\nradius.\n  We critically examine these assumptions for the tensor modes of (linear)\nmetric perturbations in a toy three stage universe with (i) inflation, (ii)\nradiation-dominated and (iii) late-time accelerated phases. The\nquantum-to-classical transition for these modes is evident from the evolution\nof Wigner function in phase space and its peaking on the classical trajectory.\nHowever, a better approach to quantify the degree of classicality and study its\nevolution was given by Mahajan and Padmanabhan [1] using a classicality\nparameter constructed from the parameters of the Wigner function. We study the\nevolution of the classicality parameter across the three phases and it turns\nout that the first assumption holds true, there is emergence of classicality on\nHubble exit, however the latter assumption of \"once classical, always\nclassical\" seems to lie on a shaky ground.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jul 2016 12:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-18"}

Recognizing\nactions thus involves learning a classifier sensitive to these pose transitions\nas well as to static poses. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called\ntransitions forests, an ensemble of decision trees that both learn to\ndiscriminate static poses and transitions between pairs of two independent\nframes. During training, node splitting is driven by alternating two criteria:\nthe standard classification objective that maximizes the discrimination power\nin individual frames, and the proposed one in pairwise frame transitions.\nGrowing the trees tends to group frames that have similar associated\ntransitions and share same action label incorporating temporal information that\nwas not available otherwise. Unlike conventional decision trees where the best\nsplit in a node is determined independently of other nodes, the transition\nforests try to find the best split of nodes jointly (within a layer) for\nincorporating distant node transitions. When inferring the class label of a new\nframe, it is passed down the trees and the prediction is made based on previous\nframe predictions and the current one in an efficient and online manner.

The nature of tactile measurements, the strict time requirements for\nreal-time operation and the multimodality of the involved probability\ndistributions pose remarkable challenges and call for advanced nonlinear\nfiltering techniques.
