The goal is to determine the optimized\nenergy state of the system subject to the constraint of constant angular\nmomentum. Due to the lack of a closed form solution for the full three-body\nproblem, however, we must use use an approximate description of the orbits. We\nfirst consider the Keplerian limit and find that the critical energy states are\nsaddle points, rather than minima, so that these hierarchical systems have no\nstable tidal equilibrium states. We then generalize the calculation so that the\nlunar orbit is described by a time-averaged version of the circular restricted\nthree-body problem.

In response to emergency situations, load\nshedding is a prevailing approach where local protective devices are activated\nto cut a suitable amount of load to quickly rebalance the supply demand and\nhopefully stabilize the system. This traditional emergency control results in\ninterrupted service with severe economic damage to customers. Also, such\ncontrol is usually less effective due to the lack of coordination among\nprotective devices. In this paper, we propose a novel structural emergency\ncontrol to render post-fault dynamics from the critical/emergency fault-cleared\nstate to the stable equilibrium point. This is a new control paradigm that does\nnot rely on any continuous measurement or load shedding, as in the classical\nsetup. Instead, the grid is made stable by discretely relocating the\nequilibrium point and its stability region such that the system is\nconsecutively attracted from the fault-cleared state back to the original\nequilibrium point. The proposed control is designed by solving linear and\nconvex optimization problems, making it possibly scalable to large-scale power\ngrids. Finally, this emergency control scheme can be implemented by exploiting\ntransmission facilities available on the existing grids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 17:12:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2016 16:51:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 19:20:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 18:19:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-31"}

As in fourth-generation systems, such as LTE, 5G systems are likely\nto continue to use single-carrier frequency division multiple-access (SC-FDMA)\non the uplink due to its advantageous peak-to-average power ratio. Moreover, 5G\nsystems are likely to use frequency hopping on the uplink to help randomize\ninterference and provide diversity against frequency-selective fading. In this\npaper, the implications of these and other physical-layer features on uplink\nperformance are assessed using a novel millimeter-wave propagation model\nfeaturing distance-dependent parameters that characterize the path-loss,\nshadowing, and fading. The analysis proceeds by first fixing the location of\nthe mobile devices and finding the performance conditioned on the topology.

To satisfy\nthe constraint of uniform density, the superconducting state of the ladder is\nwritten as a linear combination of the allowed k-states of the tight-binding\nmodel with open boundaries.

To obtain such benefits, we need to have not only good\nestimates of how the traffic is formed but also to have target strategies to\nreduce enough vehicles from the best possible roads in a feasible way. The\nopportunity is that during large events the traffic inconveniences in large\ncities are unusually high, yet temporary, and the entire population may be more\nwilling to adopt collective recommendations for social good. In this paper, we\nintegrate for the first time big data resources to quantify the impact of\nevents and propose target strategies for collective good at urban scale.

The method provides an analytical solution for\nthe computation of precise p-values when its assumptions are met. When its\nassumptions are not met the thresholds generated by Random Field Theory can be\nmore conservative than Bonferroni corrections, which are arguably too stringent\nfor use in fMRI. As this has been well documented theoretically it is\nsurprising that a majority of current studies (~80%) would not meet the\nassumptions of Random Field Theory and therefore would have reduced\nsensitivity. Specifically most data is not smooth enough to meet the good\nlattice assumption. Current studies smooth data on average by twice the voxel\nsize which is rarely sufficient to meet the good lattice assumption. The amount\nof smoothing required for Random Field Theory to produce accurate p-values\nincreases with image resolution and decreases with degrees of freedom. There is\nno rule of thumb that is valid for all study designs but for typical data (3mm\nresolution, and greater than 20 subjects) residual smoothness with FWHM = 4\ntimes voxel size should produce valid results. However, it should be stressed\nthat for higher spatial resolution and lower degrees of freedom the critical\nsmoothness required will increase sharply. This implies that researchers should\ncarefully choose appropriate smoothing kernels. This can be facilitated by the\nsimulations we provide that identify the critical smoothness at which the\napplication of RFT becomes appropriate. For some applications such as\npresurgical mapping or, imaging of small structures, probing the\nlaminar/columnar structure of the cortex these smoothness requirements may be\ntoo great to preserve spatial structure. As such, this study suggests\ndevelopments are needed in Random Field Theory to fully exploit the resolution\nof modern neuroimaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 18:17:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-28"}

We\nconsider the closely-related problem of recovering a signal from its phaseless\nshort-time Fourier transform (STFT) measurements. This problem arises naturally\nin several applications, such as ultra-short laser pulse characterization and\nptychography. The redundancy offered by the STFT enables unique recovery under\nmild conditions. We show that in some cases the unique solution can be obtained\nby the principal eigenvector of a matrix, constructed as the solution of a\nsimple least-squares problem. When these conditions are not met, we suggest\nusing the principal eigenvector of this matrix to initialize non-convex local\noptimization algorithms and propose two such methods. The first is based on\nminimizing the empirical risk loss function, while the second maximizes a\nquadratic function on the manifold of phases. We prove that under appropriate\nconditions, the proposed initialization is close to the underlying signal. We\nthen analyze the geometry of the empirical risk loss function and show\nnumerically that both gradient algorithms converge to the underlying signal\neven with small redundancy in the measurements. In addition, the algorithms are\nrobust to noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 19:08:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 08:05:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 15:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

Efficient pebble\naccretion is likely to be unavoidable in transition disc dust traps, as the\nsize of the dust particles required for pebble accretion are those which are\nmost efficiently trapped in the transition disc dust trap. Rapid pebble\naccretion within the dust trap gives rise, not only to low-mass planets, but to\na large accretion luminosity. This accretion luminosity is sufficient to heat\nthe disc outside the gravitational influence of the planet and makes the disc\nlocally baroclinic, and a source of vorticity. Using numerical simulations we\ndemonstrate that this source of vorticity can lead to the growth of a single\nlarge scale vortex in $\\sim 100$ orbits, which is capable of trapping\nparticles. Finally, we suggest an evolutionary cycle: planet formation proceeds\nthrough pebble accretion, followed by vortex formation and particle trapping in\nthe vortex quenching the planetary accretion and thus removing the vorticity\nsource.

The essential\ndifference between the usual differential geometry and SDG is that the latter\nenriches the real line by introducing infinitesimal of various kinds. Owing to\nthis geometry acquires a tool to penetrate \"infinitesimally small\" parts of a\ngiven manifold. However, to make use of this tool we must switch from the\ncategory of sets to some other suitable category. We try two topoi: the topos\n${\\cal G}$ of germ determined ideals and the so-called Basel topos ${\\cal B}$.\nThe category of manifolds is a subcategory of both of them. In ${\\cal G}$, we\nconstruct a simple model of a contracting sphere.

Isolated white dwarfs emit most of their power from ultraviolet\nto near-infrared wavelengths, but when in close orbits with less dense stars,\nwhite dwarfs can strip material from their companions, and the resulting mass\ntransfer can generate atomic line and X-ray emission, as well as near- and\nmid-infrared radiation if the white dwarf is magnetic. However, even in\nbinaries, white dwarfs are rarely detected at far-infrared or radio\nfrequencies. Here we report the discovery of a white dwarf / cool star binary\nthat emits from X-ray to radio wavelengths. The star, AR Scorpii (henceforth AR\nSco), was classified in the early 1970s as a delta-Scuti star, a common variety\nof periodic variable star. Our observations reveal instead a 3.56 hr period\nclose binary, pulsing in brightness on a period of 1.97 min. The pulses are so\nintense that AR Sco's optical flux can increase by a factor of four within 30\ns, and they are detectable at radio frequencies, the first such detection for\nany white dwarf system. They reflect the spin of a magnetic white dwarf which\nwe find to be slowing down on a 10^7 yr timescale. The spin-down power is an\norder of magnitude larger than that seen in electromagnetic radiation, which,\ntogether with an absence of obvious signs of accretion, suggests that AR Sco is\nprimarily spin-powered. Although the pulsations are driven by the white dwarf's\nspin, they originate in large part from the cool star. AR Sco's broad-band\nspectrum is characteristic of synchrotron radiation, requiring relativistic\nelectrons. These must either originate from near the white dwarf or be\ngenerated in situ at the M star through direct interaction with the white\ndwarf's magnetosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 21:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-05"}

The model implies that bodies scattered\noutward by Neptune to semimajor axes a>50 au often evolve into resonances which\nsubsequently act to raise the perihelion distances of orbits to q>40 au. The\nimplication of the model is that the orbits with 50<a<100 au and q>40 au should\ncluster near (but not in) the resonances with Neptune (3:1 at a=62.6 au, 4:1 at\na=75.9 au, 5:1 at a=88.0 au, etc.). The recent detection of several distant\nKuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) near resonances is consistent with this prediction,\nbut it is not yet clear whether the orbits are really non-resonant as our model\npredicts.

In next section, it is shown that,\ncomparing with the the Gaussian fields, the Laguerre-Gaussian ones reduce the\nlinewidth of the optical spectrum in the coherent population trapping.\nInterestingly, it turns out that its use of a Laguerre-Gaussian beam makes the\nlinewidth of the spectrum narrower as compared with a Gaussian one in a\nDoppler-broadened electromagnetically induced transparency.

We attempt to detect the\nastrometric lensing signatures of three photometrically identified microlensing\nevents, OGLE-2011-BLG-0022, OGLE-2011-BLG-0125, and OGLE-2012-BLG-0169\n(OB110022, OB110125, and OB120169), located toward the Galactic Bulge. These\nevents were selected because of their long durations, which statistically\nfavors more massive lenses. Astrometric measurements were made over 1-2 years\nusing laser-guided adaptive optics observations from the W. M. Keck\nObservatory. Lens model parameters were first constrained by the photometric\nlight curves. The OB120169 light curve is well-fit by a single-lens model,\nwhile both OB110022 and OB110125 light curves favor binary-lens models. Using\nthe photometric fits as prior information, no significant astrometric lensing\nsignal was detected and all targets were consistent with linear motion. The\nsignificant lack of astrometric signal constrains the lens mass of OB110022 to\n0.05-1.79 Msun in a 99.7% confidence interval, which disfavors a black hole\nlens. Fits to OB110125 yielded a reduced Einstein crossing time and\ninsufficient observations during the peak, so no mass limits were obtained. Two\ndegenerate solutions exist for OB120169, which have a lens mass between\n0.2-38.8 Msun and 0.4-39.8 Msun for a 99.7% confidence interval. Follow-up\nobservations of OB120169 will further constrain the lens mass.

In recent years, a number of\nthinkers have argued that accelerating trends in computer science, cognitive\nscience, and related disciplines foreshadow the creation of intelligent\nmachines which meet and ultimately surpass the cognitive abilities of human\nbeings, thereby entangling an understanding of human values with future\ntechnological development. Contemporary research accomplishments suggest\nsophisticated AI systems becoming widespread and responsible for managing many\naspects of the modern world, from preemptively planning users' travel schedules\nand logistics, to fully autonomous vehicles, to domestic robots assisting in\ndaily living. The extrapolation of these trends has been most forcefully\ndescribed in the context of a hypothetical \"intelligence explosion,\" in which\nthe capabilities of an intelligent software agent would rapidly increase due to\nthe presence of feedback loops unavailable to biological organisms. The\npossibility of superintelligent agents, or simply the widespread deployment of\nsophisticated, autonomous AI systems, highlights an important theoretical\nproblem: the need to separate the cognitive and rational capacities of an agent\nfrom the fundamental goal structure, or value system, which constrains and\nguides the agent's actions. The \"value alignment problem\" is to specify a goal\nstructure for autonomous agents compatible with human values. In this brief\narticle, we suggest that recent ideas from affective neuroscience and related\ndisciplines aimed at characterizing neurological and behavioral universals in\nthe mammalian class provide important conceptual foundations relevant to\ndescribing human values.

Three-body decays of heavy mesons receive both resonant and\nnonresonant contributions. Dominant nonresonant contributions to tree-dominated\nand penguin-dominated three-body decays arise from the $b\\to u$ tree transition\nand $b\\to s$ penguin transition, respectively. The former can be evaluated in\nthe framework of heavy meson chiral perturbation theory with some modification,\nwhile the latter is governed by the matrix element of the scalar density\n$\\langle M_1M_2|\\bar q_1 q_2|0\\rangle$. Strong phases in this work reside in\neffective Wilson coefficients, propagators of resonances and the matrix element\nof scalar density. In order to accommodate the branching fraction and CP\nasymmetries observed in $B^-\\to K^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$, the matrix element $\\langle\nK\\pi|\\bar sq|0\\rangle$ should have an additional strong phase, which might\narise from some sort of power corrections such as final-state interactions. We\ncalculate inclusive and regional CP asymmetries and find that nonresonant CP\nviolation is usually much larger than the resonant one and that the\ninterference effect is generally quite significant. If nonresonant\ncontributions are turned off in the $K^+K^-K^-$ mode, the predicted CP\nasymmetries due to resonances will be wrong in sign when confronted with\nexperiment.

Recently,\nBayesian optimization has been proposed for optimizing hyperparameters of\nvarious machine learning algorithms. Those methods adopt probabilistic\nsurrogate models like Gaussian processes to approximate and minimize the\nvalidation error function of hyperparameter values. However, probabilistic\nsurrogates require accurate estimates of sufficient statistics (e.g.,\ncovariance) of the error distribution and thus need many function evaluations\nwith a sizeable number of hyperparameters. This makes them inefficient for\noptimizing hyperparameters of deep learning algorithms, which are highly\nexpensive to evaluate. In this work, we propose a new deterministic and\nefficient hyperparameter optimization method that employs radial basis\nfunctions as error surrogates. The proposed mixed integer algorithm, called\nHORD, searches the surrogate for the most promising hyperparameter values\nthrough dynamic coordinate search and requires many fewer function evaluations.\nHORD does well in low dimensions but it is exceptionally better in higher\ndimensions. Extensive evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 for four deep neural\nnetworks demonstrate HORD significantly outperforms the well-established\nBayesian optimization methods such as GP, SMAC, and TPE. For instance, on\naverage, HORD is more than 6 times faster than GP-EI in obtaining the best\nconfiguration of 19 hyperparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 05:03:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2017 03:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-24"}

The spectrum of the turbulent potential\nenergy (PE) also approximately follows a $k^{-3}$ power-law and its flux is\ndirected to small scales. For moderate stratification, there is no VSHF and the\nKE of the turbulent flow exhibits Bolgiano-Obukhov scaling that transitions\nfrom a shallow $k^{-11/5}$ form at large scales, to a steeper approximate\n$k^{-3}$ scaling at small scales. The entire range of scales shows a strong\nforward enstrophy flux, and interestingly, large (small) scales show an inverse\n(forward) KE flux. The PE flux in this regime is directed to small scales, and\nthe PE spectrum is characterized by an approximate $k^{-1.64}$ scaling.\nFinally, for weak stratification, KE is transferred upscale and its spectrum\nclosely follows a $k^{-2.5}$ scaling, while PE exhibits a forward transfer and\nits spectrum shows an approximate $k^{-1.6}$ power-law.

In this configuration, dominated by the disk in\nthe center, a bar forms relatively quickly, after 1 Gyr of evolution. This is\nimmediately followed by the formation of two manifold-driven spiral arms and\nthe outflow of stars that modifies the potential in the vicinity of the bar,\napparently shifting the position of the L_1/L_2 Lagrange points. This\nmodification leads to the shortening of the bar and the creation of a next\ngeneration of manifold-driven spiral arms at a smaller radius. The process\nrepeats itself a few times over the next 0.5 Gyr resulting in further\nsubstantial weakening and shortening of the bar. The time when the damping\ncomes to an end coincides with the first buckling episode in the bar which\nrebuilds the orbital structure so that no more new spiral arms are formed. The\nmorphology of the bar and the spiral structure at this time show remarkable\nsimilarity to the present properties of the Milky Way.

This observation is relevant\nfor the selection of sensitive transitions in searches for exotic couplings\nthrough spectrum shape measurements.

We determine the free\nenergy of formation of the nitrogen vacancy and of several Mg-related defects.\nThe entropic contribution as a function of temperature is determined within the\nquasiharmonic approximation. We find that the Mg interstitial shows a\nnoticeably lower free energy of formation than the Mg substitutional to Ga in\np-type conditions. Therefore, the Mg impurity is amphoteric behaving like an\nacceptor when substitutional to Ga and like a double donor when accommodated in\nan interstitial position. The hybrid-functional results are then linked to\nexperimental observations by solving the charge neutrality equations for\nsemiconductor dominated by impurities. We show that a thermodynamic equilibrium\nmodel is unable to account for the experimental hole concentration as a\nfunction of Mg doping density, due to nitrogen vacancies and Mg interstitials\nacting as compensating donors. To explain the experimental result, which\nincludes a dropoff of the hole concentration at high Mg densities, we thus\nresort to nonequilibrium models. We show that either nitrogen vacancies or Mg\ninterstitials could be at the origin of the self-compensation mechanism.\nHowever, only the model based on interstitial Mg donors provides a natural\nmechanism to account for the sudden appearance of self-compensation. Indeed,\nthe amphoteric nature of the Mg impurity leads to Fermi-level pinning and\naccounts for the observed dropoff of the hole concentration of GaN samples at\nhigh Mg doping. Our work suggests that current limitations in p-type doping of\nGaN could be overcome by extrinsically controlling the Fermi energy during\ngrowth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 08:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-01"}

The `intrinsic electrical\nconductivity' and concentration dependence of the relative electrical\nconductivity $\\Sigma (p)$ ($\\Sigma=\\sigma/ \\sigma_m$ for the C-model and\n$\\Sigma=\\sigma_m /\\sigma$ for the I-model, where $\\sigma_m$ is the electrical\nconductivity of substrate) in different directions were analyzed. At large\nvalues of $k$ the $\\Sigma (p)$ curves became very similar and they almost\ncoincided at $k=128$. Moreover, for both models the greater the length of the\n$k$-mers the smoother the functions $\\Sigma_{xy}(p)$, $\\Sigma_{x}(p)$ and\n$\\Sigma_{y}(p)$. For the C-model, the other interesting findings are: for large\nvalues of $k$ ($k=64, 128$), the values of $\\Sigma_{xy}$ and $\\Sigma_{y}$\nincrease rapidly with the initial increase of $p$ from 0 to 0.1; for $k \\geq\n16$, all the $\\Sigma_{xy}(p)$ and $\\Sigma_{x}(p)$ curves intersect with each\nother at the same iso-conductivity points; for anisotropic deposition, the\npercolation concentrations are the same in the $x$ and $y$ directions, whereas,\nat the percolation point the greater the length of the $k$-mers the larger the\nanisotropy of the electrical conductivity, i.e., the ratio $\\sigma_y/\\sigma_x$\n($>1$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 09:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

Our simulations consider one of the latest models currently used for\nspace weather studies in the Heliosphere. Large-scale magnetic field maps,\nrecovered with two implementations of the tomographic technique of\nZeeman-Doppler imaging, serve to drive steady-state solutions in each system.\nThis paper contains the description of the stellar wind and inner astrosphere,\nwhile the coronal structure was previously discussed in Alvarado-G\\'omez et al.\n(2016). The analysis includes the magneto-hydrodynamical properties of the\nstellar wind, the associated mass and angular momentum loss rates, as well as\nthe topology of the astrospheric current sheet in each system. A systematic\ncomparison among the considered cases is performed, including two reference\nsolar simulations covering activity minimum and maximum. For HD 1237, we\ninvestigate the interactions between the structure of the developed stellar\nwind, and a possible magnetosphere around the Jupiter-mass planet in this\nsystem. We find that the process of particle injection into the planetary\natmosphere is dominated by the density distribution rather than velocity\nprofile of the stellar wind. In this context, we predict a maximum exoplanetary\nradio emission of 12 mJy at 40 MHz in this system, assuming the crossing of a\nhigh-density streamer during periastron passage. Furthermore, in combination\nwith the analysis performed in Alvarado-G\\'omez et al. (2016), we obtain for\nthe first time a fully simulated mass loss-activity relation, which is compared\nand discussed in the context of the relation based on astrospheric detections\nproposed by Wood et al. (2005a). Finally, we provide a characterisation of the\n3D properties of the stellar wind of these systems, at the inner edges of their\nhabitable zones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 11:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

We\npresent a model which describes the biofilm evolution and the advancing biofilm\nedge for this spreading mechanism. The model is based on a gradient dynamics\nformulation for thin films of biologically passive liquid mixtures and\nsuspensions, supplemented by bioactive processes which play a decisive role in\nthe osmotic spreading of biofilms.

In this paper\nwe propose to treat the problem of obtaining the user position with respect to\na known environment as a video registration problem. Video registration, i.e.\nthe task of aligning an input video sequence to a pre-built 3D model, relies on\na matching process of local keypoints extracted on the query sequence to a 3D\npoint cloud. The overall registration performance is strictly tied to the\nactual quality of this 2D-3D matching, and can degrade if environmental\nconditions such as steep changes in lighting like the ones between day and\nnight occur. To effectively register an egocentric video sequence under these\nconditions, we propose to tackle the source of the problem: the matching\nprocess. To overcome the shortcomings of standard matching techniques, we\nintroduce a novel embedding space that allows us to obtain robust matches by\njointly taking into account local descriptors, their spatial arrangement and\ntheir temporal robustness. The proposal is evaluated using unconstrained\negocentric video sequences both in terms of matching quality and resulting\nregistration performance using different 3D models of historical landmarks. The\nresults show that the proposed method can outperform state of the art\nregistration algorithms, in particular when dealing with the challenges of\nnight and day sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 13:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-29"}

Method: To describe the spectrum and\ndecay modes of $ ^{39}\\text{Mg} $ we use the conventional Shell Model, Gamow\nShell Model, Resonating Group Method, Density Matrix Renormalization Group\nmethod, and the non-adiabatic Particle-Plus-Rotor model formulated in the\nBerggren basis.

Traditional hashing methods learn hash functions to\ngenerate binary codes from hand-crafted features, which achieve limited\naccuracy since the hand-crafted features cannot optimally represent the image\ncontent and preserve the semantic similarity. Recently, several deep hashing\nmethods have shown better performance because the deep architectures generate\nmore discriminative feature representations. However, these deep hashing\nmethods are mainly designed for supervised scenarios, which only exploit the\nsemantic similarity information, but ignore the underlying data structures. In\nthis paper, we propose the semi-supervised deep hashing (SSDH) approach, to\nperform more effective hash function learning by simultaneously preserving\nsemantic similarity and underlying data structures. The main contributions are\nas follows: (1) We propose a semi-supervised loss to jointly minimize the\nempirical error on labeled data, as well as the embedding error on both labeled\nand unlabeled data, which can preserve the semantic similarity and capture the\nmeaningful neighbors on the underlying data structures for effective hashing.\n(2) A semi-supervised deep hashing network is designed to extensively exploit\nboth labeled and unlabeled data, in which we propose an online graph\nconstruction method to benefit from the evolving deep features during training\nto better capture semantic neighbors. To the best of our knowledge, the\nproposed deep network is the first deep hashing method that can perform hash\ncode learning and feature learning simultaneously in a semi-supervised fashion.\nExperimental results on 5 widely-used datasets show that our proposed approach\noutperforms the state-of-the-art hashing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 14:30:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Jun 2017 07:52:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2017 03:23:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

This\napproach is applied to even-even nuclei, the strength function for odd nuclei\nbeing derived by interpolation. The convergence with respect to the adopted\nnumber of harmonic oscillator shells and the cut-off energy introduced in the\n2-quasiparticle (2-$qp$) excitation space is analyzed. The calculations\nperformed with two different Gogny interactions, namely D1S and D1M, are\ncompared. A systematic energy shift of the $E1$ strength is found for D1M\nrelative to D1S, leading to a lower energy centroid and a smaller\nenergy-weighted sum rule for D1M.

Mitochondria are the major\nsub-cellular organelle of ATP production. With a negative inner membrane\npotential, mitochondria take up Ca2+ from their surroundings, a process called\nmitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Under physiological conditions, Ca2+ uptake into\nmitochondria promotes ATP production. Excessive uptake causes mitochondrial\nCa2+ overload, which activates downstream adverse responses leading to cell\ndysfunction. Moreover, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake could shape spatio-temporal\npatterns of intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Malfunction of mitochondrial Ca2+\nuptake is implicated in muscle degeneration. Unlike non-excitable cells,\nmitochondria in muscle cells experience dramatic changes of intracellular Ca2+\nlevels. Besides the sudden elevation of Ca2+ level induced by action\npotentials, Ca2+ transients in muscle cells can be as short as a few\nmilliseconds during a single twitch or as long as minutes during tetanic\ncontraction, which raises the question whether mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is\nfast and big enough to shape intracellular Ca2+ signaling during\nexcitation-contraction coupling and creates technical challenges for\nquantification of the dynamic changes of Ca2+ inside mitochondria.

For thin films of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene\nsulfonate post-treated with ethylene glycol and of polyimide we find\nconductivities of 1.0 W/mK and 0.4 W/mK at room temperature, respectively.\nThese results are in very good agreement with literature values, validating the\nmethod developed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 15:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

The crux of our treatment lies in the\nintroduction of a vector configurational field. This field lies in the\nmaterial, or configurational, manifold, in contrast with the traditional\ndisplacement field, which we regard as lying in the spatial manifold. We\nidentify two distinct cases which describe (a) problems in which the\nconfigurational field's evolution is localized to a mathematically sharp\ninterface, and (b) those in which the configurational field's evolution can\nextend throughout the volume. The first case is suitable for describing\nincoherent phase interfaces in polycrystalline solids, and the latter is useful\nfor describing smooth changes in crystal structure and naturally incorporates\ncoherent (diffuse) phase interfaces. For sharp interfaces that are\nout-of-equilibrium, the second law of thermodynamics furnishes restrictions on\nthe kinetic law for the interface velocity. The class of problems in which the\nmaterial undergoes configurational changes between distinct, stable crystal\nstructures are characterized by free energy density functions that are\nnon-convex with respect to configurational strain. For physically meaningful\nsolutions and mathematical well-posedness, it becomes necessary to incorporate\ninterfacial energy. This we have done by introducing a configurational strain\ngradient dependence in the free energy density function following ideas laid\nout by Toupin (Arch. Rat. Mech. Anal. 11, 1962, 385-414). The variational\ntreatment leads to a system of partial differential equations governing the\nconfiguration that is coupled with the traditional equations of nonlinear\nelasticity. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate interface motion as\nwell as evolving microstructures of crystal structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 18:05:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 17:11:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}
