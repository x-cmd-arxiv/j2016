As such, our problem is\nan $N$-player linear-quadratic stochastic differential game with delay.

Specifically, we present a general prescription\nfor the construction of quasi-joint-probability (QJP) distributions associated\nwith a given pair of observables.

As the name suggests, they are close relatives of\nMXenes, which instead have 1T symmetry (P-3m1). The newly found BiXenes, as\nwell as some new MXenes, are shown to have formation energies close to that of\ngermanene, which suggests that these materials should be possible to be\nsynthesised. Among them, we illustrate that 1H-Tc2C and 1T-Mo2C are dynamically\nstable at 0 K, while 1H-Mo2C, 1TTc2C, 1H-Tc2C, and 1T-Rh2C are likely to be\nstabilised via strain or temperature. In addition, the nature of the chemical\nbonding is analysed, emphasizing that the covalency between the transition\nmetal ions and carbon is much stronger in BiXenes than in MXenes. The emergence\nof BiXenes can not only open up a new era of conducting 2D monolayers, but also\nprovide good candidates for carrier materials aimed at energy storage and\nspintronic devices that have already been unveiled in MXenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 18:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

However, the densification gain come at the expense of higher\nhandover rates and network control overhead. Hence, users mobility can diminish\nor even nullifies the foreseen densification gain.

However, because of the way these measures are collected, they are\nprone to missing data, which can ultimately affect the decision of whether an\nintervention is good value for money. We examine how missing cost and effect\noutcome data are handled in RCT-based CEAs, complementing a previous review\n(covering 2003-2009, 88 articles) with a new systematic review (2009-2015, 81\narticles) focussing on two different perspectives. First, we review the\ndescription of the missing data, the statistical methods used to deal with\nthem, and the quality of the judgement underpinning the choice of these\nmethods. Second, we provide guidelines on how the information about missingness\nand related methods should be presented to improve the reporting and handling\nof missing data. Our review shows that missing data in within-RCT CEAs are\nstill often inadequately handled and the overall level of information provided\nto support the chosen methods is rarely satisfactory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 19:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-22"}

A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the\ndistribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training\ncases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the\nsummed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces\nthe training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch\nnormalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to\napply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch\nnormalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used\nfor normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a\nsingle training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its\nown adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before\nthe non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs\nexactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also\nstraightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the\nnormalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is\nvery effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks.\nEmpirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the\ntraining time compared with previously published techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 19:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-22"}

In the range of $7.^{\\circ}5 \\le l \\le 194^{\\circ}$, we\nhave identified 54 large-scale filaments and derived mass ($\\sim 10^3 - 10^5 \\,\nM_\\odot$), length (10-276 pc), linear mass density (54-8625 $M_\\odot \\,\n\\rm{pc}^{-1}$), aspect ratio, linearity, velocity gradient, temperature,\nfragmentation, Galactic location and orientation angle. The filaments\nconcentrate along major spiral arms. They are widely distributed across the\nGalactic disk, with 50% located within $\\pm$20 pc from the Galactic mid-plane\nand 27% run in the center of spiral arms (aka \"bones\"). An order of 1% of the\nmolecular ISM is confined in large filaments. Massive star formation is more\nfavorable in large filaments compared to elsewhere. This is the first\ncomprehensive catalog of large filaments useful for a quantitative comparison\nwith spiral structures and numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 19:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

We show that, for gauge couplings smaller\nthan $0.4$, the LHC gives rise to the strongest collider limit. In particular,\nwe find $M_{Z^{\\prime}}/g_{BL} > 8.7$ TeV for $g_{BL}=0.3$. We conclude that\nthe NLO+NLL corrections improve the dilepton bounds on the $Z^{\\prime}$ mass\nand that both dark matter candidates are only viable in the $Z^{\\prime}$\nresonance region, with the parameter space for scalar dark matter being fully\nprobed by XENON1T. Lastly, we show that one can successfully have a minimal two\ncomponent dark matter model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 20:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

Abu India. Designed for\nexoplanet detection, PARAS is capable of single-shot spectral coverage of 3800\n- 9600 A, and currently achieving radial velocity (RV) precisions approaching\n~1 m/s over several months using simultaneous ThAr calibration. As such, it is\none of the few dedicated stabilized fiber-fed spectrographs on small (1-2 m)\ntelescopes that are able to fill an important niche in RV follow-up and stellar\ncharacterization. The success of ground-based RV surveys is motivating the push\ninto extreme precisions, with goals of ~10 cm/s in the optical and <1 m/s in\nthe near-infrared (NIR). Lessons from existing instruments like PARAS are\ninvaluable in informing hardware design, providing pipeline prototypes, and\nguiding scientific surveys. Here we present our current precision estimates of\nPARAS based on observations of bright RV standard stars, and describe the\nevolution of the data reduction and RV analysis pipeline as instrument\ncharacterization progresses and we gather longer baselines of data. Secondly,\nwe discuss how our experience with PARAS is a critical component in the\ndevelopment of future cutting edge instruments like (1) the Habitable Zone\nPlanet Finder (HPF), a NIR spectrograph optimized to look for planets around M\ndwarfs, scheduled to be commissioned on the Hobby Eberly Telescope in 2017, and\n(2) the NEID optical spectrograph, designed in response to the NN-EXPLORE call\nfor an extreme precision Doppler spectrometer (EPDS) for the WIYN telescope. In\nanticipation of instruments like TESS and GAIA, the ground-based RV support\nsystem is being reinforced. We emphasize that instruments like PARAS will play\nan intrinsic role in providing both complementary follow-up and battlefront\nexperience for these next generation of precision velocimeters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 20:14:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

These signals arise from the photosphere of the stars. The m/s\nperturbation created by these signals prevents the detection and mass\ncharacterization of small-mass planetary candidates such as Earth-twins.\nSeveral methods have been proposed to mitigate stellar signals in RV\nmeasurements. However, without precisely knowing the stellar and planetary\nsignals in real observations, it is extremely difficult to test the efficiency\nof these methods.\n  The goal of the RV fitting challenge is to generate simulated RV data\nincluding stellar and planetary signals and to perform a blind test within the\ncommunity to test the efficiency of the different methods proposed to recover\nplanetary signals despite stellar signals.\n  In this first paper, we describe the simulation used to model the\nmeasurements of the RV fitting challenge. Each simulated planetary system\nincludes the signals from instrumental noise, stellar oscillations,\ngranulation, supergranulation, stellar activity, and observed and simulated\nplanetary systems. In addition to RV variations, this simulation also models\nthe effects of instrumental noise and stellar signals on activity observables\nobtained by HARPS-type high-resolution spectrographs, that is, the calcium\nactivity index log(R'hk) and the bisector span and full width at half maximum\nof the cross-correlation function.\n  We publish the 15 systems used for the RV fitting challenge including the\ndetails about the planetary systems that were injected into each of them (data\navailable at CDS and here: https://rv-challenge.wikispaces.com.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 20:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-25"}

Here we study whether such stochastic control is also\npossible in a noisy environment, where both the process of state-observation\nand the process of state-evolution are subject to adversarial perturbation\n(noise). The introduction of noise causes the tools developed for LLL\nalgorithmization to break down since the key LLL ingredient, the sparsity of\nthe causality (dependence) relationship, no longer holds. To overcome this\nchallenge we develop a new analysis where entropy plays a central role, both to\nmeasure the rate at which progress towards an acceptable state is made and the\nrate at which noise undoes this progress.

This is particularly true when we look at the\nassociated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Indeed, even in the\nsimplified setting (introduced first by Vinter and Kwong for the deterministic\ncase) the HJB equation is an infinite dimensional second order semilinear\nPartial Differential Equation (PDE) that does not satisfy the so-called\n\"structure condition\" which substantially means that the control can act on the\nsystem modifying its dynamics at most along the same directions along which the\nnoise acts.\n  The absence of such condition, together with the lack of smoothing properties\nwhich is a common feature of problems with delay, prevents the use of the known\ntechniques (based on Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) or on\nthe smoothing properties of the linear part) to prove the existence of regular\nsolutions of this HJB equation and so no results on this direction have been\nproved till now.\n  In this paper we provide a result on existence of regular solutions of such\nkind of HJB equations. This opens the road to prove existence of optimal\nfeedback controls, a task that will be accomplished in a companion paper.

Done in the right way, improved\nutilization maximizes social welfare--- balancing the utility of a high value\nbut unreliable agent with the group's preference that resources be used. We\nintroduce the family of contingent payment mechanisms (CP), which may charge an\nagent contingent on use (a penalty). A CP mechanism is parameterized by a\nmaximum penalty, and has a dominant-strategy equilibrium. Under a set of\naxiomatic properties, we establish welfare-optimality for the special case\nCP(W), with CP instantiated for a maximum penalty equal to societal value W for\nutilization. CP(W) is not dominated for expected welfare by any other\nmechanism, and second, amongst mechanisms that always allocate the resource and\nhave a simple indirect structure, CP(W) strictly dominates every other\nmechanism. The special case with no upper bound on penalty, the contingent\nsecond-price mechanism, maximizes utilization. We extend the mechanisms to\nassign multiple, heterogeneous resources, and present a simulation study of the\nwelfare properties of these mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 21:26:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2017 02:29:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Nov 2018 16:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-02"}

In this paper, we present a general and flexible iterative framework\nto approximately solve robust convex optimization problems that is built on a\nfully online first-order paradigm. In comparison to the existing literature, a\nkey distinguishing feature of our approach is that it only requires access to\nfirst-order oracles that are remarkably cheaper than pessimization or nominal\nfeasibility oracles, while maintaining the same convergence rates. This, in\nparticular, makes our approach much more scalable and hence preferable in\nlarge-scale applications, specifically those from machine learning and\nstatistics domains.

In this paper we focus on the case of non-convex losses, which\nis practically important but still poorly understood. Classical empirical\nprocess theory implies uniform convergence of the empirical risk to the\npopulation risk. While uniform convergence implies consistency of the resulting\nM-estimator, it does not ensure that the latter can be computed efficiently.\n  In order to capture the complexity of computing M-estimators, we propose to\nstudy the landscape of the empirical risk, namely its stationary points and\ntheir properties. We establish uniform convergence of the gradient and Hessian\nof the empirical risk to their population counterparts, as soon as the number\nof samples becomes larger than the number of unknown parameters (modulo\nlogarithmic factors). Consequently, good properties of the population risk can\nbe carried to the empirical risk, and we can establish one-to-one\ncorrespondence of their stationary points.

Our inelastic neutron scattering\nstudies on single crystals of CeRu2Al10 and CeOs2Al10 revealed dispersive\ngapped spin wave excitations below TN.

The searches for the lightest stop have put strong constraints\non its mass. However, there is still a search gap in the low mass region if the\nspectrum of the stop and the lightest neutralino is compressed. In that case,\nit may be easier to look for the second stop since naturalness requires both\nstops to be close to the weak scale. The current experimental searches for the\nsecond stop are based on the simplified model approach with the decay modes\n$\\tilde{t}_2 \\to \\tilde{t}_1 Z$ and $\\tilde{t}_2 \\to \\tilde{t}_1 h$. However,\nin a realistic supersymmetric spectrum there is always a sbottom lighter than\nthe second stop, hence the decay patterns are usually more complicated than the\nsimplified model assumptions. In particular, there are often large branching\nratios of the decays $\\tilde{t}_2 \\to \\tilde{b}_1 W$ and $\\tilde{b}_1 \\to\n\\tilde{t}_1 W$ as long as they are open. The decay chains can be even more\ncomplex if there are intermediate states of additional charginos and\nneutralinos in the decays. By studying several MSSM benchmark models at the 14\nTeV LHC, we point out the importance of the multi-$W$ final states in the\nsecond stop and the sbottom searches, such as the same-sign dilepton and\nmultilepton signals, aside from the traditional search modes. The observed\nsame-sign dilepton excesses at LHC Run 1 and Run 2 may be explained by some of\nour benchmark models. We also suggest that the vector boson tagging and a new\nkinematic variable may help to suppress the backgrounds and increase the signal\nsignificance for some search channels. Due to the complex decay patterns and\nlack of the dominant decay channels, the best reaches likely require a\ncombination of various search channels at the LHC for the second stop and the\nlightest sbottom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2016 03:54:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2016 20:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-05"}

We assume that the seed binary has no eccentricity and no\ngrowth by gas accretion. The envelope is assumed to be an isothermal gas with\nno self-gravity.

In the\nabsence of external forcing, the magnetic energy then remains small at all\ntimes if it is small in the initial state. In other words, a small \"seed\"\nmagnetic field cannot be amplified significantly, regardless of the nature of\nflow, as long as the collision frequency and gyroradius are small enough to be\nnegligible. A similar conclusion also holds if the system is subject to\nexternal forcing as long as this forcing conserves the magnetic moment of at\nleast one plasma species and does not greatly increase the total energy of the\nplasma (i.e., in practice, is subsonic). Dynamo action therefore always\nrequires collisions or some small-scale kinetic mechanism for breaking the\nadiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2016 11:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

Their result applies if\na naturally defined \"exchange graph\" for two feasible solutions is planar and\nis based on subdividing this graph via a planar separator theorem due to\nFrederickson (1987). Obtaining similar results for the related maximum\nk-coverage problem (MC) seems non-trivial due to the hard cardinality\nconstraint. In fact, while Badanidiyuru, Kleinberg, and Lee (2012) have shown\n(via a different analysis) that local search yields a PTAS for two-dimensional\nreal halfspaces, they only conjectured that the same holds true for dimension\nthree. Interestingly, at this point it was already known that local search\nprovides a PTAS for the corresponding set cover case and this followed directly\nfrom the approach of Mustafa and Ray.\n  In this work we provide a way to address the above-mentioned issue. First, we\npropose a color-balanced version of the planar separator theorem. The resulting\nsubdivision approximates locally in each part the global distribution of the\ncolors.

It is a crucial performance parameter for\nsystems using superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). In\nthis work, we have demonstrated that the detection timing jitter is limited in\npart by the spatial variation of photon detection events along the length of\nthe wire. This distribution causes the generated electrical pulses to arrive at\nthe readout at varied times. We define this jitter source as geometric jitter\nsince it is related to the length and area of the SNSPD. To characterize the\ngeometric jitter, we have constructed a novel differential cryogenic readout\nwith less than 7 ps of electronic jitter that can amplify the pulses generated\nfrom the two ends of an SNSPD. By differencing the measured arrival times of\nthe two electrical pulses, we were able to partially cancel out the difference\nof the propagation times and thus reduce the uncertainty of the photon arrival\ntime.

It is often used by manufacturing firms in practice in\norder to improve the operational efficiency with respect to the order of job\nprocessing to be performed. It is known that the performance of a machine\ndepends on the particular timing of the job processing even if the job\nprocessing order is fixed. That is, the performance of a system with respect to\nflowshop processing depends on the procedure of scheduling. In this present\nwork, we first discuss the relationship between makespan and several scheduling\nprocedures in detail by using a small example and provide an algorithm for\nderiving the makespan. Using our proposed algorithm, several numerical\nexperiments are examined so as to reveal the relationship between the typical\nbehavior of makespan and the position of the fiducial machine, with respect to\nseveral distinguished distributions of the processing time. We also discuss the\nbehavior of makespan by using the properties of the shape functions used in the\ncontext of percolation theory. Our contributions are firstly giving a detail\ndiscussion on the universality of makespan in flowshop problems and obtaining\nseveral novel properties of makespan, as follows: (1) makespan possesses\nuniversality in the sense of being little affected by a change in the\nprobability distribution of the processing time, (2) makespan can be decomposed\ninto the sum of two shape functions, and (3) makespan is less affected by the\ndispatching rule than by the scheduling procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jul 2016 06:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-26"}
