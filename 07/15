In dielectrics and semiconductors, various\nlight-field-driven effects have been explored, such as high-harmonic\ngeneration, sub-optical-cycle interband population transfer and nonperturbative\nincrease of transient polarizability. In contrast, much less is known about\nfield-driven electron dynamics in metals because charge carriers screen an\nexternal electric field in ordinary metals. Here we show that atomically thin\nmonolayer Graphene offers unique opportunities to study light-field-driven\nprocesses in a metal. With a comparably modest field strength of up to 0.3\nV/{\\AA}, we drive combined interband and intraband electron dynamics, leading\nto a light-field-waveform controlled residual conduction current after the\nlaser pulse is gone. We identify the underlying pivotal physical mechanism as\nelectron quantum-path interference taking place on the 1-femtosecond\n($10^{-15}$ second) timescale. The process can be categorized as\nLandau-Zener-St\\\"uckelberg interferometry. These fully coherent electron\ndynamics in graphene take place on a hitherto unexplored timescale faster than\nelectron-electron scattering (tens of femtoseconds) and electron-phonon\nscattering (hundreds of femtoseconds). These results broaden the scope of\nlight-field control of electrons in solids to an entirely new and eminently\nimportant material class -- metals -- promising wide ramifications for band\nstructure tomography and light-field-driven electronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 16:37:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

This theory states that a transmitted\nmatrix signal can be uniquely identified if and only if the cover order is\nequal to the transmitter aperture number, i.e., full cover. In addition, we\nprove that full reliability is guaranteed for space-time block coded MIMO-OWC\nover commonly used log-normal fading channels with an ML detector if and only\nif the STBC enables full cover. In addition, the diversity gain can be\ngeometrically interpreted as the cover order of the super-rectangle, which\nshould be maximized, and the volume of this super-rectangle, as the diversity\nloss, should be minimized.

We introduce a new methodology to remedy this\nissue, and we generate self-consistent photoionization and photoheating rates\nto model any chosen reionization history.

This phenomenon was\ngeneralized in 1999 to multivariate interpolation in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert\nSpaces on domains $\\Omega\\subset R^d$ for continuous positive definite\nFourier-transformable shift-invariant kernels on $R^d$. But the sufficient\ncondition for superconvergence given in 1999 still needs further analysis,\nbecause the interplay between smoothness and boundary conditions is not clear\nat all. Furthermore, if only additional smoothness is assumed, superconvergence\nis numerically observed in the interior of the domain, but without explanation,\nso far. This paper first generalizes the \"improved error bounds\" of 1999 by an\nabstract theory that includes the Aubin-Nitsche trick and the known\nsuperconvergence results for univariate polynomial splines. Then the paper\nanalyzes what is behind the sufficient conditions for superconvergence. They\nsplit into conditions on smoothness and localization, and these are\ninvestigated independently. If sufficient smoothness is present, but no\nadditional localization conditions are assumed, it is proven that\nsuperconvergence always occurs in the interior of the domain. If smoothness and\nlocalization interact in the kernel-based case on $R^d$, weak and strong\nboundary conditions in terms of pseudodifferential operators occur. A special\nsection on Mercer expansions is added, because Mercer eigenfunctions always\nsatisfy the sufficient conditions for superconvergence.

The post-blast rock size distribution\ncan significantly influence the efficiency of all the downstream mining and\ncomminution processes. Image analysis methods are one of the most common\nmethods used to measure rock fragment size distribution in mines regardless of\ncriticism for lack of accuracy to measure fine particles and other perceived\ndeficiencies. The current practice of collecting rock fragmentation data for\nimage analysis is highly manual and provides data with low temporal and spatial\nresolution. Using UAVs for collecting images of rock fragments can not only\nimprove the quality of the image data but also automate the data collection\nprocess. Ultimately, real-time acquisition of high temporal- and\nspatial-resolution data based on UAV technology will provide a broad range of\nopportunities for both improving blast design without interrupting the\nproduction process and reducing the cost of the human operator. This paper\npresents the results of a series of laboratory-scale rock fragment measurements\nusing a quadrotor UAV equipped with a camera. The goal of this work is to\nhighlight the benefits of aerial fragmentation analysis in terms of both\nprediction accuracy and time effort. A pile of rock fragments with different\nfragment sizes was placed in a lab that is equipped with a motion capture\ncamera system for precise UAV localization and control. Such an environment\npresents optimal conditions for UAV flight and thus, is well-suited for\nconducting proof-of-concept experiments before testing them in large-scale\nfield experiments. The pile was photographed by a camera attached to the UAV,\nand the particle size distribution curves were generated in almost real-time.\nThe pile was also manually photographed and the results of the manual method\nwere compared to the UAV method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 18:47:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-15"}

Here, we\nsystematically investigate the effects of atmospheric bulk compositions on\ntemperature and wind distributions for tidally locked sub-Jupiter-sized\nplanets, using an idealized 3D general circulation model (GCM). The bulk\ncomposition effects are characterized in the framework of two independent\nvariables: molecular weight and molar heat capacity. The effect of molecular\nweight dominates. As the molecular weight increases, the atmosphere tends to\nhave a larger day-night temperature contrast, a smaller eastward phase shift in\nthe thermal phase curve and a smaller zonal wind speed. The width of the\nequatorial super-rotating jet also becomes narrower and the \"jet core\" region,\nwhere the zonal-mean jet speed maximizes, moves to a greater pressure level.\nThe zonal-mean zonal wind is more prone to exhibit a latitudinally alternating\npattern in a higher-molecular-weight atmosphere. We also present analytical\ntheories that quantitatively explain the above trends and shed light on the\nunderlying dynamical mechanisms. Those trends might be used to indirectly\ndetermine the atmospheric compositions on tidally locked sub-Jupiter-sized\nplanets. The effects of the molar heat capacity are generally small. But if the\nvertical temperature profile is close to adiabatic, molar heat capacity will\nplay a significant role in controlling the transition from a divergent flow in\nthe upper atmosphere to a jet-dominated flow in the lower atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 19:36:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2017 08:26:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

The point of departure in the description are the basic\nequations of elasticity (i.e. constitutive law, equations of equilibrium in\nterms of stresses, and the definition of strain), together with the principle\nof effective stress, and the law of Darcy for fluid flow in porous media. These\nequations, together with the principle of mass conservation, are the only\npremises used to derive a drained description of consolidation theory. Next,\nthe increment of fluid content is defined and its constitutive law is derived -\nwith its derivation following naturally from the equation of fluid mass\nbalance. Pore pressure, storage, and undrained coefficients are also introduced\nand useful relations are proven. Where appropriate, the physical meaning of\nthese coefficients is proven mathematically. Equations of equilibrium and fluid\nmass conservation are subsequently expressed in terms of the increment of fluid\ncontent and undrained coefficients, leading to an undrained description of\nconsolidation theory. Thus the initial approach of using drained description is\nextended to the formalism of Rice and Cleary. This approach to\nthree-dimensional consolidation is useful for its simplicity. It does not\nrequire the ad-hoc definition of constants and that of an elastic energy\npotential. Instead, it is a direct extension to linear elasticity that accounts\nfor the coupling of skeletal deformations and fluid behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 21:10:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-18"}

This is important in determining the number of dwarf galaxies\nformed before reionization and their fossils in the local universe, as well as\nthe number of intermediate-mass seed black holes. A mean X-ray emission per\nsource above the optimal level reduces the number of Pop III stars because of\nthe increased Jeans mass of the intergalactic medium (IGM), while a lower\nemission suppresses the formation rate of H2 preventing or delaying star\nformation in dark matter minihalos above the Jeans mass. The build up of the H2\ndissociating background is slower than the X-ray background due to the\nshielding effect of resonant hydrogen Lyman lines. Hence, the nearly\nunavoidable X-ray emission from supernova remnants of Pop III stars is\nsufficient to boost their number to few tens per comoving Mpc^3 by redshift\nz~15. We find that there is a critical X-ray to UV energy ratio emitted per\nsource that produces a universe where the number of Pop III stars is largest:\n400 per comoving- Mpc^3. This critical ratio is very close to the one provided\nby 20-40 M_sun Pop III stars exploding as hypernovae.

Although the\ndense gas in which stars are formed tends to have a disk structure, stars are\nfound in spheroids with little rotation. Halos with masses between 10^6 M_sun\nand 5x10^8 M_sun form stars stochastically, with stellar masses in the range\n10^4 M_sun to 2x10^6 M_sun. Nearly independent of stellar mass, we observe a\nlarge range of half-light radii for the stars, from a few parsecs to a few\nhundred parsecs and surface brightnesses and mass-to-light ratios ranging from\nthose typical of globular clusters to ultra-faint dwarfs. In our simulations,\nstars form in dense stellar clusters with high gas-to-star conversion\nefficiencies and rather uniform metallicities.

By direct inspection of the spectrum and wave functions we\nexamine the evolution of the topological phase as an in-plane, uniaxial\ndeformation is imposed. It is found that strain shifts the energy of 1D edge\nstates, thus causing a topological phase transition which eliminates the\nMajorana modes.

The theory is formulated in\nterms of a conformational N-dynamic-order-parameter Generalized Langevin\nEquation approach. It is implemented using a field-theoretic Gaussian thread\nmodel of polymer structure and closed in a universal manner at the level of the\nchain dynamic second moment matrix. The physical idea is that the isotropic\nRouse model fails due to the dynamical emergence of time-persistent\nintermolecular contacts determined by the combined influence of local chain\nuncrossability, long range polymer connectivity and a self-consistent treatment\nof chain motion and the dynamic forces that hinder it. For long chain melts,\nthe mesoscopic localization length (tube diameter) and emergent elasticity\npredictions are in near quantitative agreement with experiment. Moreover, the\nonset chain length scales with the semi-dilute crossover concentration with a\nrealistic numerical prefactor. Distinctive predictions are made for various\noff-diagonal correlation functions that quantify the full spatial structure of\nthe dynamically localized polymer conformation. As the local uncrossability\nconstraint and/or intrachain bonding spring are softened, the tube diameter is\npredicted to swell until it reaches the chain radius-of-gyration at which point\nentanglement localization vanishes in a discontinuous manner.

In this context, a shared facility controller (SFC)\nwith a number of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in a smart community is\nconsidered that has the capability to schedule the generated energy for\nconsumption and trade to other entities. Particularly, a mechanism is designed\nfor the SFC to decide on the energy surplus, if there is any, that it can use\nto charge its battery and sell to the households and the grid based on the\noffered prices. In this regard, a hierarchical energy management scheme is\nproposed with a view to reduce the total operational cost to the SFC. The\nconcept of a virtual cost (VC) is introduced that aids the SFC to estimate its\nfuture operational cost based on some available current information. The energy\nmanagement is conducted for three different cases and the optimal cost to the\nSFC is determined for each case via the theory of maxima and minima. A\nreal-time algorithm is proposed to reach the optimal cost for all cases and\nsome numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the beneficial properties\nof the proposed scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2016 03:07:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-18"}

We corroborate our quantum\nself-consistent approach using the quantum master equation that can deal with\nanharmonicity exactly, but is limited to the weak system-bath coupling regime.\nFinally, in order demonstrate its strength we apply the quantum self-consistent\napproach to study thermal rectification in a weakly coupled two segment\nanharmonic system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2016 05:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

In particular, the second-order empirical Bayes confidence\ninterval, the coverage error of which is of the third order for large number of\nareas, is widely used in small area estimation when the sample size within each\narea is not large enough to make reliable direct estimates based on a\ndesign-based approach. Yoshimori and Lahiri (2014a) proposed a new type of\nconfidence interval, called the second-order efficient empirical Bayes\nconfidence interval, whose length is less than that of the direct confidence\ninterval based on the design-based approach. However, this interval still has\nsome disadvantages: (i) it is hard to use when at least one leverage value is\nhigh; (ii) many iterations tend to be required to obtain the estimators of one\nglobal model variance parameter as the number of areas getting larger, due to\nthe area-specific adjustment factor. To prevent such issues, this paper\nproposes, as never done before, a more efficient confidence interval to allow\nfor high leverage and reduce the number of iterations for large number of\nareas, by adopting a non-area-specific adjustment factor, maintaining the\nexisting desired properties.

Recently, a\nunifying concept behind all these orders has been shown: they can be described\nby a graph decomposition into parts that have a prescribed vertex-connectivity.\n  Despite extensive interest in canonical orderings, no analogue of this\nunifying concept is known for edge-connectivity. In this paper, we establish\nsuch a concept named edge-orders and show how to compute (1,1)-edge-orders of\n2-edge-connected graphs as well as (2,1)-edge-orders of 3-edge-connected graphs\nin linear time, respectively. While the former can be seen as the edge-variants\nof st-numberings, the latter are the edge-variants of Mondshein sequences and\nnon-separating ear decompositions. The methods that we use for obtaining such\nedge-orders differ considerably in almost all details from the ones used for\ntheir vertex-counterparts, as different graph-theoretic constructions are used\nin the inductive proof and standard reductions from edge- to\nvertex-connectivity are bound to fail.\n  As a first application, we consider the famous Edge-Independent Spanning Tree\nConjecture, which asserts that every k-edge-connected graph contains k rooted\nspanning trees that are pairwise edge-independent. We illustrate the impact of\nthe above edge-orders by deducing algorithms that construct 2- and 3-edge\nindependent spanning trees of 2- and 3-edge-connected graphs, the latter of\nwhich improves the best known running time from O(n^2) to linear time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2016 09:33:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-18"}

In this paper, we consider\ntherefore the problem of establishing an efficient swarm movement model and a\nnetwork topology between a collection of UAVs, which are specifically deployed\nfor the scenario of high-quality forest-mapping.\n  The forest environment with its highly heterogeneous distribution of trees\nand obstacles represents an extreme challenge for a UAV swarm. It requires the\nswarm to constantly avoid possible collisions with trees, to change\nautonomously the trajectory, which can lead to disconnection to the swarm, and\nto reconnect to the swarm after passing the obstacle, while continue collecting\nenvironmental data that needs to be fused and assessed efficiently.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel solution to the formation flight problem\nfor UAV swarms. The proposed method provides an adaptive and reliable network\nstructure, which maintains swarm connectivity and communicability. These\ncharacteristics are needed to achieve a detailed and accurate description of\nthe environment from the data acquired by the UAV swarm.\n  The main characteristics of our approach are high scalability regarding the\nnumber of UAVs in the swarm and the adaptive network topology within the swarm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2016 10:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-18"}

A distinguishing feature of such systems is the phenomenon\nof \"saturation\" which tames the expected growth of the gluon density as the\nenergy of the collision increases. The onset of saturation occurs at a\nparticular transverse momentum scale, the \"saturation momentum\", that emerges\ndynamically and that marks the onset of non-linear gluon interactions. At high\nenergy, and for large nuclei, the saturation momentum is large compared to the\ntypical hadronic scale, making high density gluons amenable to a description\nwith weak coupling techniques. This paper reviews some of the challenges faced\nin the study of such dense systems of small $x$ gluons, and of the progress\nmade in addressing them. The focus is on conceptual issues, and the\npresentation is both pedagogical, and critical.

In this work we rigorously show the shortcomings of various\nsimplifications that are used to calculate the total internal partition\nfunction. These shortcomings can lead to errors of up to 40 percent or more in\nthe estimated partition function. These errors carry on to calculations of\nthermodynamic quantities. Therefore a more complicated approach has to be\ntaken.\n  Methods. Seven possible simplifications of various complexity are described,\ntogether with advantages and disadvantages of direct summation of experimental\nvalues. These were compared to what we consider the most accurate and most\ncomplete treatment (case 8). Dunham coefficients were determined from\nexperimental and theoretical energy levels of a number of electronically\nexcited states of H$_2$ . Both equilibrium and normal hydrogen was taken into\nconsideration.\n  Results. Various shortcomings in existing calculations are demonstrated, and\nthe reasons for them are explained. New partition functions for equilibrium,\nnormal, and ortho and para hydrogen are calculated and thermodynamic quantities\nare reported for the temperature range 1 - 20000 K.

For most of the relevant astrophysical cases it is strongly\nadvised to avoid using simplifications, such as a harmonic oscillator and rigid\nrotor or ad hoc summation limits of the eigenstates to estimate accurate\npartition functions and to be particularly careful when using polynomial fits\nto the computed values.

In this paper, the radiative correction to\nthe triple Higgs coupling is investigated in the minimal extension of the SM by\nadding a real gauge singlet scalar. In this model there are two scalars $h$ and\n$H$, and both of them are mixing states of the doublet and singlet. Provided\nthat the mixing angle is set to be zero, namely the SM limit, $h$ is the pure\nleft-over of the doublet and its behaviour is the same as that of the SM at the\ntree level. However the loop corrections can alter $h$-related couplings. In\nthis SM limit case, the effect of the singlet $H$ may show up in the\n$h$-related couplings, especially the triple $h$ coupling.

The first result, coupled with electron density diagnostics\nand compared with published optical and ultraviolet observations, indicates\nthat most likely in 2012 September the X-rays originate from a very small\nfraction of the ejecta, concentrated in very dense clumps. We obtained a fairly\ngood fit to the September spectrum with a model of plasma in collisional\nionization equilibrium (CIE) with two components; one at a temperature of 0.78\nkeV, blueshifted by 710-930 km/s, the other at a temperature of 4.5 keV, mostly\ncontributing to the high-energy continuum. However, we cannot rule out a range\nof plasma temperatures between these two extremes. In December, the central\nwhite dwarf (WD) became visible in X-rays. We estimate an effective temperature\nof about 680,000 K, consistent with a WD mass ~1.1 M(sol). The WD flux is\nmodulated with the orbital period, indicating high inclination, and two\nquasi-periodic modulations with hour timescales were also observed. No hot\nplasma component with temperature above 0.5 keV was observed in December, and\nthe blue-shifted component cooled to kT~0.45 keV. Additionally, new emission\nlines due to a much cooler plasma appeared, which were not observed two months\nearlier. We estimate abundances and yields of elements in the nova wind that\ncannot be measured in the optical spectra and confirm the high Ne abundance\npreviously derived for this nova.

Recent progress have\nextended SFM to the areas of {multi-body SFM} (where there are {multiple rigid}\nrelative motions in the scene), as well as {non-rigid SFM} (where there is a\nsingle non-rigid, deformable object or scene). Along this line of thinking,\nthere is apparently a missing gap of \"multi-body non-rigid SFM\", in which the\ntask would be to jointly reconstruct and segment multiple 3D structures of the\nmultiple, non-rigid objects or deformable scenes from images.

An Explorer-scale,\nlarge-area (> 1,000 cm2), high resolving power (R > 3,000) XGS is highly\nfeasible based on Critical-Angle Transmission (CAT) gratings, even for\ntelescopes with angular resolution of 5-10 arcsec. Significantly higher\nperformance can be provided by a CAT XGS on an X-ray-Surveyor-type mission. CAT\ngratings combine the advantages of blazed reflection gratings (high efficiency,\nuse of higher diffraction orders) with those of transmission gratings (low\nmass, relaxed alignment and temperature requirements, transparent at high\nenergies) with minimal mission resource demands. They are high-efficiency\nblazed transmission gratings that consist of freestanding, ultra-high\naspect-ratio grating bars made from SOI wafers using anisotropic dry and wet\netch techniques. Blazing is achieved through reflection off grating bar\nsidewalls. Silicon is well matched to the soft x-ray band, and existing silicon\nCAT gratings exceed 30% absolute diffraction efficiency, with clear paths for\nimprovement. CAT gratings coated with heavier elements allow extension of the\nCAT grating principle to higher energies and larger angles, enabling higher\nresolving power at shorter wavelengths. We show x-ray data from CAT gratings\ncoated with platinum using atomic layer deposition, and demonstrate blazing to\nhigher energies and much larger blaze angles than possible with silicon. We\nmeasure resolving power of a CAT XGS consisting of a Wolter-I focusing mirror\npair from GSFC and CAT gratings, performed at the MSFC SLF. Measurement of the\nAl Ka doublet in 18th order shows resolving power > 10,000, based on\npreliminary analysis. This demonstrates that currently fabricated CAT gratings\nare compatible with the most advanced XGS designs for future soft x-ray\nspectroscopy missions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2016 14:08:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

The analysis\ndemonstrate the importance of the inter atomic dipole-dipole interaction which\nmay lead to a collective ordering of the emission along some specific\ndirections. We examine the conditions under which the radiative modes available\nfor the emission are only those contained inside a cone centered about the\ninter atomic axis. Particular interest is in achieving the one-way emission\nalong the inter atomic axis, either into left (backward) or right (forward)\ndirection, which is referred to as a mirror-like behavior of the atomic chain.\nA direction dependent quantity called the directivity function, which\ndetermines how effective the system is in concentrating the radiation into a\ngiven direction, is introduced. We show that the function depends crucially on\nthe distance between the atoms and find that there is a threshold for the inter\natomic distances above which a strongly directional emission can be achieved.\nThe one-sided emission as a manifestation of the mirror-like behavior and a\nhighly focused emission along the inter atomic axis as a characteristic of a\nsingle-mode cavity are demonstrated to occur in the stationary field. Below the\nthreshold the directivity function is spherically symmetric.

A considerable\namount of literature has addressed spatio--temporal models, with Spatial\nDynamic Panel Data (SDPD) being widely investigated and applied.

At other times, the\nassumptions are clearly violated. For example, the spatial matrix is assumed to\nbe known but it may actually be unknown and needs to be estimated. In such\ncases, the performance of the SDPD model's estimator is generally affected.\nMotivated by such considerations, we propose a new model (called stationary\nSDPD) and a new estimation procedure based on simple and clear assumptions that\ncan be easily checked with real data. The new model is highly adaptive, and the\nestimation procedure has a rate of convergence that is not affected by the\ndimension of the time series (under general assumptions), notwithstanding the\nrelatively high number of parameters to be estimated. The new model may be used\nto represent a wide class of multivariate time series, not necessarily\nspatio-temporal. So, it can be used as a valid alternative to vector\nautoregressive (VAR) models with two immediate advantages: i) a faster rate of\nconvergence of the estimation procedure and ii) the possibility of estimating\nthe model even when the dimension is higher than the time series length,\novercoming the curse of dimensionality typical of the VAR models.

This problem commonly appears in information retrieval and\nweb-search in order to select a diverse set of points from the input. In this\ncontext, it has recently received a lot of attention.\n  We present new techniques to analyze natural local search algorithms. This\nleads to a (1-O(1/k))-approximation for distances of negative type, even\nsubject to any matroid constraint of rank k, in time O(n k^2 log k), when\nassuming that distance evaluations and calls to the independence oracle are\nconstant time. Negative type distances include as special cases Euclidean\ndistances and many further natural distances. Our result easily transforms into\na PTAS and improves on the only previously known PTAS for this setting, which\nrelies on convex optimization techniques in an n-dimensional space and is\nimpractical for large data sets. In contrast, our procedure has an (optimal)\nlinear dependence on n.\n  Using generalized exchange properties of matroid intersection, we show that a\nPTAS can be obtained for matroid intersection constraints as well. Moreover,\nour techniques, being based on local search, are conceptually simple and allow\nfor various extensions. In particular, we get asymptotically optimal\nO(1)-approximations when combining the classic dispersion function with a\nmonotone submodular objective, which is a very common class of functions to\nmeasure diversity and relevance. This result leverages recent advances on local\nsearch techniques based on proxy functions to obtain optimal approximations for\nmonotone submodular function maximization subject to a matroid constraint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2016 15:38:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-18"}

The matching method is applied to obtain the\nnature of the fields near the horizon using which the holographic free energy\nis computed through the gauge/gravity duality. The critical temperature is\nobtained for a set of values of the matching point of the near horizon and the\nboundary behaviour of the fields. The thermodynamic geometry is then computed\nfrom the free energy of the boundary theory. From the divergence of the\nthermodynamic scalar curvature, the critical temperature is obtained once\nagain. We then compare this result for the critical temperature with that\nobtained from the matching method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 16:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-23"}

GW emission in the\npre-explosion phase strongly depends on whether the post-shock flow is\ndominated by the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) or convection and\ndiffers considerably from 2D models. SASI activity produces a strong signal\ncomponent below 250 Hz through asymmetric mass motions in the gain layer and a\nnon-resonant coupling to the proto-neutron star (PNS). Both convection- and\nSASI-dominated models show GW emission above 250 Hz, but with considerably\nlower amplitudes than in 2D. This is due to a different excitation mechanism\nfor high-frequency l=2 motions in the PNS surface, which are predominantly\nexcited by PNS convection in 3D. Resonant excitation of high-frequency surface\ng-modes in 3D by mass motions in the gain layer is suppressed compared to 2D\nbecause of smaller downflow velocities and a lack of high-frequency variability\nin the downflows. In the exploding 20 Msun model, shock revival results in\nenhanced low-frequency emission due to a change of the preferred scale of the\nconvective eddies in the PNS convection zone. Estimates of the expected excess\npower in two frequency bands suggests that second-generation detectors will\nonly be able to detect very nearby events, but that third-generation detectors\ncould distinguish SASI- and convection-dominated models at distances of ~10\nkpc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2016 15:16:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 12:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

Our formulations are based on a global\nscheduling scheme and a fluid model. The first formulation is a mixed-integer\nnonlinear program, since the scheduling problem is intuitively considered as an\nassignment problem. However, by changing the scheduling problem to first\ndetermine a task workload partition and then to find the execution order of all\ntasks, the computation time can be significantly reduced. Specifically, the\nworkload partitioning problem can be formulated as a continuous nonlinear\nprogram for a system with continuous operating frequency, and as a continuous\nlinear program for a practical system with a discrete speed level set. The task\nordering problem can be solved by an algorithm with a complexity that is linear\nin the total number of tasks. The work is evaluated against existing global\nenergy/feasibility optimal workload allocation formulations. The results\nillustrate that our algorithms are both feasibility optimal and energy optimal\nfor both implicit and constrained deadline tasksets. Specifically, our\nalgorithm can achieve up to 40% energy saving for some simulated tasksets with\nconstrained deadlines. The benefit of our formulation compared with existing\nwork is that our algorithms can solve a more general class of scheduling\nproblems due to incorporating a scheduling dynamic model in the formulations\nand allowing for a time-varying speed profile. Moreover, our algorithms can be\napplied to both online and offline scheduling schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2016 14:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-13"}

It is found that the standard presuppositions of\npeople like Benofy and Quay (BQ) following Joseph Fourier do not obtain for at\nleast a certain specified regime of intermolecular potential parameters related\nto harmonic (quadratic) potentials for nearest neighbor interactions. For these\nharmonic potentials, it appears from the simulation results that steady state\nsolutions exist utilizing non-synthetic thermostats that couple not just the\ntwo particles at the extreme ends of the lattice chain, but to a control volume\nof $N$ particles located at either ends of the chain that does not accord with\nthe unique analytical solutions that obtains for single particle thermostatting\nat the ends of the lattice with a different thermostatting algorithm that\nutilizes coupling coefficients. If the method used here is considered a more\n\"realistic\" or feasible model of the physical reality, then a re-evaluation of\nsome aspects of the standard theoretical methodology is warranted since the\nstandard model solution profile does not accord with the simulation temperature\nprofile determined here for this related model.
