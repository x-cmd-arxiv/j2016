Vector magnetic field measurements from Helioseismic\nMagnetic Imager and coronal EUV observations from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly\nreveal that the erupting inverse-S sigmoid had roots in the location of the\nrotating sunspot. Sunspot rotates at a rate of 0-5deg/h with increasing trend\nin the first half followed by a decrease. Time evolution of many non-potential\nparameters had a well correspondence with the sunspot rotation. The evolution\nof the AR magnetic structure is approximated by a time series of force free\nequilibria. The NLFFF magnetic structure around the sunspot manifests the\nobserved sigmoid structure. Field lines from the sunspot periphery constitute\nthe body of the sigmoid and those from interior overly the sigmoid similar to a\nfluxrope structure. While the sunspot is being rotating, two major CME\neruptions occurred in the AR. During the first (second) event, the coronal\ncurrent concentrations enhanced (degraded) consistent with the photospheric net\nvertical current, however the magnetic energy is released during both the\ncases. The analysis results suggest that the magnetic connections of the\nsigmoid are driven by slow motion of sunspot rotation, which transforms to a\nhighly twisted flux rope structure in a dynamical scenario. An exceeding\ncritical twist in the flux rope probably leads to the loss of equilibrium and\nthus triggering the onset of two eruptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 16:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

The bright end of this population has been well characterized in\nrecent years, but considerable uncertainties remain for fainter dusty\nstar-forming galaxies, which are responsible for the bulk of star formation at\nhigh redshift and thus play a key role in galaxy growth and evolution.\n  In this first paper of our series, we describe our methods for finding high\nredshift faint dusty galaxies using millimeter observations with ALMA. We\nobtained ALMA 1.1 mm mosaic images for three strong-lensing galaxy clusters\nfrom the Frontier Fields survey. The 2'x2' mosaics overlap with the deep HST\nWFC3/IR footprints and encompass the high magnification regions of each\ncluster. The combination of extremely high ALMA sensitivity and the\nmagnification power of these clusters allows us to systematically probe the\nsub-mJy population of dusty star-forming galaxies over a large surveyed area.\n  We present a description of the reduction and analysis of the ALMA continuum\nobservations for the galaxy clusters Abell 2744 (z=0.308), MACSJ0416.1-2403\n(z=0.396) and MACSJ1149.5+2223 (z=0.543), for which we reach observed rms\nsensitivities of 55, 59 and 71 $\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ respectively. We detect 12\ndusty star-forming galaxies at S/N>5.0 across the three clusters, all of them\npresenting coincidence with NIR detected counterparts in the HST images.

The MFR is non-linear force-free with\ndecreasing twist from the axis (9 turns/AU) towards the edge. Therefore\nGold-Hoyle (GH) configuration, assuming a constant twist, is more consistent\nwith the MC structure than the Lundquist configuration of increasing twist from\nthe axis to boundary.

As a way to study the\nbehavior of gravity in these extreme environments I have used and added to a\nray-tracing code that simulates the X-ray emission from the accretion disks\nsurrounding black holes. In particular, the observational channels which can be\nsimulated include the thermal and reflected spectra, polarization, and\nreverberation signatures. These calculations can be performed assuming GR as\nwell as four alternative spacetimes. These results can be used to see if it is\npossible to determine if observations can test the No-Hair theorem of GR which\nstates that stationary, astrophysical black holes are only described by their\nmass and spin. Although it proves difficult to distinguish between theories of\ngravity it is possible to exclude a large portion of the possible deviations\nfrom GR using observations of rapidly spinning stellar mass black holes such as\nCygnus X-1.

We therefore propose the KIT Motion-Language Dataset, which is large,\nopen, and extensible. We aggregate data from multiple motion capture databases\nand include them in our dataset using a unified representation that is\nindependent of the capture system or marker set, making it easy to work with\nthe data regardless of its origin. To obtain motion annotations in natural\nlanguage, we apply a crowd-sourcing approach and a web-based tool that was\nspecifically build for this purpose, the Motion Annotation Tool. We thoroughly\ndocument the annotation process itself and discuss gamification methods that we\nused to keep annotators motivated. We further propose a novel method,\nperplexity-based selection, which systematically selects motions for further\nannotation that are either under-represented in our dataset or that have\nerroneous annotations. We show that our method mitigates the two aforementioned\nproblems and ensures a systematic annotation process. We provide an in-depth\nanalysis of the structure and contents of our resulting dataset, which, as of\nOctober 10, 2016, contains 3911 motions with a total duration of 11.23 hours\nand 6278 annotations in natural language that contain 52,903 words.

Our results are completely new for the Hardy-Sobolev case, and in\nthe Besov case they extend results recently obtained by Barton and Mayboroda.\n  First we develop a theory of BHS spaces adapted to operators which are\nbisectorial on $L^2$, with bounded $H^\\infty$ functional calculus on their\nranges, and which satisfy $L^2$ off-diagonal estimates. In particular, this\ntheory applies to perturbed Dirac operators $DB$.

Many historical trend analyses appear to\ndeemphasize physical and statistical assumptions: examples include regression\nmodels that treat time rather than radiative forcing as the relevant covariate\nand time series methods that account for internal variability\nnonparametrically. However, given a limited record and the presence of internal\nvariability, estimating radiatively forced historical temperature trends\nnecessarily requires assumptions. Ostensibly empirical methods can involve an\ninherent conflict in assumptions: they require data records that are short\nenough for naive trend models to apply but long enough for internal variability\nto be accounted for. In the context of global mean temperatures, methods that\ndeemphasize assumptions can therefore produce misleading inferences, because\nthe twentieth century trend is complex and the scale of correlation is long\nrelative to the data length. We illustrate how a simple but physically\nmotivated trend model can provide better-fitting and more broadly applicable\ntrend estimates and can address a wider array of questions. The model allows\none to distinguish, within a single framework, between uncertainties in the\nshorter-term versus longer-term response to radiative forcing, with\nimplications not only on historical trends but also on uncertainties in future\nprojections. We also investigate the consequence on inferred uncertainties of\nthe choice of a statistical description of internal variability. While\nnonparametric methods may seem to avoid making explicit assumptions, we\ndemonstrate how even misspecified parametric methods, if attuned to important\ncharacteristics of internal variability, can result in more accurate statements\nabout trend uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 18:35:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2016 20:13:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 14 May 2017 23:04:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

Max-Sum has been shown experimentally to give\nasymptotically optimal results on certain types of weighted random graphs, and\nto give good solutions in short computation times for some types of real\nnetworks. However, the hypotheses behind the formulation and the cavity method\nitself limit substantially the class of instances on which the approach gives\ngood results (or even converges). Moreover, in the standard model formulation,\nthe diameter of the tree solution is limited by a predefined bound, that\naffects both computation time and convergence properties. In this work we\ndescribe two main enhancements to the Max-Sum equations to be able to cope with\noptimization of real-world instances. First, we develop an alternative 'flat'\nmodel formulation, that allows to reduce substantially the relevant\nconfiguration space, making the approach feasible on instances with large\nsolution diameter, in particular when the number of terminal nodes is small.\nSecond, we propose an integration between Max-Sum and three greedy heuristics.\nThis integration allows to transform Max-Sum into a highly competitive\nself-contained algorithm, in which a feasible solution is given at each step of\nthe iterative procedure. Part of this development participated on the 2014\nDIMACS challenge on Steiner Problems, and we report the results here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 19:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

We present simultaneous NuSTAR, Chandra and Swift/XRT observations\nduring the peak of a flaring episode with the aim of modeling the emission of\nM82 X-1 and yielding insights into its nature. We find that thin-accretion disk\nmodels all require accretion rates at or above the Eddington limit in order to\nreproduce the spectral shape, given a range of black hole masses and spins.\nSince at these high Eddington ratios the thin-disk model breaks down due to\nradial advection in the disk, we discard the results of the thin-disk models as\nunphysical. We find that the temperature profile as a function of disk radius\n($T(r)\\propto r^{-p}$) is significantly flatter ($p=0.55^{+ 0.07}_{- 0.04}$)\nthan expected for a standard thin disk ($p=0.75$). A flatter profile is instead\ncharacteristic of a slim disk which is highly suggestive of super-Eddington\naccretion.

The average 1-sigma depth of S2CLS is 1.2 mJy/beam,\napproaching the SCUBA-2 850um confusion limit, which we determine to be ~0.8\nmJy/beam. We measure the single dish 850um number counts to unprecedented\naccuracy, reducing the Poisson errors on the differential counts to\napproximately 4% at S_850~3mJy. With several independent fields, we investigate\nfield-to-field variance, finding that the number counts on 0.5-1 degree scales\nare generally within 50% of the S2CLS mean for S_850>3mJy, with scatter\nconsistent with the Poisson and estimated cosmic variance uncertainties,\nalthough there is a marginal (2-sigma) density enhancement in the GOODS-North\nfield. The observed number counts are in reasonable agreement with recent\nphenomenological and semi-analytic models. Finally, the large solid angle of\nS2CLS allows us to measure the bright-end counts: at S_850>10mJy there are\napproximately ten sources per square degree, and we detect the distinctive\nup-turn in the number counts indicative of the detection of local sources of\n850um emission and strongly lensed high-redshift galaxies.

Compared to previous approaches, our\ntransfer process features high yield and uniformity with minimal liquid and\nchemical exposure (only involving DI water), resulting in high-quality MoS2\ncrystals and exceptional device performance and homogeneity; and our process is\nreadily applicable to other 2D materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 22:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-15"}

As the amount of data\nis often huge, it is desirable to obtain sublinear time algorithms, and\nspecifically property testers, to understand local properties of the data.\n  We focus on the natural local problem of testing pattern freeness: given a\nlarge $d$-dimensional array $A$ and a fixed $d$-dimensional pattern $P$ over a\nfinite alphabet, we say that $A$ is $P$-free if it does not contain a copy of\nthe forbidden pattern $P$ as a consecutive subarray. The distance of $A$ to\n$P$-freeness is the fraction of entries of $A$ that need to be modified to make\nit $P$-free. For any $\\epsilon \\in [0,1]$ and any large enough pattern $P$ over\nany alphabet, other than a very small set of exceptional patterns, we design a\ntolerant tester that distinguishes between the case that the distance is at\nleast $\\epsilon$ and the case that it is at most $a_d \\epsilon$, with query\ncomplexity and running time $c_d \\epsilon^{-1}$, where $a_d < 1$ and $c_d$\ndepend only on $d$.\n  To analyze the testers we establish several combinatorial results, including\nthe following $d$-dimensional modification lemma, which might be of independent\ninterest: for any large enough pattern $P$ over any alphabet (excluding a small\nset of exceptional patterns for the binary case), and any array $A$ containing\na copy of $P$, one can delete this copy by modifying one of its locations\nwithout creating new $P$-copies in $A$.\n  Our results address an open question of Fischer and Newman, who asked whether\nthere exist efficient testers for properties related to tight substructures in\nmulti-dimensional structured data. They serve as a first step towards a general\nunderstanding of local properties of multi-dimensional arrays, as any such\nproperty can be characterized by a fixed family of forbidden patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 23:55:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 20:01:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2017 12:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

Under\nsuitable conditions, the total spectral function is shown to develop a Fermi\nlevel resonance, so that the linear conductance of the system peaks at a finite\nZeeman field while it decreases as function of temperature. These features, as\nwell as the local moment and entropy contribution of the impurity system are\ncommensurate with Kondo physics, which can be studied in suitably tuned quantum\ndot systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 00:40:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 23:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

First, the problem of GFDM filter\noptimization for rate maximization is formulated by expressing the transmission\nrate of GFDM as a function of GFDM filter coefficients. It is shown that\nDirichlet filters are rate-optimal in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)\nchannels with no carrier frequency offset (CFO) under linear zero-forcing (ZF)\nor minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receivers, but in general channels\nperturbed by CFO a properly designed nontrivial GFDM filter can yield better\nperformance than Dirichlet filters by adjusting the subcarrier waveform to cope\nwith the channel-induced CFO. Next, the problem of GFDM filter design for OOB\nemission minimization is formulated by expressing the power spectral density\n(PSD) of the GFDM transmit signal as a function of GFDM filter coefficients,\nand it is shown that the OOB emission can be reduced significantly by designing\nthe GFDM filter properly. Finally, joint design of GFDM filter and window for\nthe two design criteria is considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 06:09:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2016 01:10:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

Recently\nTully et al. (2015) reported the discovery of two almost parallel planes in the\nnearby Cen A group using mostly high-mass galaxies (M$_B$ $<$ -10 mag) in their\nanalysis. Our team detected a large number of new group member candidates in\nthe Cen A group (M\\\"uller et al. 2016).

We use various statistical methods to test whether the distribution\nof galaxies follows a single normal distribution or shows evidence of\nbimodality as it has been reported earlier. We confirm that the data used for\nthe Tully et al.

Instead, the plane that contains Cen A becomes more prominent. We\nfound evidence that the galaxy system around Cen A is made up of only one plane\nof satellites. This plane is almost orthogonal to the dust plane of Cen A.\nAccurate distances to the new dwarf galaxies will be required to measure the\nprecise 3D distribution of the galaxies around Cen A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 08:09:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2016 09:27:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2016 07:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

We observe two types of molecular resonances. The\nfirst type originates from the correlated excitation of two atoms into\nRydberg-atom-pair states interacting at long range via multipole-multipole\ninteractions. The second type results from the interaction of one atom excited\nto a Rydberg state with one atom in the electronic ground state. Which type of\nresonances is observed in the experiments depends on the laser intensity and\nfrequency and on the pulse sequences used to prepare the Rydberg states. We\nobtain insights into both types of molecular resonances by modelling the\ninteraction potentials, using a multipole expansion of the long-range\ninteraction for the first type of resonances and a Fermi-contact\npseudo-potential for the second type of resonances. We analyse the relation of\nthese long-range molecular resonances to molecular Rydberg states and ion-pair\nstates, and discuss their decay channels into atomic and molecular ions.

Chemical\nkinetics models have been widely used in the literature to investigate the\nchemical compositions of hot Jupiter atmospheres which are expected to be\ndriven away from chemical equilibrium via processes such as vertical mixing and\nphotochemistry. All of these models have so far used pressure--temperature\n(P-T) profiles as fixed model input. This results in a decoupling of the\nchemistry from the radiative and thermal properties of the atmosphere, despite\nthe fact that in nature they are intricately linked. We use a one-dimensional\nradiative-convective equilibrium model, ATMO, which includes a sophisticated\nchemistry scheme to calculate P-T profiles which are fully consistent with\nnon-equilibrium chemical abundances, including vertical mixing and\nphotochemistry. Our primary conclusion is that, in cases of strong chemical\ndisequilibrium, consistent calculations can lead to differences in the P-T\nprofile of up to 100 K compared to the P-T profile derived assuming chemical\nequilibrium. This temperature change can, in turn, have important consequences\nfor the chemical abundances themselves as well as for the simulated emission\nspectra. In particular, we find that performing the chemical kinetics\ncalculation consistently can reduce the overall impact of non-equilibrium\nchemistry on the observable emission spectrum of hot Jupiters. Simulated\nobservations derived from non-consistent models could thus yield the wrong\ninterpretation. We show that this behaviour is due to the non-consistent models\nviolating the energy budget balance of the atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 10:07:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

In this paper we introduce a novel approach, which was recently\npresented at Linux Conference Europe 2015, based on the Beowulf concept and\nutilizing single board computers (SBC). We present a low-energy consumption\narchitecture capable to tackle heavily demanding scientific computational\nproblems. Additionally, our goal is to provide a low cost personal solution for\nscientists and engineers. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed\narchitecture we ran several standard benchmarking tests. Furthermore, we assess\nthe reliability of the machine in real life situations by performing two\nbenchmark tools involving practical TCAD for physicist and engineers in the\nsemiconductor industry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 10:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-15"}

The density profile of a typical core extracted from an earlier\nsimulation developed to study core-formation in a molecular cloud was used for\nthe purpose. We demonstrate - (i) cores contracted in quasistatic manner over a\ntimescale on the order of $\\sim 10^{5}$ years. Those that remained starless did\nbriefly acquire a centrally concentrated density configuration that mimicked\nthe density profile of a unstable Bonnor Ebert sphere before rebounding, (ii)\nthree of our test cores viz. L694-2, L1689-SMM16 and L1521F remained starless\ndespite becoming thermally super-critical. On the contrary B68 and L1517B\nremained sub-critical; L1521F collapsed to become a VeLLO only when gas-cooling\nwas enhanced by increasing the size of dust-grains. This result is robust, for\nother cores viz. B68, L694-2, L1517B and L1689 that previously remained\nstarless could also be similarly induced to collapse. Our principle conclusions\nare : (a) acquiring the thermally super-critical state does not ensure that a\ncore will necessarily become protostellar, (b) potentially star-forming cores\n(VeLLO L1521F here), could be experiencing coagulation of dust-grains that must\nenhance the gas-dust coupling and in turn lower the gas temperature, thereby\nassisting collapse. This hypothesis appears to have some observational support,\nand (c) depending on its dynamic state at any given epoch, a core could appear\nto be pressure-confined, gravitationally/virially bound, suggesting that\ngravitational/virial boundedness of a core is insufficient to ensure it will\nform stars, though it is crucial for gas in a contracting core to cool\nefficiently so it can collapse further to become protostellar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 10:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

Here, we present polarization\nsimulations for two alternative scenarios: the sub-Chandrasekhar mass\ndouble-detonation and the Chandrasekhar mass delayed-detonation model.\nSpecifically, we study a two-dimensional double-detonation model and a\nthree-dimensional delayed-detonation model, and calculate polarization spectra\nfor multiple observer orientations in both cases. We find modest polarization\nlevels ($<$ 1 per cent) for both explosion models. Polarization in the\ncontinuum peaks at $\\sim$ 0.1$-$0.3 per cent and decreases after maximum light,\nin excellent agreement with spectropolarimetric data of normal Type Ia\nsupernovae. Higher degrees of polarization are found across individual spectral\nlines. In particular, the synthetic Si ii {\\lambda}6355 profiles are polarized\nat levels that match remarkably well the values observed in normal Type Ia\nsupernovae, while the low degrees of polarization predicted across the O i\n{\\lambda}7774 region are consistent with the non-detection of this feature in\ncurrent data. We conclude that our models can reproduce many of the\ncharacteristics of both flux and polarization spectra for well-studied Type Ia\nsupernovae, such as SN 2001el and SN 2012fr.

Modern interferometers are capable of\nproducing data at very high time and frequency resolution; practical limits on\nstorage and computation costs require that some form of data compression be\nimposed. The traditional form of compression is a simple averaging of the\nvisibilities over coarser time and frequency bins. This has an undesired side\neffect: the resulting averaged visibilities \"decorrelate\", and do so\ndifferently depending on the baseline length and averaging interval. This\ntranslates into a non-trivial signature in the image domain known as\n\"smearing\", which manifests itself as an attenuation in amplitude towards\noff-centre sources. With the increasing fields of view and/or longer baselines\nemployed in modern and future instruments, the trade-off between data rate and\nsmearing becomes increasingly unfavourable. In this work we investigate\nalternative approaches to low-loss data compression. We show that averaging of\nthe visibility data can be treated as a form of convolution by a boxcar-like\nwindow function, and that by employing alternative baseline-dependent window\nfunctions a more optimal interferometer smearing response may be induced. In\nparticular, we show improved amplitude response over a chosen field of\ninterest, and better attenuation of sources outside the field of interest. The\nmain cost of this technique is a reduction in nominal sensitivity; we\ninvestigate the smearing vs. sensitivity trade-off, and show that in certain\nregimes a favourable compromise can be achieved. We show the application of\nthis technique to simulated data from the Karl G.

In the framework of\ndynamical instability models of early Solar System evolution, which suggest a\ncommon primordial progenitor population for both Trojans and Kuiper belt\nobjects, we use observational constraints to assert that the color bimodalities\nevident in both minor body populations developed within the primordial\npopulation prior to the onset of instability. We show that, beginning with an\ninitial composition of rock and ices, location-dependent volatile loss through\nsublimation in this primordial population could have led to sharp changes in\nthe surface composition with heliocentric distance. We propose that the\ndepletion or retention of H$_{2}$S ice on the surface of these objects was the\nkey factor in creating an initial color bimodality. Objects that retained\nH$_{2}$S on their surfaces developed characteristically redder colors upon\nirradiation than those that did not. After the bodies from the primordial\npopulation were scattered and emplaced into their current positions, they\npreserved this primordial color bimodality to the present day.

LSPIV technique is based on a camera view that frames the water surface\nin a sequence, and image-processing methods to compute water surface\ndisplacements between consecutive frames. Using LSPIV, high flow velocities, as\nfor example flood conditions, were accurately measured, whereas determinations\nof low flow velocities is more challenging, especially in absence of floating\nseeding transported by the flow velocity. In fact, in unseeded conditions,\ntypical surface features dynamics must be taken into account: besides surface\nstructures convected by the current, capillary-gravity waves travel in all\ndirections, with their own dynamics. Discrimination between all these phenomena\nis here discussed, providing a new method to distinguish and to correct\nunseeded LSPIV measurements associated with wavy structures, accounting for\ntheir phase speed magnitude and direction.

In this\nproblem, the X-ray signals to be separated have similar morphological\ncharacteristics, which brings previous source separation methods to their\nlimits. Our solution is to use photographs taken from the front and back-side\nof the panel to drive the separation process. The crux of our approach relies\non the coupling of the two imaging modalities (photographs and X-rays) using a\nnovel coupled dictionary learning framework able to capture both common and\ndisparate features across the modalities using parsimonious representations;\nthe common component models features shared by the multi-modal images, whereas\nthe innovation component captures modality-specific information. As such, our\nmodel enables the formulation of appropriately regularized convex optimization\nprocedures that lead to the accurate separation of the X-rays. Our dictionary\nlearning framework can be tailored both to a single- and a multi-scale\nframework, with the latter leading to a significant performance improvement.\nMoreover, to improve further on the visual quality of the separated images, we\npropose to train coupled dictionaries that ignore certain parts of the painting\ncorresponding to craquelure. Experimentation on synthetic and real data - taken\nfrom digital acquisition of the Ghent Altarpiece (1432) - confirms the\nsuperiority of our method against the state-of-the-art morphological component\nanalysis technique that uses either fixed or trained dictionaries to perform\nimage separation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 14:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

As some items might be substitutes,\nagents need to strategize in order to maximize their utilities. A number of\nresults indicate that high welfare can be achieved this way, giving bounds on\nthe welfare at equilibrium. Recently, however, criticism has been raised that\nequilibria are hard to compute and therefore unlikely to be attained.\n  In this paper, we take a different perspective. We study simple best-response\ndynamics. That is, agents are activated one after the other and each activated\nagent updates his strategy myopically to a best response against the other\nagents' current strategies. Often these dynamics may take exponentially long\nbefore they converge or they may not converge at all. However, as we show,\nconvergence is not even necessary for good welfare guarantees. Given that\nagents' bid updates are aggressive enough but not too aggressive, the game will\nremain in states of good welfare after each agent has updated his bid at least\nonce.\n  In more detail, we show that if agents have fractionally subadditive\nvaluations, natural dynamics reach and remain in a state that provides a $1/3$\napproximation to the optimal welfare after each agent has updated his bid at\nleast once. For subadditive valuations, we can guarantee an $\\Omega(1/\\log m)$\napproximation in case of $m$ items that applies after each agent has updated\nhis bid at least once and at any point after that. The latter bound is\ncomplemented by a negative result, showing that no kind of best-response\ndynamics can guarantee more than an $o(\\log \\log m/\\log m)$ fraction of the\noptimal social welfare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 14:30:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2017 11:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-17"}

While size-spectrum models have\nexplained this phenomenon for assemblages of multicellular organisms, this\npaper introduces a species-resolved size-spectrum model to explain the\nphenomenon in unicellular plankton. A Sheldon spectrum spanning the cell-size\nrange of unicellular plankton necessarily consists of a large number of\ncoexisting species covering a wide range of characteristic sizes. The\ncoexistence of many phytoplankton species feeding on a small number of\nresources is known as the Paradox of the Plankton. Our model resolves the\nparadox by showing that coexistence is facilitated by the allometric scaling of\nfour physiological rates. Two of the allometries have empirical support, the\nremaining two emerge from predator-prey interactions exactly when the\nabundances follow a Sheldon spectrum. Our plankton model is a scale-invariant\ntrait-based size-spectrum model: it describes the abundance of phyto- and\nzooplankton cells as a function of both size and species trait (the maximal\nsize before cell division). It incorporates growth due to resource consumption\nand predation on smaller cells, death due to predation, and a flexible cell\ndivision process. We give analytic solutions at steady state for both the\nwithin-species size distributions and the relative abundances across species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 15:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-26"}

The universal\nequation of state is written as a series solution to a self consistent integral\nequation where the general solution is a linear combination of Fermi functions.\nFirst, by truncating our series solution to four terms with already known exact\ntheoretical inputs at limiting cases, namely the first \\emph{three} virial\ncoefficients and using the Bertsch parameter as a free parameter, we find a\ngood agreement with experimental measurements in the entire temperature region\nin the normal state. This analytical equation of state agrees with experimental\ndata up to the fugacity $z = 18$, which is a vast improvement over the other\nanalytical equations of state available where the agreements is \\emph{only} up\nto $z \\approx 7$. Second, by truncating our series solution to four terms again\nusing first \\emph{four} virial coefficients, we find the Bertsch parameter $\\xi\n=0.35$, which is in good agreement with the direct experimental measurement of\n$\\xi =0.37$. This second form of equation of state shows a good agreement with\nself-consistent T-matrix calculations in the normal phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 14:04:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Oct 2016 17:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

The main contribution of the Oxford study is to\nestablish a phenomenology of cost and cost overrun at the Olympics, which\nallows consistent and systematic comparison across Games. This has not been\ndone before. The study concludes that for a city and nation to decide to stage\nthe Olympic Games is to decide to take on one of the most costly and\nfinancially most risky type of megaproject that exists, something that many\ncities and nations have learned to their peril.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 12:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-18"}

This study assesses the hypothesis that the\nHEGB diffusion is responsible for Ag release in Tristructural-Isotropic fuel\nparticles, and provides a specific example to increase understanding of\nimpurity diffusion in highly disordered grain boundaries. The HEGB environment\nwas modeled by an amorphous SiC. The structure and stability of Ag defects were\ncalculated using density functional theory code. The defect energetics\nsuggested that the fastest diffusion takes place via an interstitial mechanism\nin a-SiC. The formation energy of Ag interstitials and the kinetic resolved\nactivation energies between them were well approximated with Gaussian\ndistributions that were then sampled in the kMC. The diffusion of Ag was\nsimulated with the effective medium model using kMC. At 1200-1600C, Ag in a\nHEGB is predicted to exhibit an Arrhenius type diffusion and with a diffusion\nprefactor and effective activation energy of (2.73+-1.09)*10-10 m2s-1 and\n2.79+-0.18 eV, respectively. The comparison between HEGB results to other\ntheoretical studies suggested not only that GB diffusion is predominant over\nbulk diffusion, but also that the HEGB is one of fastest grain boundary paths\nfor Ag diffusion in SiC. The Ag diffusion coefficient in the HEGB shows a good\nagreement with ion-implantation measurements, but is 2-3 orders of magnitude\nlower than the diffusion coefficients extracted from integral release\nmeasurements. The discrepancy between GB diffusion and integral release\nmeasurements suggests that other contributions are responsible for the fast\nrelease of Ag in some experiments and we propose that these contributions may\narise from radiation enhanced diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jul 2016 15:43:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-19"}
