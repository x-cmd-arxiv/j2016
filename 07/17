An approximation algorithm for CSP is called robust if\nit outputs an assignment satisfying a $(1-g(\\varepsilon))$-fraction of\nconstraints on any $(1-\\varepsilon)$-satisfiable instance, where the loss\nfunction $g$ is such that $g(\\varepsilon)\\rightarrow 0$ as\n$\\varepsilon\\rightarrow 0$.\n  We study how the robust approximability of CSPs depends on the set of\nconstraint relations allowed in instances, the so-called constraint language.\nAll constraint languages admitting a robust polynomial-time algorithm (with\nsome $g$) have been characterised by Barto and Kozik, with the general bound on\nthe loss $g$ being doubly exponential, specifically\n$g(\\varepsilon)=O((\\log\\log(1/\\varepsilon))/\\log(1/\\varepsilon))$.

The two main hard problems\nunderlying its security are the shortest vector problem (SVP) and the closest\nvector problem (CVP). Various algorithms have been studied for solving these\nproblems, and for SVP, lattice sieving currently dominates in terms of the\nasymptotic time complexity: one can heuristically solve SVP in time\n$2^{0.292d}$ in high dimensions $d$ [BDGL'16]. Although several SVP algorithms\ncan also be used to solve CVP, it is not clear whether this also holds for\nheuristic lattice sieving methods. The best time complexity for CVP is\ncurrently $2^{0.377d}$ [BGJ'14].\n  In this paper we revisit sieving algorithms for solving SVP, and study how\nthese algorithms can be modified to solve CVP and its variants as well. Our\nfirst method is aimed at solving one problem instance and minimizes the overall\ntime complexity for a single CVP instance with a time complexity of\n$2^{0.292d}$. Our second method minimizes the amortized time complexity for\nseveral instances on the same lattice, at the cost of a larger preprocessing\ncost. We can solve the closest vector problem with preprocessing (CVPP) with\n$2^{0.636d}$ space and preprocessing, in $2^{0.136d}$ time, while the query\ncomplexity can even be reduced to $2^{\\epsilon d}$ at the cost of preprocessing\ntime and memory complexities of $(1/\\epsilon)^{O(d)}$.\n  For easier variants of CVP, such as approximate CVP and bounded distance\ndecoding (BDD), we further show how the preprocessing method achieves even\nbetter complexities. For instance, we can solve approximate CVPP with large\napproximation factors $k$ with polynomial-sized advice in polynomial time if $k\n= \\Omega(\\sqrt{d/\\log d})$, heuristically closing the gap between the\ndecision-CVPP result of [AR'04] and the search-CVPP result of [DRS'14].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2016 18:59:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-04"}

The lattice\nconstants are found to be sensitive indicators for hydrogen ordering. The a and\nb lattice constants contract whereas a pronounced expansion in c is found upon\nhydrogen ordering. Overall, the hydrogen ordering transition goes along with a\nsmall increase in volume which explains why the phase transition is more\ndifficult to observe upon cooling under pressure. Slow-cooling ice VI at 1.4\nGPa gives essentially fully hydrogen-disordered ice VI. Consistent with earlier\nstudies, the ice XV obtained after slow-cooling at ambient pressure is best\ndescribed with P-1 space group symmetry. Using a new computational approach, we\nachieve the atomistic reconstruction of a supercell structure that is\nconsistent with the average partially ordered structure derived from Rietveld\nrefinements. This shows that C-type networks are most prevalent in ice XV but\nother structural motifs outside of the classifications of the fully\nhydrogen-ordered networks are identified as well.

However, collision\ndetection is often considered to be the computational bottleneck in practice.\nExamining various asymptotically optimal planning algorithms, we characterize\nsettings, which we call NN-sensitive, in which the practical computational role\nof nearest-neighbor search is far from being negligible, i.e., the portion of\nrunning time taken up by nearest-neighbor search is comparable, or sometimes\neven greater than the portion of time taken up by collision detection. This\nreinforces and substantiates the claim that motion-planning algorithms could\nsignificantly benefit from efficient and possibly specifically-tailored\nnearest-neighbor data structures. The asymptotic (near) optimality of these\nalgorithms relies on a prescribed connection radius, defining a ball around a\nconfiguration $q$, such that $q$ needs to be connected to all other\nconfigurations in that ball. To facilitate our study, we show how to adapt this\nradius to non-Euclidean spaces, which are prevalent in motion planning. This\ntechnical result is of independent interest, as it enables to compare the\nradial-connection approach with the common alternative, namely, connecting each\nconfiguration to its $k$ nearest neighbors ($k$-NN).

Our mechanized semantics, called HoTTSQL,\nis based on K-Relations and homotopy type theory, where we denote relations as\nmathematical functions from tuples to univalent types. We have implemented\nHoTTSQL in Coq, which takes only fewer than 300 lines of code and have proved a\nwide range of SQL rewrite rules, including those from database research\nliterature (e.g., magic set rewrites) and real-world query optimizers (e.g.,\nsubquery elimination). Several of these rewrite rules have never been\npreviously proven correct. In addition, while query equivalence is generally\nundecidable, we have implemented an automated decision procedure using HoTTSQL\nfor conjunctive queries: a well-studied decidable fragment of SQL that\nencompasses many real-world queries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2016 03:15:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 20:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-09"}

The kink model also captures the phenomenon\nof baryonic popcorn, in which a first order phase transition generates an\nadditional soliton layer in the holographic direction. We find that this\npopcorn transition takes place at a density below the dyonic salt phase, making\nthe latter energetically unfavourable. However, the kink model predicts only\none pop, rather than the sequence of pops suggested by previous approximations.\nIn the kink model the two layers produced by the single pop form the surface of\na soliton bag that increases in size as the baryon chemical potential is\nincreased. The interior of the bag is filled with abelian electric potential\nand the instanton charge density is localized on the surface of the bag. The\nsoliton bag may provide a holographic description of a quarkyonic phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2016 08:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-10"}

If the metric can be\ndecomposed as the sum of the classical and of a fluctuating part, of quantum\norigin, then the corresponding Einstein quantum gravity generates at the\nclassical level modified gravity models with a nonminimal coupling between\ngeometry and matter. As a first step in our study, after assuming that the\nexpectation value of the quantum correction can be generally expressed in terms\nof an arbitrary second order tensor constructed from the metric and from the\nthermodynamic quantities characterizing the matter content of the Universe, we\nderive the (classical) gravitational field equations in their general form. We\nanalyze in detail the cosmological models obtained by assuming that the quantum\ncorrection tensor is given by the coupling of a scalar field and of a scalar\nfunction to the metric tensor, and by a term proportional to the matter\nenergy-momentum tensor. For each considered model we obtain the gravitational\nfield equations, and the generalized Friedmann equations for the case of a flat\nhomogeneous and isotropic geometry. In some of these models the divergence of\nthe matter energy-momentum tensor is non-zero, indicating a process of matter\ncreation, which corresponds to an irreversible energy flow from the\ngravitational field to the matter fluid, and which is direct consequence of the\nnonminimal curvature-matter coupling. The cosmological evolution equations of\nthese modified gravity models induced by the quantum fluctuations of the metric\nare investigated in detail by using both analytical and numerical methods, and\nit is shown that a large variety of cosmological models can be constructed,\nwhich, depending on the numerical values of the model parameters, can exhibit\nboth accelerating and decelerating behaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2016 14:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-02"}

We consider the problem of how to optimally distribute receptors\nalong a one-dimensional continuum consistent with the following design\nprinciples. First, neural representations of the world should obey a neural\nuncertainty principle---making as few assumptions as possible about the\nstatistical structure of the world. Second, neural representations should\nconvey, as much as possible, equivalent information about environments with\ndifferent statistics. The results of these arguments resemble the structure of\nthe visual system and provide a natural explanation of the behavioral\nWeber-Fechner law, a foundational result in psychology. Because the derivation\nis extremely general, this suggests that similar scaling relationships should\nbe observed not only in sensory continua, but also in neural representations of\n``cognitive' one-dimensional quantities such as time or numerosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jul 2016 15:59:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 04:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-04"}

Since combustion\ndiagnostics and flame control strategies based on electric fields depend on the\namount of current drawn from flames, there is significant interest in modeling\nand understanding i-V curves. We implement and apply a detailed model for the\nsimulation of the production and transport of ions and electrons in one\ndimensional premixed flames. An analytical reduced model is developed based on\nthe detailed one, and analytical expressions are used to gain insight into the\ncharacteristics of the i-V curve for various flame configurations. In order for\nthe reduced model to capture the spatial distribution of the electric field\naccurately, the concept of a dead zone region, where voltage is constant, is\nintroduced, and a suitable closure for the spatial extent of the dead zone is\nproposed and validated. The results from the reduced modeling framework are\nfound to be in good agreement with those from the detailed simulations. The\nsaturation voltage is found to depend significantly on the flame location\nrelative to the electrodes, and on the sign of the voltage difference applied.\nFurthermore, at sub-saturation conditions, the current is shown to increase\nlinearly or quadratically with the applied voltage, depending on the flame\nlocation. These limiting behaviors exhibited by the reduced model elucidate the\nfeatures of i-V curves observed experimentally. The reduced model relies on the\nexistence of a thin layer where charges are produced, corresponding to the\nreaction zone of a flame. Consequently, the analytical model we propose is not\nlimited to the study of premixed flames, and may be applied easily to others\nconfigurations, e.g. nonpremixed counterflow flames.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2016 20:42:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}
