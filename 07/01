Despite the success of these methods, their\nonline-only approach inherently limits the richness of the model they can\nlearn. Recently, several attempts have been made to exploit the expressive\npower of deep convolutional networks. However, when the object to track is not\nknown beforehand, it is necessary to perform Stochastic Gradient Descent online\nto adapt the weights of the network, severely compromising the speed of the\nsystem. In this paper we equip a basic tracking algorithm with a novel\nfully-convolutional Siamese network trained end-to-end on the ILSVRC15 dataset\nfor object detection in video. Our tracker operates at frame-rates beyond\nreal-time and, despite its extreme simplicity, achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in multiple benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2016 16:00:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 11:48:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 19:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-03"}

From our study, orange main-sequence\nstars, ranging from spectral type late-G to mid-K (with a maximum at early-K),\nare most promising. Our analysis considers a variety of aspects, including (1)\nthe frequency of the various types of stars, (2) the speed of stellar evolution\ntheir lifetimes, (3) the size of the stellar climatological habitable zones\n(CLI-HZs), (4) the strengths and persistence of their magnetic dynamo generated\nX-ray - UV emissions, and (5) the frequency and severity of flares, including\nsuperflares; both (4) and (5) greatly reduce the suitability of red dwarfs to\nhost life-bearing planets.

With advances in telemetry capabilities, animal movement\nmodels are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite a need for\npopulation-level inference, animal movement models are still predominantly\ndeveloped for individual-level inference. Most efforts to upscale the inference\nto the population-level are either post hoc or complicated enough that only the\ndeveloper can implement the model. Hierarchical Bayesian models provide an\nideal platform for the development of population-level animal movement models\nbut can be challenging to fit due to computational limitations or extensive\ntuning required. We propose a two-stage procedure for fitting hierarchical\nanimal movement models to telemetry data. The two-stage approach is\nstatistically rigorous and allows one to fit individual-level movement models\nseparately, then resample them using a secondary MCMC algorithm. The primary\nadvantages of the two-stage approach are that the first stage is easily\nparallelizable and the second stage is completely unsupervised, allowing for a\ncompletely automated fitting procedure in many cases. We demonstrate the\ntwo-stage procedure with two applications of animal movement models. The first\napplication involves a spatial point process approach to modeling telemetry\ndata and the second involves a more complicated continuous-time discrete-space\nanimal movement model.

For finite\nvalues of $g^2N$ single-trace intermediate operators arise at order $1/c$ and\nthis leads to specific poles in the Mellin representation of the correlator.\nThe sign of the residue at these poles is fixed by unitarity. We consider\nsolutions consistent with crossing symmetry and this pole structure. We show\nthat in a certain regime all solutions result in a negative contribution to the\nanomalous dimension of twist four operators. The reason behind this is a\npositivity property of Mack polynomials that leads to a positivity condition\nfor the Mellin amplitude. This positivity condition can also be proven by\nassuming the correct Regge behaviour for the Mellin amplitude. For large $g^2N$\nwe recover a tower of solutions in one to one correspondence with local\ninteractions in a effective field theory in the $AdS$ bulk, with the\nappropriate suppression factors, and with definite overall signs. These signs\nagree with the signs that would follow from causality constraints on the\neffective field theory. The positivity constraints arising from CFT for the\nMellin amplitude take a very similar form to the causality constraint for the\nforward limit of the S-matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2016 18:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

In FROG, a\nreconstruction algorithm retrieves the pulse from a measured spectrogram, yet\ncurrent FROG reconstruction algorithms require and exhibit several restricting\nfeatures that weaken FROG performances. For example, the delay step must\ncorrespond to the spectral bandwidth measured with large enough SNR a condition\nthat limits the temporal resolution of the reconstructed pulse, obscures\nmeasurements of weak broadband pulses, and makes measurement of broadband\nmid-IR pulses hard and slow because the spectrograms become huge. We develop a\nnew approach for FROG reconstruction, based on ptychography (a scanning\ncoherent diffraction imaging technique), that removes many of the algorithmic\nrestrictions. The ptychographic reconstruction algorithm is significantly\nfaster and more robust to noise than current FROG algorithms, which are based\non generalized projections (GP). We demonstrate, numerically and\nexperimentally, that ptychographic reconstruction works well with very partial\nspectrograms, e. g. spectrograms with reduced number of measured delays and\nspectrograms that have been substantially spectrally filtered. In addition, we\nimplement the ptychogrpahic approach to blind second harmonic generation (SHG)\nFROG and demonstrate robust and complete characterization of two unknown pulses\nfrom a single measured spectrogram and power spectrum of only one of the\npulses.

A number of recent papers have claimed the discovery of an X-shape\nstructure in the bulge of our Galaxy in the population of the red clumps.\n  AIMS. We endeavor to analyze the stellar density of bulge stars in the same\nregions using a different stellar population that is characteristic of the\nyoung bulge ($\\lesssim 5$ Gyr). Particularly, we use F0-F5 main-sequence stars\nwith distances derived through photometric parallax.\n  METHODS. We extract these stars from extinction-corrected color-magnitude\ndiagrams in the near-infrared of VISTA-VVV data in some bulge regions and\ncalculate the densities along the line of sight. We take the uncertaintity in\nthe photometric parallax and the contamination of other sources into account,\nand we see that these errors do not avoid the detection of a possible double\npeak along some lines of sight as expected for a X-shape bulge if it existed.\n  RESULTS. Only a single peak in the density distribution along the line of\nsight is observed, so apparently there is no X-shape structure for this\npopulation of stars. Nonetheless, the effects of the dispersion of absolute\nmagnitudes in the selected population might be an alternative explanation,\nalthough in principle these effects are insufficient to explain this lack of\ndouble peak according to our calculations.\n  CONCLUSIONS. The results of the present paper do not demonstrate that\nprevious claims of X-shaped bulge using only red clump stars are incorrect, but\nthere are apparently some puzzling questions if we want to maintain the\nvalidity of both the red-clump results and the results of this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2016 19:35:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

The validity of their method is assumed\nto hold depending on two main hypothesis: $(i)$ The network determined by the\nthe interaction between pairs of nodes has negligible degree correlations;\n$(ii)$ The node activities are uniform across nodes on both the drift and\npair-wise interaction functions. Moreover, the authors consider only positive\n(mutualistic) interactions. Here we show the conditions proposed by Gao and\ncollaborators are neither sufficient nor necessary to guarantee that their\nmethod works in general, and validity of their results are not independent of\nthe model chosen within the class of dynamics they considered.

Our goal is to understand the interplay between AGN\nfeedback and the interstellar medium in M51, a nearby spiral galaxy with a\nmodest AGN and a kpc-scale radio jet expanding through the disc of the galaxy.\nFor that purpose, we combine molecular gas observations in the CO(1-0) and\nHCN(1-0) lines from the Plateau de Bure interferometer with archival radio,\nX-ray, and optical data. We show that there is a significant scarcity of CO\nemission in the ionisation cone, while molecular gas emission tends to\naccumulate towards the edges of the cone. The distribution and kinematics of CO\nand HCN line emission reveal AGN feedback effects out to r~500pc, covering the\nwhole extent of the radio jet, with complex kinematics in the molecular gas\nwhich displays strong local variations. We propose that this is the result of\nthe almost coplanar jet pushing on molecular gas in different directions as it\nexpands; the effects are more pronounced in HCN than in CO emission, probably\nas the result of radiative shocks.

With the success of aLIGO and the\nadvent of instruments like the SKA and eLISA, the prospects for the discovery\nof such PSR-BH binaries are very promising.

Recent investigations indicate that it may even hold in the\nregime of local dwarf galaxies, and we explore here the expected behavior in\nthe regime of star formation surface densities below 0.1 M_sun kpc^{-2}\nyr^{-1}. We derive two conditions that can be particularly relevant for\ninducing a change in the expected correlation: a critical star formation\nsurface density to maintain the correlation between star formation rate and the\nmagnetic field, and a critical star formation surface density below which\ncosmic ray diffusion losses dominate over their injection via supernova\nexplosions. For rotation periods shorter than 1.5x10^7 (H/kpc)^2 yrs, with H\nthe scale height of the disk, the first correlation will break down before\ndiffusion losses are relevant, as higher star formation rates are required to\nmaintain the correlation between star formation rate and magnetic field\nstrength. For high star formation surface densities Sigma_SFR, we derive a\ncharacteristic scaling of the non-thermal radio to the far-infrared / infrared\nemission with Sigma_SFR^{1/3}, corresponding to a scaling of the non-thermal\nradio luminosity L_s with the infrared luminosity L_{th} as L_{th}^{4/3}.

The CSC minimization is\nthe cornerstone of the path-following interior point methods for solving a\nbroad class of convex optimization problems. It has also found numerous\napplications in machine learning. The proximal damped Newton (PDN) methods have\nbeen well studied in the literature for solving this problem that enjoy a nice\niteration complexity. Given that at each iteration these methods typically\nrequire evaluating or accessing the Hessian of $f$ and also need to solve a\nproximal Newton subproblem, the cost per iteration can be prohibitively high\nwhen applied to large-scale problems. Inspired by the recent success of block\ncoordinate descent methods, we propose a randomized block proximal damped\nNewton (RBPDN) method for solving the CSC minimization. Compared to the PDN\nmethods, the computational cost per iteration of RBPDN is usually significantly\nlower. The computational experiment on a class of regularized logistic\nregression problems demonstrate that RBPDN is indeed promising in solving\nlarge-scale CSC minimization problems. The convergence of RBPDN is also\nanalyzed in the paper. In particular, we show that RBPDN is globally convergent\nwhen $g$ is Lipschitz continuous. It is also shown that RBPDN enjoys a local\nlinear convergence. Moreover, we show that for a class of $g$ including the\ncase where $g$ is Lipschitz differentiable, RBPDN enjoys a global linear\nconvergence. As a striking consequence, it shows that the classical damped\nNewton methods [22,40] and the PDN [31] for such $g$ are globally linearly\nconvergent, which was previously unknown in the literature. Moreover, this\nresult can be used to sharpen the existing iteration complexity of these\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2016 03:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-04"}

For more detailed\nanalyses, the number of text character accesses $X^{\\mathcal{A},S}_n$ performed\nby an algorithm $\\mathcal{A}$ when searching a random text of length $n$ for a\nfixed pattern $S$ has been considered. Constructing a state space and\ncorresponding transition rules (e.g. in a Markov chain) that reflect the\nbehavior of a pattern matching algorithm is a key step in existing analyses of\n$X^{\\mathcal{A},S}_n$ in both the asymptotic ($n\\to\\infty$) and the\nnon-asymptotic regime. The size of this state space is hence a crucial\nparameter for such analyses.

Three nuclear quadrupole interaction\nsignals were detected and their equilibrium site fractions were measured up to\n700 oC. Two signals have well-defined electric field gradients (EFGs) and are\nattributed to In-probes on Gd- and Ni-sites in a well-ordered lattice. A third,\ninhomogeneously broadened signal was observed at low temperature. This is\nattributed to trapping, or segregation, of In-probes to lattice sinks such as\ngrain boundaries (GB) that have a large multiplicity of local environments and\nEFGs. Changes in site fractions were reversible above 300oC. Measurements were\nmade on a pair of samples that were richer and poorer in Gd. Remarkably, the\nGB-site was populated only in the more Gd-rich sample. This is explained by the\nhypothesis that excess Gd segregates to the grain boundaries and provides a\nlower enthalpy environment for In-probe atoms. Observations are discussed in\nrelation to a three-level quantum system. Enthalpy differences between levels\nwere determined from measurements of temperature dependences of ratios of site\nfractions. The enthalpy of transfer of In-probes from the Gd- to Ni-sublattice\nwas found to be much smaller in the Gd-rich sample.

Meanwhile, recent\nhydrodynamical simulations have indicated that the accretion-induced collapse\nmay be avoided under certain conditions when double WDs merge violently.\nHowever, the properties of SNe Ia from this violent merger scenario are highly\ndependent on a particular mass-accretion stage, the so-called WD + He subgiant\nchannel, during which the primary WD is able to increase its mass by accreting\nHe-rich material from a He subgiant before the systems evolves into a double WD\nsystem. In this article, we aim to study this particular evolutionary stage\nsystematically and give the properties of violent WD mergers. By employing the\nEggleton stellar evolution code, we followed a large number of binary\ncalculations and obtained the regions in parameter space for producing violent\nmergers based on the WD + He subgiant channel. According to these simulations,\nwe found that the primary WDs can increase their mass by ~0.10-0.45 Msun during\nthe mass-accretion stage. We then conducted a series of binary population\nsynthesis calculations and found that the Galactic SN Ia birthrate from this\nchannel is about 0.01-0.4*10-3 yr-1. This suggests that the violent WD mergers\nfrom this channel may only contribute to ~0.3%-10% of all SNe Ia in our Galaxy.\nThe delay times of violent WD mergers from this channel are >1.7 Gyr,\ncontributing to the SNe Ia in old populations. We also found that the WD + He\nsubgiant channel is the dominent way for producing violent WD mergers that may\nbe able to eventually explode as SNe Ia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2016 08:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-08"}

Our approach reformulates the original task as a convex optimisation\nmodel. The sought solution shall be a matrix with a certain desired structure.\nWe enforce this structure through additional constraints. By combining popular\nsplitting algorithms and matrix differential theory in a novel framework we\nobtain a numerically efficient strategy. Besides a thorough theoretical\nconsideration we also provide an experimental setup that certifies the\nusability of our strategy. Finally, we also address practical issues, such as\nthe handling of inaccuracies in the measurement and corruption of the given\ndata.

DFS traditionally requires\nan applied force that increases linearly with time so that the bio-complex\nunder investigation is exposed to a constant loading rate. However, tethers or\npolymers can modulate the applied force in a nonlinear regime. For example,\nbacterial adhesion pili and polymers with worm-like chain properties are\nexamples of structures that show nonlinear force responses. In these\nsituations, the theory for traditional DFS cannot be readily applied. In this\nwork we expand the theory for DFS to also include nonlinear external forces\nwhile still maintaining compatibility with the linear DFS theory. To validate\nthe theory we modeled a bio-complex expressed on a stiff, an elastic and a\nworm-like chain polymer, using Monte Carlo methods, and assessed the\ncorresponding rupture force spectra. It was found that the nonlinear DFS\n(NLDFS) theory correctly predicted the numerical results.

In\nparticular, a recent breakthrough result of Fazelli, Vardy and Yaakobi\nintroduces the notion of a PIR code and a PIR array code, and uses this notion\nto produce efficient PIR protocols.\n  In this paper we are interested in designing PIR array codes. We consider the\ncase when we have $m$ servers, with each server storing a fraction $(1/s)$ of\nthe bits of the database; here $s$ is a fixed rational number with $s > 1$. A\nPIR array code with the $k$-PIR property enables a $k$-server PIR protocol\n(with $k\\leq m$) to be emulated on $m$ servers, with the overall storage\nrequirements of the protocol being reduced. The communication complexity of a\nPIR protocol reduces as $k$ grows, so the virtual server rate, defined to be\n$k/m$, is an important parameter. We study the maximum virtual server rate of a\nPIR array code with the $k$-PIR property. We present upper bounds on the\nachievable virtual server rate, some constructions, and ideas how to obtain PIR\narray codes with the highest possible virtual server rate. In particular, we\npresent constructions that asymptotically meet our upper bounds, and the exact\nlargest virtual server rate is obtained when $1 < s \\leq 2$.\n  A $k$-PIR code (and similarly a $k$-PIR array code) is also a locally\nrepairable code with symbol availability $k-1$. Such a code ensures $k$\nparallel reads for each information symbol. So the virtual server rate is very\nclosely related to the symbol availability of the code when used as a locally\nrepairable code. The results of this paper are discussed also in this context,\nwhere subspace codes also have an important role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2016 13:25:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2016 17:45:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 21:44:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 11:28:51 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 14:16:12 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2018 13:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

When the field and the spin-torque concur to favor the P to\nAP transition, the reversal yields monotonic resistance ramps that can be\ninterpreted as a domain wall propagation through the device at velocities of 17\nto 30 nm/ns; smaller cells switch hence faster. When the field hinders the P to\nAP transition, the switching is preceded by repetitive switching attempts,\nduring which the resistance transiently increases until successful reversal\noccurs. At 50 nm, the P to AP switching proceeds reproducibly in 3 ns, with a\nmonotonic increase of the device resistance. In the reverse transition (AP to\nP), several reversal paths are possible even in the smallest junctions.\nBesides, the non uniform nature of the response seems still present at\nnanoscale, with sometimes electrical signatures of strong disorder during the\nreversal. The AP to P transition is preceded by a strong instability of the AP\nstate in devices above 100 nm. The resistance becomes extremely agitated before\nswitching to P in a path yielding a slow (20-50 ns) irregular increase of the\nconductance with variability. Unreversed bubbles of 60 nm can persist a few\nmicroseconds in the largest junctions. The complexity of the AP to P switching\nis reduced but not suppressed when the junctions are downsized below 60 nm. The\ninstability of the initial AP state is no longer detected but the other\nfeatures remain. In the smallest junctions (50 nm) we occasionally observe much\nfaster (sub-1 ns) switching events. We discuss the origin of the switching\nasymmetry and its size dependence, with an emphasis on the role of the non\nuniformities of the stray field emanating from the reference layers, which\naffects the zones in which nucleation is favored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2016 14:31:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-10"}

For the proof of the method's validity Lazard introduced a new\nnotion of valuation of a multivariate polynomial at a point. However a gap in\none of the key supporting results for his proof was subsequently noticed. In\nthe present paper we provide a complete validity proof of Lazard's method. Our\nproof is based on the classical parametrized version of Puiseux's theorem and\nbasic properties of Lazard's valuation. This result is significant because\nLazard's method can be applied to any finite family of polynomials, without any\nassumption on the system of coordinates. It therefore has wider applicability\nand may be more efficient than other projection and lifting schemes for CAD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2016 14:37:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 09:17:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-27"}

Using the spectroscopic data\nwe computed time-resolved Doppler tomograms of the system demonstrating its\nbehavior at different orbital phases. In the tomograms one can see the periodic\nbrightening of different regions within one orbital cycle. We interpret this\nbrightening as being due to the interaction of four phase-locked shock waves in\nthe disk with a specific internal precessing density wave that develops inside\nthe disk, because of the tidal influence of the secondary star, and this\ndensity wave propagates up to the disk's outer regions. When the outer part of\nthe density wave in its precessional motion reaches a shock wave the local\ndensity grows, which amplifies the shock (by increasing $\\rho V^{2}/2$). This\nresults in an additional energy release in the shock and can be observed as a\nbrightening. Analysis of the tomographic results and the photometric data shows\nthat two main sources contribute to the light curves of the system: the\nradiation of the \"hot line\" and the bow-shock gives us two major orbital humps,\nlocated approximately at the orbital phases $\\phi=0.25$ and $\\phi=0.75$; the\namplification of the four shock waves may give us up to four \"superhumps\"\nshifting over the light curve with the precessional period. These two effects,\nwhen overlapping, change the shape of the light curves, shift the hump maxima,\nand they sometimes produce more than two humps in the light curve. We should\nemphasize that when saying \"superhumps\" we imply an effect that is observed in\nquiescent light curves of WZ Sge stars, as opposed to \"classical\" superhumps\nusually observed in outbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2016 14:41:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2016 11:10:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

As common DNS configurations, recursive\nservers should allow a reasonable timeout for each recursion which may take as\nlong as several seconds. However, it is proposed in this paper that recursion\nparallelization may be exploited by attackers to compromise the recursion\ntimeout mechanism for the purpose of DoS or DDoS attacks. Attackers can have\nrecursive servers drop early existing recursions in service by saturating\nrecursion parallelization. The key of the proposed attack model is to reliably\nprolong service times for any attacking queries. As means of prolong service\ntimes, serval techniques are proposed to effectively avoiding cache hit and\nprolonging overall latency of external DNS lookups respectively. The impacts of\nsaturated recursion parallelization on timeout are analytically provided.

Non-axisymmetric\nstratorotational instability (SRI) is known to set in for anticyclonic rotation\nratios beyond that line, i.e. $\\eta^2<\\mu<1$ for axially stably-stratified\nTaylor-Couette flow, but the competition between CI and SRI in the range\n$\\mu<\\eta^2$ has not yet been addressed.

Several other qualitative differences with inviscid theory were\nfound, among which the instability of a non-axisymmetric mode localized at the\nouter cylinder without stratification, and the instability of a mode\npropagating against the inner cylinder rotation with stratification. The\ncombination of viscosity and stratification can also lead to a `collision'\nbetween (axisymmetric) Taylor vortex branches, causing the axisymmetric\noscillatory state already observed in past experiments.

We derive analytic expressions for the semiclassical\ndensity of states, which shows a logarithmic divergence at a critical energy\neigenvalue in the broken symmetry (superradiant) phase. Moreover, we find that\nthe logarithmic singularities in the density of states leads to singularities\nin the relevant observables in the system such as photon number and atomic\npolarization.

CIQGMs characterize the conditional independence of\ndistributions by evaluating the distributional dependence structure at each\nquantile index. As such, CIQGMs can be used for validation of the graph\nstructure in the causal graphical models (\\cite{pearl2009causality,\nrobins1986new, heckman2015causal}). One main advantage of these models is that\nwe can apply them to large collections of variables driven by non-Gaussian and\nnon-separable shocks. PQGMs characterize the statistical dependencies through\nthe graphs of the best linear predictors under asymmetric loss functions. PQGMs\nmake weaker assumptions than CIQGMs as they allow for misspecification. Because\nof QGMs' ability to handle large collections of variables and focus on specific\nparts of the distributions, we could apply them to quantify tail\ninterdependence. The resulting tail risk network can be used for measuring\nsystemic risk contributions that help make inroads in understanding\ninternational financial contagion and dependence structures of returns under\ndownside market movements.\n  We develop estimation and inference methods for QGMs focusing on the\nhigh-dimensional case, where the number of variables in the graph is large\ncompared to the number of observations. For CIQGMs, these methods and results\ninclude valid simultaneous choices of penalty functions, uniform rates of\nconvergence, and confidence regions that are simultaneously valid. We also\nderive analogous results for PQGMs, which include new results for penalized\nquantile regressions in high-dimensional settings to handle misspecification,\nmany controls, and a continuum of additional conditioning events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2016 15:19:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 04:38:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 2019 17:46:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-29"}

Several issues regarding the nature of dust at high redshift remain\nunresolved: its composition, its production and growth mechanisms, and its\neffect on background sources. Aims. We provide a more accurate relation between\ndust depletion levels and dust-to-metals ratio (DTM), and to use the DTM to\ninvestigate the origin and evolution of dust in the high-redshift Universe via\nGamma-ray burst damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (GRB-DLAs). Methods. We use\nabsorption-line measured metal column densities for a total of 19 GRB-DLAs,\nincluding five new GRB afterglow spectra from VLT/X-shooter. We use the latest\nlinear models to calculate the dust depletion strength factor in each DLA.\nUsing these values we calculate total dust and metal column densities to\ndetermine a DTM. We explore the evolution of DTM with metallicity, and compare\nit to previous trends in DTM measured with different methods. Results. We find\nsignificant dust depletion in 16 of our 19 GRB-DLAs, yet 18 of the 19 have a\nDTM significantly lower than the Milky Way. We find that DTM is positively\ncorrelated with metallicity, which supports a dominant ISM grain-growth mode of\ndust formation. We find a substantial discrepancy between the dust content\nmeasured from depletion and that derived from the total V-band extinction,\n$A_V$ , measured by fitting the afterglow SED. We advise against using a\nmeasurement from one method to estimate that from the other until the\ndiscrepancy can be resolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2016 15:21:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 16:13:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 17:19:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-03"}

These analyses are subject to important systematic\nuncertainties due to the use of hadronic interaction models that extrapolate\nlower energy accelerator data to the highest energies. Although proton models\nof UHECRs are disfavored by these results, they cannot be completely ruled out.\nIt is well known that the energy spectra of gamma rays and neutrinos, produced\nduring propagation of these very energetic particles through the intergalactic\nmedium, are a useful tool to constrain the spectrum models.

Indeed, we report\non results that point to the possibility of describing {\\it interacting\nclassical spin systems} in the thermodynamic limit, including the occurrence of\na phase transition, using topology arguments only. Our approach relies on Morse\ntheory, through the determination of the critical points of the potential\nenergy, which is the proper Morse function. Our main finding is to show that,\nin the context of the studied classical models, the Euler characteristic\n$\\chi(E)$ embeds the necessary features for a correct description of several\nmagnetic thermodynamic quantities of the systems, such as the magnetization,\ncorrelation function, susceptibility, and critical temperature. Despite the\nclassical nature of the studied models, such quantities are those that do not\nviolate the laws of thermodynamics [with the proviso that Van der Waals loop\nstates are mean field (MF) artifacts]. We also discuss the subtle connection\nbetween our approach using the Euler entropy, defined by the logarithm of the\nmodulus of $\\chi(E)$ per site, and that using the {\\it Boltzmann}\nmicrocanonical entropy. Moreover, the results suggest that the loss of\nregularity in the Morse function is associated with the occurrence of unstable\nand metastable thermodynamic solutions in the MF case. The reliability of our\napproach is tested in two exactly soluble systems: the infinite-range and the\nshort-range $XY$ models in the presence of a magnetic field. In particular, we\nconfirm that the topological hypothesis holds for both the infinite-range ($T_c\n\\neq 0$) and the short-range ($T_c = 0$) $XY$ models.
