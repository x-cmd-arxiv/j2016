For instance, concerning the scalar spectrum, they allow for\nmeasurable equilateral non-Gaussianity, whose amplitude can differ\nsignificantly from the predictions of other existing models. Moreover, we show\nthat the stability and the consistency of such theories are ensured by an\napproximate Galileon symmetry. Indeed, being generically possible to build an\ninvariant theory under Galileon transformations in flat space-time, it is\ninstead well known that such a symmetry is unavoidably broken by gravity. In\nprinciple, this might ruin the nice and interesting properties of the Galileons\nin flat backgrounds, such as the non-renormalization theorem. However, we find\nthat this does not happen if the Galileon invariance is broken only weakly, in\na well defined sense, by a suitable coupling to gravity, providing therefore an\nextension of the quantum non-renormalization properties in curved space-times.\nHence, besides discussing the phenomenological consequences and the\nobservational predictions for inflation, we apply such Galileon theories to the\ncontext of the late-time acceleration of the Universe. In the last part, in\norder to probe non-standard primordial scenarios, they are also employed in a\ncosmology where the Big Bang singularity is smoothed down and the Universe\nemerges from a Minkowski space-time, in a well defined extension at all times\nof the Galilean Genesis scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2016 17:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-06"}

In\nparticular, a caching scheme enabling power-efficient PLS is proposed for\ncellular video streaming with constrained backhaul capacity. By sharing video\ndata across a subset of base stations (BSs) through both caching and backhaul\nloading, secure cooperative transmission of several BSs is dynamically enabled\nin accordance with the cache status, the channel conditions, and the backhaul\ncapacity. Thereby, caching reduces the data sharing overhead over the\ncapacity-constrained backhaul links. More importantly, caching introduces\nadditional secure degrees of freedom and enables a power-efficient design. We\ninvestigate the optimal caching and transmission policies for minimizing the\ntotal transmit power while providing quality of service (QoS) and guaranteeing\nsecrecy during video delivery. A two-stage non-convex mixed-integer\noptimization problem is formulated, which optimizes the caching policy in an\noffline video caching stage and the cooperative transmission policy in an\nonline video delivery stage. As the problem is NP-hard, suboptimal\npolynomial-time algorithms are proposed for low-complexity cache training and\ndelivery control, respectively. Sufficient optimality conditions, under which\nthe proposed schemes attain global optimal solutions, are also provided.\nSimulation results show that the proposed schemes achieve low secrecy outage\nprobability and high power efficiency simultaneously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2016 21:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-06"}

This prevents timely\nlocalization and prediction of actions and interactions - an important\nconsideration for many tasks including surveillance and human-machine\ninteraction.\n  In our approach, we estimate human poses at each frame and train\ndiscriminative appearance models using the superpixels inside the pose bounding\nboxes. Since the pose estimation per frame is inherently noisy, the conditional\nprobability of pose hypotheses at current time-step (frame) is computed using\npose estimations in the current frame and their consistency with poses in the\nprevious frames. Next, both the superpixel and pose-based foreground\nlikelihoods are used to infer the location of actors at each time through a\nConditional Random. The issue of visual drift is handled by updating the\nappearance models, and refining poses using motion smoothness on joint\nlocations, in an online manner. For online prediction of action (interaction)\nconfidences, we propose an approach based on Structural SVM that operates on\nshort video segments, and is trained with the objective that confidence of an\naction or interaction increases as time progresses. Lastly, we quantify the\nperformance of both detection and prediction together, and analyze how the\nprediction accuracy varies as a time function of observed action (interaction)\nat different levels of detection performance.

Three-terminal spectroscopy allows us to identify the coupling to the\nN contacts as the origin of the Andreev resonance (AR) linewidths and to\ndetermine the critical coupling strengths to S, for which a ground state\ntransition S-QD systems can occur. We ascribe replicas of the lowest-energy ABS\nresonance to transitions between the ABS and odd-parity excited QD states, a\nprocess called excited state ABS resonances. In the conductance between the two\nN contacts we find a characteristic pattern of positive and negative\ndifferential subgap conductance, which we explain by considering two nonlocal\nprocesses, the creation of Cooper pairs in S by electrons from both N\nterminals, and a novel mechanism called resonant ABS tunneling. In the latter,\nelectrons are transferred via the ABS without creating Cooper pairs in S. The\nthree-terminal geometry also allows spectroscopy experiments with different\nboundary conditions, for example by leaving S floating.

Using GP, the\nvariances computed during the modelling and inference processes allow us to\ntake model uncertainty into account. The main issue in using MPC to control\nsystems modelled by GP is the propagation of such uncertainties within the\ncontrol horizon. In this paper, two approaches to solve this problem, called\nGPMPC1 and GPMPC2, are proposed. With GPMPC1, the original Stochastic Model\nPredictive Control (SMPC) problem is relaxed to a deterministic nonlinear MPC\nbased on a basic linearized GP local model. The resulting optimization problem,\nthough non-convex, can be solved by the Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP).\nBy incorporating the model variance into the state vector, an extended local\nmodel is derived. This model allows us to relax the non-convex MPC problem to a\nconvex one which can be solved by an active-set method efficiently. The\nperformance of both approaches is demonstrated by applying them to two\ntrajectory tracking problems.

However, when the\nrouting decisions are made for advanced vehicles, there are other factors\naffecting cost, such as vehicle powertrain type, battery state of charge (SOC)\nand the change of component efficiencies under traffic conditions, which are\nnot considered by traditional routing systems. The impact of the trade-off\nbetween distance and traffic on the cost of the trip might change with the type\nof vehicle technology and component dynamics. As a result, the least-cost paths\nmight be different from the shortest-distance or shortest-time paths. In this\nwork, a novel routing strategy has been proposed where the decision-making\nprocess benefits from the aforementioned information to result in a least-cost\npath for drivers. We integrate vehicle powertrain dynamics into route\noptimization and call this strategy as Vehicle Powertrain Connected Route\nOptimization (VPCRO). We find that the optimal paths might change significantly\nfor all types of vehicle powertrains when VPCRO is used instead of\nshortest-distance strategy. About 81% and 58% of trips were replaced by\ndifferent optimal paths with VPCRO when the vehicle type was Conventional\nVehicle (CV) and Electrified Vehicle (EV), respectively. Changed routes had\nreduced travel costs on an average of 15% up to a maximum of 60% for CVs and on\nan average of 6% up to a maximum of 30% for EVs. Moreover, it was observed that\n3% and 10% of trips had different optimal paths for a plug-in hybrid electric\nvehicle, when initial battery SOC changed from 90% to 60% and 40%,\nrespectively. Paper shows that using sensory information from vehicle\npowertrain for route optimization plays an important role to minimize travel\ncosts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 04:16:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-06"}

We achieve this goal in a\nmodel-independent way by exploiting the SFR functions derived by Mancuso et al.\n(2016) on the basis of an educated extrapolation of the latest UV/far-IR data\nfrom HST/Herschel, and already tested against a number of independent\nobservables. Our SFR functions integrated down to an UV magnitude limit\nM_UV<-13 (or SFR limit around 10^-2 M_sun/yr) produces a cosmic SFR density in\nexcellent agreement with recent determinations from IR surveys and, taking into\naccount a metallicity ceiling Z<Z_sun/2, with the estimates from long GRB\nrates.

The development of sophisticated data\nanalysis techniques to improve the opportunities of detection for low\nsignal-to-noise-ratio events is hence a most crucial effort.

By\nbuilding dictionaries from numerical relativity templates of both, binary black\nholes mergers and bursts of rotational core collapse, we show how\nmachine-learning algorithms based on dictionaries can be also successfully\napplied for gravitational wave denoising. We use a subset of signals from both\ncatalogs, embedded in non-white Gaussian noise, to assess our techniques with a\nlarge sample of tests and to find the best model parameters. The application of\nour method to the actual signal GW150914 shows promising results.\nDictionary-learning algorithms could be a complementary addition to the\ngravitational wave data analysis toolkit.

When approaching the moving contact line, a\nmicroscopic mechanism is required to regularize the singularity of viscous\ndissipation. On the other hand, if the characteristic size of a fluidic system\nis reduced to a range comparable to the microscopic regularization length\nscale, the assumption that viscous effects are localized near the contact line\nis no longer justified. In the present work, such microscopic length is the\nslip length. We investigate the dewetting of a droplet using the boundary\nelement method. Specifically, we solve for the axisymmetric Stokes flow with i)\nthe Navier-slip boundary condition at the solid/liquid boundary, and ii) a\ntime-independent microscopic contact angle at the contact line. The profile\nevolution is computed for different slip lengths and equilibrium contact\nangles. When decreasing the slip length, the typical nonsphericity first\nincreases, reaches a maximum at a characteristic slip length $\\tilde{b}_m$, and\nthen decreases. Regarding different equilibrium contact angles, two universal\nrescalings are proposed to describe the behavior for slip lengths larger or\nsmaller than $\\tilde{b}_m$. Around $\\tilde{b}_m$, the early time evolution of\nthe profiles at the rim can be described by similarity solutions. The results\nare explained in terms of the structure of the flow field governed by different\ndissipation channels: viscous elongational flows for large slip lengths,\nfriction at the substrate for intermediate slip lengths, and viscous shear\nflows for small slip lengths. Following the transitions between these dominant\ndissipation mechanisms, our study indicates a crossover to the quasistatic\nregime when the slip length is small compared to the droplet size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 13:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-12"}

Radiation therapy employs several beams of ionizing radiation to\nkill cancer tumors, but such irradiation also causes damage to normal tissues.\nTherefore, a treatment plan should satisfy dose-volume constraints (DVCs).\nIntensity-modulated radiotherapy treatment (IMRT) enables to control the beam\nintensities and gives more flexibility for the treatment plan to satisfy the\nDVCs. Romeijn et al. (2003) replaced the DVCs in an IMRT optimization with\nC-VaR (Conditional Value-at-Risk) type constraints, and proposed a numerical\nmethod based on linear programming (LP). Their approach reduced the computation\ncost of the original DVCs, but the feasible region of their LP problems was\nmuch narrow compared to the DVCs, therefore, their approach often failed to\nfind a feasible plan even when the DVCs were not so tight.\n  In this paper, we propose a successive LP approach with the C-VaR type\nconstraints. We detect outliers form the solution of LP problems, and remove\nthem from the domain of the C-VaR type constraints. This eases the sensitivity\nof C-VaR type constraints to outliers and we can search feasible plans from\nwider regions. Furthermore, we can give a mathematical proof that if the\noptimal value of the LP problem in the proposed approach is non-positive, the\ncorresponding optimal solution satisfies all the DVCs. From numerical\nexperiments on test data sets, we observed that our approach found feasible\nsolutions more appropriately than existing LP approaches.

As an example we\ninvestigate an isolated monomeric Myc oncoprotein that has been implicated in\ncarcinomas including those in colon, breast and lungs. Under physiological\nconditions a monomeric Myc is presumed to be an example of intrinsically\ndisordered proteins, that pose a serious challenge to existing modelling\ntechniques. We argue that a room temperature monomeric Myc is in a dynamical\nstate, it oscillates between different conformations that we identify. For this\nwe adopt the C-alpha backbone of Myc in a crystallographic heteromer as an\ninitial Ansatz for the monomeric structure. We construct a multisoliton of the\npertinent Landau free energy, to describe the C-alpha profile with ultra high\nprecision. We use Glauber dynamics to resolve how the multisoliton responds to\nrepeated increases and decreases in ambient temperature. We confirm that the\ninitial structure is unstable in isolation. We reveal a highly degenerate\nground state landscape, an attractive set towards which Glauber dynamics\nconverges in the limit of vanishing ambient temperature.

Type-II fuzzy logic controllers are however\nnewer and more promising approaches that have been recently applied to various\nfields due to their significant contribution especially when noise (as an\nimportant instance of uncertainty) emerges.

Despite the superior performance of DNNs in these\napplications, it has been recently shown that these models are susceptible to a\nparticular type of attack that exploits a fundamental flaw in their design.\nThis attack consists of generating particular synthetic examples referred to as\nadversarial samples. These samples are constructed by slightly manipulating\nreal data-points in order to \"fool\" the original DNN model, forcing it to\nmis-classify previously correctly classified samples with high confidence.\nAddressing this flaw in the model is essential if DNNs are to be used in\ncritical applications such as those in cyber security.\n  Previous work has provided various learning algorithms to enhance the\nrobustness of DNN models, and they all fall into the tactic of \"security\nthrough obscurity\". This means security can be guaranteed only if one can\nobscure the learning algorithms from adversaries. Once the learning technique\nis disclosed, DNNs protected by these defense mechanisms are still susceptible\nto adversarial samples. In this work, we investigate this issue shared across\nprevious research work and propose a generic approach to escalate a DNN's\nresistance to adversarial samples.

Starting from a\nfield-theoretical model for two complex scalar fields - one of which is\nelectrically charged - we derive a Ginzburg-Landau potential which includes\nentrainment between the two fluids and temperature effects from thermal\nexcitations of the two scalar fields and the gauge field. The Ginzburg-Landau\ndescription is then used for an analysis of the phase structure in the presence\nof an external magnetic field. In particular, we study the effect of the\nsuperfluid on the flux tube phase by computing the various critical magnetic\nfields and deriving an approximation for the flux tube interaction. As a\nresult, we point out differences to the naive expectations from an isolated\nsuperconductor, for instance the existence of a first-order flux tube onset,\nresulting in a more complicated phase structure in the region between type-I\nand type-II superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 15:36:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2017 13:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-10"}

Due to the randomness in both RE generation\nand mobile traffic at each base station (BS), a surplus or shortfall of energy\nmay occur at any given time. To increase energy self-reliance and minimize the\nnetwork's energy cost, the operator needs to efficiently exploit the RE\ngenerated across all BSs. In this paper, a hybrid energy sharing framework for\ncellular network is proposed, where a combination of physical power lines and\nenergy trading with other BSs using smart grid is used. Algorithms for physical\npower lines deployment between BSs, based on average and complete statistics of\nthe net RE available, are developed. Afterwards, an energy management framework\nis formulated to optimally determine the quantities of electricity and RE to be\nprocured and exchanged among BSs, respectively, while considering battery\ncapacities and real-time energy pricing. Three cases are investigated where RE\ngeneration is unknown, perfectly known, and partially known ahead of time.\nResults investigate the time varying energy management of BSs and demonstrate\nconsiderable reduction in average energy cost thanks to the hybrid energy\nsharing scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 15:30:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-03"}
