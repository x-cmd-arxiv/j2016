Row typing is a long understood mechanism for typing extensible\nrecords and variants, but its adoption would require extension of Haskell's\ncore type system. Alternatively, we might hope to encode extensible variants in\nterms of existing mechanisms, such as type classes. We describe an encoding of\nextensible variants using instance chains, a proposed extension of the class\nsystem. Unlike many previous encodings of extensible variants, ours does not\nrequire the definition of a new type class for each function that consumes\nvariants. Finally, we translate our encoding to use closed type families, an\nexisting feature of GHC. Doing so demonstrates the interpretation of instances\nchains and functional dependencies in closed type families.\n  One concern with encodings like ours is how completely they match the encoded\nsystem. We compare the expressiveness of our encodings with each other and with\nsystems based on row types. We find that, while equivalent terms are typable in\neach system, both encodings require explicit type annotations to resolve\nambiguities in typing not present in row type systems, and the type family\nimplementation retains more constraints in principal types than does the\ninstance chain implementation. We propose a general mechanism to guide the\ninstantiation of ambiguous type variables, show that it eliminates the need for\ntype annotations in our encodings, and discuss conditions under which it\npreserves coherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2016 16:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

Recently, more and more studies begin to address the\nideology detection problem for ordinary users based on their online behaviors\nthat can be captured by social media, e.g., Twitter. As far as we are\nconcerned, however, the vast majority of the existing methods on ideology\ndetection on social media have oversimplified the problem as a binary\nclassification problem (i.e., liberal vs. conservative). Moreover, though\nsocial links can play a critical role in deciding one's ideology, most of the\nexisting work ignores the heterogeneous types of links in social media. In this\npaper we propose to detect \\emph{numerical} ideology positions for Twitter\nusers, according to their \\emph{follow}, \\emph{mention}, and \\emph{retweet}\nlinks to a selected set of politicians. A unified probabilistic model is\nproposed that can (1) explain the reasons why links are built among people in\nterms of their ideology, (2) integrate heterogeneous types of links together in\ndetermining people's ideology, and (3) automatically learn the quality of each\ntype of links in deciding one's ideology. Experiments have demonstrated the\nadvantages of our model in terms of both ranking and political leaning\nclassification accuracy. It is shown that (1) using multiple types of links is\nbetter than using any single type of links alone to determine one's ideology,\nand (2) our model is even more superior than baselines when dealing with people\nthat are sparsely linked in one type of links. We also show that the detected\nideology for Twitter users aligns with our intuition quite well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2016 17:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

This SET can eventually get captured in a register resulting in a flip\nof the register content, which is known as soft error or single-event upset\n(SEU). A soft error is typically modeled as a probabilistic single bit-flip\nmodel. In developing such abstract fault models, an important issue to consider\nis the likelihood of multiple bit errors caused by particle strikes. The fact\nthat an SET causes multiple flips is noted in the literature. We perform a\ncharacterization study of the impact of an SET on a logic circuit to quantify\nthe extent to which an SET can cause multiple bit flips. We use post-layout\ncircuit simulations and Monte Carlo sampling scheme to get accurate bit-flip\nstatistics. We perform our simulations on ISCAS'85, ISCAS'89 and ITC'99\nbenchmarks in 180nm and 65nm technologies. We find that a substantial fraction\nof SEU outcomes had multiple register flips.

In this paper,\nwe provide an improved strong deflection limit analysis in a general\nasymptotically flat, static, spherically symmetric spacetime. The strong\ndeflection limit analysis also works in ultrastatic spacetimes. As an example\nof an ultrastatic spacetime, we reexamine the deflection angle in the strong\ndeflection limit in an Ellis wormhole spacetime. Using the strong deflection\nlimit, we obtain the deflection angle analytically for the Reissner-Nordstrom\nspacetime. The point of the improvement is the definition of a standard\nvariable in the strong deflection limit analysis. We show that the choice of\nthe variable is as important as the choice of the coordinates and we conclude\nthat one should choose a proper variable for a given spacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Dec 2016 08:47:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 12:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-24"}

The first relies on alternating\nminimization and the stochastic Newton iteration to minimize a network-wide\ncost, which discards observations with small innovations. In the resultant\nalgorithm, each node performs local data-adaptive censoring to reduce\ncomputations, while exchanging its local estimate with neighbors so as to\nconsent on a network-wide solution.

Cation\nintercalation desalination (CID) cells, which use intercalation host compounds\n(IHCs) in combination with ion-exchange membranes (IEMs), could aid in\naddressing this challenge by treating saline water sources. Originally, the\nperformance of such cells was predicted utilizing continuous flow of saline\nwater through porous IHC electrodes. Here, we use two-dimensional\nporous-electrode theory with concentrated solution transport to evaluate the\nperformance of various cell architectures where flow occurs through open flow\nchannels (OFCs) when two IHC electrodes comprised of nickel hexacyanoferrate\n(NiHCF) are used to store Na+ ions. We show that, when two OFCs are used,\ncation exchange membranes (CEMs) are adjoined at flow-channel/electrode\ninterfaces, and an anion exchange membrane (AEM) is arranged between flow\nchannels, salt removal increases relative to the original design with\nflow-through (FT) electrodes. The IEM stacking sequence within such a membrane\nflow-by (MFB) cell is the fundamental repeat unit for electrodialysis (ED)\nstacks using many IEMs (CEM/AEM/.../CEM/AEM/CEM) with many diluate streams.\nAccordingly, we simulate the performance of such ED stacks using NiHCF IHCs,\nand we predict that salt adsorption capacity (per unit NiHCF mass) is amplified\nby twenty-fold relative to MFB and FT cells, while simultaneously decreasing\n0.7 M NaCl feed water to 0.2-0.3 M within diluate streams. The generality of\nthese findings is further supported by simulations using Na0.44MnO2 IHC instead\nof NiHCF. Thus, we propose the use of cation IHCs as alternatives to the\ngas-evolution reactions used in conventional ED.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Dec 2016 15:26:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}
