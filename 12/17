When simulated via a Karhunen-Loeve expansion a set\nof dependent but uncorrelated one-dimensional Levy processes has to be\ngenerated. The dependence structure among the one-dimensional processes ensures\nthat the resulting field exhibits the correct point-wise marginal\ndistributions. To approximate the respective (one-dimensional) Levy-measures, a\nnumerical method, called discrete Fourier inversion, is developed. For this\nmethod, $L^p$-convergence rates can be obtained and, under certain regularity\nassumptions, mean square and $L^p$-convergence of the approximated field is\nproved. Further, a class of (time-dependent) Levy fields is introduced, where\nthe point-wise marginal distributions are dependent but uncorrelated\nsubordinated Wiener processes. For this specific class one may derive\npoint-wise marginal distributions in closed form.

A database system designed according to this vision\noffers both increased productivity and high performance, instead of sacrificing\nthe former for the latter as is the case with existing, monolithic\nimplementations that are hard to maintain and extend. In this article, we\nrealize this vision in the domain of analytical query processing. We present\nLegoBase, a query engine written in the high-level language Scala. The key\ntechnique to regain efficiency is to apply generative programming: LegoBase\nperforms source-to-source compilation and optimizes the entire query engine by\nconverting the high-level Scala code to specialized, low-level C code. We show\nhow generative programming allows to easily implement a wide spectrum of\noptimizations, such as introducing data partitioning or switching from a row to\na column data layout, which are difficult to achieve with existing low-level\nquery compilers that handle only queries. We demonstrate that sufficiently\npowerful abstractions are essential for dealing with the complexity of the\noptimization effort, shielding developers from compiler internals and\ndecoupling individual optimizations from each other. We evaluate our approach\nwith the TPC-H benchmark and show that: (a) With all optimizations enabled,\nLegoBase significantly outperforms a commercial database and an existing query\ncompiler. (b) Programmers need to provide just a few hundred lines of\nhigh-level code for implementing the optimizations, instead of complicated\nlow-level code that is required by existing query compilation approaches.

To test this hypothesis\nwe have studied a ULX where the wind is strong enough to cause significant\nabsorption of the hard X-ray continuum: NGC 55 ULX. The RGS spectrum of NGC 55\nULX shows a wealth of emission and absorption lines blueshifted by significant\nfractions of the light speed (0.01 - 0.20)c indicating the presence of a\npowerful wind. The wind has a complex dynamical structure with the ionization\nstate increasing with the outflow velocity, which may indicate launching from\ndifferent regions of the accretion disk. The comparison with other ULXs such as\nNGC 1313 X-1 and NGC 5408 X-1 suggests that NGC 55 ULX is being observed at\nhigher inclination. The wind partly absorbs the source flux above 1 keV,\ngenerating a spectral drop similar to that observed in ULSs.

The 12CO/13CO ratio in the circumstellar envelope (CSE) of\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars has been extensively used as the tracer of\nthe photospheric 12C/13C ratio. However, spatially-resolved ALMA observations\nof R Scl, a carbon rich AGB star, have shown that the 12CO/13CO ratio is not\nconsistent over the entire CSE. Hence, it can not necessarily be used as a\ntracer of the 12C/13C ratio. The most likely hypothesis to explain the observed\ndiscrepancy between the 12CO/13CO and 12C/13C ratios is CO isotopologue\nselective photodissociation by UV radiation. Unlike the CO isotopologue ratio,\nthe HCN isotopologue ratio is not affected by UV radiation. Therefore, HCN\nisotopologue ratios can be used as the tracer of the atomic C ratio in UV\nirradiated regions.

One increasingly\npopular and successful approach is to take inspiration from inference and\nlearning algorithms used in deep neural networks. However, the workhorse of\ndeep learning, the gradient descent Back Propagation (BP) rule, often relies on\nthe immediate availability of network-wide information stored with\nhigh-precision memory, and precise operations that are difficult to realize in\nneuromorphic hardware. Remarkably, recent work showed that exact backpropagated\nweights are not essential for learning deep representations. Random BP replaces\nfeedback weights with random ones and encourages the network to adjust its\nfeed-forward weights to learn pseudo-inverses of the (random) feedback weights.\nBuilding on these results, we demonstrate an event-driven random BP (eRBP) rule\nthat uses an error-modulated synaptic plasticity for learning deep\nrepresentations in neuromorphic computing hardware. The rule requires only one\naddition and two comparisons for each synaptic weight using a two-compartment\nleaky Integrate & Fire (I&F) neuron, making it very suitable for implementation\nin digital or mixed-signal neuromorphic hardware. Our results show that using\neRBP, deep representations are rapidly learned, achieving nearly identical\nclassification accuracies compared to artificial neural network simulations on\nGPUs, while being robust to neural and synaptic state quantizations during\nlearning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 19:06:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2017 07:45:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-06"}

The origin and structure of\nthe generally exponential profiles in stellar disks is considered to result\nfrom cosmological infall combined with a non-linear star formation law and a\nhistory of stellar migration and scattering from spirals, bars, and random\ncollisions with interstellar clouds. In both spirals and dwarfs, the far-outer\ndisks tend to be older, redder and thicker than the inner disks, with the\noverall radial profiles suggesting inside-out star formation plus stellar\nscattering in spirals, and outside-in star formation with a possible\ncontribution from scattering in dwarfs. Dwarf irregulars and the far-outer\nparts of spirals both tend to be gas dominated, and the gas radial profile is\noften non-exponential although still decreasing with radius. The ratio of\nH-alpha to far-UV flux tends to decrease with lower surface brightness in these\nregions, suggesting either a change in the initial stellar mass function or the\nsampling of that function, or a possible loss of H-alpha photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 20:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

Inferences from these surveys have called into question two\nlong-standing beliefs that the MCs : 1 are Virialised entities and (2) have\napproximately constant surface density i.e., the validity of the Larson's third\nlaw. In this work we invoke the framework of cloud-formation via collisions\nbetween warm gas flows. Post-collision clouds forming in these realisations\ncool rapidly and evolve primarily via the interplay between the Non-linear Thin\nShell Instability (NTSI), and the self-gravity. Over the course of these\nsimulations we traced the temporal evolution of the surface density of the\nassembled clouds, the fraction of dense gas, the distribution of gas column\ndensity (NPDF), and the Virial nature of the assembled clouds. We conclude,\nthese physical properties of MCs not only exhibit temporal variation, but their\nrespective peak-magnitude also increases in proportion with the magnitude of\nexternal pressure, $P_{ext}$. The velocity dispersion in assembled clouds\nappears to follow the power-law, $\\sigma_{gas}\\propto P_{ext}^{0.23}$. Also,\nthe power-law tail at higher densities becomes shallower with increasing\nmagnitude of external pressure, for magnitudes, $P_{ext}/k_{B}\\lesssim 10^{7}$\nK cm$^{-3}$, at higher magnitudes such as those typically found in the Galactic\nCMZ ($P_{ext}/k_{B} > 10^{7}$ K cm$^{-3}$), the power-law shows significant\nsteepening. Thus while our results are broadly consistent with inferences from\nvarious recent observational surveys, it appears, MCs hardly exhibit a unique\nset of properties, but rather a wide variety, that can be reconciled with a\nrange of magnitudes of pressure between 10$^{4}$ K cm$^{-3}$ - 10$^{8}$ K\ncm$^{-3}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2016 01:42:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

As the two sellers may\nhave different leasing period, there are three epochs, in which seller 1 has\nspectrum to lease in Epochs II and III, while seller 2 has spectrum to lease in\nEpochs I and II.

First, we investigate the case of\nhalf-duplex nodes where a node can either transmit or receive in a given time\ninstant. The network is said to be naturally sparse if the number of\nnonempty-queue transmitters in a given frame is much smaller than the number of\nusers, which is the case when the arrival rates to the queues are very small\nand the number of users is large. If the network is not naturally sparse, we\ndesign the user requests to be sparse such that only few requests are sent to\nthe destination. We refer to the detected nonempty-queue transmitters in a\ngiven frame as frame owners. Our design goal is to minimize the nodes' total\ntransmit power in a given frame. In the case of unslotted-time data\ntransmission, the optimization problem is shown to be a convex optimization\nprogram. We propose an approximate formulation to simplify the problem and\nobtain a closed-form expression for the assigned time durations to the nodes.\nThe solution of the approximate optimization problem demonstrates that the time\nduration assigned to a node in the set of frame owners is the ratio of the\nsquare-root of the buffer occupancy of that node to the sum of the square-roots\nof each occupancy of all the frame owners. We then investigate the slotted-time\ndata transmission scenario, where the time durations assigned for data\ntransmission are slotted. In addition, we show that the full-duplex capability\nof a node increases the data transmission portion of the frame and enables a\ndistributed implementation of the proposed schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2016 07:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-20"}

We show that these\ntwo-peak solitons are stable in propagation and exhibit adiabatic transition to\na single peak state under weak absorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2016 08:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

The inequalities hold for all such tripartite states,\nwithout the assumption of Gaussian states, and are based on measurements of two\nconjugate quadrature phase amplitudes $X_{i}$ and $P_{i}$ at each mode $i=A,B$.\nThe first monogamy inequality is $D_{BA}+D_{BC}\\geq1$ where $D_{BA}<1$ is the\nwidely used symmetric entanglement criterion, for which $D_{BA}$ is the sum of\nthe variances of $(X_{A}-X_{B})/2$ and $(P_{A}+P_{B})/2$.

We also show that\nthe monogamy bounds are increased if a standard steering criterion for the\nsteering of $B$ is not satisfied. We illustrate the monogamy for continuous\nvariable tripartite entangled states including the effects of losses and noise,\nand identify regimes of saturation of the inequalities. The monogamy relations\nexplain the experimentally observed saturation at $D_{AB}=0.5$ for the\nentanglement between $A$ and $B$ when both modes have 50\\% losses, and may be\nuseful to establish rigorous bounds of correlation for the purpose of quantum\nkey distribution protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2016 10:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-20"}

The phases of the extraction include:\ntext preprocessing (tokenization, stop words, filtering), search engine\nautomated query, HTML parsing of results (i.e. scraping), estimation of\nsemantic proximity, ranking of emotions according to proximity measures. The\nmain idea is that, since it is possible to generalize semantic similarity under\nthe assumption that similar concepts co-occur in documents indexed in search\nengines, therefore also emotions can be generalized in the same way, through\ntags or terms that express them in a particular language, ranking emotions.\nTraining results are compared to human evaluation, then additional comparative\ntests on results are performed, both for the global ranking correlation (e.g.\nKendall, Spearman, Pearson) both for the evaluation of the emotion linked to\neach single word. Different from sentiment analysis, our approach works at a\ndeeper level of abstraction, aiming at recognizing specific emotions and not\nonly the positive/negative sentiment, in order to predict emotions as semantic\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2016 11:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-12"}

In the paramagnetic phase, magnetic resonance spectra are determined by\nmagnetic dipole and exchange interactions between Eu2+ spins. In the film, a\nlarge contribution arises from the demagnetization field. From detailed\nanalysis of the linewidth and its temperature dependence, the parameters of\nspin-spin interactions were determined: the exchange frequency is 15-15.5 GHz\nand the estimated critical exponent of the spin correlation length is ~ 0.5. In\nthe bulk samples, the spectra exhibited a distinct minimum in the linewidth at\nthe N\\'eel temperature, T_N = 5.5 K, while the resonance field practically does\nnot change even on cooling below T_N. This is indicative of a small magnetic\nanisotropy ~ 320 G in the antiferromagnetic phase. In the film, the magnetic\nresonance spectrum is split below T_N into several components due to excitation\nof the magnetostatic modes, corresponding to a non-uniform precession of\nmagnetization. Moreover, the film was observed to degrade over two years. This\nwas manifested by an increase of defects and a change in the domain structure.\nThe saturated magnetization in the film, estimated from the magnetic resonance\nspectrum, was about 900 emu/cm3 or 5.5 mu_B/unit cell at T = 3.5 K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2016 15:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

Using a classical analysis, the Hamilton's\nequation are obtained, a threshold indicating a discontinuous phase transition\nis presented and the classical dynamics is computed. Then, the quantum dynamics\nis investigated using direct diagonalisation. We find well agreement in both\nthese analysis. Based on our results, the switching scheme for tunneling is\nshown and the experimental feasibility is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2016 12:34:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

Sorg","title":"On the Non-Relativistic Groundstate Energy of Positronium in\n  Relativistic Schroedinger Theory","comments":"32 pages 3 figures","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"physics.gen-ph hep-th","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  The \\emph{Relativistic Schr\\\"odinger Theory} (RST) has been set up as an\nalternative form of particle theory. This theory obeys the fundamental\nsymmetries which are required to hold for any meaningful theory: gauge and\nLorentz covariance (RST can be formulated even over a pseudo-Riemannian\nspace-time). But the question is now whether obeying those fundamental\nsymmetries is sufficient for the practical success of a theory, i.e. whether\nthe predictions are in agreement with the experimental findings. In this\ncontext, the non-relativistic energy spectrum of positronium has been\nconsidered in some precedent papers. Here, the problem is that exact solutions\nof the RST eigenvalue system cannot be obtained and one has to resort to\napproximate solutions. For this purpose, a variational method is applied in the\npresent paper which yields the RST groundstate energy smaller than the former\nresults and than its conventional counterpart by some 10\\%. Such deviations are\nalso observed when one compares the approximate RST spectrum (up to quantum\nnumbers $n\\approx 100$) to the corresponding predictions of the conventional\ntheory. It seems presently not possible to decide whether those deviations are\ndue to RST itself or are merely due to the applied approximation technique.\nThus the practical usefulness of RST must remain unclarified for the moment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2016 15:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}
