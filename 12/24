To recover high-quality aerial image from its\nnon-uniform version, we propose a novel patch-wise restoration approach based\non a key observation that the degree of blurring is inevitably affected by the\nilluminated conditions. A non-local Retinex model is developed to accurately\nestimate the reflectance component from the degraded aerial image. Thereafter\nthe uneven illumination is corrected well. And then non-uniform coupled\nblurring in the enhanced reflectance image is alleviated and transformed\ntowards uniform distribution, which will facilitate the subsequent deblurring.\nFor constructing the multi-scale sparsified regularizer, the discrete shearlet\ntransform is improved to better represent anisotropic image features in term of\ndirectional sensitivity and selectivity. In addition, a new adaptive variant of\ntotal generalized variation is proposed for the structure-preserving\nregularizer. These complementary regularizers are elegantly integrated into an\nobjective function. The final deblurred image with uniform illumination can be\nextracted by applying the fast alternating direction scheme to solve the\nderived function. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can\nnot only remove both the space-varying illumination and motion blur in the\naerial image effectively but also recover the abundant details of aerial scenes\nwith top-level objective and subjective quality, and outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art restoration methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2016 17:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

Our numerical calculations show that the many body\nphysics of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) side is strongly modified\ncompared to the Fermi gases in the free space. The physics behind this\nstatement is in the fact that without a lattice structure, if the value of the\nZeeman field does not exceed some threshold value, the minimum of the\nsingle-particle ground state energy is infinitely degenerate and occurs along a\nring in $(k_x,k_y)$ space. This reduces the effective dimensionality; the\nsingle-particle density of states is a constant at low energies, and the\nmolecular pairing is strongly enhanced. In contrast to the continuum, in the 2D\nlattice case there are only four degenerate minima, and because of that, the\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) in optical lattices gives rise to unusual properties\nentirely different from the continuum. For example, in the continuum, the\npairing gap as well as the condensate fraction are strongly enhanced by the SOC\nstrength on the BCS side. In the presence of lattice geometry the gap and the\ncondensate fraction increase as a function of the SOC strength only at the\nsmall fillings and weak attraction limit. Moreover, we found that the speed of\nsound also exhibits different behavior: in the 3D and 2D continuum, the slope\nof the Goldstone mode decreases as a function of the SOC strength, while in the\nlattice case the speed of sound increases monotonically with SOC strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2016 17:06:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

This work aims to bridge this gap by modelling cell types as a\nset of hierarchically related dynamical attractors representing cell cycles.\nStages of the cell cycle are characterised by the configuration of gene\nexpression levels, and reprogramming corresponds to triggering transitions\nbetween such configurations.

Using a noncooperative game, a distributed\noptimization mechanism is proposed to maximize the secrecy rate of each link.\nThe decision variables here are the covariance matrices for the information\nsignals and ANs. However, the nonconvexity of each link's optimization problem\n(i.e., best response) makes conventional convex games inapplicable, even to\nfind whether a Nash Equilibrium (NE) exists. To tackle this issue, we analyze\nthe proposed game using a relaxed equilibrium concept, called quasi-Nash\nequilibrium (QNE). Under a constraint qualification condition for each player's\nproblem, the set of QNEs includes the NE of the proposed game. We also derive\nthe conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the resulting QNE. It turns\nout that the uniqueness conditions are too restrictive, and do not always hold\nin typical network scenarios. Thus, the proposed game often has multiple QNEs,\nand convergence to a QNE is not always guaranteed. To overcome these issues, we\nmodify the utility functions of the players by adding several specific terms to\neach utility function. The modified game converges to a QNE even when multiple\nQNEs exist. Furthermore, players have the ability to select a desired QNE that\noptimizes a given social objective (e.g., sum-rate or secrecy sum-rate).\nDepending on the chosen objective, the amount of signaling overhead as well as\nthe performance of resulting QNE can be controlled.

However,\nthe mechanistic aspects of impact-induced adhesion are still unresolved. Here\nwe study supersonic impact of individual metallic microparticles on substrates\nwith micro-scale and nanosecond-level resolution.

Line velocities however are much lower than expected from a stellar\ndisruption by supermassive black hole (SMBH), and are somewhat faster than\nexpected for the broad line region (BLR) clouds of a persistently active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN). The distinctive spectral states are not strongly\nrelated to observed luminosity and velocity, nor to SMBH mass estimates.

Our clustering method is general and can be tailored to a variety of\napplications in science and industry.

By imposing\nappropriate structural constraints and respecting the multi-indexed structure\nof the data, the analysis of clusters can be optimized for biological\ninterpretation and therapeutic understanding. We then perform a systematic,\nlarge-scale exploration of mechanistic models of MAPK-AKT crosstalk for each\ncluster.

In addition we demonstrate that\nthe nonlinear model describes the process of reduction of the number of\nfilaments trough two mechanisms of nonlinear interaction: attraction due to\ncross-phase modulation and energy exchange due to four-photon parametric wave\nmixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2016 00:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

This\ncorrelation is beneficial for learning algorithms, and indeed it was recently\nshown that $\\omega$-regular languages can be learned from membership and\nequivalence queries, using FDFAs as the acceptors.\n  In this paper, we look into the question of how suitable FDFAs are for\ndefining omega-regular languages.

This\nconclusion is obtained studying at first specific one-dimensional LR examples,\nin particular their phase diagrams and contents in symmetries and entanglement.\nThe purely long-range phases (LRP) are signaled by the violation of the\narea-law for the Von Neumann entropy and by corresponding peculiar\ndistributions for the entanglement spectrum (ES). The origin of the deviations\nfrom the TWC is analyzed from a more general point of view and in any\ndimension. In particular, it is found related with a particular type of\ndivergences occurring in the spectrum, due to the LR couplings. A satisfying\ncharacterization for the LRP can be achieved at least for one-dimensional\nsystems, as well as the connected definition of a nontrivial topology, provided\na careful evaluation of the LR contributions. Our results lead to reconsider\nthe definition of correlation length in LR systems.

The emergence of this peculiar edge structure\nis signaled by the bulk ES. The stability of the LRP against finite-size\neffects, relevant in current experiments, and against local disorder is\ndiscussed, showing that the latter ingredient can even strengthen the effect of\nthe LR couplings.

Due to this rastering combined with the magnification\nto atomic scale, movements of the specimen even at the nanometer scale lead to\nrandom image distortions that make precise atom localization difficult. Given a\nseries of STEM images, we derive a Bayesian method that jointly estimates the\ndistortion in each image and reconstructs the underlying atomic grid of the\nmaterial by fitting the atom bumps with suitable bump functions. The resulting\nhighly non-convex minimization problems are solved numerically with a trust\nregion approach. Well-posedness of the reconstruction method and the model\nbehavior for faster and faster rastering are investigated using variational\ntechniques.

Detection of both ground-state\n(at 119 and 79 um) and one or more radiatively-excited (at 65 and 84 um) lines\nallows us to model the nuclear gas (<~300 pc) as well as the more extended\ncomponents using spherically symmetric radiative transfer models. The highest\nmolecular outflow velocities are found in buried sources, in which slower but\nmassive expansion of the nuclear gas is also observed. With the exception of a\nfew outliers, the outflows have momentum fluxes of (2-5)xL_IR/c and mechanical\nluminosities of (0.1-0.3)% of L_IR. The moderate momentum boosts in these\nsources (<~3) suggest that the outflows are mostly momentum-driven by the\ncombined effects of AGN and nuclear starbursts, as a result of radiation\npressure, winds, and supernovae remnants.

At the same time, since any transportation infrastructure\nneeds some level of inter-settlement cooperation to be established, they can\nalso be regarded as an epiphenomenon of social interactions at the regional\nscale. Here, we propose to analyze ancient pathway networks to understand the\norganization of cities and villages located in a certain territory, attempting\nto clarify whether such organization existed and if so, how it functioned. To\naddress such a question, we chose a quantitative approach. Adopting network\nscience as a general framework, by means of formal models, we try to identify\nhow the collective effort that produced the terrestrial infrastructure was\ndirected and organized. We selected a paradigmatic case study: Iron Age\nsouthern Etruria, a very well-studied context, with detailed archaeological\ninformation about settlement patterns and an established tradition of studies\non terrestrial transportation routes, perfectly suitable for testing new\ntechniques. The results of the modelling suggest that a balanced coordinated\ndecision-making process was shaping the route network in Etruria, a scenario\nwhich correlates well with the picture elaborated by different scholars using a\nmore traditional technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2016 17:16:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Nov 2018 15:58:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 2019 17:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-14"}

The harmonic oscillator\nthus ceases to be a useful microscopic physical model in the limit $m \\to 0$,\nbut its Feynman path integral has interesting singularities which make it a\nprototype of other systems exhibiting a \"quantum runaway\" from the classical\nconfigurations near the minimum of the action. The probability density of the\ncoherent runaway modes can be obtained as the solution of a Fokker-Planck\nequation associated to the condition $S=S_{min}$. This technique can be applied\nalso to other systems, notably to a dimensional reduction of the\nEinstein-Hilbert action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2016 22:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-03"}

This interpretation relates the problem to capillary action and to\nmetastable configurations (Berthelot's negative pressure experiment of 1850).\nWe calculate the pressure and density profiles and find that the first\ninstability of basic Couette flow is localized near the bubble point. This\ntheoretical prediction has been confirmed by recent experiments.\n  The theory is the result of merging the two versions of classical\nhydrodynamics, as advocated by Landau for superfluid Helium II, but here\napplied to fluids in general, in accord with a widely held opinion concerning\nsuperfluidity.\n  In this paper two-flow dynamics is created by merging two actions, not by\nchoosing between them, nor by combining the two vector fields as in the\nNavier-Stokes equation . At rest, as contributions to the mass flow they\ncancel, but a non-zero kinetic energy and kinetic potential as well as non-zero\nangular momentum remain, manifest as liquid tension, as is well known to exist\nby observation of the meniscus and configurations with negative pressure.\n(Fronsdal 2020b in preparation).\n  This theory gives a very satisfactory characterization of the limit of\nstability of the most basic Couette flow. The inclusion of a vector field that\nis not a gradient has the additional affect of introducing spin, which explains\na most perplexing experimental discovery: the ability of frozen Helium to\nremember its angular momentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2016 22:44:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 18:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

Considering the fronthaul capacity, the controller maximizes the\ntime-averaged network throughput by enforcing a coarse correlated equilibrium\n(CCE) and incentivizing base stations (BSs) to locally optimize their decisions\nto ensure mobile users' (MUs) quality-of-service (QoS) requirements.
