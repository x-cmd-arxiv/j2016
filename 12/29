However, it is not clear if these\npolarity patterns can be explained by the same underlying regulatory mechanism.\nHere, we show that random, persistent and oscillatory migration accompanied by\npolarization can simultaneously occur in populations of melanoma cells derived\nfrom tumors with different degrees of aggressiveness. We demonstrate that all\nthese patterns and the probabilities of their occurrence are quantitatively\naccounted for by a simple mechanism involving a spatially distributed,\nmechano-chemical feedback coupling the dynamically changing extracellular\nmatrix (ECM)-cell contacts to the activation of signaling downstream of the\nRho-family small GTPases. This mechanism is supported by a predictive\nmathematical model and extensive experimental validation, and can explain\npreviously reported results for diverse cell types. In melanoma, this mechanism\nalso accounts for the effects of genetic and environmental perturbations,\nincluding mutations linked to invasive cell spread. The resulting mechanistic\nunderstanding of cell polarity quantitatively captures the relationship between\npopulation variability and phenotypic plasticity, with the potential to account\nfor a wide variety of cell migration states in diverse pathological and\nphysiological conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2016 18:50:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

The number of adopters of a new technology\ngenerally increases following a kind of logistic function. However, empirical\ndata provide evidences that this behavior may be more complex, as many factors\ninfluence the decision to adopt an innovation. On the one hand, although some\nindividuals are inclined to adopt an innovation if many people do the same,\nthere are others who act in the opposite direction, trying to differentiate\nfrom the \"herd\". People who prefer to behave like the others are called\nmimetic, whereas individuals who resist adopting new products, the stronger the\ngreater the number of adopters, are named contrarians. On the other hand, new\nadopters may have second thoughts and change their decisions accordingly.\nAgents who regret and abandon their decision will be denominated repentant. In\nthis paper we investigate a simple model for the adoption of an innovation for\na society composed by mimetic and contrarian individuals whose decisions depend\nmainly on three elements: the appeal of the novelty, the inertia or resistance\nto adopt it, and the social interactions with other agents. In the process,\nagents can repent and turn back to the old technology. We present analytic\ncalculations and numerical simulations to determine the conditions for the\nestablishment of the new technology. The inclusion of repentant agents modify\nthe balance between the global incentive to adopt and the number of contrarians\nwho prevent full adoption, generating a rich landscape of temporal evolution\nthat includes cycles of adoption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2016 18:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

As an\nexample, the abundance of B between about 7 and 15 MeV per nuc is unexpectedly\nlarge, greater than the prediction of a LBM by 2 or 3 in the measurement and\ncross section error. On the other hand, for several other heavier secondary\nnuclei with a low source abundance such as F and Z equal 17 to 19 and 21 to 23\nnuclei, in the corresponding energy channels between about 10-20 MeV/nuc, zero\nnuclei have been observed. The same LBM calculations would predict about 6 to 7\nevents for the sum of these three groups of nuclei. The B observed intensities\ncould be more closely matched by considering a nested LBM with 0.3-1.0 g/cm2 of\nmatter near the cosmic ray sources, essentially a source component of B. This\nnested LBM calculation, if extended to the production of the above groups of\nsecondaries, would however predict a total 8 to 12 events thus leading to an\neven larger discrepancy with the zero events that are observed. The\nmeasurements of heavier secondaries at low energies therefore make it very\nproblematical that a nested LBM with more than a few 0.1 g/cm2 or more of\nmatter near the sources could be the source of the large B abundance seen by\nVoyager. The large abundance of B at the lowest energies is best understood, so\nfar, as the result of production mostly from a matter traversal of 10 g/cm2 in\nthe galaxy, possibly in combination with uncertainties in the data and cross\nsections at these low energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2016 20:14:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-30"}

In order to determine this\nstructure, one must understand how different individual components of the\noverall argument are linked. General consensus in this field dictates that the\nargument components form a hierarchy of persuasion, which manifests itself in a\ntree structure. This work provides the first neural network-based approach to\nargumentation mining, focusing on the two tasks of extracting links between\nargument components, and classifying types of argument components. In order to\nsolve this problem, we propose to use a joint model that is based on a Pointer\nNetwork architecture. A Pointer Network is appealing for this task for the\nfollowing reasons: 1) It takes into account the sequential nature of argument\ncomponents; 2) By construction, it enforces certain properties of the tree\nstructure present in argument relations; 3) The hidden representations can be\napplied to auxiliary tasks. In order to extend the contribution of the original\nPointer Network model, we construct a joint model that simultaneously attempts\nto learn the type of argument component, as well as continuing to predict links\nbetween argument components. The proposed joint model achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on two separate evaluation corpora, achieving far superior performance\nthan a regular Pointer Network model.

Higginbottom \\& Proga recently demonstrated that the\nproperties of thermally-driven winds depend critically on the shape of the\nthermal equilibrium curve, since this determines the thermal stability of the\nirradiated material. For a given spectral energy distribution, the thermal\nequilibrium curve depends on exact balance between the various heating and\ncooling mechanisms at work. Most previous work on thermally-driven disk winds\nrelied an analytical approximation to these rates. Here, we use the\nphotoionization code \\textsc{cloudy} to generate realistic heating and cooling\nrates which we then use in a 2.5D hydrodynamic model computed in ZEUS to\nsimulate thermal winds in a typical black-hole X-ray binary. We find that these\nheating and cooling rates produce a significantly more complex thermal\nequilibrium curve, with dramatically different stability properties. The\nresulting flow, calculated in the optically thin limit, is qualitatively\ndifferent from flows calculated using approximate analytical rates.\nSpecifically, our thermal disk wind is much denser and slower, with a mass-loss\nrate that is a factor of two higher and characteristic velocities that are a\nfactor of three lower. The low velocity of the flow -- $v_{max} \\simeq\n200$~km~s$^{-1}$ -- may be difficult to reconcile with observations.

This is probably due\nto a small increase in the Crab Pulsar's internal temperature. In its absence,\nthe next large glitch in the Crab Pulsar is expected to occur around $2019$\nMarch. However, this event could have an important bearing on its occurrence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2016 05:35:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-17"}

The flavor\nsymmetry breaking scheme is considered to be $S_{3L} \\times S_{3R} \\to S_{2L}\n\\times S_{2R} \\to 0$.

Therefore, it seems to be more realistic to consider universal\nwaterfall textures for both $Y_{f}$ and $M_{R}$, e.g., by the radiative mass\ngeneration or the Froggatt--Nielsen mechanism.\n  Moreover, analysis of eigenvalues shows that the lightest mass eigenvalue\n$M_{R1}$ is too light to achieve successful thermal leptogenesis.

The memory effect means the\ndependence of the process not only on the current state of the process, but\nalso on the history of changes of this process in the past. For the\nmathematical description of the economic process with power-law memory we used\nthe theory of derivatives of non-integer order and fractional-order\ndifferential equation. We propose equations take into account the effects of\nmemory with one-parameter power-law damping. Solutions of these fractional\ndifferential equations are suggested.

In PSRs, one of the fundamental problems is\nthe learning of the PSR model of the underlying system. Recently, spectral\nmethods have been successfully used to address this issue by treating the\nlearning problem as the task of computing an singular value decomposition (SVD)\nover a submatrix of a special type of matrix called the Hankel matrix. Under\nthe assumptions that the rows and columns of the submatrix of the Hankel Matrix\nare sufficient~(which usually means a very large number of rows and columns,\nand almost fails in practice) and the entries of the matrix can be estimated\naccurately, it has been proven that the spectral approach for learning PSRs is\nstatistically consistent and the learned parameters can converge to the true\nparameters. However, in practice, due to the limit of the computation ability,\nonly a finite set of rows or columns can be chosen to be used for the spectral\nlearning. While different sets of columns usually lead to variant accuracy of\nthe learned model, in this paper, we propose an approach for selecting the set\nof columns, namely basis selection, by adopting a concept of model entropy to\nmeasure the accuracy of the learned model.

When $k=0$ the model\nis critical, and as $k$ varies the whole range of temperatures is covered. In\nthis paper we study the corresponding dimer model on the Fisher graph, thus\nextending our papers (Boutillier and de Tili{\\`e}re in Probab Theory Relat\nFields 147:379--413, 2010; Commun Math Phys 301(2):473--516, 2011) to the full\n$Z$-invariant case.

The expression for\n$H_{MF}$ is generalized beyond the real spin degree of freedom to include other\nspin-like discrete degrees of freedom (e.g. valley and pseudospin). By direct\ncomparison between Kubo formula and the time-independent perturbation theory,\nas well as the Sundaram-Niu wavepacket formalism, we show that $H_{MF}$\nreproduces the effect of the E-field, i.e. $E_x\\hat{x}$, up to the first order.\nThis replacement suggests the emergence of a new spin current term that is not\ncaptured by the standard Kubo formula spin current calculation.

We develop a nonstandard measure theory with\nvalues in a complete non-Archimedean valued field $K$, e.g. the $p-$adic\nnumbers $\\mathbb{Q}_p$. The corresponding theory for real-valued measures is\nwell known by the work of P. A. Loeb, R. M.

Then internal\nmeasures on rings and algebras with values in a nonstandard field ${^*K}$ are\nintroduced. We explain how an internal measure induces a $K$-valued Loeb\nmeasure. The standard-part map between a Loeb space and the underlying standard\nmeasure space is measurable almost everywhere. We establish liftings from\nmeasurable functions to internal simple functions. Furthermore, we prove that\nstandard measure spaces can be described as push-downs of hyperfinite internal\nmeasure spaces. This result is an analogue of a well-known Theorem on\nhyperfinite representations of Radon spaces. Then standard integrable functions\nare related to internal $S$-integrable functions and integrals are represented\nby hyperfinite sums. Finally, the results are applied to measures and integrals\non $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_p^{\\times}$.

Regularization in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) is widely\nused to solve this task and includes powerful estimators such as regularization\nnetworks. Recent achievements include the proof of the statistical consistency\nof these kernel- based approaches. Parallel to this, many different system\nidentification techniques have been developed but the interaction with machine\nlearning does not appear so strong yet. One reason is that the RKHSs usually\nemployed in machine learning do not embed the information available on dynamic\nsystems, e.g. BIBO stability. In addition, in system identification the\nindependent data assumptions routinely adopted in machine learning are never\nsatisfied in practice. This paper provides new results which strengthen the\nconnection between system identification and machine learning. Our starting\npoint is the introduction of RKHSs of dynamic systems. They contain functionals\nover spaces defined by system inputs and allow to interpret system\nidentification as learning from examples. In both linear and nonlinear\nsettings, it is shown that this perspective permits to derive in a relatively\nsimple way conditions on RKHS stability (i.e. the property of containing only\nBIBO stable systems or predictors), also facilitating the design of new kernels\nfor system identification.

We provide analytical expressions\nthat account for decoherence in CIFs, friction coefficients and the\nself-correlation functions of the CIFs.

The effect of decoherence\non the current-induced friction depends on the length of the system, reducing\nthe friction for small systems while increasing it for long ones.

Classically, gradient descent has been a sequential and\nsynchronous process, although distributed and asynchronous variants have been\nstudied since the 1980s. Coordinate descent is a commonly studied version of\ngradient descent. In this paper, we focus on asynchronous coordinate descent on\nconvex functions $F:\\mathbb{R}^n\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ of the form $F(x) = f(x)\n+ \\sum_{k=1}^n \\Psi_k(x_k)$, where $f:\\mathbb{R}^n\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is a\nsmooth convex function, and each $\\Psi_k:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is a\nunivariate and possibly non-smooth convex function. Such functions occur in\nmany data analysis and machine learning problems.\n  We give new analyses of cyclic coordinate descent, a parallel asynchronous\nstochastic coordinate descent, and a rather general worst-case parallel\nasynchronous coordinate descent. For all of these, we either obtain sharply\nimproved bounds, or provide the first analyses. Our analyses all use a common\namortized framework. The application of this framework to the asynchronous\nstochastic version requires some new ideas, for it is not obvious how to ensure\na uniform distribution where it is needed in the face of asynchronous actions\nthat may undo uniformity. We believe that our approach may well be applicable\nto the analysis of other iterative asynchronous stochastic processes.\n  We extend the framework to show that an asynchronous version of tatonnement,\na fundamental price dynamic widely studied in general equilibrium theory,\nconverges toward a market equilibrium for Fisher markets with CES utilities or\nLeontief utilities, for which tatonnement is equivalent to coordinate descent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2016 15:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-30"}

The\nenthalpy-based MRT-LB method consists of three different MRT-LB models: one for\nflow field based on the generalized non-Darcy model, and the other two for\nphase change material (PCM) and metal foam temperature fields described by the\nLTNE model. The moving solid-liquid phase interface is implicitly tracked\nthrough the liquid fraction, which is simultaneously obtained when the energy\nequations of PCM and metal foam are solved. The present method has several\ndistinctive features. First, as compared with previous studies, the present\nmethod avoids the iteration procedure, thus it retains the inherent merits of\nthe standard LB method and is superior over the iteration method in terms of\naccuracy and computational efficiency. Second, a volumetric LB scheme instead\nof the bounce-back scheme is employed to realize the no-slip velocity condition\nin the interface and solid phase regions, which is consistent with the actual\nsituation. Last but not least, the MRT collision model is employed, and with\nadditional degrees of freedom, it has the ability to reduce the numerical\ndiffusion across phase interface induced by solid-liquid phase change.\nNumerical tests demonstrate that the present method can be served as an\naccurate and efficient numerical tool for studying metal foam enhanced\nsolid-liquid phase change heat transfer in latent heat storage. Finally,\ncomparisons and discussions are made to offer useful information for practical\napplications of the present method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2016 16:50:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2017 15:07:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 13:58:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 22 Jul 2017 03:43:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-09"}
