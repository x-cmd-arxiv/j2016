For\nseveral common quantum control goals, including the maximization of an\nobservable expectation value, the landscape has been shown to lack local optima\nif three assumptions are satisfied: (i) the quantum system is controllable,\n(ii) the Jacobian of the map from the control field to the evolution operator\nis full-rank, and (iii) the control field is not constrained. In the case of\nthe observable objective, this favorable analysis shows that the associated\nlandscape also contains saddles, i.e., critical points that are not local\nsuboptimal extrema. In this paper, we investigate whether the presence of these\nsaddles affects the trajectories of gradient-based searches for an optimal\ncontrol. We show through simulations that both the detailed topology of the\ncontrol landscape and the parameters of the system Hamiltonian influence\nwhether the searches are attracted to a saddle. For some circumstances with a\nspecial initial state and target observable, optimizations may approach a\nsaddle very closely, reducing the efficiency of the gradient algorithm.\nEncounters with such attractive saddles are found to be quite rare. Neither the\npresence of a large number of saddles on the control landscape nor a large\nnumber of system states increase the likelihood that a search will closely\napproach a saddle. Even for applications that encounter a saddle, well-designed\ngradient searches with carefully chosen algorithmic parameters will readily\nlocate optimal controls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2016 16:29:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

The metric is split in the holographic coordinate, used to approach the\nboundary, and the metric at the boundary. One can consider the quantities in\nthe bulk perturbing the (one dimension lower) boundary metric in holographic\ncoordinate. The response functions to fluctuations of the boundary metric are\nBrown--York stress energy tensor sourced by the leading term in the expansion\nof the boundary metric and a Partially Massless Response, specific for CG and\nsourced by the subleading term in the expansion of the boundary metric. They\nformulate boundary charges that define the asymptotic symmetry algebra or the\nalgebra of the diffeomorphisms that preserve the boundary conditions of the\ntheory. We further analyse CG via canonical analysis constructing the gauge\ngenerators of the canonical charges that agree with Noether charges, while the\ncharge associated to Weyl transformations, vanishes. Asymptotic symmetry\nalgebra is determined by the leading term in the expansion of the boundary\nmetric and for the asymptotically Minkowski, R \\times S2, and the boundaries\nrelated by conformal rescaling, defines conformal algebra.

The novelty of our computation is\nthat it uses a completely different method by means of the mass insertion\napproximation which works with the electroweak interaction states instead of\nthe usual 9 physical neutrino mass eigenstates of the inverse seesaw model.\nThis method also allows us to write the analytical results explicitly in terms\nof the most relevant model parameters, that are the neutrino Yukawa coupling\nmatrix $Y_\\nu$ and the right-handed mass matrix $M_R$, which is very convenient\nfor a phenomenological analysis.

These star\npolygons are formed from truncated extended edges of the N-gon and the\nintersection points ('star' points) determine a scaling which defines the\nparameters of the family. In 'First Families of Regular Polygons'\n(arXiv:1503.05536) we showed that this scaling forms a basis for the maximal\nreal subfield of the cyclotomic field of N. The traditional generator for this\nsubfield is 2cos(2Pi/N) so it has order Phi(N)/2 where Phi is the Euler totient\nfunction. This order is known as the 'algebraic complexity' of N. The family of\nregular polygons shares this same scaling and complexity, so members of this\nfamily are an intrinsic part of any regular polygon - and we call them the\nFirst Family of N.\n  Here we start from first principles and give a formal derivation of the First\nFamilies showing how each star[k] point of N defines a scale[k] and also an\nS[k] 'tile' of the family. Under a piecewise isometry such as the\nouter-billiards map the 'singularity set' W can be formed by iterating the\nextended edges of N and we show that W can be reduced to a 'shear and rotation'\nwhich preserves the S[k], so the 'web' W can be regarded as the disjoint union\n(coproduct) of the local webs of the S[k]. These local webs are still very\ncomplex but we show in Lemma 4.1 that the center of each S[k] has a constant\nstep-k orbit around N. These 'resonant' orbits set bounds on global orbits and\nestablish a connection between geometry and dynamics. We can now make\npredictions about the geometry of the S[1] and S[2] tiles on the edges of N and\ngive a plausible explanation for the '4k+1' conjecture of arXiv:1311.6763 about\nextended families of tiles when N = 8k+2.

The accretion of heavy material with a mean\nmolecular weight, $\\mu$, higher than the mean molecular weight of the white\ndwarf outer layers, induces a double-diffusive instability producing fingering\nconvection and extra-mixing. As a result, the accreted material is diluted deep\ninto the star.

This effect is\nshown to be independent of the degree of polymerization, N, and the size of the\nsystem. It arises from the composition and the structure of the first particle\nlayer adjacent to each surface that results from the confinement of the fluid.\nWhenever such layers are made up of as close a proportion of polymer beads to\nsolvent particles as there are in the fluid, the friction coefficient shows a\nminimum, while for disparate proportions the friction coefficient grows.

The competition between Kondo correlations and superconductivity in\nJosephson quantum dot (QD) devices results in two different ground states and\nthe occurrence of a 0-$\\pi$ quantum phase transition. Here we report on\ntransport measurements on hybrid superconductor-InSb nanowire QD devices with\ndifferent device geometries. We demonstrate a realization of continuous\ngate-tunable ABSs with both 0-type levels and $\\pi$-type levels. This allow us\nto manipulate the transition between 0 and $\\pi$ junction and explore charge\ntransport and spectrum in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition regime.\nFurthermore, we find a coexistence of 0-type ABS and $\\pi$-type ABS in the same\ncharge state. By measuring temperature and magnetic field evolution of the\nABSs, the different natures of the two sets of ABSs are verified, being\nconsistent with the scenario of phase transition between the singlet and\ndoublet ground state.

A protein folding theory indicates that homologous\nsequences obey a canonical ensemble characterized by $\\exp(-\\Delta G_{ND}/k_B\nT_s)$ or by $\\exp(- G_{N}/k_B T_s)$ if an amino acid composition is kept\nconstant, where $\\Delta G_{ND} \\equiv G_N - G_D$, $G_N$ and $G_D$ are the\nnative and denatured free energies, and $T_s$ is selective temperature.

We present a justification on the conjecture on\nthe mirror construction of D- branes in Aganagic-Vafa [2]. We apply the\ntechniques employed in Chan-Lau-Leung [8] and Chan [6], which give the SYZ\nmirror construction for D-branes. Recently, Chan-Lau-Leung [8] has given an\nexplicit mirror construction for toric Calabi-Yau manifolds as complex\nalgebraic varieties. Inspired by the SYZ transformation of D-branes in\nLeung-Yau-Zaslow[29], Chan[6] has defined a generalised mirror construction for\na larger class of Lagrangian subspaces, which is important to our situation.\nThe results point towards a need for further quantum correction of the SYZ\ntransform for Lagrangian subspaces in order to recover physicists mirror\nprediction of counting holomorphic discs in Ooguri-Vafa [34]. When compare to\nphysicists prediction of the Aganagic-Vafa mirror branes, such naive SYZ\ntransform fails to coincide with the prediction. The main reasons lies in the\nfact that the SYZ transformation does not capture open Gromov-Witten invariants\nof the A-brane. Through the special case of Aganagic-Vafa A-branes, we are able\nto modify the SYZ transform that involves further quantum correction using\ndiscs counting of the A-brane. However it is not known how such a modified SYZ\ntransform can be constructed and works in general. We believe that the explicit\nformulas and computations in the special case we consider here can give hints\nto the correct modification in general in future development of the SYZ\nprogramme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2016 04:12:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-02"}

Due to limited depth of field at such small distances,\nthe defocus blur induced in images can provide information about the 3D shape\nof the object. The task of `shape from defocus' (SFD), involves the problem of\nestimating good quality 3D shape estimates from images with depth-dependent\ndefocus blur. While the research area of SFD is quite well-established, the\napproaches have largely demonstrated results on objects with bulk/coarse shape\nvariation. However, in many cases, objects studied under microscopes often\ninvolve fine/detailed structures, which have not been explicitly considered in\nmost methods.

It\nis widely accepted that flares are powered by magnetic reconnection in the\ncorona. An eruptive flare is usually accompanied by a coronal mass ejection,\nboth of which are probably driven by the eruption of a magnetic flux rope\n(MFR). Here we report an eruptive flare on 2016 March 23 observed by the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The\nextreme-ultraviolet imaging observations exhibit the clear rise and eruption of\nan MFR. In particular, the observations reveal solid evidence for magnetic\nreconnection from both the corona and chromosphere during the flare.

Among them, this review focuses on the molecule-like\nstructure of unstable nuclei. One of the earliest discussions on the clustering\nin unstable nuclei was made for neutron-rich Be and B isotopes. AMD\ncalculations predicted that the ground state clustering is enhanced or reduced\ndepending on the number of excess neutrons. Today, the experiments are\nconfirming this prediction as the change of the proton radii. Behind this\nenhancement and reduction of the clustering, there are underlying shell effects\ncalled molecular- and atomic-orbits.

In the strong coupling regime, we find that the existence of spin\ninduces quantum phase transitions (QPTs) between two states of environment: the\nnormal state and a state with local distortions.

We model\nthese emission features in the infrared spectra of 69 PPDs around 14 T Tauri\nand 55 Herbig Ae/Be stars in terms of astronomical-PAHs.

We find that the characteristic size of PAHs shows a tendency of\ncorrelating with the stellar effective temperature ($T_{\\rm eff}$) and\ninterpret this as the preferential photodissociation of small PAHs in systems\nwith higher $T_{\\rm eff}$ of which the stellar photons are more energetic. In\naddition, the PAH size shows a moderate correlation with the red-ward\nwavelength-shift of the 7.7 $\\mu$m PAH feature that is commonly observed in\ndisks around cool stars. The ionization fraction of PAHs does not seem to\ncorrelate with any stellar parameters. This is because the charging of PAHs\ndepends on not only the stellar properties (e.g., $T_{\\rm eff}$, luminosity)\nbut also the spatial distribution of PAHs in the disks. The mere negative\ncorrelation between the PAH size and the stellar age suggests that continuous\nreplenishment of PAHs via the outgassing of cometary bodies and/or the\ncollisional grinding of planetesimals and asteroids is required to maintain the\nabundance of small PAHs against complete destruction by photodissociation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2016 10:57:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

Historically the transport of\nthese particles has been largely treated through a deterministic approach, in\nwhich first-order secular energy loss to electrons in the ambient target is\ntreated as the dominant effect, with second-order diffusive terms (in both\nenergy and angle) being generally either treated as a small correction or even\nneglected. We here critically analyze this approach, and we show that spatial\ndiffusion through pitch-angle scattering necessarily plays a very significant\nrole in the transport of electrons. We further show that a satisfactory\ntreatment of the diffusion process requires consideration of non-local effects,\nso that the electron flux depends not just on the local gradient of the\nelectron distribution function but on the value of this gradient within an\nextended region encompassing a significant fraction of a mean free path. Our\nanalysis applies generally to pitch-angle scattering by a variety of\nmechanisms, from Coulomb collisions to turbulent scattering. We further show\nthat the spatial transport of electrons along the magnetic field of a flaring\nloop can be modeled rather effectively as a Continuous Time Random Walk with\nvelocity-dependent probability distribution functions of jump sizes and\noccurrences, both of which can be expressed in terms of the scattering mean\nfree path.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2016 11:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

The Trifid Nebula M20 is a well known galactic HII\nregion ionized by a single O7.5 star. In 2011, based on the CO observations\nwith NANTEN2 we reported that the O star was formed by the collision between\ntwo molecular clouds ~0.3,Myr ago. Those observations identified two molecular\nclouds towards M20, traveling at a relative velocity of 7.5 km/s. This velocity\nseparation implies that the clouds cannot be gravitationally bound to M20, but\nsince the clouds show signs of heating by the stars there they must be\nspatially coincident with it. A collision is therefore highly possible. In this\npaper we present the new CO J=1-0 and J=3-2 observations of the colliding\nclouds in M20 performed with the Mopra and ASTE telescopes. The high resolution\nobservations revealed the two molecular clouds have peculiar spatial and\nvelocity structures, i.e., the spatially complementary distribution between the\ntwo clouds and the bridge feature which connects the two clouds in velocity\nspace. Based on a new comparison with numerical models, we find that this\ncomplementary distribution is an expected outcome of cloud-cloud collisions,\nand that the bridge feature can be interpreted as the turbulent gas excited at\nthe interface of the collision. Our results reinforce the cloud-cloud collision\nscenario in M20.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2016 11:18:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

We find an increase\nin the fractional variability with energy, while no significant interband\ncorrelations of flux changes are found in the acquired data set. The higher\nvariability in the very high energy (>100 GeV, VHE) gamma-ray emission and the\nlack of correlation with the X-ray emission indicate that the highest-energy\nelectrons that are responsible for the VHE gamma-rays do not make a dominant\ncontribution to the ~1 keV emission. Alternatively, there could be a very\nvariable component contributing to the VHE gamma-ray emission in addition to\nthat coming from the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) scenarios. The space of SSC\nmodel parameters is probed following a dedicated grid-scan strategy, allowing\nfor a wide range of models to be tested and offering a study of the degeneracy\nof model-to-data agreement in the individual model parameters. We find that\nthere is some degeneracy in both the one-zone and the two-zone SSC scenarios\nthat were probed, with several combinations of model parameters yielding a\nsimilar model-to-data agreement, and some parameters better constrained than\nothers. The SSC model grid-scan shows that the flaring activity around 2009 May\n22 cannot be modeled adequately with a one-zone SSC scenario, while it can be\nsuitably described within a two-independent-zone SSC scenario. The observation\nof an electric vector polarization angle rotation coincident with the gamma-ray\nflare from 2009 May 1 resembles those reported previously for low frequency\npeaked blazars, hence suggesting that there are many similarities in the\nflaring mechanisms of blazars with different jet properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2016 12:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

The model has interpretable parameters and is\ncomparatively more realistic than previous stochastic models, providing new\ninsights into the relationship between sequence and structure evolution. For\nexample, using the trained model we were able to identify an apparent\nsequence-structure evolutionary motif present in a large number of homologous\nprotein pairs.

A\none-to-many mapping of vertex onto dimer configurations allows the free-fermion\nsolutions to be applied to the anisotropic dimer model on a square lattice\nwhere the dimers are rotated by 45 degrees compared to their usual orientation.\nThis dimer model is exactly solvable in geometries of arbitrary finite size. In\nthis paper, we establish and solve inversion identities for dimers with\nperiodic boundary conditions on the cylinder. In the particle representation,\nthe local face tile operators give a representation of the fermion algebra and\nthe fermion particle trajectories play the role of nonlocal (logarithmic)\ndegrees of freedom. In a suitable gauge, the dimer model is described by the\nTemperley-Lieb algebra with loop fugacity $\\beta=2\\cos\\lambda=0$. At the\nisotropic point, the exact solution allows for the explicit counting of 45\ndegrees rotated dimer configurations on a periodic $M\\times N$ rectangular\nlattice. We show that the modular invariant partition function on the torus is\nthe same as symplectic fermions and critical dense polymers. We also show that\nnontrivial Jordan cells appear for the dimer Hamiltonian on the strip with\nvacuum boundary conditions. We therefore argue that, in the continuum scaling\nlimit, the dimer model gives rise to a {\\em logarithmic} conformal field theory\nwith central charge c=-2, minimal conformal weight $\\Delta_{\\text{min}}=-1/8$\nand effective central charge $c_{\\text{eff}}=1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2016 12:41:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 02:05:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-19"}

We conduct a\ncomprehensive eigenmode analysis, both analytically and numerically, on the\ndispersive properties of sausage modes in pressureless tubes with three\nfamilies of continuous radial density profiles. We find a rich variety of the\ndependence on the axial wavenumber $k$ of the axial group speed $v_{\\rm gr}$.\nDepending on the density contrast and profile steepness as well as on the\ndetailed profile description, the $v_{\\rm gr}-k$ curves either possess or do\nnot possess cutoff wavenumbers, and they can behave in either a monotonical or\nnon-monotonical manner. With time-dependent simulations, we further show that\nthis rich variety of the group speed characteristics heavily influences the\ntemporal evolution and Morlet spectra of impulsively generated wave trains. In\nparticular, the Morlet spectra can look substantially different from \"crazy\ntadpoles\" found for the much-studied discontinuous density profiles. We\nconclude that it is necessary to re-examine available high-cadence data to look\nfor the rich set of temporal and spectral features, which can be employed to\ndiscriminate between the unknown forms of the density distributions transverse\nto coronal structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2016 13:14:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

Analyzing\ndifferent datasets, ranging from metabolic gene-regulatory to species\ninteraction networks, we find that these networks are sparse, i.e. the\npercentage of the active interactions scales inversely proportional to the\nsystem size. This puzzling characteristic has been neither yet considered nor\nexplained. Herein, we introduce the new concept of explorability, a measure of\nthe ability of the system to adapt to newly intervening changes. We show that\nsparsity is an emergent property resulting from a variational principle aiming\nat the optimization of both explorability and dynamical robustness, the\ncapacity of the system to remain stable after perturbations of the underlying\ndynamics. Networks with higher connectivities lead to an incremental difficulty\nto find better values for both the explorability and dynamical robustness,\nassociated with the fine-tuning of the newly added interactions. A relevant\ncharacteristic of our solution is its scale invariance, that is, it remains\noptimal when several communities are assembled togheter. Connectivity is also a\nkey ingredient determining ecosystem stability and our proposed solution\ncontributes to solving May's celebrated complexity-stability paradox.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2016 00:37:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2017 23:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-13"}

Further, error\nperformance of BICM-ID can significantly be improved by employing\nmulti-dimensional (MD) modulation. However, suitable MD mappings are obtained\nby computer search techniques except for MD modulations that use smaller\nconstellation e.g., binary phase shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase shift\nkeying (QPSK) and $8$-ary phase shift keying ($8$-PSK) as basic modulation. The\nalphabet size of MD modulations increases exponentially as the order of the\nbasic modulation increases and computer search becomes intractable. In this\npaper, we propose a systematic mapping method for MD modulations. The\ninnovativeness of our proposed method is that it generates MD mappings using\n$16$- and $64$-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) very efficiently.
