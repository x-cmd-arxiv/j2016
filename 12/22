This\nencoder-decoder style architecture first learns a coarse representation of the\noptical flow field features, and then refines it iteratively to produce motion\nlabels at the original high-resolution.

Although considerable research has been devoted to the\ndevelopment of rank aggregation algorithms, one basic question is how to\nefficiently collect a large amount of high-quality pairwise comparisons for the\nranking purpose. Because of the advent of many crowdsourcing services, a crowd\nof workers are often hired to conduct pairwise comparisons with a small\nmonetary reward for each pair they compare. Since different workers have\ndifferent levels of reliability and different pairs have different levels of\nambiguity, it is desirable to wisely allocate the limited budget for\ncomparisons among the pairs of items and workers so that the global ranking can\nbe accurately inferred from the comparison results.

One of the key challenges in exploiting this effect is processing\nthe signal so that it can be readily measured; linear processing is\ninsufficient.

We call such a hypothesis\n\"noncontextuality\", an instance of Leibniz's principle of the identity of\nindiscernibles. Read in the contrapositive, this hypothesis entails that any\nphysical distinctions between two experimental procedures must necessarily lead\nto a difference in their operational statistics. The results I present in this\nthesis concern the failure of this hypothesis -- a failure dubbed\n\"contextuality\" -- when one tries to embed an operational theory (such as\nquantum theory) in the ontological models framework. The Kochen-Specker theorem\ndemonstrates the failure of noncontextuality for deterministic ontological\nmodels of quantum theory, i.e., those ontological models where the\nontic/physical state of the system fixes the outcome of any projective\nmeasurement on the system in a deterministic manner. This thesis goes beyond\nthe Kochen-Specker (KS) theorem by asking what operational facts must be\nverified in experiments to conclude that Nature does not admit noncontextual\nontological models, not even indeterministic ones. This leads to\nnoncontextuality inequalities that are robust to noise in the preparations and\nmeasurements. In the particular case of quantum theory, these inequalities are\nmeaningful even when unsharp measurements (or POVMs) are allowed, a feature not\nshared by the traditional approach to KS-noncontextuality where unsharp\nmeasurements are excluded by fiat: allowing them renders even trivial POVMs\n(proportional to identity) maximally KS-contextual.

Of particular interest is the possibility that the merger\nevents detected could be evidence of dark matter in the form of primordial\nblack holes (PBHs). It has been argued that the presence of many black holes\nwould effect the thermal and ionization history of the universe via their\naccretion of matter which would have strong signatures in the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground's (CMB) power spectra evident in the damping of anisotropies and\nchange in low-$l$ polarization power. In general the accretion is quite\nsensitive to the specific physics involved and the conditions of the early\nuniverse. In this work, we take a minimal approach and find constraints on PBHs\nnot including the model dependent effects of nonlinear structure of formation\nor transition between different accretion models which would work to increase\nthe effect. In addition, we include the relative velocity between dark matter\nand baryonic matter including the effects of supersonic streaming at high\nredshift which work to significantly reduce the constraining power. We also\nexamine the constraints on more astrophysically-motivated extended black hole\nmass functions and discuss how mergers might effect this distribution.

The macrocell base station (BS) locations are modeled by an\nindependent PPP. This model is consistent with the user and SBS configurations\nconsidered by 3GPP. Using this model, we study the performance of a typical\nuser in terms of coverage probability and throughput for two association\npolicies: i) Policy 1, under which a typical user is served by the open-access\nBS that provides maximum averaged received power, and ii) Policy 2, under which\nthe typical user is served by the small cell tier if the maximum averaged\nreceived power from the open-access SBSs is greater than a certain power\nthreshold; and macro tier otherwise. A key intermediate step in our analysis is\nthe derivation of distance distributions from a typical user to the open-access\nand closed-access interfering SBSs. Our analysis demonstrates that as the\nnumber of SBSs reusing the same resource block increases, coverage probability\ndecreases whereas throughput increases. Therefore, contrary to the usual\nassumption of orthogonal channelization, it is reasonable to assign the same\nresource block to multiple SBSs in a given cluster as long as the coverage\nprobability remains acceptable.

These ambiguities are usually resolved by developing a\nself-adjoint extension of the original problem; a non-unique procedure that\nleaves undetermined which extension should apply in specific physical systems.\nWe take the guesswork out of this picture by using techniques of effective\nfield theory to derive the required boundary conditions at the origin in terms\nof the effective point-particle action describing the physics of the source. In\nthis picture ambiguities in boundary conditions boil down to the allowed\nchoices for the source action, but casting them in terms of an action provides\na physical criterion for their determination.

First, we show that the above mentioned\nsymmetry also holds when parity and charge conjugation invariance are broken.\nSecond we extend this new symmetry to the case of critical (gapless) theories.\nOur results are further supported by numerical analysis. For some particular\ncases, analytical demonstrations show the validity of the extended symmetry. We\nfinally discuss the intriguing parallelism of this new symmetry and space-time\nconformal transformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 19:16:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2017 18:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

Gravitational energy released as the body\ninspirals into the outer layers of the star caused a temporary and unobserved\nbrightening, from which the stellar flux is now returning to the quiescent\nstate. The transient dimming events could then be due to obscuration by\nplanetary debris from an earlier partial disruption of the same inspiraling\nbodies, or due to evaporation and out-gassing from a tidally detached moon\nsystem. Alternatively, the dimming events could arise from a large number of\nbodies comet- or planetesimal-mass bodies placed onto high eccentricity orbits\nby the same mechanism (e.g. Lidov-Kozai oscillations due to the outer M-dwarf\ncompanion) responsible for driving the more massive planets into KIC 8462852.\nThe required high occurrence rate of KIC 8462852-like systems which have\nundergone recent major planet inspiral event(s) is the greatest challenge to\nthe model, placing large lower limits on the mass of planetary systems\nsurrounding F stars and/or requiring an unlikely probability to catch KIC\n8462852 in its current state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 21:01:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 00:31:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

This is the analogue for spinless\nelectrons of the contribution of the charge-radius of the source to these\nlevels, and we disagree with standard calculations in several ways. Most\nnotably we find there are two effective interactions with the same dimension\nthat contribute to leading order in the nuclear size. One is the standard\ncharge-radius contribution, while the other is a contact interaction whose\nleading contribution to $\\delta E$ arises linearly in the small length scale,\n$\\epsilon$, characterizing the finite-size effects, and is suppressed by\n$(Z\\alpha)^5$. We argue that standard calculations miss the contributions of\nthis second operator because they err in their choice of boundary conditions at\nthe source for the wave-function of the orbiting particle. PPEFT predicts how\nthis boundary condition depends on the source's charge radius, as well as on\nthe orbiting particle's mass.

When an agent is in the ON mode, it can measure the instantaneous\noutcome of one of the actions corresponding to the ON mode and decides whether\nit should take this action or not based on this new observation. If it does not\ntake this action, it switches to the OFF mode where it transitions to the next\nstate based on a predetermined set of transitional probabilities, without\nmaking any additional observations. In this decision-making model, each agent\nacts autonomously according to an ON/OFF decision policy, and the discrete\nprobability distribution for the agent's state evolves according to a\ndiscrete-time Markov chain that is a linear function of the stochastic\nenvironment (i.e., transition probabilities) and the ON/OFF decision policy.\nThe relevant policy synthesis is formulated as a convex optimization problem\nwhere hard safety and convergence constraints are imposed on the resulting\nMarkov matrix.

It was demonstrated that this generalization can have\nimportant consequences on the evolution of turbulence, leading to the creation\nof maximally-helical fields from initially non-helical ones. Therefore, chiral\neffects can strongly support turbulent inverse cascade, and lead to a slower\ndecrease of the magnetic field with time, and also to a faster growth of the\ncorrelation length, when compared to the evolution predicted by the standard\nmagnetohydrodynamical description.

This problem is typically formulated\nas a nonconvex maximum-likelihood estimation that is computationally hard to\nsolve in general. Nevertheless, in this paper we present an algorithm that is\nable to efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions of the\nspecial Euclidean synchronization problem in a non-adversarial noise regime.\nThe crux of our approach is the development of a semidefinite relaxation of the\nmaximum-likelihood estimation whose minimizer provides an exact MLE so long as\nthe magnitude of the noise corrupting the available measurements falls below a\ncertain critical threshold; furthermore, whenever exactness obtains, it is\npossible to verify this fact a posteriori, thereby certifying the optimality of\nthe recovered estimate. We develop a specialized optimization scheme for\nsolving large-scale instances of this relaxation by exploiting its low-rank,\ngeometric, and graph-theoretic structure to reduce it to an equivalent\noptimization problem on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and design a\ntruncated-Newton trust-region method to solve this reduction efficiently.\nFinally, we combine this fast optimization approach with a simple rounding\nprocedure to produce our algorithm, SE-Sync. Experimental evaluation on a\nvariety of simulated and real-world pose-graph SLAM datasets shows that SE-Sync\nis able to recover certifiably globally optimal solutions when the available\nmeasurements are corrupted by noise up to an order of magnitude greater than\nthat typically encountered in robotics and computer vision applications, and\ndoes so more than an order of magnitude faster than the Gauss-Newton-based\napproach that forms the basis of current state-of-the-art techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 23:21:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2017 03:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

In systems with very low\naccretion rates, this is likely due to the very low accretion luminosities\nresulting from radiatively inefficient accretion flows. In systems with high\naccretion rates, the accretion flows are expected to be radiatively efficient,\nand the production of such powerful jets may require an accretion scenario\nwhich involves magnetically arrested discs (MADs). However, numerical\nsimulations of the MAD scenario indicate that jet production efficiency is\nlarge only for geometrically thick accretion flows and scales roughly with\n$(H/R)^2$, where $H$ is the disc height and $R$ is the distance from the BH.\nUsing samples of FRII radio galaxies and quasars accreting at moderate\naccretion rates we show that their jets are much more powerful than predicted\nby the MAD scenario. We discuss possible origins of this discrepancy,\nsuggesting that it can be related to approximations adopted in MHD simulations\nto treat optically thick accretion flow within the MAD-zone, or may indicate\nthat accretion disks are geometrically thicker than the standard theory\npredicts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 23:48:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

If the\ninterference channels between the SUs and the PU are statistically different\ndue to the different physical locations of the SUs, the SUs will experience\ndifferent delay performances. This is because SUs located closer to the PU\ntransmit with lower power levels. A dynamic scheduling-and-power-allocation\npolicy that uses the dynamic programming, is proposed.

The deposition temperature varies the diffusion length during thin\nfilm growth by limiting the average crystal size in the range from 40 to 110\nnm. Using a method common for single chain magnets, the magnetic relaxation\ntime for each chain length is determined from temporal remanence data and fit\nto a stretched exponential form in the temperature range below 5 K, the onset\nfor magnetic hysteresis. A temperature-independent master curve is generated by\nscaling the remanence by its relaxation time to fit the energy barrier for spin\nreversal, and the single spin relaxation time. The energy barrier of 95 K is\nfound to be independent of the chain length. In contrast, the single spin\nrelaxation time increases with longer chains from under 1 ps to 800 ps.

Specifically, we find in the case of a\nfast electron-positron spine surrounded by a slow-moving or stationary\nelectron-ion sheath, lepton acceleration proceeds in a highly anisotropic\nmanner due to electromagnetic fields created at the shear interface. While the\nhighest-energy leptons still produce a beaming pattern (as seen in the\nquasi-stationary frame of the sheath) of order 1/{\\Gamma}, where {\\Gamma} is\nthe bulk Lorentz factor of the spine, for lower-energy particles, the beaming\nis much less pronounced. This is in stark contrast to the case of pure\nelectron-ion shear layers, in which anisotropic particle acceleration leads to\nsignificantly narrower beaming patterns than 1/{\\Gamma} for the highest-energy\nparticles. In either case, shear-layer acceleration is expected to produce\nstrongly angle-dependent lepton (and hence, emanating radiation) spectra, with\na significantly harder spectrum in the forward direction than viewed from\nlarger off-axis angles, much beyond the regular Doppler boosting effect from a\nco-moving isotropic lepton distribution. This may solve the problem of the need\nfor high (and apparently arbitrarily chosen) minimum Lorentz factors of\nradiating electrons, often plaguing current blazar and GRB jet modeling\nefforts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 02:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-01"}

We also show that surface functionalization of NPs with\nphotosensitive azobenzene groups allows for in situ control of their\ndiffusivity through trans-cis isomerization that changes surface anchoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 05:08:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-23"}

While almost all the ML tools require\nthe input data to be presented as a single table, many datasets are\nmulti-table, which forces data scientists to join those tables first, leading\nto data redundancy and runtime waste. Recent works on \"factorized\" ML mitigate\nthis issue for a few specific ML algorithms by pushing ML through joins. But\ntheir approaches require a manual rewrite of ML implementations. Such piecemeal\nmethods create a massive development overhead when extending such ideas to\nother ML algorithms. In this paper, we show that it is possible to mitigate\nthis overhead by leveraging a popular formal algebra to represent the\ncomputations of many ML algorithms: linear algebra. We introduce a new logical\ndata type to represent normalized data and devise a framework of algebraic\nrewrite rules to convert a large set of linear algebra operations over\ndenormalized data into operations over normalized data. We show how this\nenables us to automatically \"factorize\" several popular ML algorithms, thus\nunifying and generalizing several prior works. We prototype our framework in\nthe popular ML environment R and an industrial R-over-RDBMS tool. Experiments\nwith both synthetic and real normalized data show that our framework also\nyields significant speed-ups, up to 36x on real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 05:41:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2016 04:28:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2016 01:25:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2017 01:25:21 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 2017 04:20:30 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 02:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

A Compton-thick AGN\nobscured with a hydrogen column density of $\\approx 1.3\\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$\nis detected above 10 keV. A spectral fit with a numerical torus model favors a\nlarge half opening angle of the torus, $>41$ degrees, suggesting that the\ncovering fraction of material heavily obscuring the X-ray source is moderate.\nThe intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity is determined to be $\\approx 1.4\\times\n10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which is $\\approx$2.5 times larger than the previous\nestimate using only data below 10 keV with a simple spectral model.

The\nfirst one uses restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and the second one\nautoencoders. RBMs are stacked in layers to form deep belief network (DBN); the\nfinal representation layer is attached to the target to complete the deep\nneural network. Autoencoders are nested one inside the other to form stacked\nautoencoders; once the stcaked autoencoder is learnt the decoder portion is\ndetached and the target attached to the deepest layer of the encoder to form\nthe deep neural network. This work proposes a new approach to train deep neural\nnetworks using dictionary learning as the basic building block; the idea is to\nuse the features from the shallower layer as inputs for training the next\ndeeper layer. One can use any type of dictionary learning (unsupervised,\nsupervised, discriminative etc.) as basic units till the pre-final layer. In\nthe final layer one needs to use the label consistent dictionary learning\nformulation for classification.

However,\nthe microscopic role of oxygen in the write-erase process, i.e., the reversible\nphase transition between crystalline and amorphous state of phase-change\nmaterials is not clear yet. Using oxygen doped GeTe as an example, this work\nunravels the role of oxygen at the atomic scale by means of ab initio total\nenergy calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our main\nfinding is that after the amorphization and the subsequent re-crystallization\nprocess simulated by ab initio molecular dynamics, oxygen will drag one Ge atom\nout of its lattice site and both atoms stay in the interstitial region near the\nTe vacancy that was originally occupied by the oxygen, forming a\n\"dumbbell-like\" defect (O-VTe-Ge), which is in sharp contrast to the results of\nab initio total energy calculations at 0 K showing that the oxygen prefers to\nsubstitute Te in crystalline GeTe.

Currently, the predominant Bayesian\ncomputation approach is convex optimisation, which scales very efficiently to\nhigh dimensional image models and delivers accurate point estimation results.\nHowever, in order to perform more complex analyses, for example image\nuncertainty quantification or model selection, it is necessary to use more\ncomputationally intensive Bayesian computation techniques such as Markov chain\nMonte Carlo methods. This paper presents a new and highly efficient Markov\nchain Monte Carlo methodology to perform Bayesian computation for high\ndimensional models that are log-concave and non-smooth, a class of models that\nis central in imaging sciences. The methodology is based on a regularised\nunadjusted Langevin algorithm that exploits tools from convex analysis, namely\nMoreau-Yoshida envelopes and proximal operators, to construct Markov chains\nwith favourable convergence properties. In addition to scaling efficiently to\nhigh dimensions, the method is straightforward to apply to models that are\ncurrently solved by using proximal optimisation algorithms. We provide a\ndetailed theoretical analysis of the proposed methodology, including asymptotic\nand non-asymptotic convergence results with easily verifiable conditions, and\nexplicit bounds on the convergence rates. The proposed methodology is\ndemonstrated with four experiments related to image deconvolution and\ntomographic reconstruction with total-variation and $\\ell_1$ priors, where we\nconduct a range of challenging Bayesian analyses related to uncertainty\nquantification, hypothesis testing, and model selection in the absence of\nground truth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 07:31:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-23"}

We conducted a multiwavelength six-month campaign to observe the\nnearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469 with several observatories in order to better\nunderstand and quantify the outflow in this AGN. We report on the\ntime-integrated line-resolved X-ray spectrum of NGC 7469 obtained with the\nReflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) on board XMM-Newton. We use the RGS\nspectrum to discern the many AGN outflow components. A global fit is applied to\nobtain their physical parameters. We find that the AGN wind can be well\ndescribed by three narrow velocity components at -650, -950, and -2050 km/s.\nThe RGS clearly resolves the -20 50 km/s component in C5+ Ly$\\alpha$, while the\n-650 km/s and -950 km/s velocities are blended. Similar velocities are resolved\nin the UV. The H-equivalent column densities of these components are,\nrespectively, NH = 7x10^20, 2.2x10^21, and 10^20 cm^-2, for a total of 3x10^21\ncm^-2. The -650 km/s component shows a broad ionisation distribution. We\nidentify a photo-ionised emission component blue-shifted by -450 km/s which we\nascribe to the same outflow that produces the absorption lines. The elemental\nabundance ratios of C, N, Ne, S, and Fe to O in the outflow tend to be between\n1 - 2 times solar. Preliminary estimates of the absorber distance from the AGN\ncenter suggest it is at least a few pc away from the center, but more advanced\nmethods need to be applied in order to obtain better constraints. The complex\nX-ray spectrum of NGC 7469 demonstrates the richness of high energy phenomena\ntaking place in AGN cores. The subtle spectroscopic differences between the\nvarious components require deep, high-resolution observations, such as the\npresent RGS spectrum, if one is to resolve them and perform quantitative plasma\ndiagnostics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 09:56:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Dec 2016 10:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

Here, we present a proof-of-principle\nrealization of a resonator network consisting of two high-quality nanostring\nresonators, coupled mechanically by a shared support. First, we demonstrate\nthat we can control the fundamental mode frequencies of both nanostrings\nindependently by a strong drive tone resonant with one of the higher harmonics\nof the network, rendering local control gates redundant. The tuning mechanism\nrelies on an effective increase of the pre-stress in a highly excited\nnanostring, known as geometric nonlinearity. Using this selective frequency\ncontrol of the individual nanomechanical resonators, we investigate the\ncoherent dynamics of the resonator network, which is a classical model system\nshowing several of the characteristic features of strongly coupled quantum\nsystems. In particular, we demonstrate mode splitting, classical Rabi\noscillations, as well as adiabatic and diabatic transitions between the coupled\nstates representing the classical analog of Landau-Zener tunneling.

It showed extreme outbursts on June 2015, characterized by a\nlarge amplitude and short time variation of flux in the radio, optical, and\nX-ray bands. Not only disk emission, but also synchrotron radiation from the\nrelativistic jets were suggested by radio observations. However, it is\ndifficult to measure the accurate spectral shape in the optical/near infrared\nband because there are uncertainties of interstellar extinction.\n  To estimate the extinction value for V404 Cygni, we performed\nphotopolarimetric and spectroscopic observations of V404 Cygni and nearby field\nstars. Here, we estimate the Galactic extinction using interstellar\npolarization based on the observation that the origin of the optical\npolarization is the interstellar medium, and investigate the properties of\ninterstellar polarization around V404~Cygni. We found a good correlation\nbetween the color excess and polarization degree in the field stars. We also\nconfirmed that the wavelength dependence of the polarization degree in the\nhighly polarized field stars was similar to that of V404~Cygni. Using the\nhighly polarized field stars, we estimated the color excess and the extinction,\n$E(B-V)=1.2 \\pm 0.2$ and $3.0 < A(V) < 3.6$, respectively. A tendency for a\nbluer peak of polarization ($\\lambda_{\\rm max}<5500$ \\AA) was commonly seen in\nthe highly polarized field stars, suggesting that the dust grains toward this\nregion are generally smaller than the Galactic average. The corrected spectral\nenergy distribution of V404~Cygni in the near infrared (NIR) and optical bands\nin our results indicated a spectral break between $2.5 \\times 10^{14}$ Hz and\n$3.7 \\times 10^{14}$ Hz, which might be originated in the synchrotron self\nabsorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 10:03:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

On the side of\ndefinable groups, we prove for example that if $G$ is definable in a model $M$,\nand $G$ is definably amenable, then the connected components ${G^{*}}^{00}_{M}$\nand ${G^{*}}^{000}_{M}$ coincide, answering positively a question from an\nearlier paper of the authors.\n  We also take the opportunity to further develop the model-theoretic approach\nto topological dynamics, obtaining for example some new invariants for\ntopological groups, as well as allowing a uniform approach to the theorems\nabove and the various categories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 12:03:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jan 2019 20:37:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-11"}

However, this information is implicitly available in the work of\nVanlessen, based on a non-linear steepest descent analysis of an associated\nso-called Riemann--Hilbert problem. We will extend this work and show how to\nefficiently compute an arbitrary number of higher-order terms in the asymptotic\nexpansions of Laguerre and Laguerre-type polynomials. This effort is similar to\nthe case of Jacobi and Jacobi-type polynomials in a previous paper. We supply\nan implementation with explicit expansions in four different regions of the\ncomplex plane. These expansions can also be extended to Hermite-type weights of\nthe form $\\exp(-\\sum_{k=0}^m q_k x^{2k})$ on $(-\\infty,\\infty)$, and to general\nnon-polynomial functions $Q(x)$ using contour integrals. The expansions may be\nused, e.g., to compute Gauss-Laguerre quadrature rules in a lower computational\ncomplexity than based on the recurrence relation, and with improved accuracy\nfor large degree. They are also of interest in random matrix theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 12:36:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-16"}

The\nreconnection process proceeds in several stages: first, a linear tearing mode\nwith $N$ magnetic islands grows and saturates, and then the $X$-points between\nthese islands collapse into secondary current sheets, which then reconnect\nuntil the original structure is destroyed.

A given quantum state is considered\nto be steerable if it violates a suitably chosen steering inequality. A quantum\nstate which otherwise satisfies a certain inequality can violate the inequality\nunder a global change of basis i.e, if the state is transformed by a nonlocal\nunitary operation. Intriguingly there are states which preserve their\nnon-violation(pertaining to the said inequality) under any global unitary\noperation. The present work explores the effect of global unitary operations on\nthe steering ability of a quantum state which live in two qubits. We\ncharacterize such states in terms of a necessary and sufficient condition on\ntheir spectrum. Such states are also characterized in terms of some analytic\ncharacteristics of the set to which they belong. Looking back at steerability\nthe present work also provides a relation between steerability and quantum\nteleportation together with the derivation of a result related to the optimal\nviolation of steering inequality . An analytic estimation of the size of such\nnon-violating states in terms of purity is also obtained.

To solve the confusion between water and low-reflectance objects,\nthe Landsat 8 time series with two shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands is added\nbecause water has extremely strong absorption in SWIR.

These are 1, 2 and 4, the elements which define the\nunique attracting cycle, as hypothesised by Collatz.

It is worthwhile to\nmention that an interacting Chaplygin gas model was considered in 2006 by Zhang\nand Zhu, nevertheless, analytic solutions for the continuity equations could\nnot be determined assuming an interaction proportional to $H$ times the sum of\nthe energy densities of Chaplygin gas and dust.

The future of the interactive world depends on the future Internet\nof Things (IoT). Software-defined networking (SDN) technology, a new paradigm\nin the networking area, can be useful in creating an IoT because it can handle\ninteractivity by controlling physical devices, transmission of data among them,\nand data acquisition. However, digital signage can be one of the promising\ntechnologies in this era of technology that is progressing toward the\ninteractive world, connecting users to the IoT network through device-to-device\ncommunication technology. This article illustrates a novel prototype that is\nmainly focused on a smart digital signage system comprised of software-defined\nIoT (SD-IoT) and invisible image sensor communication technology. We have\nproposed an SDN scheme with a view to initiating its flexibility and\ncompatibility for an IoT network-based smart digital signage system. The idea\nof invisible communication can make the users of the technology trendier to it,\nand the usage of unused resources such as images and videos can be ensured. In\naddition, this communication has paved the way for interactivity between the\nuser and digital signage, where the digital signage and the camera of a\nsmartphone can be operated as a transmitter and a receiver, respectively. The\nproposed scheme might be applicable to real-world applications because SDN has\nthe flexibility to adapt with the alteration of network status without any\nhardware modifications while displays and smartphones are available everywhere.\nA performance analysis of this system showed the advantages of an SD-IoT\nnetwork over an Internet protocol-based IoT network considering a queuing\nanalysis for a dynamic link allocation process in the case of user access to\nthe IoT network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 17:42:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-20"}

This makes the grid vulnerable to demand fluctuations and\nmuch effort has been invested to mitigate their effect. The Digital Power\nNetwork (DPN) is an energy-on-demand approach to power grids. In the new\n(digital) approach, the user initiates an energy request. This action\nalleviates uncertainties in energy demands. The service provider may grant the\nrequest fully or partially. Energy is then transmitted in discrete units,\nanalogous to packets of data over a computer network. The packetized energy is\nrouted to the user address. Because energy demands are known ahead of time, the\nenergy provider may optimize the power distribution of the entire power network\nand isolate pockets of instabilities. For example, under severe energy\nconstraints the energy provider may queue some energy requests and grant these\nrequests later. Alternative energy resources may be seamlessly incorporated\ninto the power network as yet another address in the system and since their\nenergy is coded, they would be connected to specific users directly. In its\nsimplest form, this grid can be realized by overlaying an auxiliary\n(communication) network on top of an energy delivery network (the current\ntransmission lines) and coupling the two through an array of addressable\ndigital power switches. Optimization of energy requests is the topic of this\npaper. We investigate the role of the network queue and provide a snapshot of\nits behavior in time. The DPN with a limited channel capacity and the optimal\npath for energy flow in a standard IEEE 39 bus are considered, as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 15:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-09"}
