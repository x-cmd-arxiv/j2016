A subset of nodes S is a k-plex if the degree of every node in the\nassociated induced subgraph is at least |S|-k. The maximum edge-weight k-plex\npartitioning (Max-EkPP) problem is to find a k-plex partition with maximum\ntotal weight, where the partition's weight is the sum of the weights on the\nedges in the solution. When k=1, all components in the partition are cliques\nand the problem becomes the well-known maximum edge-weight clique partitioning\n(Max-ECP). However, and to our best knowledge, when k>1, the problem has never\nbeen modeled. Actually, the literature on the k-plex addresses the search for a\nsingle component in an unweighted graph. We propose a polynomial size integer\nlinear programming formulation for the Max-EkPP problem and consider the\ninclusion of additional topological constraints in the model. These constraints\ninvolve lower and upper limit capacity bounds in each component and upper bound\nconstraints on the number of components in the final solution.

We address the optimization of transmit\nstrategies from both the game theoretical and the network utility maximization\n(NUM) perspectives and show that they can be unified in a generalized Nash\nequilibrium problem (GNEP) framework. Specifically, the small cell network\ndesign is first formulated as a GNEP, where the SBSs and MBS compete for the\nspectral resources by maximizing their own rates while satisfying global\nquality of service (QoS) constraints. We analyze the GNEP via variational\ninequality theory and propose distributed algorithms, which only require the\nbroadcasting of some pricing information, to achieve a generalized Nash\nequilibrium (GNE). Then, we also consider a nonconvex NUM problem that aims to\nmaximize the sum rate of all BSs subject to global QoS constraints.

The convergence of the proposed algorithms is proved and guaranteed\nfor properly chosen algorithm parameters.

In this picture, dark matter arises as a\nresponse to the standard model of particle physics from the delocalized degrees\nof freedom that build up the dark energy component of the Universe. Dark matter\nphysics is then regulated by a characteristic acceleration scale $a_0$,\nidentified with the radius of the (quasi)-de Sitter universe we inhabit. For a\npoint particle matter source, or outside an extended spherically symmetric\nobject, MOND's empirical fitting formula is recovered. However, Verlinde's\ntheory critically departs from MOND when considering the inner structure of\ngalaxies, differing by a factor of 2 at the centre of a regular massive body.\nFor illustration, we use the eight classical dwarf spheroidal satellites of the\nMilky Way. These objects are perfect testbeds for the model given their\napproximate spherical symmetry, measured kinematics, and identified missing\nmass. We show that, without the assumption of a maximal deformation, Verlinde's\ntheory can fit the velocity dispersion profile in dwarf spheroidals with no\nfurther need of an extra dark particle component. If a maximal deformation is\nconsidered, the theory leads to mass-to-light ratios that are marginally larger\nthan expected from stellar population and formation history studies. We also\ncompare our results with the recent phenomenological interpolating MOND\nfunction of McGaugh {\\it et al}, and find a departure that, for these galaxies,\nis consistent with the scatter in current observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2016 17:34:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2018 14:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-20"}

This paper presents a\ncomprehensive study of the effective elastic behavior of this composite\nmaterial by three multi-scale models accounting for different microstructural\ncontents: two mean-field models and a full-field finite element model. As the\nspecimens exhibit many characteristic scales, several scale transition steps\nare carried out iteratively from the grain scale to the macro-scale. The\ngeneral agreement among the model responses allows suggesting the best strategy\nto estimate the effective behavior of Cu-Nb wires and save computational time.\nThe importance of crystallographical and morphological textures in various\ncases is discussed.

It combines two schemes: a transaction is\nexecuted either optimistically by only one service replica in the deferred\nupdate mode (DU), or deterministically by all replicas in the state machine\nmode (SM); the choice is made by an oracle. The DU mode allows for parallelism\nand thus takes advantage of multicore hardware. In contrast to DU, the SM mode\nguarantees abort-free execution, so it is suitable for irrevocable operations\nand transactions generating high contention. For expressiveness, transactions\ncan be discarded or retried on demand. We formally prove that the higher\nflexibility of the scheme does not come at the cost of weaker guarantees for\nclients: HTR satisfies strong consistency guarantees akin to those provided by\nother popular transactional replication schemes such as Deferred Update\nReplication. We developed HTR-enabled Paxos STM, an object-based distributed\ntransactional memory system, and evaluated it thoroughly under various\nworkloads. We show the benefits of using a novel oracle, which relies on\nmachine learning techniques for automatic adaptation to changing conditions. In\nour tests, the ML-based oracle provides up to 50% improvement in throughput\nwhen compared to the system running with DU-only or SM-only oracles.

Teleconnections arise from complex\ninteractions between the atmosphere and ocean, of which the El Nino--Southern\nOscillation teleconnection is a well-known example.

We consider many different ans\\\"{a}tze for both\nthe functional form of $c(z)$ (which cannot be fixed by theoretical\nmotivations) and for the dark energy dynamics, in order to have a clear global\npicture from which we extract the results.

We find that the\npresent cosmological data is perfectly compatible with any of these VSL\nscenarios, but in one case (Moffat model) we have a higher Bayesian Evidence\nratio in favour of VSL than in the standard $c=$ constant $\\Lambda$CDM\nscenario. Moreover, in such a scenario, the VSL signal can help to strengthen\nconstraints on the spatial curvature (with indication toward an open universe),\nto clarify some properties of dark energy (exclusion of a cosmological constant\nat $2\\sigma$ level) and is also falsifiable in the nearest future due to some\npeculiar issues which differentiate this model from the standard model.\nFinally, we have applied some priors which come from cosmology and, in\nparticular, from information theory and gravitational thermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2016 20:54:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 10:54:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

We perform a suite\nof hydrodynamic simulations of the complex interplay between fragmentation,\nprotostellar accretion, and merging inside dark matter minihaloes. Instead of\nthe traditional sink particle method, we employ a stiff equation of state\napproach, so that we can more robustly ascertain the viscous transport inside\nthe disc. The simulations show inside-out fragmentation because the gas\ncollapses faster in the central region. Fragments migrate on the viscous\ntimescale, over which angular momentum is lost, enabling them to move towards\nthe disc centre, where merging with the primary protostar can occur. This\nprocess depends on the fragmentation scale, such that there is a maximum scale\nof $(1 - 5) \\times 10^4$ au, inside which fragments can migrate to the primary\nprotostar. Viscous transport is active until radiative feedback from the\nprimary protostar destroys the accretion disc. The final mass spectrum and\nmultiplicity thus crucially depends on the effect of viscosity in the disc. The\nentire disc is subjected to efficient viscous transport in the primordial case\nwith viscous parameter $\\alpha \\le 1$.

The first\npart of this paper provides a similar representation for the space of\nintegrable functions on a bounded subset of Euclidean space: The weakest\nrepresentation rendering integration over boxes is polynomial-time computable.\nIn contrast to the representation of continuous functions, however, this\nrepresentation turns out to be discontinuous with respect to both the norm and\nthe weak topology. The second part modifies the representation to be continuous\nand generalizes it to Lp-spaces. The arising representations are proven to be\ncomputably equivalent to the standard representations of these spaces as metric\nspaces and to still render integration polynomial-time computable.

PARTICIPANTS: 55 Fovea-centered\nSpectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography volumes from eleven subjects were\nanalyzed, obtained from Cirrus HD-OCT, RS-3000, Heidelberg Spectralis, RTVue\nand Topcon2000, seven subjects with retinal diseases and four normal controls.\nMETHOD: The Iowa Reference Algorithm measured total retinal thickness.\nNonlinear model of total retinal thickness measurement comparisons was derived\nand used for device-specific comparisons.

Often the text can be\nread simply by looking at individual wavelengths, but in some cases the images\nneed further enhancement to maximise the chances of reading the text. There are\nmany possible enhancement techniques and this paper assesses and compares an\nextended set of dimensionality reduction methods for image processing. We\nassess 15 dimensionality reduction methods in two different manuscripts. This\nassessment was performed both subjectively by asking the opinions of scholars\nwho were experts in the languages used in the manuscripts which of the\ntechniques they preferred and also by using the Davies-Bouldin and Dunn indexes\nfor assessing the quality of the resulted image clusters. We found that the\nCanonical Variates Analysis (CVA) method which was using a Matlab\nimplementation and we have used previously to enhance multispectral images, it\nwas indeed superior to all the other tested methods. However it is very likely\nthat other approaches will be more suitable in specific circumstance so we\nwould still recommend that a range of these techniques are tried.

We complement the complexity result by showing that the problem\nadmits efficient algorithms if any of the following parameters are bounded: (1)\nnumber of voters (2) number of candidates (3) maximum number of candidates\napproved by a voter (4) maximum number of voters approving a given candidate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 01:23:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 22:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-24"}

It\nis known that the tripartite-to-bipartite SLOCC convertibility is characterized\nby the maximal Schmidt rank of the given tripartite state, i.e. the largest\nSchmidt rank over those bipartite states lying in the support of the reduced\ndensity operator. In this paper, we further study this problem and exhibit\nnovel results in both multi-copy and asymptotic settings. In the multi-copy\nregime, we observe that the maximal Schmidt rank is strictly\nsuper-multiplicative, i.e. the maximal Schmidt rank of the tensor product of\ntwo tripartite pure states can be strictly larger than the product of their\nmaximal Schmidt ranks. We then provide a full characterization of those\ntripartite states whose maximal Schmidt rank is strictly super-multiplicative\nwhen taking tensor product with itself. In the asymptotic setting, we focus on\ndetermining the tripartite-to-bipartite SLOCC entanglement transformation rate,\nwhich turns out to be equivalent to computing the asymptotic maximal Schmidt\nrank of the tripartite state, defined as the regularization of its maximal\nSchmidt rank. Despite the difficulty caused by the super-multiplicative\nproperty, we provide explicit formulas for evaluating the asymptotic maximal\nSchmidt ranks of two important families of tripartite pure states, by resorting\nto certain results of the structure of matrix spaces, including the study of\nmatrix semi-invariants. These formulas give a sufficient and necessary\ncondition to determine whether a given tripartite pure state can be transformed\nto the bipartite maximally entangled state under SLOCC, in the asymptotic\nsetting.

A recent technique called\npiecewise flat embeddings (PFE) has been proposed for use in image\nsegmentation; PFE transforms image pixel data into a lower dimensional\nrepresentation where similar pixels are pulled close together and dissimilar\npixels are pushed apart. This technique has shown promising results, but its\noriginal formulation is not computationally feasible for large images.

The free fluid available\nwithin the droplets controls the transmission of stress during droplet\ncombination and allows connections to occur via formation of a neck between the\ndroplets. The anisotropy of three-droplet systems adds complexity to the\nsymmetric case of two-droplet aggregates because of the multiplicity of\norientations possible for the third droplet. When elasticity dominates, the\ninitial orientation of the third droplet is preserved in the triplet's final\nshape. When elasticity is dominated by the interfacial driving force, the final\nshape can deviate strongly from the initial positioning of droplets. Movement\nof the third droplet to a more compact packing occurs, driven by liquid\nmeniscus expansion that minimizes the surface energy of the triplet. A range of\ncompositions and orientations are examined and the resulting domains of\nrestructuring and stability are mapped based on the final triplet structure. A\ngeometric and a physical model are used to explain the mechanism driving\nmeniscus-induced restructuring and are related to the impact of these phenomena\non multiple droplet emulsions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 03:07:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

Such\nsuccessful channel estimation builds upon the assumption that the channel can\nbe sparsely represented under some basis/dictionary.

The learned dictionary\nadapts specifically to the cell characteristics and promotes a more efficient\nand robust channel representation, which in turn improves the performance of\nthe channel estimation. Furthermore, we extend the dictionary learning based\nchannel model into a joint uplink/downlink learning framework by observing the\nreciprocity of the AOA/AOD between the uplink/downlink transmission, and\npropose a joint channel estimation algorithm that combines the uplink and\ndownlink received training signals to obtain a more accurate channel estimate.\nIn other words, the downlink training overhead, which is a bottleneck in FDD\nMassive MIMO system, can be reduced by utilizing the information from simpler\nuplink training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 09:05:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 07:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-01"}

The origin of the gas in these hybrid disks is\nstrongly debated and the current sample is too sparse to understand this\nphenomenon. More detections are necessary to increase the statistics on this\npopulation. Lying at the final stages of evolution of proto-planetary disks and\nat the beginning of the debris disk phase, these objects could provide new\ninsight into the processes involved in the making of planetary systems. We\ncarried out a deep survey of the 12CO(2-1) and 12CO(3-2) lines with the APEX\nand IRAM radiotelescopes in young debris disks selected according to hybrid\ndisk properties. The survey is complemented with a bibliographic study of the\nratio between the emission of the gas and the continuum (S_CO/F_cont) in CTTS,\nHerbig Ae, WTTS, hybrid, and debris disks. Our sub-mm survey comprises 25\nstars, including 17 new targets, and we increase the sensitivity limit by a\nfactor 2 on eight sources compared to similar published studies.

Although various\nversions of DVM have been developed, their performance, in terms of accuracy\nand computational efficiency, is yet to be compreheively studied in the whole\nflow regime. Here, the traditional third-order time-implicit Godunov DVM (GDVM)\nand the recently developed discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme (DUGKS) are\nanalysed in finding steady-state solutions of the force-driven Poiseuille and\nlid-driven cavity flows. With the molecular collision and free streaming being\ntreated simultaneously, the DUGKS preserves the second-order accuracy in the\nspatial and temporal discretizations in all flow regimes. Towards the\nhydrodynamic flow regime, the DUGKS is not only faster than the GDVM when using\nthe same spatial mesh, but also requires less spatial resolution than that of\nthe GDVM to achieve the same numerical accuracy. From the slip to free\nmolecular flow regimes, however, the DUGKS is slower than the GDVM, due to the\ncomplicated flux evaluation and the time step is less than the maximum\neffective time step of the GDVM. Therefore, the DUGKS is preferable for\nproblems involving different flow regimes, particularly when the hydrodynamic\nflow regime is dominant. For highly rarefied gas flows, if the steady-state\nsolution is concerned, the implicit DVM, which can boost the convergence\nsignificantly, is a better choice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 10:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

Most existing approaches employ hand-crafted\nappearance features, such as HOG or Color Names. Recently, deep RGB features\nextracted from convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied for\ntracking. Despite their success, these features only capture appearance\ninformation. On the other hand, motion cues provide discriminative and\ncomplementary information that can improve tracking performance. Contrary to\nvisual tracking, deep motion features have been successfully applied for action\nrecognition and video classification tasks. Typically, the motion features are\nlearned by training a CNN on optical flow images extracted from large amounts\nof labeled videos.\n  This paper presents an investigation of the impact of deep motion features in\na tracking-by-detection framework. We further show that hand-crafted, deep RGB,\nand deep motion features contain complementary information. To the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to propose fusing appearance information with deep\nmotion features for visual tracking.

The control and generation of SPCs are demonstrated\nnumerically for ac transport in both transient and ac regime. Our results are\nrobust against edge imperfections and generally valid for other QSH insulators\nsuch as silicene and germanene, etc. These findings establish a novel route for\ngenerating SPCs by purely electrical means and open the door for new\napplications of semiconductor spintronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 12:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

Recently, Yamanaka et al.\n(2016) reported a near-infrared (NIR) excess for SN 2012dn, and proposed that\nthe excess originates from an echo by circumstellar (CS) dust. In this paper,\nwe examine a detailed distribution of the CS dust around SN 2012dn, and\ninvestigate implications of the CS dust echo scenario for general cases of\nSC-SNe Ia. We find that a disk/bipolar CS medium configuration reproduces the\nNIR excess fairly well, where the radial density distribution is given by a\nstationary mass loss.

The\nmass-loss rate of the progenitor system is estimated to be $1.2 \\times 10^{-5}$\nand $3.2 \\times 10^{-6}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the disk and bipolar CS\nmedium configurations, respectively, which adds another support for the single\ndegenerate scenario. Our models limit SN 2009dc, another SC-SN Ia, to have a\ndust mass less than $0.16$ times that of SN 2012dn. While this may merely\nindicate some variation on the CS environment among SC-SNe Ia, this could raise\nanother interesting possibility.

Specifically, when a source node is\nallowed to access the shared spectrum for data transmissions, another source is\nopportunistically selected in the spectrum sharing system to transmit an\nartificial noise for disrupting the eavesdropper without affecting the\nlegitimate transmissions.

Is presented a\ntemporal rate model for describing the charge transport properties of the cell.\nCalculations are carried out by solving the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation applying the time evolution operator within a pertinent choice of the\nnon-commuting kinetic and potential operators. The efficiency in the generation\nof current is analyzed directly by studying the occupation of the subbands\nwells in the p-i-n junction, taking into account the injection and draining\ndynamic provided by the electrical contacts connected to the cell. As a result,\nthe efficiency in the generation of current was found to be directly correlated\nto the relationship between optical generation and recombination rates\nregarding to the scattering to the ratchet state rate. This suggests that a\ngood coupling between the intermediate band and the additional band is a key\npoint to be analyzed when developing an efficient solar cell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 14:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

When d is large, this task is challenged by the so-called curse\nof dimensionality. As a typical example, standard polynomial spaces, such as\nthose of total degree type, are often uneffective to reach a prescribed\naccuracy unless a prohibitive number of evaluations is invested. In recent\nyears it has been shown that, for certain relevant applications, there are\nsubstantial advantages in using certain sparse polynomial spaces having\nanisotropic features with respect to the different variables. These\napplications include in particular the numerical approximation of\nhigh-dimensional parametric and stochastic partial differential equations. We\nstart by surveying several results in this direction, with an emphasis on the\nnumerical algorithms that are available for the construction of the\napproximation, in particular through interpolation or discrete least-squares\nfitting. All such algorithms rely on the assumption that the set of\nmulti-indices associated with the polynomial space is downward closed.

In many real-world tasks, designing a reward function takes considerable\nhand engineering and often requires additional sensors to be installed just to\nmeasure whether the task has been executed successfully. Furthermore, many\ninteresting tasks consist of multiple implicit intermediate steps that must be\nexecuted in sequence. Even when the final outcome can be measured, it does not\nnecessarily provide feedback on these intermediate steps. To address these\nissues, we propose leveraging the abstraction power of intermediate visual\nrepresentations learned by deep models to quickly infer perceptual reward\nfunctions from small numbers of demonstrations. We present a method that is\nable to identify key intermediate steps of a task from only a handful of\ndemonstration sequences, and automatically identify the most discriminative\nfeatures for identifying these steps. This method makes use of the features in\na pre-trained deep model, but does not require any explicit specification of\nsub-goals. The resulting reward functions can then be used by an RL agent to\nlearn to perform the task in real-world settings.

This system connects the wires\nof the gating grid to its driver via low impedance transmission lines. When the\ngating grid is open, all wires have the same voltage allowing drift electrons,\nproduced by the ionization of the detector gas molecules, to pass through to\nthe anode wires. When the grid is closed, the wires have alternating higher and\nlower voltages causing the drift electrons to terminate at the more positive\nwires. Rapid opening of the gating grid with low pickup noise is achieved by\nquickly shorting the positive and negative wires to attain the average bias\npotential with N-type and P-type MOSFET switches. The circuit analysis and\nsimulation software SPICE shows that the driver restores the gating grid\nvoltage to 90% of the opening voltage in less than 0.20 $\\mu$s. When tested in\nthe experimental environment of a time projection chamber larger termination\nresistors were chosen so that the driver opens the gating grid in 0.35 $\\mu$s.\nIn each case, opening time is basically characterized by the RC constant given\nby the resistance of the switches and terminating resistors and the capacitance\nof the gating grid and its transmission line. By adding a second pair of N-type\nand P-type MOSFET switches, the gating grid is closed by restoring 99% of the\noriginal charges to the wires within 3 $\\mu$s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 15:28:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}

A\ncritical aspect of the activity of an enzyme is the thermal fluctuations of its\nsolvation or hydration shell. Thermal fluctuations are also known to be\ndirectly related to membrane permeability. Here solvation shell changes of\nlipid membranes subject to an acoustic impulse were investigated using a\nfluorescence probe, Laurdan. Laurdan was embedded in multi-lamellar lipid\nvesicles in water, which were exposed to broadband pressure impulses of the\norder of 1MPa peak amplitude and 10{\\mu}s pulse duration. An instrument was\ndeveloped to monitor changes in the emission spectrum of the dye at two\nwavelengths with sub-microsecond temporal resolution. The experiments show that\nchanges in the emission spectrum, and hence the fluctuations of the solvation\nshell, are related to the changes in the thermodynamic state of the membrane\nand correlated with the compression and rarefaction of the incident sound wave.\nThe results suggest that acoustic fields affect the state of a lipid membrane\nand therefore can potentially modulate the kinetics of channels and proteins\nembedded in the membrane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 15:38:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2016 17:25:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 12:08:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2018 14:29:11 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 7 Nov 2018 01:56:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-19"}

(2) We also show that we can not have an analytic solution of\n$f(\\mathcal{R})$ for all values of tangential velocity including the observed\nvalue of tangential velocity $200-300$Km/s if the radial coefficient of the\nmetric which describes the dark matter regions is \\emph{not a constant}.

While the FHD formulation is\nformally described by stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs), it\nbecomes similar to the reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) description\nwhen those SPDEs are spatially discretized and reactions are modeled as a\nsource term having Poisson fluctuations. However, unlike the RDME, the FHD\ndescription naturally extends from the regime where fluctuations are strong,\ni.e., each hydrodynamic cell has few (reactive) molecules, to regimes with\nmoderate or weak fluctuations, and ultimately to the deterministic limit. By\ntreating diffusion implicitly, we avoid the severe restriction on time step\nsize that limits all methods based on explicit treatments of diffusion, and\nconstruct numerical methods that are more efficient than RDME methods, without\ncompromising accuracy. We find that an implicit midpoint tau leaping scheme\nattains second-order weak accuracy for the linearized FHD, and gives an\naccurate and stable structure factor for a time step size an order of magnitude\nlarger than the hopping time scale of diffusing molecules. We study the\nnumerical accuracy of our methods for the Schl\\\"ogl reaction-diffusion model\nboth in and out of thermodynamic equilibrium.

However, all the astronomical answers have detailed\nrefutations, and general disproofs, so all the astronomical answers for the\nStar are dead.\n  In 1999, Michael Molnar put forth a completely new solution, where the Star\noriginated as a report of a natal horoscope for 17 April 6 BC. This natal\nhoroscope shows very impressive regal portents and points to Judea. It is very\nimprobable that such a very rare planet configuration (averaging only once per\nmillennium or longer) would coincide with the very restricted day of Jesus'\nbirth (springtime in a year shortly before Herod's death in 4 BC), unless there\nis some causal connection. The Magi (as labeled by the gospel author) were\nastrologers, so they were only interested in horoscopes. The astrological\nsolution is further supported by the presence of an astrological technical term\n('in the east' meaning what astronomers call the 'heliacal rise') in the\nNativity narrative of Matthew. Importantly, Molnar has only identified the Star\nas originating from a particular natal horoscope, while making no statement\nabout the nature or historicity of any of the other elements of the story in\nMatthew. So for example, the Magi might be astrologers as idealized by the\nGreeks of the time, or they might have been non-existent (invented by a\nlatter-day Greek seeking omens for the birth of a great king), and they might\nhave arrived on 17 April 6 BC or months later, and they might or might not have\nbeen three in numbers with given names. But for the Star of Bethlehem alone,\nMolnar's astrological solution is convincing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2016 19:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-23"}

Within such a scenario, the interactions involving the\nvirtual gluon and constituent quark degrees of freedom of hadrons are deduced\nfrom the Green functions of Laplace operators on the $dS_4$ geodesics. Then the\nconformal symmetry of QCD emerges as a direct consequence of the conformal\nsymmetry of the $dS_4$ space-time, while the color confinement, understood as\ncolorlessness of hadrons, appears as a consequence of the inevitable charge\nneutrality of the unique closed space-like manifold, the three dimensional\nhyper-sphere $S^3$, on whose geodesics the hadron's constituents are\nconjectured to reside when near rest frame.\n  Mesons are now modelled as quarkish color-anticolor dipoles, whose free\nquantum motions on the aforementioned $S^3$ geodesic are perturbed by a\npotential generated by a gluon--anti-gluon color dipole. The potential\npredicted presents itself as the color charge analogue to the \"curved\" Coulomb\npotential, i.e. to the electric potential that defines a consistent\nelectrostatic theory on a hyper-spherical surface. The advantage of this method\nis that it allows to establish a direct relationship of the potential\nparameters to the fundamental constants of QCD.
