Most traditional tracking methods set the\nparameters or templates to track target objects in advance and should be\nmodified accordingly. Thus, we propose a new and robust tracking method using a\nFully Convolutional Network (FCN) to obtain an object probability map and\nDynamic Programming (DP) to seek the globally optimal path through all frames\nof video. Our proposed method solves the object appearance variation problem\nwith the use of a FCN and deals with occlusion by DP.

The TRIP effect leads to\nenhanced work-hardening rate, postponed onset of necking and excellent\nformability. In-situ transmission electron microscopy has been performed to\nsystematically investigate the dynamic interactions between dislocations and\nalpha martensite at microscale. Local stress concentrations, e.g. from notches\nor dislocation pile-ups, render free edges and grain boundaries favorable\nnucleation sites for alpha martensite. Its growth leads to partial dislocation\nemission on two independent slip planes from the hetero-interface when the\naustenite matrix is initially free of dislocations. The kinematic analysis\nreveals that activating slip systems on two independent {111} planes of\naustenite are necessary in accommodating the interfacial mismatch strain. Full\ndislocation emission is generally observed inside of austenite regions that\ncontain high density of dislocations. In both situations, phase boundary\npropagation generates large amounts of dislocations entering into the matrix,\nwhich renders the total deformation compatible and provide substantial strain\nhardening of the host phase. These moving dislocation sources enable plastic\nrelaxation and prevent local damage accumulation by intense slipping on the\nsofter side of the interfacial region. Thus, finely dispersed martensite\ndistribution renders plastic deformation more uniform throughout the austenitic\nmatrix, which explains the exceptional combination of strength and ductility of\nTRIP steels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Dec 2016 18:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

While commonly used interval procedures\nbased on such a model have the nominal coverage rate on average across a\npopulation of groups, their actual coverage rate for a given group will be\nabove or below the nominal rate, depending on the value of the group mean.\nAlternatively, a coverage rate that is constant as a function of a group's mean\ncan be simply achieved by using a standard $t$-interval, based on data only\nfrom that group. The standard $t$-interval, however, fails to share information\nacross the groups and is therefore not adaptive to easily obtained information\nabout the distribution of group-specific means.\n  In this article we construct confidence intervals that have a constant\nfrequentist coverage rate and that make use of information about across-group\nheterogeneity, resulting in constant-coverage intervals that are narrower than\nstandard $t$-intervals on average across groups. Such intervals are constructed\nby inverting biased tests for the mean of a normal population. Given a prior\ndistribution on the mean, Bayes-optimal biased tests can be inverted to form\nBayes-optimal confidence intervals with frequentist coverage that is constant\nas a function of the mean. In the context of multiple groups, the prior\ndistribution is replaced by a model of across-group heterogeneity.

The essential idea is to combine our multiscale\nrigidity functions with persistent homology analysis, so as to construct a\nseries of multiscale persistent functions, particularly multiscale persistent\nentropies, for structure characterization. To clarify the fundamental idea of\nour method, the multiscale persistent entropy model is discussed in great\ndetail. Mathematically, unlike the previous persistent entropy or topological\nentropy, a special resolution parameter is incorporated into our model. Various\nscales can be achieved by tuning its value. Physically, our multiscale\npersistent entropy can be used in conformation entropy evaluation. More\nspecifically, it is found that our method incorporates in it a natural\nclassification scheme. This is achieved through a density filtration of a\nmultiscale rigidity function built from bond and/or dihedral angle\ndistributions. To further validate our model, a systematical comparison with\nthe traditional entropy evaluation model is done. It is found that our model is\nable to preserve the intrinsic topological features of biomolecular data much\nbetter than traditional approaches, particularly for resolutions in the mediate\nrange. Moreover, our method can be successfully used in protein classification.\nFor a test database with around nine hundred proteins, a clear separation\nbetween all-alpha and all-beta proteins can be achieved, using only the\ndihedral and pseudo-bond angle information.

Here we revisit the predictions of the theory of the origin\nof the universe from the landscape multiverse for the case of exponential\ninflation, for two reasons: firstly to check the status of the anomalies\nassociated with this theory, in the light of the recent Planck data; secondly,\nto search for a counterexample whereby new physics modifications may bring\nconvex inflationary potentials, thought to have been ruled out, back into the\nregion of potentials allowed by data. Using the exponential inflation as an\nexample of convex potentials, we find that the answer to both tests is\npositive: modifications to the perturbation spectrum and to the Newtonian\npotential of the universe originating from the quantum entanglement, bring the\nexponential potential, back within the allowed region of current data; and, the\nseries of anomalies previously predicted in this theory, is still in good\nagreement with current data.

We study social cohesion in some special types of\ngraphs and draw a link between social cohesion and the classical notion of\nstructural cohesion. We then focus on the problem of deciding whether a given\nsocial network is socially cohesive and show that this problem is\nCoNP-complete. Nevertheless, we give two efficient heuristics for coalition\nstructures where players enjoy high popularity and experimentally evaluate\ntheir performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2016 09:41:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

In our studies,\nLorentz symmetric models are extended by the inclusion of higher-order LIV\noperators, which improve the convergence of loop integrals and introduce a\nnatural mass scale to the theories. We then present how Lorentz invariance can\nbe recovered, for both models, after quantisation, in such a way that the\ndynamical masses and mixing are the only quantum effects that remain finite.\n  Additionally, we study how matter fields, especially fermions, behave when\ncoupled to two modified gravity models. Such modified gravity models break the\n4-dimensional diffeomorphism invariance and, consequently, induce local Lorentz\nviolation. In particular, we consider Horava-Lifshitz gravity, which presents\nan improved ultraviolet behaviour when compared to General Relativity (GR), and\nthus addresses a fundamental problem in physics: the\nnon-(perturbative-)renormalisability of the theory of GR. We calculate the LIV\none-loop corrections to the matter sector dispersion relations, after\nintegration over graviton components, and show that, by imposing reasonable\nconstraints on the energy scales of our gravity models, our results are\nconsistent with the current bounds on Lorentz symmetry violation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2016 12:35:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

There is a wide range of challenges in the MVP techniques, i.e.\ndecreasing noise and sparsity, defining effective regions of interest (ROIs),\nvisualizing results, and the cost of brain studies. In overcoming these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a novel model of neural representation, which\ncan automatically detect the active regions for each visual stimulus and then\nutilize these anatomical regions for visualizing and analyzing the functional\nactivities. Therefore, this model provides an opportunity for neuroscientists\nto ask this question: what is the effect of a stimulus on each of the detected\nregions instead of just study the fluctuation of voxels in the manually\nselected ROIs. Moreover, our method introduces analyzing snapshots of brain\nimage for decreasing sparsity rather than using the whole of fMRI time series.\nFurther, a new Gaussian smoothing method is proposed for removing noise of\nvoxels in the level of ROIs. The proposed method enables us to combine\ndifferent fMRI data sets for reducing the cost of brain studies. Experimental\nstudies on 4 visual categories (words, consonants, objects and nonsense photos)\nconfirm that the proposed method achieves superior performance to\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2016 14:37:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

Attempts to achieve\nobservational signatures of wormholes have been growing as the subject has\nbecame more and more popular. In this article we investigate some $f(R,T)$\ntheoretical predictions for static wormholes, i.e., wormholes whose throat\nradius can be considered a constant. Since the $T$-dependence in $f(R,T)$\ngravity is due to the consideration of quantum effects, a further investigation\nof wormholes in such a theory is well motivated. We obtain the energy\nconditions of static wormholes in $f(R,T)$ gravity and apply an analytical\napproach to find the solutions. We highlight that our results are in agreement\nwith previous solutions presented in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2016 14:35:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

The\nrelevance of such a signature is clear, as it will free many patients from the\nagony and toxic side-effects associated with the adjuvant chemotherapy\nautomatically and sometimes carelessly subscribed to them. Motivated by this\nissue, Ein-Dor (2006) and Zuk (2007) presented a Bayesian model which leads to\nthe following conclusion: Thousands of samples are needed to generate a robust\ngene list for predicting outcome. This conclusion is based on existence of some\nstatistical assumptions. The current work raises doubts over this determination\nby showing that: (1) These assumptions are not consistent with additional\nassumptions such as sparsity and Gaussianity.
