If the strong force were\nslightly weaker, deuterium would not be stable, and many authors have noted\nthat nuclesynthesis would be compromised so that helium production could not\nproceed through standard reaction chains. Motivated by the possibility that\nother regions of space-time could have different values for the fundamental\nconstants, this paper considers stellar evolution in universes without stable\ndeuterium and argues that such universes can remain habitable. Even in\nuniverses with no stellar nucleosynthesis, stars can form and will generate\nenergy through gravitational contraction. We show that such stars can be\nsufficiently luminous and long-lived to support life. Stars with initial masses\nthat exceed the Chandrasekhar mass cannot be supported by degeneracy pressure\nand explode at the end of their contraction phase. The resulting explosive\nnucleosynthesis can provide the universe with some heavy elements.

One of the difficulties in this determination is to know the\nevolutionary state of the individual stars -- i.e. have they started to burn\nHelium in their cores? That is the topic of this paper. Asteroseismic data\nprovide a route to achieving this information. What we present here is an\nhighly autonomous way of determining the evolutionary state from an analysis of\nthe power spectrum of the light curve. The method is fast and efficient and can\nprovide results for a large number of stars. It uses the structure of the\ndipole-mode oscillations, which have a mixed character in red-giant stars, to\ndetermine some measures that are used in the categorisation. It does not\nrequire that all the individual components of any given mode be separately\ncharacterised. Some 6604 red giant stars have been classified. Of these 3566\nare determined to be on the red-giant branch, 2077 are red-clump and 439 are\nsecondary-clump stars. We do not specifically identify the low metallicity,\nhorizontal-branch stars. The difference between red-clump and secondary-clump\nstars is dependent on the manner in which Helium burning is first initiated. We\ndiscuss that the way the boundary between these classifications is set may lead\nto mis-categorisation in a small number of stars. The remaining 522 stars were\nnot classified either because they lacked sufficient power in the dipole modes\n(so-called depressed dipole modes) or because of conflicting values in the\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 17:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

In order for a dense\nlabeling algorithm to be able to achieve accurate and precise results, it has\nto consider the dependencies that exist in the joint space of both the input\nand the output variables. An implicit approach for modeling those dependencies\nis by training a deep neural network that, given as input an initial estimate\nof the output labels and the input image, it will be able to predict a new\nrefined estimate for the labels. In this context, our work is concerned with\nwhat is the optimal architecture for performing the label improvement task. We\nargue that the prior approaches of either directly predicting new label\nestimates or predicting residual corrections w.r.t. the initial labels with\nfeed-forward deep network architectures are sub-optimal. Instead, we propose a\ngeneric architecture that decomposes the label improvement task to three steps:\n1) detecting the initial label estimates that are incorrect, 2) replacing the\nincorrect labels with new ones, and finally 3) refining the renewed labels by\npredicting residual corrections w.r.t. them. Furthermore, we explore and\ncompare various other alternative architectures that consist of the\naforementioned Detection, Replace, and Refine components. We extensively\nevaluate the examined architectures in the challenging task of dense disparity\nestimation (stereo matching) and we report both quantitative and qualitative\nresults on three different datasets. Finally, our dense disparity estimation\nnetwork that implements the proposed generic architecture, achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in the KITTI 2015 test surpassing prior approaches by\na significant margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 18:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-15"}

It boasts the smallest known syndrome extraction\ncircuits and correspondingly largest thresholds. Defect-based logical encodings\nof a new variety called twists have made it possible to implement the full\nClifford group without state distillation. Here we investigate a patch-based\nencoding involving a modified twist. In our modified formulation, the resulting\ncodes, called triangle codes for the shape of their planar layout, have only\nweight-four checks and relatively simple syndrome extraction circuits that\nmaintain a high, near surface-code-level threshold. They also use 25% fewer\nphysical qubits per logical qubit than the surface code.

These include a\nfull-rank solution for the MIMO channel and a general solution for the\nmultiple-input single-output (MISO) channel. In this paper, the fixed Gaussian\nMISO channel is considered and its capacity as well as optimal transmission\nstrategies are determined in a closed form under the joint total and\nper-antenna power constraints in the general case. In particular, the optimal\nstrategy is hybrid and includes two parts: first is equal-gain transmission and\nsecond is maximum-ratio transmission, which are responsible for the PA and TP\nconstraints respectively. The optimal beamforming vector is given in a\nclosed-form and an accurate yet simple approximation to the capacity is\nproposed. Finally, the above results are extended to the MIMO case by\nestablishing the ergodic capacity of fading MIMO channels under the joint power\nconstraints when the fading distribution is right unitary-invariant (of which\ni.i.d. and semi-correlated Rayleigh fading are special cases).

There are ambiguities in interpreting the QPO coherence time due to\nnon-sinusoidal light curve shapes, signal-to-noise, error mischaracterizations,\nand cadence. Higher-order implementations of the QPO model that better capture\nlight curve shapes are necessary for the coherence time to have its implied\nphysical meaning.

This difference may arise\nfrom the SMC's lower metallicity, but it could be a selection effect: the SMC\nsample includes more stars which are brighter and thus more massive. The\ndistribution of SMC stars along the silicate sequence looks more like that of\nGalactic red supergiants than asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs). While many\nare definitively AGBs, several SMC stars show evidence of hot bottom burning.\nOther sources show mixed chemistry (oxygen-rich and carbon-rich features),\nincluding supergiants with PAH emission. MSX SMC 134 may be the first confirmed\nsilicate/carbon star in the SMC, and MSX SMC 049 is a post-AGB candidate. MSX\nSMC 145, previously a candidate OH/IR star, is actually an AGB star with a\nbackground galaxy at z=0.16 along the same line-of-sight. We consider the\noverall characteristics of all the {\\em MSX} sources, the most infrared-bright\nobjects in the SMC, in light of {\\em Spitzer}'s higher sensitivity and\nresolution, and compare them with the object types expected from the original\nselection criteria. This population represents what will be seen in more\ndistant galaxies by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Color-color diagrams\nusing the IRS spectra and JWST mid-infrared filters show how one can separate\nevolved stars from young stellar objects (YSOs) and distinguish among different\nYSO classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 21:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-13"}

However, this task is still challenging\nfor existing systems, since videos that present the same action, can be taken\nfrom significantly different viewing directions, performed by different actors\nand backgrounds and under various video qualities. Video descriptors play a\nsignificant role in these systems. In this work we propose the\n\"temporal-needle\" descriptor which captures the dynamic behavior, while being\ninvariant to viewpoint and appearance. The descriptor is computed using multi\ntemporal scales of the video and by computing self-similarity for every patch\nthrough time in every temporal scale. The descriptor is computed for every\npixel in the video. However, to find similar actions across videos, we consider\nonly a small subset of the descriptors - the statistical significant\ndescriptors. This allow us to find good correspondences across videos more\nefficiently. Using the descriptor, we were able to detect the same behavior\nacross videos in a variety of scenarios. We demonstrate the use of the\ndescriptor in tasks such as temporal and spatial alignment, action detection\nand even show its potential in unsupervised video clustering into categories.\nIn this work we handled only videos taken with stationary cameras, but the\ndescriptor can be extended to handle moving camera as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 21:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-16"}

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the most\ncommonly obtained imaging modality in ophthalmology and represents a dense and\nrich dataset when combined with labels derived from the EMR. We sought to\ndetermine if deep learning could be utilized to distinguish normal OCT images\nfrom images from patients with Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Methods:\nAutomated extraction of an OCT imaging database was performed and linked to\nclinical endpoints from the EMR. OCT macula scans were obtained by Heidelberg\nSpectralis, and each OCT scan was linked to EMR clinical endpoints extracted\nfrom EPIC. The central 11 images were selected from each OCT scan of two\ncohorts of patients: normal and AMD. Cross-validation was performed using a\nrandom subset of patients. Area under receiver operator curves (auROC) were\nconstructed at an independent image level, macular OCT level, and patient\nlevel. Results: Of an extraction of 2.6 million OCT images linked to clinical\ndatapoints from the EMR, 52,690 normal and 48,312 AMD macular OCT images were\nselected. A deep neural network was trained to categorize images as either\nnormal or AMD. At the image level, we achieved an auROC of 92.78% with an\naccuracy of 87.63%. At the macula level, we achieved an auROC of 93.83% with an\naccuracy of 88.98%. At a patient level, we achieved an auROC of 97.45% with an\naccuracy of 93.45%. Peak sensitivity and specificity with optimal cutoffs were\n92.64% and 93.69% respectively. Conclusions: Deep learning techniques are\neffective for classifying OCT images. These findings have important\nimplications in utilizing OCT in automated screening and computer aided\ndiagnosis tools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 00:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-16"}

Both of\nthese criteria depend sensitively on whether and how perturbation modes of the\ninflaton interact and decohere. Decoherence is inevitable as a result of\ngravitationally-sourced interactions whose strength are proportional to the\nslow-roll parameters. However, the weakness of these interactions means that\ndecoherence is typically delayed until several Hubble times after modes grow\nbeyond the Hubble scale. We present perturbative evidence that decoherence of\nlong-wavelength inflaton modes indeed leads to an ensemble of classical\nspacetimes with differing cosmological evolutions. We introduce the notion of\nper-branch observables---expectation values with respect to the different\ndecohered branches of the wave function---and show that the evolution of modes\non individual branches varies from branch to branch.

In this context, the term global refers to the identification of a\nmodel that is capable of representing the system dynamics under any admissible\nflight state based on data recorded from sample states. The proposed framework\nis based on stochastic time-series models for representing the system dynamics\nand aeroelastic response under multiple flight states, with each state\ncharacterized by several variables, such as the airspeed and angle of attack,\nforming a flight state vector. The method's cornerstone lies in the new class\nof Vector-dependent Functionally Pooled (VFP) models which allow the explicit\nanalytical inclusion of the flight state vector into the model parameters and,\nhence, system dynamics. The experimental evaluation is based on a prototype\nbio-inspired self-sensing composite wing that is subjected to a series of wind\ntunnel experiments. Distributed micro-sensors in the form of stretchable sensor\nnetworks are embedded in the composite layup of the wing to provide the sensing\ncapabilities. Data collected from piezoelectric sensors are employed for the\nidentification of a stochastic global VFP model. The estimated VFP model\nparameters constitute two-dimensional functions of the flight state vector\ndefined by the airspeed and angle of attack. The identified model is able to\nsuccessfully represent the aeroelastic response of the wing under the\nadmissible flight states via a minimum number of estimated parameters compared\nto standard identification approaches. The obtained results demonstrate the\nhigh accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed global identification\nframework, thus constituting a first step towards the next generation of\nfly-by-feel aerospace vehicles with state awareness capabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 00:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-28"}

The asymptotic closed-form\nexpressions of the average sum-rate for A$^3$-AS and AIA-AS and that of the\naverage rate of the secondary user for MCG-AS are derived, respectively.\nNumerical results demonstrate that the AIA-AS provides better user-fairness,\nwhile the A$^3$-AS achieves a near-optimal sum-rate in F-NOMA systems. For the\nCR-NOMA scenario, MCG-AS achieves a near-optimal performance in a wide SNR\nregime. Furthermore, all the proposed AS algorithms yield a significant\ncomputational complexity reduction, compared to exhaustive search-based\ncounterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 06:22:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 12:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-23"}

In this paper, we\nfocus on two key factors that can affect the controllers' global network view\nand subsequently impact the application performance. Particularly we examine:\n(1) network state collection, and (2) network state distribution. First, we\ncompare the impact of active and passive OpenFlow network state collection\nmethods on an SDN load-balancing application running at the controller using\nkey performance indicators that we define. We do this comparison through: (i) a\nsimulation of a mathematical model we derive for the SDN load-balancer, and\n(ii) an evaluation of a load-balancing application running on top of single and\ndistributed controllers. Further, we investigate the impact of network state\ncollection on a state-distribution-aware load-balancing application. Finally,\nwe study the impact of network scale on applications requiring an up-to-date\nglobal network view in the presence of the aforementioned key factors. Our\nresults show that both the network state collection and network state\ndistribution can have an impact on the SDN application performance. The more\nthe information at the controllers becomes outdated, the higher the impact\nwould be. Even with those applications that were designed to mitigate the\nissues of controller state distribution, their performance was affected by the\nnetwork state collection. Lastly, the results suggest that the impact of\nnetwork state collection on application performance becomes more apparent as\nthe number of distributed controllers increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 06:26:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-16"}

The normal\nstate MEs exhibit commensurability to diamond and to square-like structure\ntransition with the increase of energy. This structure transition persists in\nthe spin and orbital scenarios of nematic phases, although the MEs show\nanisotropic behaviors due to the C4 symmetry breaking induced by the nematic\norders. The MEs exhibit distinct energy evolution behaviors between the spin\nand orbital scenarios of nematicity. For the spinnematic scenario, the\nanisotropy of the MEs persists up to the high energy region. In contrast, for\nthe orbital-nematic scenario, it reduces dramatically in the low energy region\nand is negligible in the high energy region. These distinct behaviors of the\nMEs are attributed to the different origins between the spin and orbital\nscenarios of nematic orders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 08:08:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-05"}

A previously unrecognized factor governing\nthe spin evolution of such pulsars is the crucial effect of non-steady or\ntransient accretion. We numerically compute the evolution of accreting neutron\nstars through a series of outburst and quiescent phases considering the drastic\nvariation of the accretion rate and the standard disk-magnetosphere\ninteraction. We find that, for the same long-term average accretion rate, X-ray\ntransients can spin up pulsars to rates several times higher than can\npersistent accretors, even when the spin down due to electromagnetic radiation\nduring quiescence is included. We also compute an analytical expression for the\nequilibrium spin frequency in transients, by taking spin equilibrium to mean\nthat no net angular momentum is transferred to the neutron star in each\noutburst cycle. We find that the equilibrium spin rate for transients, which\ndepends on the peak accretion rate during outbursts, can be much higher than\nthat for persistent sources. This explains our numerical finding. This finding\nimplies that any meaningful study of neutron star spin and magnetic field\ndistributions requires the inclusion of the transient accretion effect, since\nmost accreting neutron star sources are transients. Our finding also implies\nthe existence of a submillisecond pulsar population, which is not observed.\nThis may point to the need for a competing spin-down mechanism for the\nfastest-rotating accreting pulsars, such as gravitational radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 08:15:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

For an efficient\nmodeling one usually focuses on the slower degrees of freedom and it is of\ngreat importance to accurately eliminate the fast variables in a controlled\nfashion, carefully accounting for their net effect on the slower dynamics. This\nprocedure in general requires to perform two different operations: decimation\nand coarse-graining. We introduce the asymptotic methods that form the basis of\nthis procedure and discuss their application to a series of physical,\nbiological and chemical examples. We then turn our attention to functionals of\nthe stochastic trajectories such as residence times, counting statistics,\nfluxes, entropy production, etc. which have been increasingly studied in recent\nyears. For such functionals, the elimination of the fast degrees of freedom can\npresent additional difficulties and naive procedures can lead to blatantly\ninconsistent results. Homogenization techniques for functionals are less\ncovered in the literature and we will pedagogically present them here, as\nnatural extensions of the ones employed for the trajectories. We will also\ndiscuss recent applications of these techniques to the thermodynamics of small\nsystems and their interpretation in terms of information-theoretic concepts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 09:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

Typically this problem is confounded with the\nproblem of graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL), because both problems\nrepresent the data as a graph and predict the missing class labels of nodes.\nHowever, not all graphs are created equally. In GSSL a graph is constructed,\noften from independent data, based on similarity. As such, edges tend to\nconnect instances with the same class label. Relational networks, however, can\nbe more heterogeneous and edges do not always indicate similarity. For\ninstance, instead of links being more likely to connect nodes with the same\nclass label, they may occur more frequently between nodes with different class\nlabels (link-heterogeneity). Or nodes with the same class label do not\nnecessarily have the same type of connectivity across the whole network\n(class-heterogeneity), e.g. in a network of sexual interactions we may observe\nlinks between opposite genders in some parts of the graph and links between the\nsame genders in others. Performing classification in networks with different\ntypes of heterogeneity is a hard problem that is made harder still when we do\nnot know a-priori the type or level of heterogeneity. Here we present two\nscalable approaches for graph-based semi-supervised learning for the more\ngeneral case of relational networks. We demonstrate these approaches on\nsynthetic and real-world networks that display different link patterns within\nand between classes. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, ours give better\nclassification performance without prior knowledge of how classes interact. In\nparticular, our two-step label propagation algorithm gives consistently good\naccuracy and runs on networks of over 1.6 million nodes and 30 million edges in\naround 12 seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 10:15:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-16"}

However,\ninference in implicit models or complex posterior distributions is hard. A\npopular tool for learning implicit models are generative adversarial networks\n(GANs) which learn parameters of generators by fooling discriminators.\nTypically, GANs are considered to be models themselves and are not understood\nin the context of inference. Current techniques rely on inefficient global\ndiscrimination of joint distributions to perform learning, or only consider\ndiscriminating a single output variable. We overcome these limitations by\ntreating GANs as a basis for likelihood-free inference in generative models and\ngeneralize them to Bayesian posterior inference over factor graphs. We propose\nlocal learning rules based on message passing minimizing a global divergence\ncriterion involving cooperating local adversaries used to sidestep explicit\nlikelihood evaluations. This allows us to compose models and yields a unified\ninference and learning framework for adversarial learning. Our framework treats\nmodel specification and inference separately and facilitates richly structured\nmodels within the family of Directed Acyclic Graphs, including components such\nas intractable likelihoods, non-differentiable models, simulators and generally\ncumbersome models. A key result of our treatment is the insight that Bayesian\ninference on structured models can be performed only with sampling and\ndiscrimination when using nonparametric variational families, without access to\nexplicit distributions. As a side-result, we discuss the link to likelihood\nmaximization.

Expectation Propagation (EP) (Minka\n(2001)) is a popular algorithm that solves this issue by computing a parametric\napproximation (e.g: Gaussian) to the density of the posterior. However, while\nit is known empirically to quickly compute fine approximations, EP is extremely\npoorly understood which prevents it from being adopted by a larger fraction of\nthe community.\n  The object of the present article is to shed intuitive light on EP, by\nrelating it to other better understood methods. More precisely, we link it to\nusing gradient descent to compute the Laplace approximation of a target\nprobability distribution. We show that EP is exactly equivalent to performing\ngradient descent on a smoothed energy landscape: i.e: the original energy\nlandscape convoluted with some smoothing kernel. This also relates EP to\nalgorithms that compute the Gaussian approximation which minimizes the reverse\nKL divergence to the target distribution, a link that has been conjectured\nbefore but has not been proved rigorously yet. These results can help\npractitioners to get a better feel for how EP works, as well as lead to other\nnew results on this important method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 13:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-16"}

However, those photospheric characteristics are often hampered by\nsystematic uncertainties. The joint spectro-seismo project (APOKASC) of field\nred giants has revealed a puzzling offset between the log g determined\nspectroscopically and those determined using asteroseismology, which is largely\ndependent on the stellar evolutionary status. Therefore, in this letter, we aim\nto shed light on the spectroscopic source of the offset using the APOKASC\nsample. We analyse the log g discrepancy as a function of stellar mass and\nevolutionary status and discuss the impact of He and carbon isotopic ratio.\n  We first show that for stars at the bottom of the red giant branch, the\ndiscrepancy between spectroscopic and asteroseismic log g depends on stellar\nmass. This indicates that the discrepancy is related to CN cycling. We\ndemonstrate that the C isotopic ratio ($\\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$) has the largest\nimpact on the stellar spectrum. We find that this log g discrepancy shows a\nsimilar trend in mass as the $\\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratios expected by stellar\nevolution theory. Although we do not detect a direct signature of $\\rm ^{13}C$,\nthe data suggests that the discrepancy is tightly correlated to the production\nof $\\rm ^{13}C$. Moreover, by running a data-driven algorithm (the Cannon) on a\nsynthetic grid trained on the APOGEE data, we quantitatively evaluate the\nimpact of various $\\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratios. While we have demonstrated that\n$\\rm ^{13}C$ impacts all parameters, the size of the impact is smaller than the\nobserved offset in log g. If further tests confirm that $\\rm ^{13}C$ is not the\nmain element responsible of the log g problem, the number of spectroscopic\neffects remaining to be investigated is now relatively limited.

In transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers,\nwhere spin-valley locking is present, strong retention of valley chirality has\nbeen reported for MoS$_2$, WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$ while MoSe$_2$ shows anomalously\nlow valley polarisation retention. In this work, chiral selectivity of MoSe$_2$\ncavity polaritons under helical excitation is reported with a polarisation\ndegree that can be controlled by the exciton-cavity detuning. In contrast to\nthe very low circular polarisation degrees seen in MoSe$_2$ exciton and trion\nresonances, we observe a significant enhancement of up to 7 times when in the\npolaritonic regime. Here, polaritons introduce a fast decay mechanism which\ninhibits full valley pseudospin relaxation and thus allows for increased\nretention of injected polarisation in the emitted light. A dynamical model\napplicable to cavity-polaritons in any TMD semiconductor, reproduces the\ndetuning dependence through the incorporation of the cavity-modified exciton\nrelaxation, allowing an estimate of the spin relaxation time in MoSe$_2$ which\nis an order of magnitude faster than those reported in other TMDs.

This\nincreases the risk of computing a local rather than the global minimum of the\nmisfit. In our previous work, we proposed the quadratic Wasserstein metric\n($W_2$) as a new misfit function for FWI. The $W_2$ metric has been proved to\nhave many ideal properties with regards to convexity and insensitivity to\nnoise. When the observed and predicted seismic data are regarded as two density\nfunctions, the quadratic Wasserstein metric corresponds to the optimal cost of\nrearranging one density into the other, where the transportation cost is\nquadratic in distance. The difficulty of transforming seismic signals into\nnonnegative density functions is discussed.

In this work, we build on our earlier\nmethod to cover more realistic high-resolution applications by embedding the\n$W_2$ technique into the framework of the adjoint-state method and applying it\nto seismic relevant 2D examples: the Camembert, the Marmousi, and the 2004 BP\nmodels.

In the last decade, a\nsub-hierarchy, known as quantum combs, was exhaustively studied, and\ncharacterised as the most general class of transformations that can be achieved\nby quantum circuits with open slots hosting variable input elements, to form a\ncomplete output quantum circuit. The theory of quantum combs proved to be\nsuccessful for the optimisation of information processing tasks otherwise\nuntreatable. In more recent years the study of maps from combs to combs has\nincreased, thanks to interesting examples showing how this next order of maps\nrequires entanglement of the causal order of operations with the state of a\ncontrol quantum system, or, even more radically, superpositions of alternate\ncausal orderings.

CEP systems collect events arriving from input data\nstreams and use them to infer more complex events according to predefined\npatterns. The Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) is one of the most\npopular mechanisms on which such systems are based. During the event detection\nprocess, NFAs incrementally extend previously observed partial matches until a\nfull match for the query is found. As a result, each arriving event needs to be\nprocessed to determine whether a new partial match is to be initiated or an\nexisting one extended. This method may be highly inefficient when many of the\nevents do not result in output matches. We present a lazy evaluation mechanism\nthat defers processing of frequent event types and stores them internally upon\narrival. Events are then matched in ascending order of frequency, thus\nminimizing potentially redundant computations. We introduce a Lazy Chain NFA,\nwhich utilizes the above principle, and does not depend on the underlying\npattern structure. An algorithm for constructing a Lazy Chain NFA for common\npattern types is presented, including conjunction, negation and iteration.\nFinally, we experimentally evaluate our mechanism on real-world stock trading\ndata.

The measured spectra, well fitted in both cases by a log-parabola\nspectral model (with a 5 sigma statistical preference for non-zero curvature\nfor PKS 2155-304 and 4.5 sigma for PG 1553+113), were found consistent with\nspectra derived from contemporaneous Fermi-LAT data, indicating a sharp break\nin the observed spectra of both sources at E ~ 100 GeV. When corrected for EBL\nabsorption, the intrinsic spectrum of PKS 2155-304 was found to show\nsignificant curvature. For PG 1553+113, however, no significant detection of\ncurvature in the intrinsic spectrum could be found within statistical and\nsystematic uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 15:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

Because the extended halos survive longer than the relatively fragile\ntidal features, they trace more ancient mergers. We use images reaching surface\nbrightness limits as low as 28.5-29 mag.arcsec-2 (g-band) to obtain light and\ncolor profiles up to 5-10 effective radii of a sample of nearby early-type\ngalaxies. They were acquired with MegaCam as part of the CFHT MATLAS large\nprogramme. These profiles may be compared to those produced by simulations of\ngalaxy formation and evolution, once corrected for instrumental effects. Indeed\nthey can be heavily contaminated by the scattered light caused by internal\nreflections within the instrument. In particular, the nucleus of galaxies\ngenerates artificial flux in the outer halo, which has to be precisely\nsubtracted. We present a deconvolution technique to remove the artificial halos\nthat makes use of very large kernels. The technique based on PyOperators is\nmore time efficient than the model-convolution methods also used for that\npurpose. This is especially the case for galaxies with complex structures that\nare hard to model. Having a good knowledge of the Point Spread Function (PSF),\nincluding its outer wings, is critical for the method. A database of MegaCam\nPSF models corresponding to different seeing conditions and bands was generated\ndirectly from the deep images. It is shown that the difference in the PSFs in\ndifferent bands causes artificial changes in the color profiles, in particular\na reddening of the outskirts of galaxies having a bright nucleus. The method is\nvalidated with a set of simulated images and applied to three representative\ntest cases: NGC 3599, NGC 3489, and NGC 4274, and exhibiting for two of them a\nprominent ghost halo.

Based upon previous work on part localization, in this\npaper, we address the problem of inferring rich semantics imparted by an object\npart in still images. We propose to tokenize the semantic space as a discrete\nset of part states. Our modeling of part state is spatially localized,\ntherefore, we formulate the part state inference problem as a pixel-wise\nannotation problem. An iterative part-state inference neural network is\nspecifically designed for this task, which is efficient in time and accurate in\nperformance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can\neffectively predict the semantic states of parts and simultaneously correct\nlocalization errors, thus benefiting a few visual understanding applications.\nThe other contribution of this paper is our part state dataset which contains\nrich part-level semantic annotations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 13:46:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-22"}

The\ncomplex structure of the Galaxy makes it extremely difficult and challenging to\nmodel its mass distribution, particularly for the Galactic disk which plays the\nmost important role in the dynamics and evolution of the Galaxy. Conventionally\nan axisymmetric disk model with an exponential brightness distribution and a\nconstant mass-to-light ratio is assumed for the Galactic disk. In order to\ngenerate a flat rotation curve, a dark halo has also to be included. Here, by\nusing the recently released Gaia billion-star map, we propose a Galactic disk\nmass distribution model which is based on the star density distribution rather\nthan the brightness and mass-to-light ratio. The model is characterized by two\nparameters, a bulge radius and a characteristic length. Using the mass\ndistribution model and solving the Poisson equation of the Galaxy, we obtain a\nflat rotation curve which reproduces the key observed features with no need for\na dark halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 22:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-23"}

Current network scenario is experiencing the huge spectrum\nscarcity problem due to the fixed assignment policy so in this method great\namount of spectrum remain unused. To overcome this limitation the spectrum\nallocation must be in dynamic manner. In this paper the spectrum allocation is\ndiscussed thoroughly. Interference is the most important factor that needs to\nbe considered. It is caused by the environment (noise) or by other radio users.\nIt limits the possibility of spectrum reuse. Channel assignment is one of the\ntechniques used to control interference in the network. There exist a trade-off\nbetween network capacity and level of contention. In cognitive radio networks\nspectrum assignment or spectrum allocation or frequency assignment is used to\navoid interference. It is the process of simultaneous selection of operating\ncentral frequency and bandwidth. In doing so, the process of sensing the\nspectrum becomes very crucial; it must be reliable, accurate and efficient. The\naccuracy of sensing affects the overall operation of cognitive networks.\nAccurate results not only lead to higher utilization of the spectrum but also\npreserve the privacy of primary user. Accuracy of sensing is highly affected by\nthe natural causes like noise, shadowing, fading etc. There are many other\nchallenges as well, like, hardware requirements, hidden node problem, security,\nsensing frequency and duration, decision fusion etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 14:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-30"}
