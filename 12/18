Rather,\nin the continuous limit, the variations of a typical readout become much larger\nthan the separation between the eigenvalues of the measured quantity.

Advances\nin exposure assessment and statistics allow for estimation of both critical\nwindows of vulnerability and exposure effect heterogeneity. Simultaneous\nestimation of windows of vulnerability and effect heterogeneity can be\naccomplished by fitting a distributed lag model (DLM) stratified by subgroup.\nHowever, this can provide an incomplete picture of how effects vary across\nsubgroups because it does not allow for subgroups to have the same window but\ndifferent within-window effects or to have different windows but the same\nwithin-window effect. Because the timing of some developmental processes are\ncommon across subpopulations of infants while for others the timing differs\nacross subgroups, both scenarios are important to consider when evaluating\nhealth risks of prenatal exposures. We propose a new approach that partitions\nthe DLM into a constrained functional predictor that estimates windows of\nvulnerability and a scalar effect representing the within-window effect\ndirectly. The proposed method allows for heterogeneity in only the window, only\nthe within-window effect, or both.

In particular, our iDroop controllers are\ndecentralized, rebalance supply and demand, and provide power sharing.\nFurthermore, our solution can improve the dynamic performance without affecting\nthe steady state solution.

As proof of principle, we fabricated 800 devices with large\ndetection area (15 um * 15 um) and five different designs on a single silicon\nchip for comparison, which include standard SNSPDs, series-3-SNAPs and our\nmodified series-SNAPs with double-stage avalanche structure 2*2-SNAPs,\n2*3-SNAPs, and 3*3-SNAPs. The former three types of the detectors demonstrate\nfully-saturated device detection efficiencies of ~20% while the latter two\ntypes are latching at larger bias currents. In addition, the I_AV of 2*2-SNAPs\nis only 64% of the switching current I_SW that is lower than series-3-SNAPs\n(74%) and well below that of 4-SNAPs (84%) reported elsewhere. We also measure\nthat the exponential decay times of the detectors are proportional to (1/n)^2\ndue to the lack of external choke inductors. In particular, the decay time of\n3*3-SNAPs is only 0.89 ns compared to the standard SNSPDs' 63.2 ns, showing the\npotential to attain GHz counting rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2016 20:52:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-20"}

This allows models to\npredict how an egocentric motion would look like from outside. To do so, we\ntrain linear and nonlinear models and evaluate their performance in terms of\nretrieving the egocentric (exocentric) motion features, while having access to\nan exocentric (egocentric) motion feature. Our experimental results demonstrate\nthat motion information can be successfully transferred across the two views.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Dec 2016 23:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-20"}

High angular resolution diffusion imaging\n(HARDI) can produce better estimates of fiber orientation than the popularly\nused diffusion tensor imaging, but the high number of samples needed to\nestimate diffusivity requires longer patient scan times. To accelerate dMRI,\ncompressed sensing (CS) has been utilized by exploiting a sparse dictionary\nrepresentation of the data, discovered through sparse coding. The sparser the\nrepresentation, the fewer samples are needed to reconstruct a high resolution\nsignal with limited information loss, and so an important area of research has\nfocused on finding the sparsest possible representation of dMRI. Current\nreconstruction methods however, rely on an angular representation $\\textit{per\nvoxel}$ with added spatial regularization, and so, for non-zero signals, one is\nrequired to have at least one non-zero coefficient per voxel. This means that\nthe global level of sparsity must be greater than the number of voxels. In\ncontrast, we propose a joint spatial-angular representation of dMRI that will\nallow us to achieve levels of global sparsity that are below the number of\nvoxels. A major challenge, however, is the computational complexity of solving\na global sparse coding problem over large-scale dMRI.

Due to the distributed nature of our algorithm, it is\neasily implementable.\n  We begin by considering the simplest set-up of a one-hop wireless network in\nwhich an Access Point (AP) transmits video packets to multiple clients over a\nshared unreliable channel. The video file meant for each client has been\nfragmented into several packets, and the server maintains multiple copies (each\nof different quality) of the same video file. Clients maintain individual\npacket buffers in order to mitigate the effect of uncertainty on video\niterruption. Streaming experience, or the Quality of Experience (QoE) of a\nclient depends on several factors: i) starvation/outage probability, i.e.,\naverage time duration for which the client does not play video because the\nbuffer is empty, ii) average video quality, iii) average number of starvation\nperiods, iv) temporal variations in video quality etc.\n  We pose the problem of making dynamic streaming decisions in order to\nmaximize the total QoE as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). A\nconsideration of the associated dual MDP suggests us that the problem is vastly\nsimplified if the AP is allowed to charge a price per unit bandwidth usage from\nthe clients. More concretely, a \"client-by-client\" QoE optimization leads to\nthe networkwide QoE maximization, and thus provides us a decentralized\nstreaming algorithm.\n  This enables the clients to themselves decide the optimal streaming choices\nin each time-slot, and yields us a much desired client-level adaptation\nalgorithm.

We\nexplain the basic principles and limitations of all types of MD methods used to\nstudy unfolding and folding in a way accessible to non-specialists. We discuss\nthe potential role of G-hairpin, G-triplex and alternative GQ intermediates in\nthe folding process. We argue that, in general, folding of GQs is fundamentally\ndifferent from funneled folding of small fast-folding proteins, and can be best\ndescribed by a kinetic partitioning (KP) mechanism. KP is a competition between\nat least two (but often many) well-separated and structurally different\nconformational ensembles.\n  Major conclusions: The KP mechanism is the only plausible way to explain\nexperiments reporting long time-scales of GQ folding and the existence of\nlong-lived sub-states. A significant part of the natural partitioning of the\nfree energy landscape of GQs comes from the ability of the GQ-forming sequences\nto populate a large number of syn-anti patterns in their G-tracts.

Here we investigate spatial\ndistributions of proximity-induced superconducting currents in gapped graphene\nand, also, compare measurements in the Hall bar and Corbino geometries in the\nnormal state. By gradually opening the gap in bilayer graphene, we find that\nthe supercurrent at the charge neutrality point changes from uniform to such\nthat it propagates along narrow stripes near graphene edges.

This paper lays general theoretical foundations\nfor how to use such devices to demonstrate \"quantum supremacy\": that is, a\nclear quantum speedup for some task, motivated by the goal of overturning the\nExtended Church-Turing Thesis as confidently as possible. First, we study the\nhardness of sampling the output distribution of a random quantum circuit, along\nthe lines of a recent proposal by the the Quantum AI group at Google. We show\nthat there's a natural hardness assumption, which has nothing to do with\nsampling, yet implies that no efficient classical algorithm can pass a\nstatistical test that the quantum sampling procedure's outputs do pass.\nCompared to previous work, the central advantage is that we can now talk\ndirectly about the observed outputs, rather than about the distribution being\nsampled. Second, in an attempt to refute our hardness assumption, we give a new\nalgorithm, for simulating a general quantum circuit with n qubits and m gates\nin polynomial space and m^O(n) time. We then discuss why this and other known\nalgorithms fail to refute our assumption. Third, resolving an open problem of\nAaronson and Arkhipov, we show that any strong quantum supremacy theorem--of\nthe form \"if approximate quantum sampling is classically easy, then PH\ncollapses\"--must be non-relativizing. Fourth, refuting a conjecture by Aaronson\nand Ambainis, we show that the Fourier Sampling problem achieves a constant\nversus linear separation between quantum and randomized query complexities.\nFifth, we study quantum supremacy relative to oracles in P/poly.

In\nparticular, modeling the interaction between the network level control and the\nlocal level control has not been fully considered. Utilizing the Macroscopic\nFundamental Diagram (MFD) as the traffic performance indicator, we formulate a\ndynamic system model, and design a Model Predictive Control (MPC) based\ncontroller coupling two competing control objectives and optimizing the\nperformance at the local and the network level as a whole. To solve this highly\nnon-linear optimization problem, we employ an approximation framework, enabling\nthe optimal solution of this large-scale problem to be feasible and efficient.\nNumerical analysis shows that by applying the proposed controller, the\nprotected network can operate around the desired state as expressed by the MFD,\nwhile the total delay at the perimeter is minimized as well. Moreover, the\npaper sheds light on the robustness of the proposed controller. This\nmulti-scale hybrid controller is further extended to a stochastic MPC scheme,\nwhere connected vehicles (CV) serve as the only data source. Hence, low\npenetration rates of CVs lead to strong noises in the controller. This is a\nfirst attempt to develop a network-level traffic control methodology by using\nthe emerging CV technology. We consider the stochasticity in traffic state\nestimation and the shape of the MFD. Simulation analysis demonstrates the\nrobustness of the proposed stochastic controller, showing that efficient\ncontrollers can indeed be designed with this newly-spread vehicle technology\neven in the absence of other data collection schemes (e.g. loop detectors).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2016 13:14:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 04:40:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2017 08:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

We show\nthat inference in this probabilistic model automatically leads to a feedback\nterm to online modulate the execution of a DMP.

However, the wiring and interconnect\nrequirements for quantum circuits are completely different from those for\nclassical circuits, as individual DC, pulsed and in some cases microwave\ncontrol signals need to be routed from external sources to every qubit. This is\nfurther complicated by the requirement that these spin qubits currently operate\nat temperatures below 100 mK. Here we review several strategies that are\nconsidered to address this crucial challenge in scaling quantum circuits based\non electron spin qubits. Key assets of spin qubits include the potential to\noperate at 1 to 4 K, the high density of quantum dots or donors combined with\npossibilities to space them apart as needed, the extremely long spin coherence\ntimes, and the rich options for integration with classical electronics based on\nthe same technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2016 15:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-18"}
