The dynamical response is characterized by\ntime-changing internal currents, and it was suspected to originate from\nzero-frequency g-modes and r-modes driven by the tidal forces. In this paper we\nprovide additional insights into the phenomenon by examining the tidal response\nof a rotating body within the framework of post-Newtonian gravity. This\napproach allows us to develop an intuitive picture for the phenomenon, which\nrelies on the close analogy between post-Newtonian gravity and Maxwell's theory\nof electromagnetism. In this picture, the coupling between the gravitomagnetic\ntidal field and the body's rotational velocity is naturally expected to produce\nan unbalanced Lorentz-like force within the body, and it is this force that is\nresponsible for the tidal currents. The simplicity of the fluid equations in\nthe post-Newtonian setting allows us to provide a complete description of the\nzero-frequency modes and demonstrate their precise role in the establishment of\nthe tidal currents. We estimate the amplitude of these currents, and find that\nfor neutron-star binaries of relevance to LIGO, the scale of the velocity\nperturbation is measured in kilometers per second when the rotation period is\ncomparable to 100 milliseconds.

Preliminary comparisons with rotating\nstellar models indicate that an undetermined additional process for the\ninternal transport of angular momentum is required in addition to purely\nhydrodynamic processes. Aims: We investigate how asteroseismic measurements of\nred giants can help us characterize the additional transport mechanism.\nMethods: We first determine the efficiency of the missing transport mechanism\nfor the low-mass red giant KIC 7341231 by computing rotating models that\ninclude an additional viscosity corresponding to this process. We then discuss\nthe change in the efficiency of this transport of angular momentum with the\nmass, metallicity and evolutionary stage. Results: In the case of the low-mass\nred giant KIC 7341231, we find that the viscosity corresponding to the\nadditional mechanism is constrained to the range 1 x 10^3 - 1.3 x 10^4 cm^2/s.\nThis constraint on the efficiency of the unknown additional transport mechanism\nduring the post-main sequence is obtained independently of any specific\nassumption about the modelling of rotational effects during the pre-main\nsequence and the main sequence (in particular, the braking of the surface by\nmagnetized winds and the efficiency of the internal transport of angular\nmomentum before the post-main-sequence phase).

In this work, we investigate the possibility of testing them in\nthe strong-field regime by looking at the properties of compact\nobjects-neutron, hyperon, and quark stars-embedded in an asymptotically de\nSitter space-time, for a specific subclass of theories. We extend previous\nworks to include slow rotation and find a relation between the dimensionless\nmoment of intertia, ($\\bar{I}=Ic^2/G_{\\rm N} M^3$), and the compactness,\n$\\cal{C}=G_{\\rm N} M/Rc^2$ (an $\\bar{I}$-$\\cal{C}$ relation), independent of\nthe equation of state, that is reminiscent of but distinct from the general\nrelativity prediction. Several of our equations of state contain hyperons and\nfree quarks, allowing us to revisit the hyperon puzzle. We find that the\nmaximum mass of hyperon stars can be larger than $2M_\\odot$ for small values of\nthe beyond Horndeski parameter, thus providing a resolution of the hyperon\npuzzle based on modified gravity. Moreover, stable quark stars exist when\nhyperonic stars are unstable, which means that the phase transition from\nhyperon to quark stars is predicted just as in general relativity, albeit with\nlarger quark star masses. Two important and potentially observable consequences\nof some of the theories we consider are the existence of neutron stars in a\nrange of masses significantly higher than in GR, and $\\bar{I}$-$\\mathcal{C}$\nrelations that differ from their GR counterparts. In the former case, we find\nobjects that, if observed, could not be accounted for in GR because they\nviolate the usual GR causality condition.

The goals consisted of studying its atmospheric\ndynamics (Simon et al. 2016), detecting its global acoustic oscillations (Rowe\net al., submitted), and those of the Sun, which we report on here. We present\nthe first indirect detection of solar oscillations in intensity measurements.\nBeyond the remarkable technical performance, it indicates how Kepler would see\na star like the Sun. The result from the global asteroseismic approach, which\nconsists of measuring the oscillation frequency at maximum amplitude \"nu_max\"\nand the mean frequency separation between mode overtones \"Delta nu\", is\nsurprising as the nu_max measured from Neptune photometry is larger than the\naccepted value. Compared to the usual reference nu_max_sun = 3100 muHz, the\nasteroseismic scaling relations therefore make the solar mass and radius appear\nlarger by 13.8 +/- 5.8 % and 4.3 +/- 1.9 % respectively. The higher nu_max is\ncaused by a combination of the value of nu_max_sun, being larger at the time of\nobservations than the usual reference from SOHO/VIRGO/SPM data (3160 +/- 10\nmuHz), and the noise level of the K2 time series, being ten times larger than\nVIRGO's. The peak-bagging method provides more consistent results: despite a\nlow signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we model ten overtones for degrees l=0,1,2. We\ncompare the K2 data with simultaneous SOHO/VIRGO/SPM photometry and BiSON\nvelocity measurements.

In\nthis paper, we focus on a special case of coalition formation known as\nGraph-Constrained Coalition Formation (GCCF) whereby a network connecting the\nagents constrains the formation of coalitions. We focus on this type of problem\ngiven that in many real-world applications, agents may be connected by a\ncommunication network or only trust certain peers in their social network. We\npropose a novel representation of this problem based on the concept of edge\ncontraction, which allows us to model the search space induced by the GCCF\nproblem as a rooted tree. Then, we propose an anytime solution algorithm\n(CFSS), which is particularly efficient when applied to a general class of\ncharacteristic functions called $m+a$ functions. Moreover, we show how CFSS can\nbe efficiently parallelised to solve GCCF using a non-redundant partition of\nthe search space. We benchmark CFSS on both synthetic and realistic scenarios,\nusing a real-world dataset consisting of the energy consumption of a large\nnumber of households in the UK. Our results show that, in the best case, the\nserial version of CFSS is 4 orders of magnitude faster than the state of the\nart, while the parallel version is 9.44 times faster than the serial version on\na 12-core machine. Moreover, CFSS is the first approach to provide anytime\napproximate solutions with quality guarantees for very large systems of agents\n(i.e., with more than 2700 agents).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 17:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

A major open\nproblem is to devise a constructive version of Banaszczyk's vector balancing\ntheorem, i.e. to find an efficient algorithm which constructs the signed\ncombination.\n  We make progress towards this goal along several fronts. As our first\ncontribution, we show an equivalence between Banaszczyk's theorem and the\nexistence of $O(1)$-subgaussian distributions over signed combinations. For the\ncase of symmetric convex bodies, our equivalence implies the existence of a\nuniversal signing algorithm (i.e. independent of the body), which simply\nsamples from the subgaussian sign distribution and checks to see if the\nassociated combination lands inside the body.

Collisionless,\nphase-mixed, dispersive, Gaussian Alfven pulse in transversely inhomogeneous\nplasma is investigated by particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and by an\nanalytical model.

The numerical and\nanalytical solution of the linear KdV equation produces the pulse amplitude\ndecrease in time as $t^{-1}$. The latter scaling law is corroborated by full\nPIC simulations. It is shown that the pulse amplitude decrease is due to\ndispersive effects, while electron acceleration is due to Landau damping of the\nphase-mixed waves. The established amplitude decrease in time as $t^{-1}$ is\ndifferent from the MHD scaling of $t^{-3/2}$.

To improve the quadrotor stability and\ntrajectory tracking capability in this situation, we fully investigate the\nimpacts of the uncertain load mass on the quadrotor. By comparing the\nperformances of three different controllers -- the proportional-derivative (PD)\ncontroller, the sliding mode controller (SMC), and the model predictive\ncontroller (MPC) -- stabilization rather than trajectory tracking error is\nproved to be the main influence in the load mass uncertainty.

The calculation makes\nuse of the shearing sheet model and is carried out for a range of cooling\ntimes. Although the solutions to the inviscid problem with no cooling or\ndiffusion are well known, it is non-trivial to predict the effect caused by the\nintroduction of cooling and of small diffusivities; this work focuses on\nperturbations of intermediate wavelengths, therefore representing an extension\nto the classical stability analysis on thermal and viscous instabilities.

For Reynolds numbers greater than\n100 and lower solids concentrations, the effective viscosity continues to\nincrease with Reynolds number. However, based on comparisons with pure fluid\nmeasurements the increase in the measured effective viscosity results from the\ntransition to turbulence. The particles augment the turbulence by increasing\nthe magnitude of the measured torques and causing the flow to transition at\nlower Reynolds numbers. For the highest solid fractions, the measurements show\na significant increase in the magnitude of the torques, but the effective\nviscosity is independent of Reynolds number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 21:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

The\nalgorithms perform simultaneous smoothing and enhancement due to the\ncombination of both processes within the PDE-formulation. The framework enables\nthe incorporation of suitable colour and contrast enhancement algorithms within\none unified functional. Additional modification of the formulation includes the\ncombination of the popular Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization\n(CLAHE) with the proposed approach. This modification enables the hybrid\nalgorithm to provide both local enhancement (due to the CLAHE) and global\nenhancement (due to the proposed contrast term). Additionally, the CLAHE clip\nlimit parameter is computed dynamically in each iteration and used to gauge the\namount of local enhancement performed by the CLAHE within the formulation. This\nenables the algorithm to reduce or prevent the enhancement of noisy artifacts,\nwhich if present, are also smoothed out by the anisotropic diffusion term\nwithin the PDE formulation. In other words, the modified algorithm combines the\nstrength of the CLAHE, AD and the contrast term while minimizing their\nweaknesses. Ultimately, the system is optimized using image data metrics for\nautomated enhancement and compromise between visual and quantitative results.\nExperiments indicate that the proposed algorithms perform a series of functions\nsuch as illumination correction, colour enhancement correction and restoration,\ncontrast enhancement and noise suppression. Moreover, the proposed approaches\nsurpass most other conventional algorithms found in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 00:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-15"}

The topic of this paper is the numerical approximation of\nfunctions using the more general notion of frames: that is, complete systems\nthat are generally redundant but provide infinite representations with bounded\ncoefficients. While frames are well-known in image and signal processing,\ncoding theory and other areas of applied mathematics, their use in numerical\nanalysis is far less widespread. Yet, as we show via a series of examples,\nframes are more flexible than bases, and can be constructed easily in a range\nof problems where finding orthonormal bases with desirable properties (rapid\nconvergence, high resolution power, etc.) is difficult or impossible.\n  A key concern when using frames is that computing a best approximation\nrequires solving an ill-conditioned linear system. Nonetheless, we construct a\nframe approximation via regularization with bounded condition number (with\nrespect to perturbations in the data), and which approximates any function up\nto an error of order $\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$, or even of order $\\epsilon$ with\nsuitable modifications. Here $\\epsilon$ is a threshold value that can be chosen\nby the user. Crucially, rate of decay of the error down to this level is\ndetermined by the existence of approximate representations of $f$ in the frame\npossessing small-norm coefficients. We demonstrate the existence of such\nrepresentations in all of our examples. Overall, our analysis suggests that\nframes are a natural generalization of bases in which to develop numerical\napproximation.

Recently, interest has grown in adapting dictionary\nlearning methods for supervised tasks such as classification and inverse\nproblems. We propose two new network layers that are based on dictionary\nlearning: a sparse factorization layer and a convolutional sparse factorization\nlayer, analogous to fully-connected and convolutional layers, respectively.\nUsing our derivations, these layers can be dropped in to existing CNNs, trained\ntogether in an end-to-end fashion with back-propagation, and leverage\nsemisupervision in ways classical CNNs cannot.

This helps prevent\nduplication of work; however there is evidence that existing reward structures\nin research discourage partial-progress sharing. Ensuring PPS is especially\nimportant for new online collaborative-research platforms, which involve many\nresearchers working on large, multi-stage problems.\n  We study the problem of incentivizing information-sharing in research, under\na stylized model: non-identical agents work independently on subtasks of a\nlarge project, with dependencies between subtasks captured via an acyclic\nsubtask-network. Each subtask carries a reward, given to the first agent who\npublicly shares its solution. Agents can choose which subtasks to work on, and\nmore importantly, when to reveal solutions to completed subtasks. Under this\nmodel, we uncover the strategic rationale behind certain anecdotal phenomena.\nMoreover, for any acyclic subtask-network, and under a general model of\nagent-subtask completion times, we give sufficient conditions that ensure PPS\nis incentive-compatible for all agents.\n  One surprising finding is that rewards which are approximately proportional\nto perceived task-difficulties are sufficient to ensure PPS in all acyclic\nsubtask-networks. The fact that there is no tension between local fairness and\nglobal information-sharing in multi-stage projects is encouraging, as it\nsuggests practical mechanisms for real-world settings. Finally, we show that\nPPS is necessary, and in many cases, sufficient, to ensure a high rate of\nprogress in research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 04:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-15"}

We conduct\nexperiments on 4 products to show that the proposed method is effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 06:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-15"}

In the context of\nspot volatility estimation, most of the proposed selection methods are either\nlargely heuristic or just formally stated without any feasible implementation.\nIn this work, an objective method of bandwidth and kernel selection is\nproposed, under some mild conditions on the volatility, which not only cover\nclassical Brownian motion driven dynamics but also some processes driven by\nlong-memory fractional Brownian motions or other Gaussian processes.

Radio observations with upcoming sensitive telescopes\nwill potentially increase the sample size significantly, and allow one to\nfollow the individual bursts for a much longer duration and be able to answer\nsome of the important issues related to true calorimetry, reverse shock\nemission and environments around the massive stars exploding as GRBs in the\nearly Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 07:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

The centre and size of the region gives the most likely\ndirection of propagation and approximate angular extent. The Automated CME\nTriangulation (ACT) method is tested extensively using a series of synthetic\nCME images created using a wireframe flux rope density model, and on a sample\nof real coronagraph data; including halo CMEs. The accuracy of the angular\ndifference between the detection and true input of the synthetic CMEs is 7.14\ndegrees, and remains acceptable for a broad range of CME positions relative to\nthe observer, the relative separation of the three observers and even through\nthe loss of one coronagraph.

Components of physical pairs, thanks to their strict\ncoevality and the mass difference, such as the binary system analysed in this\npaper, are best suited to test the effectiveness of these different techniques.\nWe consider the system WW Psa + TX Psa whose membership of the 25-Myr beta\nPictoris association has been well established by earlier works. We investigate\nwhich age dating technique provides the best agreement between the age of the\nsystem and that of the association. We have photometrically monitored WW Psa\nand TX Psa and measured their rotation periods as P = 2.37d and P = 1.086d,\nrespectively. We have retrieved from the literature their Li equivalent widths\nand measured their effective temperatures and luminosities. We investigate\nwhether the ages of these stars derived using three independent techniques are\nconsistent with the age of the beta Pictoris association. We find that the\nrotation periods and the Li contents of both stars are consistent with the\ndistribution of other bona fide members of the cluster. On the contrary, the\nisochronal fitting provides similar ages for both stars, but a factor of about\nfour younger than the quoted age of the association, or about 30% younger when\nthe effects of magnetic fields are included. We explore the origin of the\ndiscrepant age inferred from isochronal fitting, including the possibilities\nthat either the two components may be unresolved binaries or that the basic\nstellar parameters of both components are altered by enhanced magnetic\nactivity. The latter is found to be the more reasonable cause, suggesting that\nage estimates based on the Li content is more reliable than isochronal fitting\nfor pre-main-sequence stars with pronounced magnetic activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 12:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

Studying the Unruh effect, we show that the inside state of the black\nhole for gluons and quarks can be represented by a maximally entangled two mode\nsqueezed state of inside and matter Hilbert spaces of black hole. Comparing the\nHiggs boson production outside and inside the shell, we observe that at lower\nmass, MBH<4 TeV, and at higher mass, MBH>9 TeV, the Higgs boson will not be\nproduced outside the shell of black hole. However this particle can be produced\ninside the shell for 2.5 TeV<MBH<12.5 TeV.

Finally we calculate the effects of Higgs boson\nradiation due to inside the shell and outside the shell of mini black holes on\nhadronic cross section at LHC.

Based solely on\ngeometric considerations, we propose a frame-invariant metric on the space of\npossible poses, valid for any physical rigid object, and requiring no arbitrary\ntuning. This distance can be evaluated efficiently using a representation of\nposes within an Euclidean space of at most 12 dimensions depending on the\nobject's symmetries.

The enhanced mass-loss from the giant drives\ninteracting mass exchange and makes these systems laboratories for\nunderstanding binary evolution. Studies of the chemical compositions are\nparticularly useful since this parameter has strong impact on the evolutionary\npath. The previous paper in this series presented photospheric abundances for\n24 giants in S-type SySt enabling a first statistical analysis. Here we present\nresults for an additional sample of 13 giants. The aims are to improve\nstatistics of chemical composition involved in the evolution of SySt, to study\nevolutionary status, mass transfer and to interpret this in terms of Galactic\npopulations. High-resolution, near-IR spectra are used, employing the spectrum\nsynthesis method in a classical approach, to obtain abundances of CNO and\nelements around the iron peak (Fe, Ti, Ni). Low-resolution spectra in the\nregion around the Ca II triplet were used for spectral classification. The\nmetallicities obtained cover a wide range with a maximum around ~-0.2 dex. The\nenrichment in the 14N isotope indicates that these giants have experienced the\nfirst dredge-up. Relative O and Fe abundances indicate that most SySt belong to\nthe Galactic disc; however, in a few cases, the extended thick-disc/halo is\nsuggested. Difficult to explain, relatively high Ti abundances can indicate\nthat adopted microturbulent velocities were too small by ~0.2-0.3 km/s.

The selected measurements should minimize a\ncertain error function assessing the error in estimating a certain $m$\ndimensional parameter vector. The exhaustive search inspecting each of the\n$n\\choose k$ possible choices would require a very high computational\ncomplexity and as such is not practical for large $n$ and $k$. Alternative\nmethods with low complexity have recently been investigated but their main\ndrawbacks are that 1) they require perfect knowledge of the measurement matrix\nand 2) they need to be applied at the pace of change of the measurement matrix.\nTo overcome these issues, we consider the asymptotic regime in which $k$, $n$\nand $m$ grow large at the same pace. Tools from random matrix theory are then\nused to approximate in closed-form the most important error measures that are\ncommonly used. The asymptotic approximations are then leveraged to select\nproperly $k$ measurements exhibiting low values for the asymptotic error\nmeasures. Two heuristic algorithms are proposed: the first one merely consists\nin applying the convex optimization artifice to the asymptotic error measure.\nThe second algorithm is a low-complexity greedy algorithm that attempts to look\nfor a sufficiently good solution for the original minimization problem. The\ngreedy algorithm can be applied to both the exact and the asymptotic error\nmeasures and can be thus implemented in blind and channel-aware fashions. We\npresent two potential applications where the proposed algorithms can be used,\nnamely antenna selection for uplink transmissions in large scale multi-user\nsystems and sensor selection for wireless sensor networks.

This\nmasking mixes power, and E-convergence and B-modes. To study the accuracy of\nforward-modelling and full-sky power spectrum recovery we consider both\nlarge-area survey geometries, and small-scale masking due to stars and a\ncheckerboard model for field-of-view gaps. The power spectrum for the\nlarge-area survey geometry is sparsely-sampled and highly oscillatory, which\nmakes modelling problematic. Instead, we derive an overall calibration for\nlarge-area mask bias using simulated fields. The effects of small-area star\nmasks can be accurately corrected for, while the checkerboard mask has\noscillatory and spiky behaviour which leads to percent biases. Apodisation of\nthe masked fields leads to increased biases and a loss of information. We find\nthat we can construct an unbiased forward-model of the raw PCls, and recover\nthe full-sky convergence power to within a few percent accuracy for both\nGaussian and lognormal-distributed shear fields.

The hygroscopic swelling of individual fibres and their interactions\nwithin the fibrous network govern the macroscopic response. At this scale,\nmoisture induced instabilities and out-of-plane deformations may occur. This\nwork focuses on several aspects of this issue. A macroscopic phenomenological\nhygro-mechanical model is first proposed, which aims at predicting moisture\ninduced out-of-plane deformations in paper sheets. The constitutive model is\nbased on the relation between these deformations and typical irreversible\nphenomena associated to the history of paper manufacturing, i.e. the release of\ndried-in strains. The model is used to describe bending induced by moisture\ngradients through the thickness of the sheet as well as buckling due to\nmoisture variation in the presence of mechanical constraints. The results of\nthe model show that the anisotropic sheet-level hygro-expansion has a strong\ninfluence on the instability phenomena. Moreover, a comparison with experiments\nprovides adequate semi-quantitative estimates. An additional step is made\ntowards the multi-scale understanding of paper hygro-mechanics. The fundamental\nmechanisms governing the macroscopic moisture induced response are investigated\non the basis of the underlying fibrous network. To this aim, a meso-structural\nmodel is developed which consists of a network of fibres randomly positioned in\na planar region according to an orientation probability density function. A\nseries of network simulations reveals that upon moisture content variations the\nexpansion of the inter-fibre bonding regions drives the overall deformation.\nParticularly in the case of anisotropic fibre orientation, this explains the\norigin of the macro-scale anisotropic hygro-expansion, which is essential for\nthe observed sheet-level instability phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 15:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-11"}

This is a manifestation of metabolic\nadvantage, which bigger organisms need to have in order to support their\nmetabolic requirements. On the other hand, this advantage cannot be too strong,\nwhich could lead to destruction of species, organisms feed on or compete for\nnutrients within the food chain. Accounting for this regular increase of\nnutrient influx, we obtained allometric exponents and their range close to\nexperimental values.

The nature of musculoskeletal interconnection facilitates stability,\nvoluntary movement, and robustness to injury. However, a fundamental\nunderstanding of this network and its control by neural systems has remained\nelusive. Here we utilize medical databases and mathematical modeling to reveal\nthe organizational structure, predicted function, and neural control of the\nmusculoskeletal system. We construct a whole-body musculoskeletal network in\nwhich single muscles connect to multiple bones via both origin and insertion\npoints. We demonstrate that a muscle's role in this network predicts\nsusceptibility of surrounding components to secondary injury. Finally, we\nillustrate that sets of muscles cluster into network communities that mimic the\norganization of motor cortex control modules. This novel formalism for\ndescribing interactions between the muscular and skeletal systems serves as a\nfoundation to develop and test therapeutic responses to injury, inspiring\nfuture advances in clinical treatments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 21:43:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-20"}

To capture the inter-seasonal variations in renewable\ngeneration of a future grid scenario necessitates the use of computationally\nintensive time-series analysis. In this paper, we propose a planning framework\nfor fast stability scanning of future grid scenarios using a novel feature\nselection algorithm and a novel self-adaptive PSO-k-means clustering algorithm.\nTo achieve the computational speed-up, the stability analysis is performed only\non small number of representative cluster centroids instead of on the full set\nof operating conditions. As a case study, we perform small-signal stability and\nsteady-state voltage stability scanning of a simplified model of the Australian\nNational Electricity Market with significant penetration of renewable\ngeneration. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach.
