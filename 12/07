Promoting the center of\nthe Skyrmion to a dynamic quantity, the fluctuations around the Skyrmionic\nconfiguration give rise to a time-dependent damping of the Skyrmion motion.\nFrom the frequency dependence of the damping kernel, we are able to identify\nthe Skyrmion mass, thus providing a microscopic description of the kinematic\nproperties of Skyrmions. When defects are present or a magnetic trap is\napplied, the Skyrmion mass acquires a finite value proportional to the\neffective spin, even at vanishingly small temperature. We demonstrate that a\nSkyrmion in a confined geometry provided by a magnetic trap behaves as a\nmassive particle owing to its quasi-one-dimensional confinement.

Moisture\ntransport to this region is important for climate projections because it drives\nthe formation of local cirrus (ice) clouds, which have a disproportionate\nimpact on the Earth's radiative balance. Deep cumulus towers carrying large\nvolumes of ice are known to reach the TTL, but their importance to the water\nbudget has been debated for several decades. We show here that profiles of the\nisotopic composition of water vapor can provide a quantitative estimate of the\nconvective contribution to TTL moistening. Isotopic measurements from the ACE\nsatellite instrument, in conjunction with ice loads inferred from CALIOP\nsatellite measurements and simple mass-balance modeling, suggest that\nconvection is the dominant source of water vapor in the TTL up to\nnear-tropopause altitudes. The relatively large ice loads inferred from CALIOP\nsatellite measurements can be produced only with significant water sources, and\nisotopic profiles imply that these sources are predominantly convective ice.\nSublimating ice from deep convection appears to increase TTL cirrus by a factor\nof several over that expected if cirrus production were driven only by\nlarge-scale uplift; sensitivity analysis implies that these conclusions are\nrobust for most physically reasonable assumptions.

What is of interest is that Planck's constant remains\nfinite at all steps in the calculation and that the classical motion is\nobtained as the result of a central limit theorem. More explicitly we show that\nif the system is sufficiently large, and if the CM is initially uncorrelated\nwith other degrees of freedom, then the CM follows a smooth trajectory and\nobeys the classical Hamilton-Jacobi with a vanishing quantum potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2016 16:53:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Jul 2017 16:36:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-01"}

In spatially\nheterogeneous environments, rapidly gaining knowledge about the local\nenvironment is key to the evolutionary success of a migrating population. For\nhistorical human migration, environmental heterogeneity was naturally\nasymmetric in the north-south (NS) and east-west (EW) directions. We here\nconsider the human migration process in the Americas, modeled as random,\nasymmetric, modularly correlated environments. Knowledge about the environments\ndetermines the fitness of each individual. We present a phase diagram for\nasymmetry of migration as a function of carrying capacity and fitness\nthreshold. We find that the speed of migration is proportional to the inverse\ncomplement of the spatial environmental gradient, and in particular we find\nthat north-south migration rates are lower than east-west migration rates when\nthe environmental gradient is higher in the north-south direction.\nCommunication of knowledge between individuals can help to spread beneficial\nknowledge within the population. The speed of migration increases when\ncommunication transmits pieces of knowledge that contribute in a modular way to\nthe fitness of individuals. The results for the dependence of migration rate on\nasymmetry and modularity are consistent with existing archaeological\nobservations.

Third, we elaborate on\nsmall displacements by introducing a sub-network specializing on small motions.\nFlowNet 2.0 is only marginally slower than the original FlowNet but decreases\nthe estimation error by more than 50%.

Moreover, we present faster\nvariants that allow optical flow computation at up to 140fps with accuracy\nmatching the original FlowNet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2016 17:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

It is\nalso much simpler than other distribution matching methods. CORAL performs\nremarkably well in extensive evaluations on standard benchmark datasets.

In this Letter, for ARs observed up to 60o from\ndisk center, we demonstrate a method of measuring and reducing the projection\nerror in the magnitude of any whole-AR parameter derived from a vector\nmagnetogram that has been deprojected to disk center. The method assumes that\nthe center-to-limb curve of the average of the parameter's absolute values\nmeasured from the disk passage of a large number of ARs and normalized to each\nAR's absolute value of the parameter at central meridian, gives the average\nfractional projection error at each radial distance from disk center. To\ndemonstrate the method, we use a large set of large-flux ARs and apply the\nmethod to a whole-AR parameter that is among the simplest to measure: whole-AR\nmagnetic flux. We measure 30,845 SDO/HMI vector magnetograms covering the disk\npassage of 272 large-flux ARs, each having whole-AR flux >1022 Mx.

The average projection error in the measured\nwhole-AR flux of an AR at a given radial distance is removed by multiplying the\nmeasured flux by the correction factor given by the fit. The correction is\nimportant for both the study of evolution of ARs and for improving the accuracy\nof forecasting an AR's major flare/CME productivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2016 18:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

The analysis considers the\nsystem matrix to be chosen from the large class of rotationally invariant\nrandom matrices. We take a statistical mechanical approach by introducing a\nspin glass corresponding to the estimator, and employing the replica method for\nthe large-system analysis. In contrast to earlier replica based studies, our\nanalysis evaluates the general replica ansatz of the corresponding spin glass\nand determines the asymptotic distortion of the estimator for any structure of\nthe replica correlation matrix. Consequently, the replica symmetric as well as\nthe Replica Symmetry (RS) breaking ansatz with $b$ steps of breaking is deduced\nfrom the given general replica ansatz. The generality of our distortion\nfunction lets us derive a more general form of the MAP decoupling principle.\nBased on the general replica ansatz, we show that for any structure of the\nreplica correlation matrix, the vector-valued system decouples into a bank of\nequivalent decoupled linear systems followed by MAP estimators. The structure\nof the decoupled linear system is further studied under both the RS and the\nReplica Symmetry Breaking (RSB) assumptions.

We use this representation to extract more information from an image\nat the pixel level, hence gaining understanding of the whole image. We\nexperimentally demonstrate the usefulness of our framework using a pretrained\nVGG-16 model to perform segmentation on the BAERI dataset of Synthetic Aperture\nRadar(SAR) imagery and the CAMVID dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2016 20:28:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

We consider a variant of\nthis model in which the companion is a giant planet with an orbital radius of a\nfew au. Guided by the results of published numerical simulations, we model the\ndynamical evolution of this system by dividing the disk into inner and outer\nparts---separated at the location of the planet---that behave as distinct,\nrigid disks.

Leaky HII region models can only shift line ratios\nslightly relative to HII region models, and thus fail to explain the\ncomposite/LI(N)ER line ratios displayed by DIG. Our result favors ionization by\nevolved stars as a major ionization source for DIG with LI(N)ER-like emission.\n  DIG can significantly bias the measurement of gas metallicity and metallicity\ngradients derived using strong-line methods. Metallicities derived using N2O2\nare optimal because they exhibit the smallest bias and error. Using O3N2, R23,\nN2=[NII]/H\\alpha, and N2S2H\\alpha\\ (Dopita et al. 2016) to derive metallicities\nintroduces bias in the derived metallicity gradients as large as the gradient\nitself. The strong-line method of Blanc et al.

The duration of this formation period can be measured using\nthe ratio of magnesium to iron abundance ([Mg/Fe]), which reflects the relative\nenrichment by core-collapse and type Ia supernovae. For local galaxies, [Mg/Fe]\nprobes the combined formation history of all stars currently in the galaxy,\nincluding younger and metal-poor stars that were added during late-time\nmergers. Therefore, to directly constrain the initial star-formation period, we\nmust study galaxies at earlier epochs. The most distant galaxy for which\n[Mg/Fe] had previously been measured is at z~1.4, with\n[Mg/Fe]=0.45(+0.05,-0.19). A slightly earlier epoch (z~1.6) was probed by\nstacking the spectra of 24 massive quiescent galaxies, yielding an average\n[Mg/Fe] of 0.31+/-0.12. However, the relatively low S/N of the data and the use\nof index analysis techniques for both studies resulted in measurement errors\nthat are too large to allow us to form strong conclusions. Deeper spectra at\neven earlier epochs in combination with analysis techniques based on full\nspectral fitting are required to precisely measure the abundance pattern\nshortly after the major star-forming phase (z>2). Here we report a measurement\nof [Mg/Fe] for a massive quiescent galaxy at z=2.1. With [Mg/Fe]=0.59+/-0.11,\nthis galaxy is the most Mg-enhanced massive galaxy found so far, having twice\nthe Mg enhancement of similar-mass galaxies today. The abundance pattern of the\ngalaxy is consistent with enrichment exclusively by core-collapse supernovae\nand with a star-formation timescale of 0.1-0.5 Gyr - characteristics that are\nsimilar to population II stars in the Milky Way. With an average past SFR of\n600-3000 Msol/yr, this galaxy was among the most vigorous star-forming galaxies\nin the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2016 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

Among them, model calibration is a crucial step in order to provide\naccurate and thus meaningful images and requires the estimation of all the\nperturbation effects introduced along the signal propagation path, for a\nspecific source direction and antenna position. Usually, it is common to\nperform model calibration using the a priori knowledge regarding a small number\nof known strong calibrator sources but under the assumption of Gaussianity of\nthe noise. Nevertheless, observations in the context of radio astronomy are\nknown to be affected by the presence of outliers which are due to several\ncauses, e.g., weak non-calibrator sources or man made radio frequency\ninterferences. Consequently, the classical Gaussian noise assumption is\nviolated leading to severe degradation in performances. In order to take into\naccount the outlier effects, we assume that the noise follows a spherically\ninvariant random distribution. Based on this modeling, a robust calibration\nalgorithm is presented in this paper. More precisely, this new scheme is based\non the design of an iterative relaxed concentrated maximum likelihood\nestimation procedure which allows to obtain closed-form expressions for the\nunknown parameters with a reasonable computational cost.

Following the\nobservations of GW150914 and GW151226, the rate and mass of coalescing binary\nblack holes appear to be greater than many previous expectations. As a result,\nthe stochastic background from unresolved compact binary coalescences is\nexpected to be particularly loud. We perform a search for the isotropic\nstochastic gravitational-wave background using data from Advanced LIGO's first\nobserving run. The data display no evidence of a stochastic gravitational-wave\nsignal. We constrain the dimensionless energy density of gravitational waves to\nbe $\\Omega_0<1.7\\times 10^{-7}$ with 95% confidence, assuming a flat energy\ndensity spectrum in the most sensitive part of the LIGO band (20-86 Hz). This\nis a factor of ~33 times more sensitive than previous measurements. We also\nconstrain arbitrary power-law spectra. Finally, we investigate the implications\nof this search for the background of binary black holes using an astrophysical\nmodel for the background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2016 21:20:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 22:25:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 18:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-17"}

We uncover the physical origins of the peaks in the nuclear\nKER spectra and ascribe them to mechanisms such as ionization following a\nresonant dipole transition, charge-resonance-enhanced ionization (CREI) and\nionization in the dissociative limit of large internuclear distances. For\nrelatively large pulse durations, i.e., for 15 or more laser cycles at 3200 nm\nand 10 or more at 6400 nm, it is possible for the nuclear wave packet in\nH$_{2}^{+}$ to reach very large separations. Ionization of this part of the\nwave packet results in peaks in the KER spectra with very low energies.

It is natural to ask (e.g., in the\ncontext of data driven optimization) how robust such properties are, and\nwhether small deviations from them can be tolerated. We consider two such\nquestions in the important special case of linear set functions.\n  One question that we address is whether any set function that approximately\nsatisfies the modularity equation (linear functions satisfy the modularity\nequation exactly) is close to a linear function. The answer to this is positive\n(in a precise formal sense) as shown by Kalton and Roberts [1983] (and further\nimproved by Bondarenko, Prymak, and Radchenko [2013]). We revisit their proof\nidea that is based on expander graphs, and provide significantly stronger upper\nbounds by combining it with new techniques. Furthermore, we provide improved\nlower bounds for this problem.\n  Another question that we address is that of how to learn a linear function\n$h$ that is close to an approximately linear function $f$, while querying the\nvalue of $f$ on only a small number of sets. We present a deterministic\nalgorithm that makes only linearly many (in the number of items) nonadaptive\nqueries, by this improving over a previous algorithm of Chierichetti, Das,\nDasgupta and Kumar [2015] that is randomized and makes more than a quadratic\nnumber of queries.

When the sound speed is\nsmall, the curvature perturbation is enhanced, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio,\nwhich is excessively large in the original model, can be sufficiently\nsuppressed to be consistent with observational bounds. Then, we study the\nprimordial three-point correlation function generated during the\nmatter-dominated contraction stage and find that it only depends on the sound\nspeed parameter. Similar to the canonical case, the shape of the bispectrum is\nmainly dominated by a local form, though for some specific sound speed values a\nnew shape emerges and the scaling behaviour changes. Meanwhile, a small sound\nspeed also results in a large amplitude of non-Gaussianities, which is\ndisfavored by current observations. As a result, it does not seem possible to\nsuppress the tensor-to-scalar ratio without amplifying the production of\nnon-Gaussianities beyond current observational constraints (and vice versa).\nThis suggests an extension of the previously conjectured no-go theorem in\nsingle field nonsingular matter bounce cosmologies, which rules out a large\nclass of models.

(2) Using a simple algorithm based on network metrics, we\nefficiently select the sub-network to use at any given time to maintain a\ntarget reliability. (3) When streaming video from Netflix, we experimentally\nshow (using measurements from a WARP radio testbed employing DIQIF relaying)\nthat our adaptive PHY cooperation scheme provides a throughput gain of 2x over\nnonadaptive PHY schemes, and a gain of 6x over genie-aided IP-level adaptive\nrouting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2016 22:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-08"}

For practical mathematical modelling of such\nsystems we require efficient and accurate methodologies for reducing the\ndimension of the original system and extracting the emergent dynamics. Common\nmathematical approximations for determining the emergent dynamics often rely on\nself-consistency arguments or limits as the aspect ratio of the 'large' and\n'thin' dimensions becomes unphysically infinite. Here we build on a new\napproach, previously establish for systems which are large in only one\ndimension, which analyses the dynamics at each cross-section of the domain with\na rigorous multivariate Taylor series. Then centre manifold theory supports the\nlocal modelling of the system's emergent dynamics with coupling to neighbouring\ncross-sections treated as a non-autonomous forcing. The union over all\ncross-sections then provides powerful support for the existence and emergence\nof a centre manifold model global in the large finite domain. Quantitative\nerror estimates are determined from the interactions between the cross-section\ncoupling and both fast and slow dynamics. Two examples provide practical\ndetails of our methodology.

The observed changes in external\nluminescence suggest strong modifications of photon recycling caused by the\npresence of the emitter. Photon recycling for propagating modes is affected by\nreflection at the vacuum-emitter interface and is substantially decreased by\nthe leakage towards the emitter through tunneling of frustrated modes. In\naddition, spontaneous emission by the cell can be strongly enhanced by the\npresence of an emitter supporting surface polariton modes. It follows that\nusing a radiative recombination model with a spatially uniform radiative\nlifetime, even corrected by a photon recycling factor, is inappropriate.\nApplying the principles of detailed balance, and accounting for non-radiative\nrecombination mechanisms, the impact of external luminescence enhancement in\nthe near field on thermophotovoltaic performance is investigated. It is shown\nthat unlike isolated cells, the external luminescence efficiency is not solely\ndependent on cell quality, but significantly increases as the vacuum gap\nthickness decreases below 400 nm for the case of an intrinsic silicon emitter.\nIn turn, the open-circuit voltage and power density benefit from this enhanced\nexternal luminescence toward the emitter.

It is\nactually a very peculiar feature of the proposed PDE system that viscous fluids\nare treated just as a special case of elasto-plastic solids. This is achieved\nby introducing a strain relaxation mechanism in the evolution equations of the\ndistortion matrix.

We show that this is due to the presence of most\nprobable physical ultra-wide pairs. These UWPs are biased towards high\nmultiplicity and higher-stellar-mass components at shorter separations. The\nmultiplicity fraction per ultra-wide pair with separation less than 10 kAU may\nbe as high as 83.5 $\\pm$ 19.6\\%. We suggest that these young pre-main sequence\nUWPs may be pristine imprints of their spatial configuration at birth resulting\nfrom a cascade fragmentation scenario of the natal molecular core. They could\nbe the older counterparts, at least for those separated by less than 10 kAU, to\nthe $\\le$ 0.5 Myr prestellar cores/Class 0 multiple objects observed at\nradio/mm wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2016 02:25:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

Besides,\nwe want to assess the relevance as a func- tion of the deformation of the EFA\napproach which has been already found out at ground state deformation.\n  Methods: Calculations within the Hartree-Fock plus BCS with self-consistent\nparticle blocking have been performed using the SkM* Skyrme effective\ninteraction in the particle-hole channel and a seniority force in the\nparticle-particle channel. Axial symmetry has been imposed throughout the whole\nfission path while the intrinsic parity symmetry has been allowed to be broken\nin the outer fission barrier region.\n  Results: Potential energy curves have been determined for six different\nconfigurations in U-235 and four in Pu-239. Inner and outer fission barriers\nhave been calculated along with some spectroscopic properties in the fission\nisomeric well. These results have been compared with available data. The\ninfluence of time-reversal breaking mean fields on the solutions has been\ninvestigated.\n  Conclusions: A sizeable configuration dependence of the fission barrier\n(width and height) has been demonstrated. A reasonable agreement with available\nsystematic evaluations of fission barrier heights has been found. The EFA\napproach has been validated at the large elongations occurring at the outer\nbarrier region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2016 05:30:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

To solve this problem, we model multiple Personal, Social\nand Environmental (PSE) constraints on human motion across cameras. The\npersonal constraints include appearance and preferred speed of each individual\nassumed to be similar across the non-overlapping cameras. The social influences\n(constraints) are quadratic in nature, i.e. occur between pairs of individuals,\nand modeled through grouping and collision avoidance. Finally, the\nenvironmental constraints capture the transition probabilities between gates\n(entrances / exits) in different cameras, defined as multi-modal distributions\nof transition time and destination between all pairs of gates. We incorporate\nthese constraints into an energy minimization framework for solving human\nre-identification. Assigning $1-1$ correspondence while modeling PSE\nconstraints is NP-hard. We present a stochastic local search algorithm to\nrestrict the search space of hypotheses, and obtain $1-1$ solution in the\npresence of linear and quadratic PSE constraints. Moreover, we present an\nalternate optimization using Frank-Wolfe algorithm that solves the convex\napproximation of the objective function with linear relaxation on binary\nvariables, and yields an order of magnitude speed up over stochastic local\nsearch with minor drop in performance. We evaluate our approach using\nCumulative Matching Curves as well $1-1$ assignment on several thousand frames\nof Grand Central, PRID and DukeMTMC datasets, and obtain significantly better\nresults compared to existing re-identification methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2016 09:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-08"}

This Letter provides a simple analytical and\nconceptual demonstration that this voltage loss is directly and inextricably\nlinked to a reduction in the field enhancement factor (FEF) at the post apex. A\nformula relating apex-FEF reduction to this voltage loss was obtained in the\npaper by E. Minoux, O. Groening, K. B. K. Teo, S. H. Dalal, L. Gangloff, J.-P.\nSchnell, L. Hudanski, I. Y. Y. Bu., P.

This Letter derives the same formula\nanalytically, by using a \"floating sphere\" model. The analytical proof brings\nout the underlying physics more clearly, and shows that the effect is a general\nphenomenon, related to reduction in the magnitude of the surface charge in the\nmost protruding parts of an emitter. Voltage-dependent FEF-reduction is one\ncause of \"saturation\" in Fowler-Nordheim plots. Another is a voltage-divider\neffect, due to measurement-circuit resistance. An integrated theory of both\neffects is presented. Both together, or either by itself, can cause saturation.\nExperimentally, if saturation occurs but voltage loss is small (< 20 V, say),\nthen saturation is more probably due to FEF-reduction than voltage division. In\nthis case, existing treatments of electrostatic interaction (\"shielding\")\nbetween closely spaced emitters may need modification. Other putative causes of\nsaturation exist, so the present theory is a partial story. Its extension seems\npossible, and could lead to a more general physical understanding of the causes\nof FN-plot saturation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2016 10:36:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Mar 2017 17:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-19"}

In prior work (Guy et al.,\nAdv Comput Math, 2015), some of us developed a geometric multigrid\npreconditioner for a stable semi-implicit IB method under Stokes flow\nconditions; however, this solver methodology used a Vanka-type smoother that\npresented limited opportunities for parallelization. This work extends this\nStokes-IB solver methodology by developing smoothing techniques that are\nsuitable for parallel implementation. Specifically, we demonstrate that an\nadditive version of the Vanka smoother can yield an effective multigrid\npreconditioner for the Stokes-IB equations, and we introduce an efficient Schur\ncomplement-based smoother that is also shown to be effective for the Stokes-IB\nequations. We investigate the performance of these solvers for a broad range of\nmaterial stiffnesses, both for Stokes flows and flows at nonzero Reynolds\nnumbers, and for thick and thin structural models. We show here that linear\nsolver performance degrades with increasing Reynolds number and material\nstiffness, especially for thin interface cases. Nonetheless, the proposed\napproaches promise to yield effective solution algorithms, especially at lower\nReynolds numbers and at modest-to-high elastic stiffnesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2016 11:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-08"}

One of the most promising ways\nto achieve this consists in engineering the target front by introducing\nperiodic nanostructures.\n  In this paper, the effect of these structures on ion acceleration is studied\nanalytically and with multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. We\nassessed the role of the structure shape, size, and the angle of laser\nincidence for obtaining the efficient energy transfer. Local control of\nelectron trajectories is exploited to maximise the energy delivered into the\ntarget.

However, no simple way to estimate the potential\nprecision of such timing measures has been presented yet, nor are guidelines\navailable regarding the relation between timing errors and sampling rate.\n  Aims: A `timing error estimator' (TEE) equation is presented that requires\nonly basic transit parameters as input. With the TEE, it is straightforward to\nestimate timing precisions both for actual data as well as for future\ninstruments, such as the TESS and PLATO space missions.\n  Methods: A derivation of the timing error based on a trapezoidal transit\nshape is given. We also verify the TEE on realistically modeled transits using\nMonte Carlo simulations and determine its validity range, exploring in\nparticular the interplay between ingress/egress times and sampling rates.\n  Results: The simulations show that the TEE gives timing errors very close to\nthe correct value, as long as the temporal sampling is faster than transit\ningress/egress durations and transits with very low S/N are avoided.\n  Conclusions: The TEE is a useful tool to estimate eclipse or transit timing\nerrors in actual and future data-sets. In combination with an equation to\nestimate period errors (Deeg 2015), predictions for the ephemeris precision of\nlong-coverage observations are possible as well. The tests for the TEE's\nvalidity-range led also to implications for instrumental design: Temporal\nsampling has to be faster than transit in- or egress durations, or a loss in\ntiming-precision will occur. An application to the TESS mission shows that\ntransits close to its detection limit will have timing uncertainties that\nexceed 1 hour within a few months after their acquisition.

In this paper,\nwe address the question whether it is possible to unveil how the underlying\nanatomical connectivity shape the brain's spontaneous correlation structure. We\nstart from the assumption that in order for two nodes to exhibit large\ncovariation, they must be exposed to similar input patterns from the entire\nnetwork. We then acknowledge that information rarely spreads only along an\nunique route, but rather travels along all possible paths. In real networks the\nstrength of local perturbations tends to decay as they propagate away from the\nsources, leading to a progressive attenuation of the original information\ncontent and, thus, of their influence. We use these notions to derive a novel\nanalytical measure, $\\mathcal{T}$ , which quantifies the similarity of the\nwhole-network input patterns arriving at any two nodes only due to the\nunderlying topology, in what is a generalization of the matching index. We show\nthat this measure of topological similarity can indeed be used to predict the\ncontribution of network topology to the expected correlation structure, thus\nunveiling the mechanism behind the tight but elusive relationship between\nstructure and function in complex networks. Finally, we use this measure to\ninvestigate brain connectivity, showing that information about the topology\ndefined by the complex fabric of brain axonal pathways specifies to a large\nextent the time-average functional connectivity observed at rest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2016 13:47:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-01"}

The\napproach is based on the framework of the second quantization method in the\npresence of bound states of particles and the method of reduced description of\nrelaxation processes. Within the approach we developed the first-order\nperturbation theory over the weak interaction for a system of kinetic equations\nfor the Wigner distribution functions of free fermions of both kinds and their\nbound states, the hydrogen-like atoms. It is shown that the conditions of\nlow-temperature approximation, of the gas non-degeneracy and the approximation\nof weak interaction are realistic and can be met in a wide range of\ntemperatures and the densities of the studied system. We obtain dispersion\nequations for determining the frequency and wave attenuation coefficients in\ndilute weakly ionized gas of hydrogen-like atoms near the described equilibrium\nstate. In the two-level atom approximation it is shown that in the system there\nare longitudinal waves of matter polarization and transverse waves with the\nbehavior characteristic of plasmon polaritons. The expressions for the\ndependence of the frequency and the Landau damping coefficients on the wave\nvector for all branches of the oscillations detected, are obtained.\nQuantitative estimations of the characteristics of the elementary perturbations\nin the system on an example of a weakly ionized dilute gas of Na-23 atoms are\npresented.

Extensive experiments on four benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that the deeply-learned features with L-softmax loss\nbecome more discriminative, hence significantly boosting the performance on a\nvariety of visual classification and verification tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2016 15:36:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 07:28:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 08:32:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 23:23:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-21"}

However, enforcing this strict guarantee\nin practice significantly distorts data and/or limits data uses, thus\ndiminishing the analytical utility of the differentially private results. In an\nattempt to address this shortcoming, several relaxations of differential\nprivacy have been proposed that trade off privacy guarantees for improved data\nutility. In this work, we argue that the standard formalization of differential\nprivacy is stricter than required by the intuitive privacy guarantee it seeks.\nIn particular, the standard formalization requires indistinguishability of\nresults between any pair of neighbor data sets, while indistinguishability\nbetween the actual data set and its neighbor data sets should be enough. This\nlimits the data controller's ability to adjust the level of protection to the\nactual data, hence resulting in significant accuracy loss. In this respect, we\npropose individual differential privacy, an alternative differential privacy\nnotion that offers em the same privacy guarantees as standard differential\nprivacy to individuals (even though not to groups of individuals). This new\nnotion allows the data controller to adjust the distortion to the actual data\nset, which results in less distortion and more analytical accuracy.

The dark\nsector of the universe should also be in the same equilibrium state with dark\nmatter and dark energy coupled to each other and emits gravitational phonon\nblackbody radiation which is the main component of the cosmic background\nradiation. In the radiation-dominated era such gravitational radiation should\nbe the majority species of the cosmic medium. Instead of the ideal fluid\nassumed by the standard cosmological model LCDM, the universe has to be taken\nas a thermodynamic system consisting of gravitationally connected dark energy\nand matter. Besides particle dynamics, statistical thermodynamics is also\nnecessary for understanding the cosmological constitution and evolution\nhistory. As an alternative to LCDM we constructed a dark-energy-matter-coupled\n(DEMC) cosmological model. Based on the relativistic mass-energy relation,\nconservation law of energy, Lagrange's equation with variable potential\nfunction, mean-field theory of continuous phase transition, and the symmetry\nprinciple of the kinetic coefficients, we deduced dynamic equations of the\nexpansion of a DEMC universe with three parameters. These equations reproduce\nthe observed history of the rate of expansion of our universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2016 06:33:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

The piezoelectric materials are shown as being capable of\nproducing induction forces in external objects and we conclude that the nature\nof the forces generated are not originated from the traditional interactions.\nFurther we specifically assert that the generation of forces by the\npiezoelectric materials is ruled by the hypothesis of preexisting condition of\ngeneralized quantum entanglement between the molecular structure of the\nmaterial bulk and the surrounding environment. In addition the widely spread\ncoupling of the molecules with the environment can be manifested from the\nso-called direct effect or the converse effect in piezoelectric materials and\nthis coupling is not intermediated by acoustic waves or electromagnetic fields.\nWe show that the novel effect has a theoretical explanation consistent with the\ngeneralized quantum entanglements and the direction of the induced forces\ndepends on either the direction of the mechanical force or the electric field\napplied in these materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2016 19:52:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

Different field configurations are looked at in\norder to study various phenomena including multiphoton pair production,\nSauter-Schwinger pair production and dynamically assisted pair production. The\nmain focus lies on pulsed, rotating fields with one main frequency component\nwhich are called rotating Sauter pulses. The results are obtained via two\nnumerical methods, that rest on different theoretical approaches. A generic\nmethod is derived from the Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner (DHW) formalism which\nentails a modified quantum kinetic equation. We call the numerical solution of\nthis equation the Wigner method. Other types of equations are derived from the\nDHW formalism as well and numerically solved with the aim to include magnetic\nfields. In the case of rotating Sauter pulses a completely different numerical\nmethod is developed, which is based on a semiclassical approach and therefore\ncalled the semiclassical method. A number of parameter studies are conducted to\nunderstand pair production in rotating Sauter pulses. The Wigner method and the\nsemiclassical method are compared exhaustively and found to complement each\nother. This makes it possible to cover the complete range of parameters of the\nrotating Sauter pulse, which helps to calculate the pair production rates for\nexperiments involving counter-propagating circularly polarized laser light. An\ninterpretation of the pair production spectra is given. Due to the general\nnature of the Wigner method it is possible to study more general field\nconfigurations which include pulses with elliptic polarization, chirp or\nbichromatic rotating Sauter pulses. Each of these exhibit interesting features,\nincluding the dynamically assisted Schwinger effect in bichromatic pulses,\nwhich could be useful in planning high-intensity laser experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2016 15:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-19"}

We first propose a multi-tier communication\nnetwork architecture for smart metering applications in dense urban\nenvironments. Our measurement campaign, without any competition from other CR\noperators, reveals that the communication architecture can achieve more than\n1Mbps data rates using the free unlicensed TVWS spectrum. However, anticipating\nstiff competition for the unlicensed TVWS spectrum among CR operators and to\nsupport smart grid applications with stringent Quality of Service (QoS)\nrequirements, we further exploit the novel idea of high priority channels (HPC)\nthat the CR operator can temporarily lease by paying a small fee. This poses\nseveral new challenges for the CR operators, such as, their economic viability\nwhile providing QoS guarantees. We develop a real-time decision support\nframework with several adjustable parameters for the CR operators that enables\nthem to tradeoff HPC leasing cost and QoS. The developed algorithms are simple\nrules that provide significant opportunities to the CR operators to maintain a\nbalance between spectrum cost and QoS depending on dynamic spectrum\navailability and smart grid application requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2016 23:19:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-13"}
