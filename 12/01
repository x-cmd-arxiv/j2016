Several so-called likelihood-free methods have been developed to\nperform inference in the absence of a likelihood function. The popular\nsynthetic likelihood approach infers the parameters by modelling summary\nstatistics of the data by a Gaussian probability distribution. In another\npopular approach called approximate Bayesian computation, the inference is\nperformed by identifying parameter values for which the summary statistics of\nthe simulated data are close to those of the observed data. Synthetic\nlikelihood is easier to use as no measure of `closeness' is required but the\nGaussianity assumption is often limiting. Moreover, both approaches require\njudiciously chosen summary statistics. We here present an alternative inference\napproach that is as easy to use as synthetic likelihood but not as restricted\nin its assumptions, and that, in a natural way, enables automatic selection of\nrelevant summary statistic from a large set of candidates. The basic idea is to\nframe the problem of estimating the posterior as a problem of estimating the\nratio between the data generating distribution and the marginal distribution.\nThis problem can be solved by logistic regression, and including regularising\npenalty terms enables automatic selection of the summary statistics relevant to\nthe inference task.

There is a ramification $\\QQ$-divisor\n$\\Delta$ on $X$, which is related to the canonical bimodule $\\omega_\\Lambda$ by\nan adjunction formula. It only depends on the class of $\\Sigma$ in the Brauer\ngroup of $\\KK$. When the numerical abundance conjecture holds true, or when\n$\\Sigma$ is a central simple algebra, we show that the Gelfand-Kirillov\ndimension (or GK dimension) of the canonical ring of $\\Lambda$ is one more than\nthe Iitaka dimension (or D-dimension) of the log pair $(X,\\Delta)$. In the case\nthat $\\Sigma$ is a division algebra, we further show that this GK dimension is\nalso one more than the transcendence degree of the division algebra of degree\nzero fractions of the canonical ring of $\\Lambda$. We prove that these\ndimensions are birationally invariant when the b-log pair determined by the\nramification divisor has b-canonical singularities. In that case we refer to\nthe Iitaka (or D-dimension) of $(X,\\Delta)$ as the Kodaira dimension of the\norder $\\Lambda$. For this, we establish birational invariance of the Kodaira\ndimension of b-log pairs with b-canonical singularities. We also show that the\nKodaira dimension can not decrease for an embedding of central simple algebras,\nfinite dimensional over their centres, which induces a Galois extension of\ntheir centres, and satisfies a condition on the ramification which we call an\neffective embedding. For example, this condition holds if the target central\nsimple algebra has the property that its period equals its index.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 17:33:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2017 09:51:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 15:44:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 16:16:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

It is therefore desirable to understand it in the context of\ncausal sets, especially since they provide in a natural manner the UV cutoff\nneeded to render entanglement entropy finite. Formulating a notion of\nentanglement entropy in a causal set is not straightforward because the type of\ncanonical hypersurface-data on which its definition typically relies is not\navailable. Instead, we appeal to the more global expression given in\narXiv:1205.2953 which, for a gaussian scalar field, expresses the entropy of a\nspacetime region in terms of the field's correlation function within that\nregion (its \"Wightman function\" $W(x,x')$). Carrying this formula over to the\ncausal set, one obtains an entropy which is both finite and of a Lorentz\ninvariant nature. We evaluate this global entropy-expression numerically for\ncertain regions (primarily order-intervals or \"causal diamonds\") within causal\nsets of 1+1 dimensions. For the causal-set counterpart of the entanglement\nentropy, we obtain, in the first instance, a result that follows a (spacetime)\nvolume law instead of the expected (spatial) area law. We find, however, that\none obtains an area law if one truncates the commutator function (\"Pauli-Jordan\noperator\") and the Wightman function by projecting out the eigenmodes of the\nPauli-Jordan operator whose eigenvalues are too close to zero according to a\ngeometrical criterion which we describe more fully below. In connection with\nthese results and the questions they raise, we also study the \"entropy of\ncoarse-graining\" generated by thinning out the causal set, and we compare it\nwith what one obtains by similarly thinning out a chain of harmonic\noscillators, finding the same, \"universal\" behaviour in both cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 17:37:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 06:56:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 19:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-13"}

A difficulty with long-time simulations of\ntraveling waves is that the solution leaves any bounded computational domain in\nfinite time. To handle this problem one should go into a suitable co-moving\nframe. Since the velocity of the wave is typically unknown, we use the method\nof freezing [Beyn, Th\\\"ummler 2004], see also [Beyn, Otten, Rottmann-Matthes\n2014], which transforms the original partial differential equation (PDE) into a\npartial differential algebraic equation (PDAE) and calculates a suitable\nco-moving frame on the fly.

One of the most celebrated\nresults of this type is the Ruzsa-Szemer\\'edi triangle removal lemma, which\nstates that if a graph is $\\varepsilon$-far from being triangle free, then most\nsubsets of vertices of size $C(\\varepsilon)$ are not triangle free.\nUnfortunately, the best known upper bound on $C(\\varepsilon)$ is given by a\ntower-type function, and it is known that $C(\\varepsilon)$ is not polynomial in\n$\\varepsilon^{-1}$. The triangle removal lemma has been extended to many other\ngraph properties, and for some of them the corresponding function\n$C(\\varepsilon)$ is polynomial. This raised the natural question, posed by\nGoldreich in 2005 and more recently by Alon and Fox, of characterizing the\nproperties for which one can prove removal lemmas with polynomial bounds.\n  Our main results in this paper are new sufficient and necessary criteria for\nguaranteeing that a graph property admits a removal lemma with a polynomial\nbound. Although both are simple combinatorial criteria, they imply almost all\nprior positive and negative results of this type. Moreover, our new sufficient\nconditions allow us to obtain polynomially bounded removal lemmas for many\nproperties for which the previously known bounds were of tower-type. In\nparticular, we show that every {\\em semi-algebraic} graph property admits a\npolynomially bounded removal lemma. This confirms a conjecture of Alon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 19:07:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-01"}

Capable of producing eggs with a certain dry resistance as\nwell as cold hardiness, populations of Ae. albopictus became distributed around\nthe globe. The invasion of the Ae. albopictus across all over the world is\nthought to be the most rapid spread of any insect species in the last four\ndecades in tropical, subtropical and temperate climate zones. In addition, Ae.\nalbopictus is a potential vector for at least 27 viruses as well as for several\nparasites and plays a major role in the global transmission of dengue virus and\nchikungunya virus; and its contribution to the rapid spread of zika virus is\ncurrently under investigation. Therefore, this species is considered a serious\nthreat to public health worldwide. This work broaches the issue of three\ninvestigations about the potential to adapt and establish stabile populations\nof the invasive Asian tiger mosquito Ae. albopictus. As a result of these\ninvestigations, a high potential for this species to become a threat to public\nhealth in many more countries, especially in temperate climatic zones, can be\nseen. Due to the fact on the one hand that Ae. albopictus can gain fitness\nadvantages due to misapplied vector control measures and on the other hand of\nthe high epigenetically adaptation potential, it is in summary recommended to\nfocus further research on the development of vaccinations for viruses and other\npathogens. By doing so, citizens will be protected without putting ecosystems\nand their services in danger and it is the even more economic solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 19:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-01"}

However, this task is challenging due to the non-convex\nnature of the matching metric over the plausible registration parameter space\nand insufficient approaches for a robust optimization. As a result, current\napproaches are often customized to a specific problem and sensitive to image\nquality and artifacts. In this paper, we propose a completely different\napproach to image registration, inspired by how experts perform the task. We\nfirst cast the image registration problem as a \"strategy learning\" process,\nwhere the goal is to find the best sequence of motion actions (e.g. up, down,\netc.) that yields image alignment. Within this approach, an artificial agent is\nlearned, modeled using deep convolutional neural networks, with 3D raw image\ndata as the input, and the next optimal action as the output. To cope with the\ndimensionality of the problem, we propose a greedy supervised approach for an\nend-to-end training, coupled with attention-driven hierarchical strategy. The\nresulting registration approach inherently encodes both a data-driven matching\nmetric and an optimal registration strategy (policy).

Over the last decades, alternative methods have been proposed\nthat can infer causal relations between variables from certain statistical\npatterns in purely observational data. We introduce Joint Causal Inference\n(JCI), a novel approach to causal discovery from multiple data sets from\ndifferent contexts that elegantly unifies both approaches. JCI is a causal\nmodeling framework rather than a specific algorithm, and it can be implemented\nusing any causal discovery algorithm that can take into account certain\nbackground knowledge. JCI can deal with different types of interventions (e.g.,\nperfect, imperfect, stochastic, etc.) in a unified fashion, and does not\nrequire knowledge of intervention targets or types in case of interventional\ndata. We explain how several well-known causal discovery algorithms can be seen\nas addressing special cases of the JCI framework, and we also propose novel\nimplementations that extend existing causal discovery methods for purely\nobservational data to the JCI setting. We evaluate different JCI\nimplementations on synthetic data and on flow cytometry protein expression data\nand conclude that JCI implementations can considerably outperform\nstate-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 20:50:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 12:43:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 21:18:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 8 Apr 2019 12:42:55 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 12:14:39 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 08:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-21"}

After an\nappropriate mapping, hydrodynamical simulations are conducted using the\nmoving-mesh code AREPO. The giant profiles are approximated by replacing the\ncore of the giant with a point mass and by constructing a suitable continuation\nof the profile to the center. Different reconstruction methods are tested that\ncan specifically control the convective behaviour of the model. After mapping\nto a grid, a relaxation procedure that includes damping of spurious velocities\nyields stable models in three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. Initially\nconvectively stable configurations lead to stable hydrodynamical models while\nfor stratifications that are convectively unstable in the stellar evolution\ncode, simulations recover the convective behaviour of the initial model and\nshow large convective plumes with Mach numbers up to 0.8. Examples are shown\nfor a $2M_\\odot$ red giant and a $0.67M_\\odot$ asymptotic giant branch star. A\ndetailed analysis shows that the improved method reliably provides stable\nmodels of giant envelopes that can be used as initial conditions for subsequent\nhydrodynamical simulations of stellar interactions involving giant stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

The SM matter and Higgs fields propagate from\nthe UV brane down to this intermediate brane only, while gauge and gravity\nfields propagate in the entire bulk. Such a configuration renders the lightest\ngauge Kaluza-Klein (KK) states within LHC reach, simultaneously satisfying\nflavor and CP constraints. In addition, the usual leading decay modes of the\nlightest KK gauge bosons into top and Higgs bosons are suppressed. This effect\npermits erstwhile subdominant channels to become significant. These include\nflavor-universal decays to SM fermions and Higgs bosons, and a novel channel -\ndecay to a radion and a SM gauge boson, followed by radion decay to a pair of\nSM gauge bosons. In this work, we first delineate the parameter space where the\nabove mentioned cascade decay of gauge KK particles dominates, and thereby can\nbe the discovery mode at the LHC. We then perform a detailed analysis of the\nLHC signals from this model, finding that 300/fb suffices for evidence of\nKK-gluon in tri-jet, jet + di-photon and jet + di-boson channels. However, KK\nphoton in photon + di-jet, and KK-W in leptonic W + di-jet require 3000/fb.

This phenomenon arises from the anisotropic exchange\ninteraction, and is distinct from the orbital effect, such as van Vleck\nsusceptibility. It is shown that while the quadratic term in the magnetization\nfavors to point the spins along the bond, the fourth order term in\nmagnetization prefers to point spins to the perpendicular direction.

Despite their promising\nresults on major structure regions such as edges and lines, they still suffer\nfrom limited performance on texture regions that consist of very complex and\nfine patterns. This is because, during the acquisition of a low-resolution (LR)\nimage via down-sampling, these regions lose most of the high frequency\ninformation necessary to represent the texture details. In this paper, we\npresent a novel texture enhancement framework for SISR to effectively improve\nthe spatial resolution in the texture regions as well as edges and lines. We\ncall our method, high-resolution (HR) style transfer algorithm. Our framework\nconsists of three steps: (i) generate an initial HR image from an interpolated\nLR image via an SISR algorithm, (ii) generate an HR style image from the\ninitial HR image via down-scaling and tiling, and (iii) combine the HR style\nimage with the initial HR image via a customized style transfer algorithm.\nHere, the HR style image is obtained by down-scaling the initial HR image and\nthen repetitively tiling it into an image of the same size as the HR image.\nThis down-scaling and tiling process comes from the idea that texture regions\nare often composed of small regions that similar in appearance albeit sometimes\ndifferent in scale. This process creates an HR style image that is rich in\ndetails, which can be used to restore high-frequency texture details back into\nthe initial HR image via the style transfer algorithm. Experimental results on\na number of texture datasets show that our proposed HR style transfer algorithm\nprovides more visually pleasing results compared with competitive methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 00:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-02"}

The EVs can inject energies by discharging via a\nVehicle-to-Grid (V2G) service which can enhance the profits of the charging\nstation. However, frequent charging and discharging degrade battery life. A\nproper compensation needs to be paid to the users to participate in the V2G\nservice. We propose a menu-based pricing scheme, where the charging station\nselects a price for each arriving user for the amount of battery utilization,\nthe total energy, and the time (deadline) that the EV will stay. The user can\naccept one of the contracts or rejects all depending on their utilities. The\ncharging station can serve users using a combination of the renewable energy\nand the conventional energy bought from the grid. We show that though there\nexists a profit maximizing price which maximizes the social welfare, it\nprovides no surplus to the users if the charging station is aware of the\nutilities of the users. If the charging station is not aware of the exact\nutilities, the social welfare maximizing price may not maximize the expected\nprofit. In fact, it can give a zero profit. We propose a pricing strategy which\nprovides a guaranteed fixed profit to the charging station and it also\nmaximizes the expected profit for a wide range of utility functions. Our\nanalysis shows that when the harvested renewable energy is small the users have\nhigher incentives for the V2G service. We, numerically, show that the charging\nstation's profit and the user's surplus both increase as V2G service is\nefficiently utilized by the pricing mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 01:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-05"}

One of the\nmain challenges is contamination by artifacts, especially in regions of strong\nunresolved emission. We present a novel method for identifying candidates for\nvariables and transients from the outputs of such surveys' data pipelines. We\nuse the method to systematically search for novae in iPTF observations of the\nbulge of M31. We demonstrate that most artifacts produced by the iPTF pipeline\nform a locally uniform background of false detections approximately obeying\nPoissonian statistics, whereas genuine variables and transients as well as\nartifacts associated with bright stars result in clusters of detections, whose\nspread is determined by the source localization accuracy. This makes the\nproblem analogous to source detection on images produced by X-ray telescopes,\nenabling one to utilize tools developed in X-ray astronomy. In particular, we\nuse a wavelet-based source detection algorithm from the Chandra data analysis\npackage CIAO. Starting from ~2.5x10^5 raw detections made by the iPTF data\npipeline, we obtain ~4000 unique source candidates. Cross-matching these\ncandidates with the source-catalog of a deep reference image, we find\ncounterparts for ~90% of them. These are either artifacts due to imperfect PSF\nmatching or genuine variable sources. The remaining ~400 detections are\ntransient sources. We identify novae among these candidates by applying\nselection cuts based on the expected properties of nova lightcurves.

Especially, the internal\ndistribution of angular momenta is closely related to the formation of disk\ngalaxies. In this article, we use haloes identified from a high-resolution\nsimulation, the Bolshoi simulation, to study the spatial distribution of\nspecific angular momenta, $j(r,\\theta)$. We show that by stacking haloes with\nsimilar masses to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, the profile can be fitted\nas a simple function, $j(r,\\theta)=j_s \\sin^2(\\theta/\\theta_s)\n(r/r_s)^2/(1+r/r_s)^4 $, with three free parameters, $j_s, r_s$, and\n$\\theta_s$. Specifically, $j_s$ correlates with the halo mass $M_\\mathrm{vir}$\nas $j_s\\propto M_\\mathrm{vir}^{2/3}$, $r_s$ has a weak dependence on the halo\nmass as $r_s \\propto M_\\mathrm{vir}^{0.040}$, and $\\theta_s$ is independent of\n$M_\\mathrm{vir}$. This profile agrees with that from a rigid shell model,\nthough its origin is unclear. Our universal specific angular momentum profile\n$j(r,\\theta)$ is useful in modelling haloes' angular momenta. Furthermore, by\nusing an empirical stellar mass - halo mass relation, we can infer the averaged\nangular momentum distribution of a dark matter halo. The specific angular\nmomentum - stellar mass relation within a halo computed from our profile is\nshown to share a similar shape as that from the observed disk galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 02:42:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 02:21:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

However, in locally stationary context, to catch the\ndynamic nature of regression function, we adopt a flexible varying-coefficient\nadditive model where the regression function has the form\n$\\alpha_{0}\\left(u\\right)+\\sum_{k=1}^{p}\\alpha_{k}\\left(u\\right)\\beta_{k}\\left(x_{k}\\right).$\nFor this model, we propose a three-step spline estimation method for each\nunivariate nonparametric function, and show its consistency and $L_{2}$ rate of\nconvergence. Furthermore, based upon the three-step estimators, we develop a\ntwo-stage penalty procedure to identify pure additive terms and\nvarying-coefficient terms in varying-coefficient additive model. As expected,\nwe demonstrate that the proposed identification procedure is consistent, and\nthe penalized estimators achieve the same $L_{2}$ rate of convergence as the\npolynomial spline estimators. Simulation studies are presented to illustrate\nthe finite sample performance of the proposed three-step spline estimation\nmethod and two-stage model selection procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 04:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-02"}

This\npaper focuses on designing profit maximization offering strategies, i.e., the\nstrategies that determine the offering price and volume, for a storage-assisted\nrenewable power producer that participates in hour-ahead electricity market.\nDesigning the strategies is challenging since (i) the underlying problem is\ncoupled across time due to the evolution of the storage level, and (ii) inputs\nto the problem including the renewable output and market clearing price are\nunknown when submitting offers. Following the competitive online algorithm\ndesign approach, we first study a basic setting where the renewable output and\nthe clearing price are known for the next hour. We propose sOffer, a simple\nonline offering strategy that achieves the best possible competitive ratio of\nO(log \\theta), where $\\theta$ is the ratio between the maximum and the minimum\nclearing prices.

Also for this class, we devise the first polynomial time algorithm and\nuse it as a building block for our main algorithm.\n  We then develop a polynomial time computable transformation mapping a\nmultimarket Cournot competition game with firm-specific affine price functions\nand quadratic costs to an associated atomic splittable congestion game as\ndescribed above. The transformation preserves equilibria in either games and,\nthus, leads -- via our first algorithm -- to a polynomial time algorithm\ncomputing Cournot equilibria. Finally, our analysis for integrally-splittable\ngames implies new bounds on the difference between real and integral Cournot\nequilibria. The bounds can be seen as a generalization of the recent bounds for\nsingle market oligopolies obtained by Todd [2016].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 10:09:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 12:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2018 10:48:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 15 Mar 2018 21:24:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 8 Aug 2018 07:00:21 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 08:20:17 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sun, 1 Aug 2021 11:01:29 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 16:15:15 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sun, 8 May 2022 16:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

In particular,\nfast reactors, which are experiencing a growing interest for their ability to\nburn radioactive waste, operate in the high energy region of the neutron\nspectrum. In this energy region most recent evaluations disagree due to\ninconsistencies in the existing measurements of up to 15%. In addition, the\nassessment of nuclear data uncertainty performed for innovative reactor systems\nshows that the uncertainty in the radiative capture cross-section of 238U\nshould be further reduced to 1-3% in the energy region from 20 eV to 25 keV. To\nthis purpose, addressed by the Nuclear Energy Agency as a priority nuclear data\nneed, complementary experiments, one at the GELINA and two at the n_TOF\nfacility, were proposed and carried out within the 7th Framework Project ANDES\nof the European Commission.\n  The results of one of these 238U(n,g) measurements performed at the n_TOF\nCERN facility are presented in this work.

Unfortunately,\ncurrent theories of the evolution and formation of CDWDs are still poorly\nconstrained and have several serious uncertainties, which affect the predicted\nSN Ia rates. Moreover, current observational constraints on this evolutionary\npathway for SN Ia mainly rely on only 18 double-lined and/or eclipsing CDWDs\nwith measured orbital and stellar parameters for both white dwarfs. In this\npaper we present the orbital periods and the individual masses of three new\ndouble-lined CDWDs, derived using a new method.

Based upon their morphological\nproperties in X-rays, they are classified as un-relaxed and relaxed clusters\nand often host (a fraction of them) different types of non-thermal radio\nemitting components, viz., haloes, mini-haloes, relics and phoenix within their\nIntra Cluster Medium (ICM). The radio haloes show steep (alpha = -1.2) and\nultra steep (alpha < -1.5) spectral properties at low radio frequencies, giving\nimportant insights on the merger (pre or post) state of the cluster. Ultra\nsteep spectrum radio halo emissions are rare and expected to be the dominating\npopulation to be discovered via LOFAR and SKA in the future. Further, the\ndistribution of matter (morphological information), alignment of hot X-ray\nemitting gas from the ICM with the total mass (dark + baryonic matter) and the\nbright cluster galaxy (BCG) is generally used to study the dynamical state of\nthe cluster. We present here a multi wavelength study on 14 massive clusters\nfrom the CLASH survey and show the correlation between the state of their\nmerger in X-ray and spectral properties (1.4 GHz - 150 MHz) at radio\nwavelengths. Using the optical data we also discuss about the gas-mass\nalignment, in order to understand the interplay between dark and baryonic\nmatter in massive galaxy clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 12:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-02"}

First, severe power ramping events in\ndaily operation due to the high variability of wind power generation pose great\nchallenges to multi-year planning decision making. Second, the long\nconstruction periods of transmission lines may not be able to keep pace with\nthe fast growing uncertainty due to the increasing integration of renewable\nenergy generation. To address such issues, we propose a comprehensive robust\nplanning model considering different resources, namely, transmission lines,\ngenerators, and FACTS devices. Various factors are taken into account,\nincluding flexibility requirement, construction period, and cost. We construct\nthe hourly net load ramping uncertainty (HLRU) set to characterize the\nvariation of hourly net load including wind power generation, and the annual\nnet load duration curve uncertainty (LDCU) set for the uncertainty of normal\nannual net load duration curve. This results in a two-stage robust optimization\nmodel with two different types of uncertainty sets, which are decoupled into\ntwo different sets of subproblems to make the entire solution process\ntractable. Numerical simulations with real-world data show that the proposed\nmodel and solution method are effective to coordinate different flexible\nresources, rendering robust expansion planning strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 12:57:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-02"}

Multiword expressions are a group of words which refers\nto some conventional or regional way of saying things.

The word sequences matching the required pattern are subjected to\na series of linguistic tests which include verb filtering, named entity\nfiltering and hyphenation filtering test to exclude false positives. The\ncandidates are then checked for semantic relationships among themselves (using\nWordnet).

Kassiopeia features a new algorithmic paradigm for\nparticle tracking simulations which targets experiments containing complex\ngeometries and electromagnetic fields, with high priority put on calculation\nefficiency, customizability, extensibility, and ease of use for novice\nprogrammers. To solve Kassiopeia's target physics problem the software is\ncapable of simulating particle trajectories governed by arbitrarily complex\ndifferential equations of motion, continuous physics processes that may in part\nbe modeled as terms perturbing that equation of motion, stochastic processes\nthat occur in flight such as bulk scattering and decay, and stochastic surface\nprocesses occuring at interfaces, including transmission and reflection\neffects. This entire set of computations takes place against the backdrop of a\nrich geometry package which serves a variety of roles, including initialization\nof electromagnetic field simulations and the support of state-dependent\nalgorithm-swapping and behavioral changes as a particle's state evolves. Thanks\nto the very general approach taken by Kassiopeia it can be used by other\nexperiments facing similar challenges when calculating particle trajectories in\nelectromagnetic fields.

Since finding the control gain for\nsuch controller is hard, we focus on finding an optimal controller among a\nclassical family of controllers which is based on Algebraic Riccati Equation\n(ARE) and guarantees asymptotic consensus. Through analysis, we find that the\nenergy cost is bounded by an interval and hence we minimize the upper bound. In\norder to do that, there are two classes of variables that need to be optimized:\nthe control gain and the edge weights of the graph and are hence designed from\ntwo perspectives. A suboptimal control gain is obtained by choosing $Q=0$ in\nthe ARE. Negative edge weights are allowed, and the problem is formulated as a\nSemi-definite Programming (SDP) problem. Having negative edge weights means\nthat \"competitions\" between the agents are allowed. The motivation behind this\nsetting is to have a better system performance.

The majority of countries in Africa and nearly one third of all\ncountries require mortality models to infer complete age schedules of\nmortality, required for population estimates, projections/forecasts and many\nother tasks in demography and epidemiology. Models that relate child mortality\nto mortality at other ages are important because all countries have measures of\nchild mortality.\n  OBJECTIVE. 1) Design a general model for age-specific mortality that provides\na standard way to relate covariates to age-specific mortality. 2) Calibrate\nthat model using the relationship between child or child/adult mortality and\nmortality at other ages. 3) Validate the calibrated model and compare its\nperformance to existing models.\n  METHODS. A general, parametrizable component model of mortality is designed\nusing the singular value decomposition (SVD-Comp) and calibrated to the\nrelationship between child or child/adult mortality and mortality at other ages\nin the observed mortality schedules of the Human Mortality Database. Cross\nvalidation is used to validate the model, and the predictive performance of the\nmodel is compared to that of the Log-Quad model, designed to do the same thing.\n  RESULTS. Prediction and cross validation tests indicate that the child\nmortality-calibrated SVD-Comp is able to accurately represent the observed\nmortality schedules in the Human Mortality Database, is robust to the selection\nof mortality schedules used to calibrate it, and performs better than the\nLog-Quad Model.\n  CONCLUSIONS. The child mortality-calibrated SVD-Comp is a useful tool that\ncan be used where child mortality is available but mortality at other ages is\nunknown. Together with earlier work on an HIV prevalence-calibrated version of\nSVD-Comp, this work suggests that this approach is truly general and could be\nused to develop a wide range of additional useful models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 03:37:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-06"}

However, this is complicated by the\nfact that these measurements are irregularly sampled and influenced by both\ngenuine physiological changes and external factors. In their current forms,\nexisting regression algorithms often do not fulfil all of a clinician's\nrequirements for identifying short-term events while still being able to\nidentify long-term trends in disease progression. Therefore, in order to\nbalance both short term interpretability and long term flexibility, an\nextension to broken-stick regression models is proposed in order to make them\nmore suitable for modelling clinical time series. The proposed probabilistic\nbroken-stick model can robustly estimate both short-term and long-term trends\nsimultaneously, while also accommodating the unequal length and irregularly\nsampled nature of clinical time series. Moreover, since the model is parametric\nand completely generative, its first derivative provides a long-term non-linear\nestimate of the annual rate of change in the measurements more reliably than\nlinear regression. The benefits of the proposed model are illustrated using\nestimated glomerular filtration rate as a case study for managing patients with\nchronic kidney disease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 17:50:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-06"}

The\nexcitability of Zero-Group Velocity (ZGV) resonances in isotropic plates is\ninvestigated both theoretically and experimentally for axially symmetric\nsources. Optimal parameters and amplitude gains are derived analytically for\nspot and annular sources of either Gaussian or rectangular energy profiles. For\na Gaussian spot source, the optimal radius is found to be $\\lambda_{ZGV}/\\pi$.\nAnnular sources increase the amplitude by at least a factor of 3 compared to\nthe optimal Gaussian source. Rectangular energy profiles provide higher gain\nthan Gaussian ones. These predictions are confirmed by semi-analytical\nsimulation of the thermoelastic generation of Lamb waves, including the effect\nof material attenuation. Experimentally, Gaussian ring sources of controlled\nwidth and radius are produced with an axicon-lens system. Measured optimal\ngeometric parameters obtained for Gaussian and annular beams are in good\nagreement with theoretical predictions. A ZGV resonance amplification factor of\n2.1 is obtained with the Gaussian ring. Such source should facilitate the\ninspection of highly attenuating plates made of low ablation threshold\nmaterials like composites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 17:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-09"}

The energy of the 2 level system is identified. In\nan MOS implementation, this arises from the electrostatic potential energy of\nthe electrons on the gate to source capacitance of the cross coupled MOS\ntransistors. The electrostatic energy, upon co-ordinate transformation,\n(incorporating the nonlinear MOS device behaviour and cross coupling), yields\nan expression for the 2 level system energy. The 2 level system, described\nunder the transformed co-ordinate, is simulated. Simulation on the dynamics of\nthe system shows a metastsable state and two stable states, corresponding to\nthe a maximum(metastable) energy and a minimum(stable) energy, as predicted by\nthe energy expression in the model. This result agrees with earlier attempt\nbased on nonlinear dynamic system approach, whereby the potential is\ninterpreted from the point of view of the gradient of vector field. In\naddition, the model gives physical design insight on how the change in circuit\nparameters (such as gm, R), affects the energy characteristics, hence leads to\neffective design of such 2 level system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 05:22:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-13"}

However, many bad decisions taken due to faulty spreadsheets\nshow that these tools need serious quality assurance. Furthermore, while\ncollaboration on spreadsheets for maintenance tasks is common, there has been\nalmost no support for ensuring that the spreadsheets remain correct during this\nprocess.\n  We have developed an approach named Spreadsheet Guardian which separates the\nspecification of spreadsheet test rules from their execution. By automatically\nexecuting user-defined test rules, our approach is able to detect semantic\nfaults. It also protects all collaborating spreadsheet users from introducing\nfaults during maintenance, even if only few end-users specify test rules. To\nevaluate Spreadsheet Guardian, we implemented a representative testing\ntechnique as an add-in for Microsoft Excel.\n  We evaluated the testing technique in two empirical evaluations with 29\nend-users and 42 computer science students. The results indicate that the\ntechnique is easy to learn and to apply. Furthermore, after finishing\nmaintenance, participants with spreadsheets \"protected\" by the technique are\nmore realistic about the correctness of their spreadsheets than participants\nwho employ only \"classic\", non-interactive test rules based on static analysis\ntechniques. Hence, we believe Spreadsheet Guardian can be of use for\nbusiness-critical spreadsheets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 21:31:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 13:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2017 17:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-01"}

In addition, identifying services\nthat relate to highly attractive districts is useful to make policies regarding\nthe placement of such places. Thus, we present a framework for classifying\ndistricts in cities by their attractiveness to visitors, and relating Points of\nInterests (POIs) types to districts' attraction patterns. We used\nOrigin-Destination matrices (ODs) mined from cell phone data that capture the\nflow of trips between each pair of places in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We define\nthe attraction profile for a place based on three main statistical features:\nThe amount of visitors a place received, the distribution of distance traveled\nby visitors on the road network, and the spatial spread of where visitors come\nfrom. We use a hierarchical clustering algorithm to classify all places in the\ncity by their features of attraction. We detect three types of Urban Attractors\nin Riyadh during the morning period: Global which are significant places in the\ncity, Downtown which the central business district and Residential attractors.\nIn addition, we uncover what makes these places different in terms of\nattraction patterns. We used a statistical significance testing approach to\nrigorously quantify the relationship between Points of Interests (POIs) types\n(services) and the 3 patterns of Urban Attractors we detected. The proposed\nframework can be used for detecting the attraction patterns given by type of\nservices related to each pattern. This is a critical piece of information to\ninform trip distribution models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 16:24:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-31"}
