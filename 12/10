Recent studies have shown that the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC) has a very extended disk strikingly perturbed in its outskirts. We search\nfor recent star formation in the far outskirts of the LMC, out to ~30 degrees\nfrom its center. We have collected intermediate-resolution spectra of\nthirty-one young star candidates in the periphery of the LMC and measured their\nradial velocity, stellar parameters, distance and age. Our measurements confirm\nmembership to the LMC of six targets, for which the radial velocity and\ndistance values match well those of the Cloud. These objects are all young\n(10-50 Myr), main-sequence stars projected between 7 and 13 degrees from the\ncenter of the parent galaxy. We compare the velocities of our stars with those\nof a disk model, and find that our stars have low to moderate velocity\ndifferences with the disk model predictions, indicating that they were formed\nin situ. Our study demonstrates that recent star formation occurred in the far\nperiphery of the LMC, where thus far only old objects were known. The spatial\nconfiguration of these newly-formed stars appears ring-like with a radius of 12\nkpc, and a displacement of 2.6 kpc from the LMC's center. This structure, if\nreal, would be suggestive of a star-formation episode triggered by an\noff-center collision between the Small Magellanic Cloud and the LMC's disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 16:11:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

These regimes additionally discriminate the\ncompletely different behaviors of several static physical properties, namely\nthe total number of excitations, the photon statistics of the field, and the\ncavity-qubit entanglement. Finally, we explain the dynamical properties which\nare traditionally associated to the deep strong coupling regime, such as the\ncollapses and revivals of the state population, in the frame of the proposed\nspectral classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 17:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-27"}

The celebrated quantum Rabi model describes the simplest\ninteraction of a two-level system with a single-mode boson field. When the\ncoupling is large enough, the bare multilevel structure of a realistic circuit\natom cannot be ignored even if the circuit is strongly anharmonic. We explored\nthis situation theoretically for flux (fluxonium) and charge (Cooper pair box)\ntype multi-level circuits tuned to their respective flux/charge degeneracy\npoints. We identified which spectral features of the quantum Rabi model survive\nand which are renormalized for large coupling. Despite significant\nrenormalization of the low-energy spectrum in the fluxonium case, the key\nquantum Rabi feature -- nearly-degenerate vacuum consisting of an atomic state\nentangled with a multi-photon field -- appears in both types of circuits when\nthe coupling is sufficiently large. Like in the quantum Rabi model, for very\nlarge couplings the entanglement spectrum is dominated by only two, nearly\nequal eigenvalues, in spite of the fact that a large number of bare atomic\nstates are actually involved in the atom-resonator ground state. We interpret\nthe emergence of the two-fold degeneracy of the vacuum of both circuits as an\nenvironmental suppression of flux/charge tunneling due to their dressing by\nvirtual low-/high-impedance photons in the resonator. For flux tunneling, the\ndressing is nothing else than the shunting of a Josephson atom with a large\ncapacitance of the resonator. Suppression of charge tunneling is a\nmanifestation of the dynamical Coulomb blockade of transport in tunnel\njunctions connected to resistive leads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 17:23:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2017 17:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-14"}

Typically, bandgap analyses and predictions rely on the assumption\nof traveling waves in an infinite medium, and do not take advantage of modal\nrepresentations typically used for the analysis of the dynamic behavior of\nfinite structures. Recently, we developed a method for understanding the\nlocally resonant bandgap in uniform finite metamaterial beams using modal\nanalysis. Here we extend that framework to general locally resonant\nmetastructures with specified boundary conditions using a general operator\nformulation. Using this approach, along with the assumption of an infinite\nnumber of resonators tuned to the same frequency, the frequency range of the\nlocally resonant bandgap is easily derived in closed form. Furthermore, the\nbandgap expression is shown to be the same regardless of the type of vibration\nproblem under consideration, depending only on the added mass ratio and target\nfrequency. It is shown that the number of resonators required for the bandgap\nto appear increases with the target frequency range, i.e. respective modal\nneighborhood. Furthermore, it is observed that there is an optimal, finite\nnumber of resonators which gives a bandgap that is wider than the\ninfinite-absorber bandgap, and that the optimal number of resonators increases\nwith target frequency and added mass ratio. As the number of resonators becomes\nsufficiently large, the bandgap converges to the derived infinite-absorber\nbandgap. The derived bandgap edge frequencies are shown to agree with results\nfrom dispersion analysis using the plane wave expansion method.

The goal of the algorithm is to recover~$x$ exactly (with\nhigh probability), while minimizing samples (number of traces) and running\ntime.\n  Previously, the best known algorithm for the trace reconstruction problem was\ndue to Holenstein~et~al.; it uses $\\exp(\\tilde{O}(n^{1/2}))$ samples and\nrunning time for any fixed $0 < \\delta < 1$.

While\nphotoionization by the ultraviolet background (UVB) is a viable option, it\ntends to predict large line-of-sight thickness for the absorbing gas. Here, we\nstudy the implications of the recently updated UVB at low-z to understand the\nionization mechanisms of intervening Ne VIII absorbers. With the updated UVB,\none typically needs higher density and metallicity to reproduce the observed\nionic column densities under photoionization. Both reduce the inferred\nline-of-sight thicknesses of the absorbers.

Therefore, a continuous injection of heat is required in\norder to enhance the detectability of the collisionally ionized gas. Using\nphotoionization models we find that in almost all Ne VIII systems the inferred\nlow ion metallicity is near solar or supersolar. If we assume the Ne VIII phase\nto have similar metallicities then photoionization can reproduce the observed\nN(Ne VIII)/N(O VI) without the line-of-sight thickness being unreasonably large\nand avoids cooling issues related to the collisional ionization at these\nmetallicities.

We\nuse extinction-corrected rest-frame U-V colors to divide both AGN hosts and\nnon-AGN galaxies into red sequence (quiescent), green valley (transition), and\nblue cloud (star-forming) populations. We find that both the AGN fraction at\nfixed stellar mass and its evolution with redshift are dependent on host\ncolors. Most notably, red galaxies have the lowest AGN fraction (~5\\%) at z~1\nyet with most rapid redshift evolution, increasing by a factor of 5 (~24\\%) at\nz~2. Green galaxies exhibit the highest AGN fraction across all redshifts,\nwhich is most pronounced at z~2 with more than half of them hosting an AGN at\n$M_{*} > 10^{10.6} M_{\\odot}$. Together with the high AGN fraction in red\ngalaxies at z~2, this indicates that X-ray AGNs could be important in both\ntransforming blue galaxies into red ones and subsequently maintaining their\nquiescence at high redshift. Furthermore, consistent with low-redshift studies,\nwe find that the probability of hosting an AGN in the total galaxy population\ncan be characterized by a universal Eddington ratio ($p(\\lambda_{Edd}) \\sim\n\\lambda_{Edd}^{-0.4}$) and a moderate redshift evolution. Yet consistent with\ntheir different AGN fractions, different populations appear to also have\ndifferent $p(\\lambda_{Edd})$ with red galaxies exhibiting more rapid redshift\nevolution than green and blue ones. Evidence for a steeper power law of\n$p(\\lambda_{Edd})$ in red galaxies is also presented, though larger samples are\nneeded to confirm. These results suggest that the AGN accretion or the growth\nof supermassive black holes is related to their host properties, and may also\ninfluence their hosts in a different mode dependent on the host color.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 21:00:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2017 09:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

Is there a direct relation\nbetween the shape parameters of the void size distribution and the\nenvironmental effects? In an attempt to answer these questions, we here find\nthat all void size distributions of these data samples satisfy the 3-parameter\nlog-normal distribution whether the environment is dominated by dark matter,\nhaloes or galaxies. In addition, the shape parameters of the 3-parameter\nlog-normal void size distribution seem highly affected by environment,\nparticularly existing substructures. Therefore, we show two quantitative\nrelations given by linear equations between the skewness and the maximum tree\ndepth, and variance of the void size distribution and the maximum tree depth\ndirectly from the simulated data. In addition to this, we find that the\npercentage of the voids with nonzero central density in the data sets has a\ncritical importance. If the number of voids with nonzero central densities\nreaches greater and or equal to 3.84 percentage in a simulation/mock sample,\nthen a second population is observed in the void size distributions.

Ghostwriting must produce text that is similar\nin style to the emulated artist, yet distinct in content.

To account for such a\nbroad range of microscopic processes under general loading paths, the Breakage\nMechanics theory is used and the computed mechanical response is linked with\nthe Kozeny equation, i.e. a permeability model able to evaluate the reduction\nof the hydraulic conductivity resulting from the simultaneous loss of porosity\nand growth of surface area. In particular, the evolution of the internal\nvariables of the model has been linked to idealized geometric schemes at\nparticle scale, with the goal to distinguish the contribution of the fines\ngenerated by the disaggregation of the cement matrix from that of the broken\nfragments resulting from the crushing of the skeleton. Compression/flow\nexperiments available in the literature for different granular rocks are used\nto validate the proposed methodology. The analyses illustrate that the drop of\nthe permeability of damaged rocks would be severely underestimated without an\naccurate computation of the growth of surface area, as well as that the\ndistributed fragmentation of skeleton particles tends to have stronger\nimplications than the generation of cement fines. These findings, along with\nthe satisfactory agreement between model predictions and experiments, stress\nthe benefits of adopting microstructure-based constitutive laws for the\nanalysis of coupled hydro-mechanical problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 23:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-13"}

Our experimental results show that the presented\nsystem can correctly answer 39 out of 40 example natural language queries with\nvarying lengths and complexities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2016 00:32:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-13"}

In this work, the formation and\nequilibration of VSHFs in a 2D Boussinesq model of stratified turbulence is\nstudied using statistical state dynamics (SSD). In SSD, equations of motion are\nexpressed directly in the statistical variables of the turbulent state.\nRestriction to 2D turbulence makes available an analytically and\ncomputationally attractive implementation of SSD referred to as S3T, in which\nthe SSD is expressed by coupling the equation for the horizontal mean structure\nwith the equation for the ensemble mean perturbation covariance.

In particular, S3T captures the spontaneous\nemergence of the VSHF and associated density layers seen in simulations of\nturbulence maintained by homogeneous large-scale stochastic excitation.

Our\nmethod significantly differs from other earlier works in (1) We set up a\nhand-crafted feature to detect salient object that our model does not need to\nbe trained by large-scale datasets; (2) Previous works only focus on appearance\nfeatures, while our CHO feature makes up the gap between the spatial object\ncovering and the object's saliency. Our experiments on a large number of public\ndatasets have obtained very positive results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2016 12:42:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 18:14:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-19"}

However, the mechanism\nunderlying the asymmetric feature in solar cycle activities is not yet well\nunderstood. In this paper, in order to explain the cause of the asymmetry from\nthe theoretical point of view, we investigate the relationship between the\ndipole- and quadrupole-type components of the magnetic field in the solar cycle\nusing the mean-field theory based on the flux transport dynamo model. As a\nresult, we found that there are two different attractors of the solar cycle, in\nwhich either the north or the south polar field is first reversed, and that the\nflux transport dynamo model well explains the phase-asymmetry of sunspot\nactivity and the polar field reversal without any ad hoc source of asymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2016 13:48:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

Statistical models based on finite mixtures can\nassist in the analysis of categorical and count outcomes when standard\ngeneralized linear models (GLMs) cannot adequately account for variability\nobserved in the data. We propose an extension of GLM where the response is\nassumed to follow a finite mixture distribution, while the regression of\ninterest is linked to the mixture's mean. This approach may be preferred over a\nfinite mixture of regressions when the population mean is the quantity of\ninterest; here, only a single regression function must be specified and\ninterpreted in the analysis. A technical challenge is that the mean of a finite\nmixture is a composite parameter which does not appear explicitly in the\ndensity.
