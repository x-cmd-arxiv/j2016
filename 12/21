Recent reports of photon recycling\nin perovskite solar cells suggest that, once optimized, it may as well achieve\nGaAs-like performance. In this paper, we show that GaAs and perovskite cells\nrecycle photons in different ways. First, although bare-perovskite has been\nshown to have lifetimes (~1us) in the radiative limit, non-radiative\nrecombination at the transport layers restricts the solar cell operation far\nbelow the \"photon-recycling\" regime. GaAs cells have no such limitation.\nSecond, even if the transport layers were optically and electrically perfect,\nthe poor mobility of the perovskite layer would still restrict the optimum\nthickness ~1um. Thus, a very high quality mirror (reflectivity >96%) is\nrequired to utilize photon-recycling. The mirror reflectivity restriction was\nfar more relaxed for the thicker (~2-3um) GaAs cells. Therefore, a nontrivial\nco-optimization of device geometry, mirror reflectivity, and material choice is\nnecessary for achieving highest theoretical efficiency anticipated for\nperovskite cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 16:16:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

The model gas and dust temperatures are determined by the\nheating and cooling equilibrium. Dense clouds are heated by turbulent\nmechanical and cosmic ray heating. The molecular abundances of individual gas\nclouds are determined by a detailed chemical network involving the cloud\nlifetime, density, and temperature. Molecular line emission is calculated with\nan escape probability formalism. The model calculates simultaneously the total\ngas mass, HI/H_2 mass, the gas velocity dispersion, IR luminosity, IR spectral\nenergy distribution, CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED), HCN(1-0), and\nHCO+(1-0) emission of a galaxy given its size, integrated star formation rate,\nstellar mass radial profile, rotation curve, and Toomre Q parameter. The model\nreproduces the observed CO luminosities and SLEDs of all sample galaxies within\nthe model uncertainties (~0.3 dex). Whereas the CO emission is robust against\nthe variation of model parameters, the HCN and HCO+ emission is sensitive to\nthe chemistry of the interstellar medium.

In addition to the well-known\nanti-ferromagnetic (AF) and ferromagnetic (FM) edge states, we find that there\nare also some excited spin density wave (ESDW) states, the energy of which are\nclose to the AF edge state (ground state). We thus argue that these ESDW states\nmay coexist in experiment when the temperature is not too low. Our numerical\nresults indicate that the allowed ESDW are commensurate; and their dispersion\ncurve is plotted. This interesting feature results from the fact the there is a\nflat edge band near the Fermi surface in the graphene zigzag ribbon. Finally we\nuse the non-equilibrium Green function theory combined with the Hubbard model\nto calculate some possible spin polarization states localized in the middle and\nterminal parts of graphene nanoribbons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 17:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-09"}

Moreover, it is known that\nunder pressure many unusual stoichiometric which are basically impossible at\nambient pressure, can be synthesized, that may even survive the decompression\nfrom high to ambient pressure.We therefore have performed a comprehensive study\nusing evolutionary algorithm and density functional theory based simulations to\nunderstand the lithiation of Sn anode at pressure ranging from 1 atm to 20 GPa.\nThe ground state structures of all stable and metastable Li-Sn compounds have\nbeen identified at ambient and moderate pressures and their properties have\nbeen studied to understand the role of pressure in re-defining the reaction\nmechanism during charging-discharging process in Li-ion batteries. Besides the\nwell-known existing Li-Sn compounds, our studies reveal the existence of five\nunreported stoichiometries (Li8Sn3, Li3Sn1, Li4Sn1, Li5Sn1, and Li7Sn1) and\ntheir associated crystal structures at ambient and high pressure.

An additional, and equally\nimportant, aim of this pilot study is to investigate the consistency between\nthe predictions of several BH scaling relations and the fundamental plane of\nblack hole activity (FP-BH). Methods: We use X-ray and radio luminosity\nrelations in accreting BHs, along with the latest scaling relations between the\nmass of the central black hole (MBH) and the properties of its host spheroid,\nto predict MBH in seven LLAGN, that were previously reported to be in the IMBH\nregime. Namely, we use the recently re-evaluated MBH - Msph (Msph : spheroid\nabsolute magnitude at 3.6 microm) scaling relation for spiral galaxies, the MBH\n- nsph (nsph : major axis Sersic index of the bulge) relation, the MBH - PA\n(PA: pitch angle) relation and the FP-BH for weakly accreting BHs, to\nindependently estimate MBH in all seven galaxies. Results: We find that all\nLLAGN in our list have low-mass central black holes - with log MBH/Msol~6.5 on\naverage - but they are, not IMBHs. All 4 methods used predicted consistent BH\nmasses, in the 1sigma range. Furthermore, we report that, in contrast to\nprevious classification, galaxy NGC 4470 is bulge-less, and cast doubts on the\nAGN classification of NGC 3507. Conclusions: We find that our latest,\nstate-of-the-art techniques for bulge magnitude & Sersic index computations and\nthe most recent updates of the MBH - Lsph, MBH - nsph , MBH - PA relations and\nthe FP-BH produce consistent results in the low mass regime. We establish a\nmultiple method approach for predicting BH masses in the regime where their\nspheres-of- grav. influence cannot be spatially resolved. Our approach\nmitigates against outliers from any one relation and provides a more robust\naverage prediction.

The main idea was to use the compact, powerful, and easy-to-use,\nmatrix exponential (ME)-distribution for i) modeling the unprocessed channel\nsignal to noise ratio (SNR), ii) exploiting the closure property of the\nME-distribution for SNR processing operations to give the effective channel\nrandom variable (r.v.) on ME-distribution form, and then to iii) express the\nperformance measure in a closed-form based on ME-distribution matrix/vector\nparameters only. In this work, we aim to more clearly present, formalize,\nrefine and develop this unified bottom-up analysis framework, show its\nversatility to handle important communication cases, performance evaluation\nlevels, and performance metrics. The bivariate ME-distribution is introduced\nhere as yet another useful ME-tool, e.g. to account for dependency among two\nr.v.s.

Such curves, together with\nreal Riemann surfaces, form the real locus of the moduli space $\\mathcal M_g$.\nThis paper deals with the classification of pseudoreal curves according to the\nstructure of their automorphism group. We follow two different approaches\nexisting in the literature: one coming from number theory, dealing more\ngenerally with fields of moduli of projective curves, and the other from\ncomplex geometry, through the theory of NEC groups. Using the first approach,\nwe prove that the automorphism group of a pseudoreal Riemann surface $X$ is\nabelian if $X/Z({\\rm Aut}(X))$ has genus zero, where $Z({\\rm Aut}(X))$ is the\ncenter of ${\\rm Aut}(X)$. This includes the case of $p$-gonal Riemann surfaces,\nalready known by results of Huggins and Kontogeorgis. By means of the second\napproach and of elementary properties of group extensions, we show that $X$ is\nnot pseudoreal if the center of $G={\\rm Aut}(X)$ is trivial and either ${\\rm\nOut}(G)$ contains no involutions or ${\\rm Inn}(G)$ has a group complement in\n${\\rm Aut}(G)$. This extends and gives an elementary proof (over $\\mathbb C$)\nof a result by D\\`ebes and Emsalem. Finally, we provide an algorithm,\nimplemented in MAGMA, which classifies the automorphism groups of pseudoreal\nRiemann surfaces of genus $g\\geq 2$, once a list of all groups acting for such\ngenus, with their signature and generating vectors, are given. This program,\ntogether with the database provided by J.

In this experiment, one of the particles passes through a very\nnarrow slit, and thereby its position becomes well-defined. This particle\ntherefore diffracts into a large divergence angle; this effect can be\nunderstood as a consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Popper\nfurther argued that its entangled partner would become comparably localized in\nposition, and that, according to his understanding of the Copenhagen\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics, the \\qo{mere knowledge} of the position of\nthis particle would cause it also to diffract into a large divergence angle.\nPopper recognized that such behaviour could violate the principle of causality\nin that the slit could be removed and the partner particle would be expected to\nrespond instantaneously. Popper thus concluded that it was most likely the case\nthat in an actual experiment the partner photon would not undergo increased\ndiffractive spreading and thus that the Copenhagen interpretation is incorrect.\nHere, we report and analyze the results of an implementation of Popper's\nproposal.

The multiperiodic\nDelta Scuti stars are well suited to study these changes. This requires a very\nlarge amount of photometric data covering years and decades as well as mode\nidentifications. We have examined over 800 nights of high-precision photometry\nof the multiperiodic pulsator 4 CVn obtained from 1966 through 2012. Because\nmost of the data were obtained in adjacent observing seasons, it is possible to\nderive very accurate period values for a number of the excited pulsation modes\nand to study their systematic changes from 1974 to 2012. Most pulsation modes\nshow systematic significant period and amplitude changes on a timescale of\ndecades. For the well-studied modes, around 1986 a general reversal of the\ndirections of both the positive and negative period changes occurred.\nFurthermore, the period changes between the different modes are strongly\ncorrelated, although they differ in size and sign. For the modes with known\nvalues of the spherical degree and azimuthal order, we find a correlation\nbetween the direction of the period changes and the identified azimuthal order,\nm. The associated amplitude changes generally have similar timescales of years\nor decades, but show little systematic or correlated behavior from mode to\nmode. A natural explanation for the opposite behavior of the prograde and\nretrograde modes is that their period changes are driven by a changing rotation\nprofile. The changes in the rotation profile could in turn be driven by\nprocesses, perhaps the pulsations themselves, that redistribute angular\nmomentum within the star. In general, different modes have different rotation\nkernels, so this will produce period shifts of varying magnitude for different\nmodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 20:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

More\nadvanced metering infrastructures provide numerous opportunities for more\naccurate load flow analysis of the LV networks. However, such data may not be\nreadily available for DNOs and in any case is likely to be expensive. Modelling\ntools are required which can provide realistic, yet accurate, load profiles as\ninput for a network modelling tool, without needing access to large amounts of\nmonitored customer data. In this paper we outline some simple methods for\naccurately modelling a large number of unmonitored residential customers at the\nLV level. We do this by a process we call buddying, which models unmonitored\ncustomers by assigning them load profiles from a limited sample of monitored\ncustomers who have smart meters. Hence the presented method requires access to\nonly a relatively small amount of domestic customers' data.

Most of the recent improvements have been achieved by targeting\ndeeper feedforward networks. However, many hard object categories such as\nbottle, remote, etc. require representation of fine details and not just\ncoarse, semantic representations. But most of these fine details are lost in\nthe early convolutional layers. What we need is a way to incorporate finer\ndetails from lower layers into the detection architecture. Skip connections\nhave been proposed to combine high-level and low-level features, but we argue\nthat selecting the right features from low-level requires top-down contextual\ninformation.

Over the decades the field has made significant\nprogress. It is now possible to simulate the formation of individual galaxies\nand galaxy populations from well defined initial conditions with realistic\nabundances and global properties. An essential component of the calculation is\nto correctly estimate the inflow to and outflow from forming galaxies since\nobservations indicating low formation efficiency and strong circum-glactic\npresence of gas are persuasive. Energetic 'feedback' from massive stars and\naccreting super-massive black holes - generally unresolved in cosmological\nsimulations - plays a major role for driving galactic outflows, which have been\nshown to regulate many aspects of galaxy evolution. A surprisingly large\nvariety of plausible sub-resolution models succeeds in this exercise. They\ncapture the essential characteristics of the problem, i.e. outflows regulating\ngalactic gas flows, but their predictive power is limited. In this review we\nfocus on one major challenge for galaxy formation theory: to understand the\nunderlying physical processes that regulate the structure of the interstellar\nmedium, star formation and the driving of galactic outflows. This requires\naccurate physical models and numerical simulations, which can precisely\ndescribe the multi-phase structure of the interstellar medium on the currently\nunresolved few hundred parsecs scales of large scale cosmological simulations.\nSuch models ultimately require the full accounting for the dominant cooling and\nheating processes, the radiation and winds from massive stars and accreting\nblack holes, an accurate treatment of supernova explosions as well as the\nnon-thermal components of the interstellar medium like magnetic fields and\ncosmic rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 21:45:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

NMT is gaining popularity in the research community\nbecause it outperformed traditional SMT approaches in several translation tasks\nat WMT and other evaluation tasks/benchmarks at least for some language pairs.\nHowever, many of the enhancements in SMT over the years have not been\nincorporated into the NMT framework.

Electronic telemetry is frequently used to document animal movement\nthrough time. Methods that can identify underlying behaviors driving specific\nmovement patterns can help us understand how and why animals use available\nspace, thereby aiding conservation and management efforts.

However, for aquatic animals, highly accurate\ntracking data of animal movement are now becoming more common.\n  2.

We show that the HMMM is both accurate and suitable\nfor multiple species by fitting it to real tracks from a grey seal, lake trout,\nand blue shark, as well as to simulated data.\n  4. The HMMM is a fast and reliable tool for making meaningful inference from\nanimal movement data that is ideally suited for ecologists who want to use the\npopular DCRWS implementation for highly accurate tracking data.

Researchers usually estimate the BMD using binomial\nresponse models with a single link function. Several forms of link function\nhave been proposed to fit dose response models to estimate the BMD and the\ncorresponding benchmark dose lower bound (BMDL). However, if the assumed link\nis not correct, then the estimated BMD and BMDL from the fitted model may not\nbe accurate. To account for model uncertainty, model averaging (MA) methods are\nproposed to estimate BMD averaging over a model space containing a finite\nnumber of standard models. Usual model averaging focuses on a pre-specified\nlist of parametric models leading to pitfalls when none of the models in the\nlist is the correct model. Here, an alternative which augments an initial list\nof parametric models with an infinite number of additional models having\nvarying links has been proposed. In addition, different methods for estimating\nBMDL based on the family of link functions are derived.

However, previous\nproof-of-principle experiments suffered from small photon number and low\nsampling rates owing to the inefficiencies of the single-photon sources and\nmulti-port optical interferometers. Here, we develop two central components for\nhigh-performance boson sampling: robust multi-photon interferometers with 0.99\ntransmission rate, and actively demultiplexed single-photon sources from a\nquantum-dot-micropillar with simultaneously high efficiency, purity and\nindistinguishability. We implement and validate 3-, 4-, and 5-photon boson\nsampling, and achieve sampling rates of 4.96 kHz, 151 Hz, and 4 Hz,\nrespectively, which are over 24,000 times faster than the previous experiments,\nand over 220 times faster than obtaining one sample through calculating the\nmatrices permanent using the first electronic computer (ENIAC) and\ntransistorized computer (TRADIC) in the human history.

The methods rely on a characteristic Galerkin weak\nformulation, leading to $L^2$ stable discretizations for linear problems.\nUnlike many existing SL methods, the high order accuracy and mass conservation\nof the proposed methods are realized in a non-splitting manner. Thus, the\ndetrimental splitting error, which is known to significantly contaminate long\nterm transport simulations, will be not incurred. One key ingredient in the\nscheme formulation, borrowed from CSLAM [Lauritzen, Nair, and Ullrich, 2010],\nis the use of Green's theorem which allows us to convert volume integrals into\na set of line integrals. The resulting line integrals are much easier to\napproximate with high order accuracy, hence facilitating the implementation.\nAnother novel ingredient is the construction of quadratic curves in\napproximating sides of upstream cell, leading to quadratic-curved quadrilateral\nupstream cells. Formal third order accuracy is obtained by such a construction.\nThe desired positivity-preserving property is further attained by incorporating\na high order bound-preserving filter.

Our analysis incorporates structure to the recent\n(unstructured) backward error analysis performed for block Kronecker\nlinearizations by Dopico, Lawrence, P\\'erez and Van Dooren, and share with it\nits key features, namely, it is a rigorous analysis valid for finite\nperturbations, i.e., it is not a first order analysis, it provides precise\nbounds, and it is valid simultaneously for a large class of\nstructure-preserving strong linearizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 08:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-22"}

The importance\nof this reaction pathway is derived by investigating isotope substituted\nanalogs. Quantitative reaction rates needed for astrochemical models at low\ntemperature are currently unavailable both in the solid state and in the gas\nphase. Here, we study tunneling effects upon hydrogen abstraction in CH4 + OH\nby focusing on two reactions: CH4 + OD -> CH3 + HDO and CD4 + OH -> CD3 + HDO.\nThe experimental study shows that the solid-state reaction rate R(CH4 + OD) is\nhigher than R(CD4 + OH) at 15 K. Experimental results are accompanied by\ncalculations of the corresponding unimolecular and bimolecular reaction rate\nconstants using instanton theory taking into account surface effects. From the\nwork presented here, the unimolecular reactions are particularly interesting as\nthese provide insight into reactions following a Langmuir-Hinshelwood process.\nThe resulting ratio of the rate constants shows that the H abstraction (k(CH4 +\nOD)) is approximately ten times faster than D-abstraction (k(CD4 + OH)) at 65\nK. We conclude that tunneling is involved at low temperatures in the\nabstraction reactions studied here. The unimolecular rate constants can be used\nby the modeling community as a first approach to describe OH-mediated\nabstraction reactions in the solid phase. For this reason we provide fits of\nour calculated rate constants that allow the inclusion of these reactions in\nmodels in a straightforward fashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 09:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

The most common approach is using online health expert\nquestion-answering (HQA) services, as health consumers are more willing to\ntrust answers from professional physicians. However, these answers can be of\nvarying quality depending on circumstance. In addition, as the available HQA\nservices grow, how to predict the answer quality of HQA services via machine\nlearning becomes increasingly important and challenging. In an HQA service,\nanswers are normally short texts, which are severely affected by the data\nsparsity problem. Furthermore, HQA services lack community features such as\nbest answer and user votes. Therefore, the wisdom of the crowd is not available\nto rate answer quality. To address these problems, in this paper, the\nprediction of HQA answer quality is defined as a classification task. First,\nbased on the characteristics of HQA services and feedback from medical experts,\na standard for HQA service answer quality evaluation is defined. Next, based on\nthe characteristics of HQA services, several novel non-textual features are\nproposed, including surface linguistic features and social features. Finally, a\ndeep belief network (DBN)-based HQA answer quality prediction framework is\nproposed to predict the quality of answers by learning the high-level hidden\nsemantic representation from the physicians' answers. Our results prove that\nthe proposed framework overcomes the problem of overly sparse textual features\nin short text answers and effectively identifies high-quality answers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 10:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-22"}

Our study combines the dataset from our previous\nwork with new observations of 55 additional objects. We have investigated 92\nYSO candidates in total, 11 of which have been definitely identified with giant\nstars unrelated to Lupus. The stellar and accretion properties of the 81 bona\nfide YSOs, which represent more than 90% of the whole class~II and transition\ndisc YSO population in the aforementioned Lupus clouds, have been homogeneously\nand self-consistently derived, allowing for an unbiased study of accretion and\nits relationship with stellar parameters. The accretion luminosity, Lacc,\nincreases with the stellar luminosity, Lstar, with an overall slope of ~1.6,\nsimilar but with a smaller scatter than in previous studies. There is a\nsignificant lack of strong accretors below Lstar~0.1Lsun, where Lacc is always\nlower than 0.01Lstar. We argue that the Lacc-Lstar slope is not due to\nobservational biases, but is a true property of the Lupus YSOs. The\nlogMacc-logMstar correlation shows a statistically significant evidence of a\nbreak, with a steeper relation for Mstar<0.2Msun and a flatter slope for higher\nmasses. The bimodality of the Macc-Mstar relation is confirmed with four\ndifferent evolutionary models used to derive the stellar mass. The bimodal\nbehaviour of the observed relationship supports the importance of modelling\nself-gravity in the early evolution of the more massive discs, but other\nprocesses, such as photo evaporation and planet formation during the YSO's\nlifetime, may also lead to disc dispersal on different timescales depending on\nthe stellar mass.

The level relation\non states and the plans constructed by ARES implicitly define a Lyapunov\nfunction and an optimal policy, respectively, both of which could be explicitly\ngenerated by applying ARES to all states of the MDP, up to some topological\nequivalence relation.

Our main aim is in pointing out the biases in the results due to not\naccounting for some sources of uncertainty. We adopt the SCEPtER pipeline,\nrelying on stellar models computed with two stellar evolutionary codes (FRANEC\nand MESA). We found multiple independent groups of solutions. The best one\nsuggests a system of age 1.10 $\\pm$ 0.07 Gyr (primary star in the central\nhelium burning stage, secondary in the sub-giant branch), with a\nhelium-to-metal enrichment ratio of $\\Delta Y/\\Delta Z = 1$ and core\novershooting parameter $\\beta = 0.15 \\pm 0.01$ (FRANEC) and $f_{\\rm ov}= 0.013\n\\pm 0.001 $ (MESA). The second class of solutions, characterised by a worse\ngoodness-of-fit, still suggest a primary star in the central helium-burning\nstage but a secondary in the overall contraction phase, at the end of the main\nsequence. The FRANEC grid provides an age of $1.16_{-0.02}^{+0.03}$ Gyr and\n$\\beta = 0.25_{-0.01}^{+0.005}$, while the MESA grid gives $1.23 \\pm 0.03$ Gyr\nand $f_{\\rm ov} = 0.025 \\pm 0.003$. We also show that very precise mass\ndeterminations with uncertainty of a few thousandths of solar mass are required\nto obtain reliable determinations of stellar parameters, as mass errors larger\nthan approximately 1% lead to estimates that are not only less precise but also\nbiased. Moreover, we show that a fit obtained with a grid of models computed at\na fixed $\\Delta Y/\\Delta Z$ can provide biased age and overshooting estimates.\nThe possibility of independent overshooting efficiencies for the two stars of\nthe system is also explored. This work confirms that to constrain the core\novershooting parameter by means of binary systems is a very difficult task that\nrequires an observational precision still rarely achieved and robust\nstatistical methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 11:38:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

The no-short selling constraint acts as\nan asymmetric $\\ell_1$ regularizer, setting some of the portfolio weights to\nzero and keeping the out of sample estimator for the variance bounded, avoiding\nthe divergence present in the non-regularized case. However, the\nsusceptibility, i.e. the sensitivity of the optimal portfolio weights to\nchanges in the returns, diverges at a critical value $r=2$. This means that a\nban on short positions does not prevent the phase transition in the\noptimization problem, it merely shifts the critical point from its\nnon-regularized value of $r=1$ to $2$. At $r=2$ the out of sample estimator for\nthe portfolio variance stays finite and the estimated in-sample variance\nvanishes. We have performed numerical simulations to support the analytic\nresults and found perfect agreement for $N/T<2$. Numerical experiments on\nfinite size samples of symmetrically distributed returns show that above this\ncritical point the probability of finding solutions with zero in-sample\nvariance increases rapidly with increasing $N$, becoming one in the large $N$\nlimit. However, these are not legitimate solutions of the optimization problem,\nas they are infinitely sensitive to any change in the input parameters, in\nparticular they will wildly fluctuate from sample to sample.

First, we\ndevelop a correlated pseudo-marginal (CPM) approach for Bayesian inference in\nstate space (SS) models that is based on filtering the disturbances, rather\nthan the states. This approach is useful when the state transition density is\nintractable or inefficient to compute, and also when the dimension of the\ndisturbance is lower than the dimension of the state. Second, we propose a\nblock pseudo-marginal (BPM) method that uses as the estimate of the likelihood\nthe average of G independent unbiased estimates of the likelihood. We associate\na set of underlying uniform of standard normal random numbers used to construct\neach of the individual unbiased likelihood estimates and then use\ncomponent-wise Markov Chain Monte Carlo to update the parameter vector jointly\nwith one set of these random numbers at a time. This induces a correlation of\napproximately 1-1/G between the logs of the estimated likelihood at the\nproposed and current values of the model parameters. Third, we show for some\nnon-stationary state space models that the BPM approach is much more efficient\nthan the CPM approach, because it is difficult to translate the high\ncorrelation in the underlying random numbers to high correlation between the\nlogs of the likelihood estimates. Although our focus has been on applying the\nBPM method to state space models, our results and approach can be used in a\nwide range of applications of the PM method, such as panel data models,\nsubsampling problems and approximate Bayesian computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 12:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-22"}

A wide variety of network graphs happen to be sparse.\nBut the index with which sparsity is commonly measured in network graphs is\nedge density, reflecting the proportion of the sum of the degrees of all nodes\nin the graph compared to the total possible degrees in the corresponding fully\nconnected graph. Thus edge density is a simple ratio and carries limitations,\nprimarily in terms of the amount of information it takes into account in its\ndefinition. In this paper, we have provided a formulation for defining sparsity\nof a network graph by generalizing the concept of Gini Index and call it\nsparsity index. A majority of the six properties (viz., Robin Hood, Scaling,\nRising Tide, Cloning, Bill Gates and Babies) with which sparsity measures are\ncommonly compared are seen to be satisfied by the proposed index. A comparison\nbetween edge density and the sparsity index has been drawn with appropriate\nexamples to highlight the efficacy of the proposed index. It has also been\nshown theoretically that the two measures follow similar trend for a changing\ngraph, i.e., as the edge density of a graph increases its sparsity index\ndecreases. Additionally, the paper draws a relationship, analytically, between\nthe sparsity index and the exponent term of a power law distribution, a\ndistribution which is known to approximate the degree distribution of a wide\nvariety of network graphs. Finally, the article highlights how the proposed\nindex together with Gini index can reveal important properties of a network\ngraph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 12:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-26"}

Can the dynamical complexity of such networks be globally\nquantified in an information-theoretic way and be meaningfully coupled to brain\nfunction? Recently, measures of dynamical complexity such as integrated\ninformation have been proposed. However, problems related to the normalization\nand Bell number of partitions associated to these measures make these\napproaches computationally infeasible for large-scale brain networks. Our goal\nin this work is to address this problem. Our formulation of network integrated\ninformation is based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the\nmultivariate distribution on the set of network states versus the corresponding\nfactorized distribution over its parts. We find that implementing the maximum\ninformation partition optimizes computations. These methods are well-suited for\nlarge networks with linear stochastic dynamics. We compute the integrated\ninformation for both, the system's attractor states, as well as non-stationary\ndynamical states of the network.

This\ntheory relies on particle-following averaging to incorporate the constraints\nimposed by the material conservations. It relies implicitly on an Euclidean\nstructure; as a result, it does not have a geometrically intrinsic\ninterpretation and suffers from undesirable features, including the divergence\nof the Lagrangian-mean velocity for incompressible fluids. Motivated by this,\nwe develop a geometric generalisation of GLM that we formulate intrinsically.\nThe theory applies to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds; it also establishes a\nclear distinction between results that stem directly from geometric consistency\nand those that depend on particular choices. We show that the Lagrangian mean\nmomentum -- the average of the pull-back of the momentum one-form -- obeys a\nsimple equation which guarantees the conservation of Kelvin's circulation,\nirrespective of the mean-flow definition. We discuss four possible definitions\nof the mean flow: a direct extension of standard GLM, a definition based on\noptimal transportation, a definition based on a geodesic distance in the group\nof volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, and the glm definition proposed by Soward\n& Roberts (2010). Assuming small-amplitude perturbations, we carry out\norder-by-order calculations to obtain explicit expressions for the mean flow\nand pseudomomentum at leading order. We also show how the wave-action\nconservation of GLM extends to the geometric setting. To make the paper\nself-contained, we introduce the tools of differential geometry and main ideas\nof geometric fluid dynamics on which we rely.

The well-known effect of this coupling is to\ngenerate A-terms at one-loop level, hence raising the Higgs mass without\nrelying on super-heavy stops. At the same time, a hierarchy between Wino and\ngluino masses, as induced by the non-unified messenger fields, can greatly\nlower the radiative corrections to the Higgs soft mass term driven by the\nhigh-energy parameters, thus reducing the fine tuning. We search for models\nwith low fine tuning within this scenario, and we discuss the spectrum,\ncollider phenomenology, constraints, and prospects of the found solutions.

We also explore the gain by combining LSST\nand CMB S4, that is, using the five relevant auto- and cross-correlations of\nthe two datasets.

Therefore,\nnanoindentation experiments on this meteorite allow us to obtain key data to\nunderstand the physical properties of near-Earth asteroids. Tests at different\nlength scales provide information about the local mechanical properties of the\nminerals forming this meteorite: reduced Young's modulus, hardness, elastic\nrecovery, and fracture toughness. Those tests are also useful to understand the\npotential to deflect threatening asteroids using a kinetic projectile. We found\nthat the differences in mechanical properties between regions of the meteorite,\nwhich increase or reduce the efficiency of impacts, are not a result of\ncompositional differences. A low mean particle size, attributed to repetitive\nshock, can increase hardness, while low porosity promotes a higher momentum\nmultiplication. Momentum multiplication is the ratio between the change in\nmomentum of a target due to an impact, and the momentum of the projectile, and,\ntherefore higher values imply more efficient impacts. In the Chelyabinsk\nmeteorite, the properties of the light-colored lithology materials facilitate\nobtaining higher momentum multiplication values, compared to the other regions\ndescribed for this meteorite. Also, we found a low value of fracture toughness\nin the shock-melt veins of Chelyabinsk, which would promote the ejection of\nmaterial after an impact and, therefore, increase the momentum multiplication.\nThese results are relevant considering the growing interest in missions to test\nasteroid deflection, such as the recent collaboration between the European\nSpace Agency and NASA, known as the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment\nmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 14:22:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

The proposed instrument would be ideally suited for a\nmission to Mars to comprehensively investigate the nature and seasonal\ndistributions of volatiles and aerosols. The investigation would include the\nabundance of atmospheric dust and condensed volatiles, surface and\ncloud/aerosol grain sizes and shapes, ice and dust particle microphysics and\nalso variations in atmospheric chemistry during multiple overflight local times\nthroughout polar night and day.\n  Such an instrument would be ideal for mapping and detection of recently\ndetected CO2 frost phenomena and H2O and CO2 precipitation events in the polar\nregions of Mars.

In our analysis, we have also included estimates of the\nbrightness of Jupiter and Saturn at the three frequencies of the Planck Low\nFrequency Instrument (30, 44, and 70 GHz). The results provide constraints on\nthe intrinsic brightness and the brightness time-variability of these planets.\nThe majority of the planet flux density estimates are limited by systematic\nerrors, but still yield better than 1% measurements in many cases. Applying\ndata from Planck HFI, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and the\nAtacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) to a model that incorporates contributions\nfrom Saturn's rings to the planet's total flux density suggests a best fit\nvalue for the spectral index of Saturn's ring system of $\\beta _\\mathrm{ring} =\n2.30\\pm0.03$ over the 30-1000 GHz frequency range. The average ratio between\nthe Planck-HFI measurements and the adopted model predictions for all five\nplanets (excluding Jupiter observations for 353 GHz) is 0.997, 0.997, 1.018,\nand 1.032 for 100, 143, 217, and 353 GHz, respectively. Model predictions for\nplanet thermodynamic temperatures are therefore consistent with the absolute\ncalibration of Planck-HFI detectors at about the three-percent-level. We\ncompare our measurements with published results from recent cosmic microwave\nbackground experiments. In particular, we observe that the flux densities\nmeasured by Planck HFI and WMAP agree to within 2%. These results allow\nexperiments operating in the mm-wavelength range to cross-calibrate against\nPlanck and improve models of radiative transport used in planetary science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 14:48:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-29"}

This promises that the scene is\nalways reconstructed from dense places to sparse areas, which can reduce error\naccumulation when images have weak overlap. To enable faster speed, images\noutside the selected group in each cluster are further divided to achieve a\ngreater degree of parallelism.

In SMRA, a set of correlated sources is encoded once for\nall and stored on a server, and clients want to successively access to only a\nsubset of the sources. Since the number of simultaneous clients can be huge,\nthe server is only allowed to extract a bitstream from the stored data: no\nre-encoding can be performed before the transmission of the specific client's\nrequest. In this paper, we formally define the SMRA framework and introduce\nboth storage and transmission rates to characterize the performance of SMRA. We\nderive achievable transmission and storage rates for lossless source coding of\ni.i.d. and non i.i.d. sources, and transmission and storage rates-distortion\nregions for Gaussian sources. We also show two practical implementations of\nSMRA systems based on rate-compatible LDPC codes. Both theoretical and\nexperimental results demonstrate that SMRA systems can reach the same\ntransmission rates as in traditional point to point source coding schemes,\nwhile having a reasonable overhead in terms of storage rate.

Here, radiation from a thin metallic shell\nis rigorously analyzed to establish fundamental limits on the radiation\nefficiency of resonant, electrically small antennas in terms of the size and\nthe metal conductivity. Metallic losses are systematically introduced into the\ncircuit model proposed by Chu, and several resonant antennas with maximum\nradiation efficiencies are analyzed.

In fact, many real-world multi-objective\nproblems contain a number of constraints. To promote research on constrained\nmulti-objective optimization, we first propose a problem classification scheme\nwith three primary types of difficulty, which reflect various types of\nchallenges presented by real-world optimization problems, in order to\ncharacterize the constraint functions in constrained multi-objective\noptimization problems (CMOPs). These are feasibility-hardness,\nconvergence-hardness and diversity-hardness.

Based on this toolkit, we suggest nine\ndifficulty-adjustable and scalable CMOPs and nine CMaOPs. The experimental\nresults reveal that mechanisms in MOEA/D-CDP may be more effective in solving\nconvergence-hard DAS-CMOPs, while mechanisms of NSGA-II-CDP may be more\neffective in solving DAS-CMOPs with simultaneous diversity-, feasibility- and\nconvergence-hardness. Mechanisms in C-NSGA-III may be more effective in solving\nfeasibility-hard CMaOPs, while mechanisms of C-MOEA/DD may be more effective in\nsolving CMaOPs with convergence-hardness.

So, we propose conditions on the\nparameters of noncommutativity which give the possibility to solve the list of\nproblems in noncommutative phase space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 15:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-27"}

The Euclid ball can be\nimmersed in the Minkovskian space (which has the negative determinant) and can\nexist stably through the history of the universe. Since the Euclid ball has the\nsame solution as the Schwarzschild black hole on its three-dimensional surface,\nan asymptotic observer can not distinguish them. If large fraction of whole\nenergy of the pre-universe was encapsulated in Euclid balls, they behave as the\ndark matter in the current universe. Euclid balls already existed at the end of\nthe cosmological inflation, and can have a heavy mass in this model, they can\nbe a seed of supper-massive black-holes, which are necessary to initiate a\nforming of galaxies in the early universe.
