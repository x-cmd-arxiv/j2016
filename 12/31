Such constraints\ncan be expressed as nonlinear inequalities on moments in terms of their lower\norder moments, and solving them in conjugation with the stationary moment\nequations results in bounds on the moments. Using two examples of biochemical\nsystems, we illustrate that not only one obtains upper and lower bounds on a\ngiven stationary moment, but these bounds also improve as one uses more moment\nequations and utilizes the inequalities for the corresponding higher order\nmoments.

These\nenvironments serve as a common platform for heterogeneous users (e.g.,\ncorporate, individuals etc.) by hosting customized user applications and\nsystems, providing ubiquitous access to the shared resources and requiring less\nadministrative efforts; as a result, they enable users and companies to\nincrease their productivity. Unfortunately, sharing of resources in open\nenvironments has significantly increased the privacy threats to the users.\nIndeed, shared electronic data may be exploited by third parties, such as Data\nBrokers, which may aggregate, infer and redistribute (sensitive) personal\nfeatures, thus potentially impairing the privacy of the individuals. A way to\npalliate this problem consists on controlling the access of users over the\npotentially sensitive resources.

The $N(1520)$ and $N(1535)$ wave functions\nare then defined without any adjustable parameters and are used to make\npredictions for the valence quark contributions to the transition form factors.\nThe predictions compare well with the data particularly for high momentum\ntransfer, where the dominance of the quark degrees of freedom is expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2016 18:40:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2017 19:40:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 16:44:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-17"}

The pressure is written in the form of piecewise\npolynomials on the main grid, which is dynamically adapted within a\ncell-by-cell AMR framework. According to the time dependent main grid,\ndifferent face-based spatially staggered dual grids are defined for the\npiece-wise polynomials of the respective velocity components. Arbitrary high\norder of accuracy is achieved in space, while a very simple semi-implicit time\ndiscretization is obtained via an explicit discretization of the nonlinear\nconvective terms, and an implicit discretization of the pressure gradient in\nthe momentum equation and of the divergence of the velocity field in the\ncontinuity equation. The real advantages of the staggered grid arise in the\nsolution of the Schur complement associated with the saddle point problem of\nthe discretized incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, i.e. after substituting\nthe discrete momentum equations into the discrete continuity equation. This\nleads to a linear system for only one unknown, the scalar pressure. Indeed, the\nresulting linear pressure system is shown to be symmetric and\npositive-definite.

The dynamics of the flaring loops in active region (AR) 11429 are\nstudied. The observed dynamics consist of several evolution stages of the\nflaring loop system during both the ascending and descending phases of the\nregistered M-class flare. The dynamical properties can also be classified by\ndifferent types of magnetic reconnection, related plasma ejection and aperiodic\nflows, quasi-periodic oscillatory motions, and rapid temperature and density\nchanges, among others. The focus of the present paper is on a specific time\ninterval during the ascending (pre-flare) phase. Aims. The goal is to\nunderstand the quasi-periodic behavior in both space and time of the magnetic\nloop structures during the considered time interval. Methods.We have studied\nthe characteristic location, motion, and periodicity properties of the flaring\nloops by examining space-time diagrams and intensity variation analysis along\nthe coronal magnetic loops using AIA intensity and HMI magnetogram images (from\nthe Solar Dynamics Observatory(SDO)).

In\nmany real-world applications, a signal of interest is typically sparse not in\nthe canonical basis but in a certain transform domain, such as wavelets or the\nfinite difference. The theory of compressed sensing was extended to the\nanalysis sparsity model but known extensions are limited to specific choices of\nsensing matrix and sparsifying transform. In this paper, we propose a unified\ntheory for robust recovery of sparse signals in a general transform domain by\nconvex programming. In particular, our results apply to general acquisition and\nsparsity models and show how the number of measurements for recovery depends on\nproperties of measurement and sparsifying transforms. Moreover, we also provide\nextensions of our results to the scenarios where the atoms in the transform has\nvarying incoherence parameters and the unknown signal exhibits a structured\nsparsity pattern.

Starting from a fundamental four-dimensional field\ntheory at nonzero temperature and density, an effective three-dimensional field\ntheory with a sign problem is derived. Although charge conjugation\n$\\mathcal{C}$ is broken at finite density, there remains a symmetry under\n$\\mathcal{CK}$, where $\\mathcal{K}$ is complex conjugation. We consider four\nmodels: relativistic fermions, nonrelativistic fermions, static fermions and\nclassical particles. The thermodynamic behavior is extracted from\n$\\mathcal{CK}$-symmetric complex saddle points of the effective field theory at\ntree level. The relativistic and static fermions show a liquid-gas transition,\nmanifesting as a first-order line at low temperature and high density,\nterminated by a critical end point. In the cases of nonrelativistic fermions\nand classical particles, we find no first-order liquid-gas transitions at tree\nlevel. The mass matrix controlling the behavior of correlation functions is\nobtained from fluctuations around the saddle points. Due to the $\\mathcal{CK}$\nsymmetry of the models, the eigenvalues of the mass matrix can be complex. This\nleads to the existence of disorder lines, which mark the boundaries where the\neigenvalues go from purely real to complex. The regions where the mass matrix\neigenvalues are complex are associated with the critical line. In the case of\nstatic fermions, a powerful duality between particles and holes allows for the\nanalytic determination of both the critical line and the disorder lines.\nDepending on the values of the parameters, either zero, one or two disorder\nlines are found. Numerical results for relativistic fermions give a very\nsimilar picture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2016 19:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

What Verlinde has extracted from this\napproach, so far, is a formula -- of rather limited applicability, and with no\nroad to generalization in sight -- for the effective gravitational field of a\nspherical, isolated, static baryonic system. This formula cannot be used to\ncalculate the gravitational field of disk galaxies, with their rich MOND\nphenomenology. Notably, it cannot predict their rotation curves, except\nasymptotically. It does not apply to the few-, or many-body problem; so, it\ncannot give, e.g., the two-body force between two galaxies, or be used to\nconduct N-body calculations of galaxy formation, evolution, and interactions.\nThe formula cannot be applied to the internal dynamics of a system embedded in\nan external field, where MOND predicts important consequences. etc. MOND is\nbacked by full-fledged, Lagrangian theories that can be, and are, routinely\napplied to all the above phenomena, and more.

It has long been thought that while higher scale (macro)\ndescriptions of causal structure may be useful to observers, they are at best a\ncompressed description and at worse leave out critical information. However,\nrecent research applying information theory to causal analysis has shown that\nthe causal structure of some systems can actually come into focus (be more\ninformative) at a macroscale (Hoel et al. 2013). That is, a macro model of a\nsystem (a map) can be more informative than a fully detailed model of the\nsystem (the territory). This has been called causal emergence. While causal\nemergence may at first glance seem counterintuitive, this paper grounds the\nphenomenon in a classic concept from information theory: Shannon's discovery of\nthe channel capacity. I argue that systems have a particular causal capacity,\nand that different causal models of those systems take advantage of that\ncapacity to various degrees. For some systems, only macroscale causal models\nuse the full causal capacity. Such macroscale causal models can either be\ncoarse-grains, or may leave variables and states out of the model (exogenous)\nin various ways, which can improve the model's efficacy and its informativeness\nvia the same mathematical principles of how error-correcting codes take\nadvantage of an information channel's capacity. As model choice increase, the\ncausal capacity of a system approaches the channel capacity. Ultimately, this\nprovides a general framework for understanding how the causal structure of some\nsystems cannot be fully captured by even the most detailed microscopic model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2016 20:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

If the\nSF for the timescales shorter than the decorrelation timescale $\\tau$ is a\nsingle power-law and for the longer ones becomes flat (i.e., the white noise),\nthe auto-correlation function (ACF) of the signal can have the form of the\npower exponential (PE). We show that the signal decorrelation timescale can be\nmeasured directly from the SF as the timescale matching the amplitude 0.795 of\nthe flat SF part (at long timescales), and only then the measurement is\nindependent of the ACF PE power. Typically, the timescale has been measured at\nan arbitrarily fixed SF amplitude, but as we prove, this approach provides\nbiased results because the AGN SF/PSD slopes, so the ACF shape, are not\nconstant and depend on either the AGN luminosity and/or the black hole mass.

A key advantage of CROM is that it embeds nonlinear dynamics in a\nlinear framework, and uncertainty can be managed with data assimilation.

We consider a variety of selections for the\nastrophysical parameters that describe the spike profile and find that the\ngamma-ray flux is strongly dependent on these selections, particularly the\nmodelling of spike depletion effects due to gravitational interactions with\nbaryons, which affect the spike radius and steepness profile. We calculate\nconstraints on the DM parameter space for both attenuated and idealized spikes,\nconsidering different choices for the steepness profiles in each case. We find\nthat for the most conservative selection of parameters, corresponding to a\ndepleted spike with an NFW cusp profile, the gamma-ray flux for a 100 GeV\nthermal relic is lower than current observational constraints by several orders\nof magnitude. For more optimistic choices of parameters corresponding to spikes\nthat have not been attenuated, bounds on DM masses can be obtained for a\nvariety of choices of steepness profiles.

The low energy structure of\nthe energy momentum tensor in these models with SU(3) flavor symmetry is\nanalyzed in the presence of external gravitational fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2016 10:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-03"}

Much less is known\nfor their non-monotone stochastic counterpart, namely kinetically constrained\nmodels (KCM). In KCM each vertex is resampled (independently) at rate one by\ntossing a p-coin iff it can be infected in the next step by the bootstrap\nmodel. In particular infection can also heal, hence the non-monotonicity.\nBesides the connection with bootstrap percolation, KCM have an interest in\ntheir own as they feature some of the most striking features of the\nliquid/glass transition, a major and still largely open problem in condensed\nmatter physics. In this paper we pave the way towards proving universality\nresults for KCM similar to those for bootstrap percolation. Our novel and\ngeneral approach establishes a close connection between the critical scaling of\ncharacteristic time scales for KCM and the scaling of the critical length in\ncritical bootstrap models. Although the full proof of universality for KCM is\ndeferred to a forthcoming paper, here we apply our general method to the\nFriedrickson-Andersen k-facilitated models, amongst the most studied KCM, and\nto the Gravner-Griffeath model.

The validity\nof the approach is demonstrated for surfaces with different fractal dimensions\nand different spectral content using a properly designed mesh convergence test.\nIn addition, we use a topology preserving smoothing technique to adjust the\nmorphology of contact clusters obtained with a coarse grid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2016 13:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-24"}

Both models are derived from a model for spatially\nembedded mono-layer networks and are generalised to handle an arbitrary number\nof network layers. The two approaches are distinguished by their use case. The\nstatic glue stick construction model yields a multi-layer network from a\npredefined layer interconnection scheme, i.e. different layers are attached\nwith transformer edges. It is especially suited to construct multi-layer power\ngrids with a specified number of nodes in and transformers between layers. We\ncontrast it with a genuine growth model which we label interconnected layer\ngrowth model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2016 10:11:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

In previous work, the authors\nhave shown that it is possible to take traditionally iterative evolutionary\nalgorithms and execute them on volunteer computing grids by performing them\nasynchronously. The asynchronous implementations dramatically increase\nscalability and decrease the time taken to converge to a solution. Iterative\nand asynchronous optimization algorithms implemented using MPI on clusters and\nsupercomputers, and BOINC on volunteer computing grids have been packaged\ntogether in a framework for generic distributed optimization (FGDO). This paper\npresents a new extension to FGDO for an asynchronous Newton method (ANM) for\nlocal optimization. ANM is resilient to heterogeneous, faulty and unreliable\ncomputing nodes and is extremely scalable. Preliminary results show that it can\nconverge to a local optimum significantly faster than conjugate gradient\ndescent does.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2016 19:37:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-09"}
