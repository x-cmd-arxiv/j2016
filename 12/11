Compared with their full quantum counterparts, one of\nthe two users is restricted to perform some \"classical\" or \"semi-quantum\"\noperations, which makes them easily realizable by using less quantum resource.\nHowever, the semi-quantum key distribution protocols mainly rely on a two-way\nquantum channel. The eavesdropper has two opportunities to intercept the\nquantum states transmitted in the quantum communication stage. It may allow the\neavesdropper to get more information and make the security analysis more\ncomplicated. In the past ten years, many semi-quantum key distribution\nprotocols have been proposed and proved to be robust. But there are few works\nconcerned about their unconditional security. It is doubted that how secure the\nsemi-quantum ones are and how much noise can they tolerate to establish a\nsecure secret key. In this paper, we prove the unconditional security of a\nsingle-state semi-quantum key distribution protocol proposed by $Zou$ et al. in\n[Phys. Rev. A. 79]. We present a complete proof from information theory aspect\nby deriving a lower bound of the protocol's key rate in the asymptotic\nscenario. Using this bound, we figure out an error threshold value such that\nall error rates are less than this threshold value, the secure secret key can\nbe established between the legitimate users definitely. Otherwise, the users\nshould abort the protocol. we make an illustration of the protocol under the\ncircumstance of the reverse quantum channel is a depolarizing one with\nparameter $q$. Additionally, we compare the error threshold value with some\nfull quantum protocols and several existing semi-quantum ones whose\nunconditional security proofs have been provided recently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2016 03:39:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2016 02:31:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 10:01:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-16"}

Due to its popularity, it attracts many malware attacks. In fact, people\nhave discovered around one million new malware samples per quarter, and it was\nreported that over 98% of these new malware samples are in fact \"derivatives\"\n(or variants) from existing malware families. In this paper, we first show that\nruntime behaviors of malware's core functionalities are in fact similar within\na malware family. Hence, we propose a framework to combine \"runtime behavior\"\nwith \"static structures\" to detect malware variants. We present the design and\nimplementation of MONET, which has a client and a backend server module. The\nclient module is a lightweight, in-device app for behavior monitoring and\nsignature generation, and we realize this using two novel interception\ntechniques. The backend server is responsible for large scale malware\ndetection. We collect 3723 malware samples and top 500 benign apps to carry out\nextensive experiments of detecting malware variants and defending against\nmalware transformation. Our experiments show that MONET can achieve around 99%\naccuracy in detecting malware variants. Furthermore, it can defend against 10\ndifferent obfuscation and transformation techniques, while only incurs around\n7% performance overhead and about 3% battery overhead. More importantly, MONET\nwill automatically alert users with intrusion details so to prevent further\nmalicious behaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2016 16:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-13"}

This work\nconsiders the converse: to impose a real-time budget on the computation, which\nresults in the number of samples simulated being random. To complicate matters,\nthe real time taken for each simulation may depend on the sample produced, so\nthat the samples themselves are not independent of their number, and a length\nbias with respect to compute time is apparent. This is especially problematic\nwhen a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used and the final state of\nthe Markov chain -- rather than an average over all states -- is required,\nwhich is the case in parallel tempering implementations of MCMC. The length\nbias does not diminish with the compute budget in this case. It also occurs in\nsequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms, which is the focus of this paper. We\npropose an anytime framework to address the concern, using a continuous-time\nMarkov jump process to study the progress of the computation in real time. We\nfirst show that for any MCMC algorithm, the length bias of the final state's\ndistribution due to the imposed real-time computing budget can be eliminated by\nusing a multiple chain construction. The utility of this construction is then\ndemonstrated on a large-scale SMC^2 implementation, using four billion\nparticles distributed across a cluster of 128 graphics processing units on the\nAmazon EC2 service. The anytime framework imposes a real-time budget on the\nMCMC move steps within the SMC$^{2}$ algorithm, ensuring that all processors\nare simultaneously ready for the resampling step, demonstrably reducing\nidleness to due waiting times and providing substantial control over the total\ncompute budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Dec 2016 16:36:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 14:34:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 19:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

We also\nprovide practical experience for how to address bottlenecks that impede the\nefficient implementation of these algorithms and demonstrate with numerical\ntests both that our algorithms can be implemented with optimal complexity and\nthat they are suitable for very large-scale, practical applications. We provide\na reference implementation in ASPECT, an open source code for geodynamic\nmantle-convection simulations built on the deal.II library.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2016 04:23:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-12"}

The forcing is a uniform steady\nwind stress that produces both a uniform large-scale zonal flow $U(t)$ and\nsmaller-scale macroturbulence (both standing and transient eddies). The flow\n$U(t)$ is retarded by Ekman drag and by the domain-averaged topographic form\nstress produced by the eddies. The topographic form stress typically balances\nmost of the applied wind stress, while the Ekman drag provides all of the\nenergy dissipation required to balance the wind work. A collection of\nstatistically equilibrated solutions delineates the main flow regimes and the\ndependence of the time-mean $U$ on the problem parameters and the statistical\nproperties of the topography.\n  If $\\beta$ is smaller than the topographic PV gradient then the flow consists\nof stagnant pools attached to pockets of closed geostrophic contours. The\nstagnant dead zones are bordered by jets and the flow through the domain is\nconcentrated into a narrow channel of open geostrophic contours.\n  If $\\beta$ is comparable to, or larger than, the topographic PV gradient then\nall geostrophic contours are open and the flow is uniformly distributed\nthroughout the domain. In this case there is an \"eddy saturation\" regime in\nwhich $U$ is insensitive to changes in the wind stress. We show that eddy\nsaturation requires strong transient eddies that act as PV diffusion. This PV\ndiffusion does not alter the energy of the standing eddies, but it does\nincrease the topographic form stress by enhancing the correlation between\ntopographic slope and the standing-eddy pressure field. Last, using bounds\nbased on the energy and enstrophy we show that as the wind stress increases the\nflow transitions from a regime in which form stress balances the wind stress to\na regime in which the form stress is very small and large transport ensues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2016 06:13:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 02:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

Both examples have in common the two-way interaction of the flow with a\ndeformable interface or a membrane. The interaction potential approach (de\nTullio & Pascazio, Jou. Comp.

The new procedure\nconsists of two phases. In phase 1, a diffuse foreground cleaned map is\nobtained by performing a usual ILC operation in the harmonic space in a single\niteration over the desired portion of the sky. In phase 2, we obtain the final\nforeground cleaned map using an iterative ILC approach also in the harmonic\nspace, however, now, during each iteration of foreground minimization, some of\nthe regions of the sky that are not being cleaned in the current iteration, are\nreplaced by the corresponding cleaned portions of the phase 1 cleaned map. The\nnew ILC method nullifies a foreground leakage signal that is otherwise\ninevitably present in the old and usual harmonic space iterative ILC method.\nThe new method is flexible to handle input frequency maps, irrespective of\nwhether or not they initially have the same instrumental and pixel resolution,\nby bringing them to a common and maximum possible beam and pixel resolution at\nthe beginning of the analysis. This dramatically reduces data redundancy and\nhence memory usage and computational cost.

The increasing complexity of\nthese models makes it computationally expensive to both evaluate long term (>60\nseconds) behaviour and determine sensitivity of model outputs to inputs. This\nis particularly relevant in models of atrial fibrillation (AF), where\nindividual episodes last from seconds to days, and inter-episode waiting times\ncan be minutes to months. Potential mechanisms of transition between sinus\nrhythm and AF have been identified but are not well understood, and it is\ndifficult to simulate AF for long periods of time using state-of-the-art\nmodels. In this study, we implemented a Moe-type cellular automaton on a novel,\ntopologically correct surface geometry of the left atrium. We used the model to\nsimulate stochastic initiation and spontaneous termination of AF, arising from\nbursts of spontaneous activation near pulmonary veins. The simplified\nrepresentation of atrial electrical activity reduced computational cost, and so\npermitted us to investigate AF mechanisms in a probabilistic setting. We\ncomputed large numbers (~10^5) of sample paths of the model, to infer\nstochastic initiation and termination rates of AF episodes using different\nmodel parameters. By generating statistical distributions of model outputs, we\ndemonstrated how to propagate uncertainties of inputs within our microscopic\nlevel model up to a macroscopic level. Lastly, we investigated spontaneous\ntermination in the model and found a complex dependence on its past AF\ntrajectory, the mechanism of which merits future investigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2016 12:11:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-13"}
