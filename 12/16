At densities which are incommensurate with\nflux, the ground state is a Meissner state, or a vortex state, depending on the\nstrength of the flux. When the density is commensurate with the flux,\nanalytical arguments predict the existence of a ground state of central charge\n$c = 1$, which displays signatures compatible with the expected Laughlin state\nat $\\nu=1/2$. This differs from the coupled wire construction of the Laughlin\nstate in that there exists a nonzero backscattering term in the edge\nHamiltonian. We construct a phase diagram versus density and flux in order to\ndelimit the region where this precursor to the Laughlin state is the ground\nstate, by using a combination of bosonization and numerics based on the density\nmatrix renormalization group (DMRG) and exact diagonalization. We obtain the\nphase diagram from local observables and central charge. We use bipartite\ncharge fluctuations to deduce the Luttinger parameter for the edge Luttinger\nliquid corresponding to the Laughlin state.

The\nejection of gas via these outflows is believed to remove angular momentum from\nthe protostellar system, thus permitting young stars to grow by accretion of\nmaterial from the protostellar disk. The underlying mechanism for outflow\nejection is not yet understood, but is believed to be closely linked to the\nprotostellar disk. Assorted scenarios have been proposed to explain\nprotostellar outflows; the main difference between these models is the region\nwhere acceleration of material takes place: close to the protostar itself\n('X-wind', or stellar wind), in a larger region throughout the protostellar\ndisk (disk wind), or at the interface between. Because of the limits of\nobservational studies, outflow launching regions have so far only been probed\nby indirect extrapolation. Here we report observations of carbon monoxide\ntoward the outflow associated with the TMC1A protostellar system. These data\nshow that gas is ejected from a region extending up to a radial distance of 25\nastronomical units from the central protostar, and that angular momentum is\nremoved from an extended region of the disk. This demonstrates that the\noutflowing gas is launched by an extended disk wind from a Keplerian disk.\nHence, we rule out X-wind and stellar wind launching scenarios as the source of\nthe emission on the scales we observe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 17:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-16"}

The\nability to sense gravitational-strength coupling is conjectured to access a\nnatural lower bound for fundamental forces, thereby representing an important\nmilestone in searches for physics beyond the standard model. A local, in-vacuum\nsource mass is particularly sensitive to a wide class of interactions whose\neffects would otherwise be suppressed beyond detectability in regions of high\nmatter density. For example, our measurement strengthens limits on a number of\ncosmologically-motivated scalar field models, such as chameleon and symmetron\nfields, by over two orders of magnitude and paves the way toward novel\nmeasurements of Newton's gravitational constant G and the gravitational\nAharonov-Bohm effect\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 18:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

In these galaxies, the prevalence of\ngravity-sensitive absorption lines (e.g. Na I and Ca II) in their near-IR\nspectra implies an excess of low-mass ($m <= 0.5$ $M_\\odot$) stars over that\nexpected from a canonical IMF observed in low-mass ellipticals. A direct\nextrapolation of such a bottom-heavy IMF to high stellar masses ($m >= 8$\n$M_\\odot$) would lead to a corresponding deficit of neutron stars and black\nholes, and therefore of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), per unit near-IR\nluminosity in these galaxies. Peacock et al. (2014) searched for evidence of\nthis trend and found that the observed number of LMXBs per unit $K$-band\nluminosity ($N/L_K$) was nearly constant. We extend this work using new and\narchival Chandra X-ray Observatory (Chandra) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nobservations of seven low-mass ellipticals where $N/L_K$ is expected to be the\nlargest and compare these data with a variety of IMF models to test which are\nconsistent with the observed $N/L_K$. We reproduce the result of Peacock et al.\n(2014), strengthening the constraint that the slope of the IMF at $m >= 8$\n$M_\\odot$ must be consistent with a Kroupa-like IMF. We construct an IMF model\nthat is a linear combination of a Milky Way-like IMF and a broken power-law\nIMF, with a steep slope ($\\alpha_1=$ $3.84$) for stars < 0.5 $M_\\odot$ (as\nsuggested by near-IR indices), and that flattens out ($\\alpha_2=$ $2.14$) for\nstars > 0.5 $M_\\odot$, and discuss its wider ramifications and limitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 18:53:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

We derive a simplified necessary\nand sufficient separability criterion for arbitrary Gaussian states of $m$ vs\n$n$ modes, which relies on convex optimisation over marginal covariance\nmatrices on one subsystem only. We further revisit the currently known results\nstating the equivalence between separability and positive partial transposition\n(PPT) for specific classes of Gaussian states. Using matrix analysis techniques\nsuch as Schur complements and matrix means, we provide a unified treatment and\ncompact proofs of all these results. In particular, we recover the\nPPT-separability equivalence for: (i) Gaussian states of $1$ vs $n$ modes; and\n(ii) isotropic Gaussian states. In passing, we also retrieve (iii) the recently\nestablished equivalence between separability of a Gaussian state and and its\ncomplete Gaussian extendability. Our techniques are then applied to progress\nbeyond the state of the art. We show that: (iv) Gaussian states that are\ninvariant under partial transposition are necessarily separable; (v) the PPT\ncriterion is necessary and sufficient for separability for Gaussian states of\n$m$ vs $n$ modes that are symmetric under the exchange of any two modes\nbelonging to one of the parties; and (vi) Gaussian states which remain PPT\nunder passive optical operations can not be entangled by them either.

The localized phase of interacting systems (many-body\nlocalization, MBL) exhibits a long-time logarithmic growth in entanglement\nentropy that distinguishes it from the noninteracting Anderson localization\n(AL), but entanglement is difficult to measure experimentally. Here, we present\na novel correlation metric, capable of distinguishing MBL from AL in\nhigh-temperature spin systems.

Massive dust grains behave as aerodynamic particles in\nprimarily neutral dense gas, and thus are able to produce dramatic small-scale\nfluctuations in the dust-to-gas ratio. Hopkins & Lee (2016) directly simulated\nthe dynamics of neutral dust grains in super-sonic MHD turbulence, typical of\nGMCs, and showed that the dust-to-gas fluctuations can exceed factor ~1000 on\nsmall scales, with important implications for star formation, stellar\nabundances, and dust behavior and growth. However, even in primarily neutral\ngas in GMCs, dust grains are negatively charged and Lorentz forces are\nnon-negligible. Therefore, we extend our previous study by including the\neffects of Lorentz forces on charged grains (in addition to drag). For small\ncharged grains (sizes <0.1 micron), Lorentz forces suppress dust-to-gas ratio\nfluctuations, while for large grains (sizes >1 micron), Lorentz forces have\nessentially no effect, trends that are well explained with a simple theory of\ndust magnetization. In some special intermediate cases, Lorentz forces can\nenhance dust-gas segregation. Regardless, for the physically expected scaling\nof dust charge with grain size, we find the most important effects depend on\ngrain size (via the drag equation) with Lorentz forces/charge as a second-order\ncorrection. We show that the dynamics we consider are determined by three\ndimensionless numbers in the limit of weak background magnetic fields: the\nturbulent Mach number, a dust drag parameter (proportional to grain size) and a\ndust Lorentz parameter (proportional to grain charge); these allow us to\ngeneralize our simulations to a wide range of conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 21:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2017 23:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-11"}

In this work we use 19\nhigh-resolution simulations of disc galaxies from the NIHAO sample to study the\nformation and the evolution of clumps in the discs of high redshift galaxies.\nWe use mock HST - CANDELS observations created with the radiative transfer code\nGRASIL-3D to carry out, for the first time, a quantitative comparison of the\nobserved fraction of clumpy galaxies and its evolution with redshift with\nsimulations. We find a good agreement between the observed clumpy fraction and\nthe one of the NIHAO galaxies. We find that dust attenuation can suppress\nintrinsically bright clumps and enhance less luminous ones. In our galaxy\nsample we only find clumps in light (u-band) from young stars but not in\nstellar mass surface density maps. This means that the NIHAO sample does not\nshow clumpy stellar discs but rather a clumpy light distribution originating\nfrom clumpy star formation events. The clumps found in the NIHAO sample match\nobserved age/color gradients as a function of distance from the galaxy center\nbut they show no sign of inward migration. Clumps in our simulations disperse\non timescales of a about a hundred Myr and their contribution to bulge growth\nis negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 21:21:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2017 06:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

The DD+SH+RD model is able to reproduce the entire\ntransient behavior over 10$^{-8}$-1s range in timescale for both SET and RESET\noperations for a range of bias, temperature. Remarkably, a universal RESET\nbehaviour of $log(I)\\propto m*log(t)$, where $m\\approx -1/10$, is reproduced.\nThe quantitatively different voltage time dilemma for SET and RESET is also\nreplicated for a range of ambient temperature. This demonstrates a\ncomprehensive model for resistance switching in PCMO based RRAM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 22:24:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Aug 2017 05:50:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

Representation\nlearning refers to the discovery of useful encodings of data that make\ndomain-relevant information explicit. Factorial representations identify\nunderlying independent causal factors of variation in data. A factorial\nrepresentation is compact and faithful, makes the causal factors explicit, and\nfacilitates human interpretation of data. Factorial representations support a\nvariety of applications, including the generation of novel examples, indexing\nand search, novelty detection, and transfer learning.\n  This article surveys various constraints that encourage a learning algorithm\nto discover factorial representations. I dichotomize the constraints in terms\nof unsupervised and supervised inductive bias. Unsupervised inductive biases\nexploit assumptions about the environment, such as the statistical distribution\nof factor coefficients, assumptions about the perturbations a factor should be\ninvariant to (e.g. a representation of an object can be invariant to rotation,\ntranslation or scaling), and assumptions about how factors are combined to\nsynthesize an observation. Supervised inductive biases are constraints on the\nrepresentations based on additional information connected to observations.\nSupervisory labels come in variety of types, which vary in how strongly they\nconstrain the representation, how many factors are labeled, how many\nobservations are labeled, and whether or not we know the associations between\nthe constraints and the factors they are related to.\n  This survey brings together a wide variety of models that all touch on the\nproblem of learning factorial representations and lays out a framework for\ncomparing these models based on the strengths of the underlying supervised and\nunsupervised inductive biases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 22:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-19"}

Recent electrophysiological recordings suggest that response\ndynamics in intermediate visual cortical area V4, shaped by feedback from\nprefrontal cortex (PFC), may play a key role. To probe the algorithms that may\nunderlie these findings, we build and test a model of V4 and PFC interactions\nbased on a hierarchical predictive coding framework. We propose that\nprobabilistic inference occurs in two steps. Initially, V4 responses are driven\nsolely by bottom-up sensory input and are thus strongly influenced by the level\nof occlusion. After a delay, V4 responses combine both feedforward input and\nfeedback signals from the PFC; the latter reflect predictions made by PFC about\nthe visual stimulus underlying V4 activity. We find that this model captures\nkey features of V4 and PFC dynamics observed in experiments. Specifically, PFC\nresponses are strongest for occluded stimuli and delayed responses in V4 are\nless sensitive to occlusion, supporting our hypothesis that the feedback\nsignals from PFC underlie robust discrimination of occluded shapes. Thus, our\nstudy proposes that area V4 and PFC participate in hierarchical inference, with\nfeedback signals encoding top-down predictions about occluded shapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 00:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-19"}

Polarization in the prompt phase spans\na wide range, and may be as high as $\\gtrsim 50\\%$. In the afterglow phase,\nhowever, it is usually below $10\\%$. According to the standard fireball model,\nGRBs are produced by synchrotron radiation and Compton scattering process in a\nhighly relativistic jet ejected from the central engine. It is widely accepted\nthat prompt emissions occur in the internal shock when shells with different\nvelocities collide with each other, and the magnetic field advected by the jet\nfrom the central engine can be ordered in large scale.

In this paper, we\ncalculate the polarization properties of the synchrotron self-Compton process\nfrom a highly relativistic jet, in which the magnetic field is randomly\ndistributed in the shock plane.

We show that\n$\\tilde{O}\\bigl(\\frac{1}{\\gamma \\pi_\\star}\\bigr)$ steps of the chain suffice to\nestimate $\\gamma$ up to multiplicative constants with high probability. When\n$\\pi$ is uniform, this matches (up to logarithmic corrections) the lower bound\nof Hsu, Kontorovich, and Szepesvari.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 01:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-19"}

For $n=2$ and\n$N\\ge n+1$, the first and third authors introduced a new CR invariant\n$g^{(1,1)}(X)$ of $X$. The vanishing of this invariant will give the interior\nregularity of the Harvey-Lawson solution up to normalization. For $n\\ge 3$ and\n$N>n+1$, the problem still remains open. In this paper, we generalize the\ninvariant $g^{(1,1)}(X)$ to higher dimension as $g^{(\\Lambda^n 1)}(X)$ and show\nthat if $g^{(\\Lambda^n 1)}(X)=0$, then the interior has at most finite number\nof rational singularities. In particular, if $X$ is Calabi--Yau of real\ndimension $5$, then the vanishing of this invariant is equivalent to give the\ninterior regularity up to normalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 03:35:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-19"}

Such changes occur due to the effect of marketing,\nadvertising, or changes in ground truth. First, we use the revealed preference\nframework to detect the unknown time point (change point) at which the utility\nfunction changed. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for detecting\nthe change point. Second, in the presence of noisy measurements, we propose a\nmethod to detect the change point and construct a decision test. Also, an\noptimization criteria is provided to recover the linear perturbation\ncoefficients. Finally, to reduce the computational cost, a dimensionality\nreduction algorithm using Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform is presented. The\nresults developed are illustrated on two real datasets: Yahoo! Tech Buzz\ndataset and Youstatanalyzer dataset. By using the results developed in the\npaper, several useful insights can be gleaned from these data sets. First, the\nchanges in ground truth affecting the utility of the agent can be detected by\nutility maximization behaviour in online search. Second, the recovered utility\nfunctions satisfy the single crossing property indicating strategic substitute\nbehaviour in online search. Third, due to the large number of videos in\nYouTube, the utility maximization behaviour was verified through the\ndimensionality reduction algorithm. Finally, using the utility function\nrecovered in the lower dimension, we devise an algorithm to predict total\ntraffic in YouTube.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 05:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

For moderate large S, large beads migrate to an intermediate\ndepth in the bed: this is called intermediate segregation. For the largest S,\nlarge beads migrate to the bottom: this is called reverse segregation (in\ncontrast with surface segregation). As the reversal and intermediate depth\nvalues depend on the bead fraction, this numerical study mainly uses a single\nlarge tracer. Small fractions are also computed showing the link between a\ntracer behavior and segregation process. For half-filled rotating drum and for\nrough incline, two and three (3D) dimensional cases are studied. In the\ntumbler, trajectories of a large tracer show that it reaches a constant depth\nduring the flow. For large S, this depth is intermediate with a progressive\nsinking when S increases. Largest S correspond to tracers at the bottom of the\nflow. All 3D simulation are in quantitative agreement with the experiments. In\nthe flow down an incline, a large tracer reaches an equilibrium depth during\nflow. For large S, its depth is intermediate, inside the bed. For the largest\nS, its depth is reverse, near the bottom. Results are slightly different for\nthin or thick flow. For 3D thick flows, the reversal between surface and bottom\npositions occurs within a short range of S: no tracer stabilizes near\nmid-height and two reachable intermediate depth layers exist, below the surface\nand above the bottom. For 3D thin flows, all intermediate depths are reachable,\ndepending on S. The numerical study of larger tracer fractions (5-10%) shows\nthe 3 segregation patterns (surface, intermediate, reverse) corresponding to\nthe 3 types of equilibrium depth.

To reach this\nperformance requires an accurate and robust data analysis method, especially\nsince the possible WEP violation signal will be dominated by a strongly colored\nnoise. An important complication is brought by the fact that some values will\nbe missing -therefore, the measured time series will not be strictly regularly\nsampled. Those missing values induce a spectral leakage that significantly\nincreases the noise in Fourier space, where the WEP violation signal is looked\nfor, thereby complicating scientific returns. Recently, we developed an\ninpainting algorithm to correct the MICROSCOPE data for missing values. This\ncode has been integrated in the official MICROSCOPE data processing pipeline\nbecause it enables us to significantly measure an equivalence principle\nviolation (EPV) signal in a model-independent way, in the inertial satellite\nconfiguration. In this work, we present several improvements to the method that\nmay allow us now to reach the MICROSCOPE requirements for both inertial and\nspin satellite configurations. The main improvement has been obtained using a\nprior on the power spectrum of the colored-noise that can be directly derived\nfrom the incomplete data. We show that after reconstructing missing values with\nthis new algorithm, a least-squares fit may allow us to significantly measure\nan EPV signal with a 0.96x10^-15 precision in the inertial mode and 1.2x10^-15\nprecision in the spin mode. Although, the inpainting method presented in this\npaper has been optimized to the MICROSCOPE data, it remains sufficiently\ngeneral to be used in the general context of missing data in time series\ndominated by an unknown colored-noise. The improved inpainting software, called\nICON, is freely available at http://www.cosmostat.org/software/icon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 13:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

In line with this, significant\nresults have been obtained within the research on data-aware business processes\n(DABP), which studies the marriage between static and dynamic aspects of a\nsystem within a unified framework.\n  Here, we investigate the verification of DABP in the presence of ontologies,\nand provide the following contributions: (1) We propose a formal framework\ncalled Golog-KABs (GKABs), by leveraging on the state of the art formalisms for\nDABP equipped with ontologies. GKABs enable us to specify semantically-rich\nDABP, where the system dynamics are specified using a high-level action\nlanguage inspired by the Golog programming language.

We study the\ndistribution of truncated linear statistics of the form $\\tilde{L}=\\sum_{i=1}^p\nf(\\lambda_i)$ with $p<N$. This problem has been considered by us in a previous\npaper when the $p$ eigenvalues are further constrained to be the largest ones\n(or the smallest). In this second paper we consider the same problem without\nthis restriction which leads to a rather different analysis. We introduce a new\nensemble which is related, but not equivalent, to the \"thinned ensembles\"\nintroduced by Bohigas and Pato. This question is motivated by the study of\npartial sums of proper time delays in chaotic quantum dots, which are\ncharacteristic times of the scattering process. Using the Coulomb gas\ntechnique, we derive the large deviation function for $\\tilde{L}$. Large\ndeviations of linear statistics $L=\\sum_{i=1}^N f(\\lambda_i)$ are usually\ndominated by the energy of the Coulomb gas, which scales as $\\sim N^2$,\nimplying that the relative fluctuations are of order $1/N$. For the truncated\nlinear statistics considered here, there is a whole region (including the\ntypical fluctuations region), where the energy of the Coulomb gas is frozen and\nthe large deviation function is purely controlled by an entropic effect.\nBecause the entropy scales as $\\sim N$, the relative fluctuations are of order\n$1/\\sqrt{N}$. Our analysis relies on the mapping on a problem of $p$ fictitious\nnon-interacting fermions in $N$ energy levels, which can exhibit both positive\nand negative effective (absolute) temperatures. We determine the large\ndeviation function characterizing the distribution of the truncated linear\nstatistics, and show that, for the case considered here\n($f(\\lambda)=1/\\lambda$), the corresponding phase diagram is separated in three\ndifferent phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 13:54:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 May 2017 15:27:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}

One\nnotable insight obtained from our results is that different applications with\nvarying parallelization benefits result in different optimal strategies.\nFinally, we complement our analytical results by applying them to various\napplications showing the optimality of the proposed scheduling strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 14:37:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 17:44:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2017 11:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-03"}

The\ncontinual emergence of small transient structures from helmet streamers is\nthought to constitute one of the main sources of the slow wind. Determining the\nheight at which these transients are released is an important factor in\ndetermining the conditions under which the slow solar wind forms. To this end,\nwe have carried out a multipoint analysis of small transient structures\nreleased from a north-south tilted helmet streamer into the slow solar wind\nover a broad range of position angles during Carrington Rotation 2137.\nCombining the remote-sensing observations taken by the Solar-TErrestrial\nRElations Observatory (STEREO) mission with coronagraphic observations from the\nSolar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) spacecraft, we show that the release\nof such small transient structures (often called blobs), which subsequently\nmove away from the Sun, is associated with the concomitant formation of\ntransient structures collapsing back towards the Sun; the latter have been\nreferred to by previous authors as raining inflows. This is the first direct\nassociation between outflowing blobs and raining inflows, which locates the\nformation of blobs above the helmet streamers and gives strong support that the\nblobs are released by magnetic reconnection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 14:37:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

In general, the optimal strategies for content placement in\nHCNs remain largely unknown and deriving them forms the theme of this paper. To\nthis end, we adopt the popular random HCN model where $K$ tiers of BSs are\nmodelled as independent Poisson point processes distributed in the plane with\ndifferent densities. Further, the random caching scheme is considered where\neach of a given set of $M$ files with corresponding popularity measures is\nplaced at each BS of a particular tier with a corresponding probability, called\nplacement probability. The probabilities are identical for all BSs in the same\ntier but vary over tiers, giving the name tier-level content placement. We\nconsider the network performance metric, hit probability, defined as the\nprobability that a file requested by the typical user is delivered successfully\nto the user. We maximize the hit probability over content placement\nprobabilities, which yields the optimal tier-level placement policies. For the\ncase of uniform received signal-to-interference thresholds for successful\ntransmissions for BSs in different tiers, the policy is in closed-form where\nthe placement probability for a particular file is proportional to the\nsquare-root of the corresponding popularity measure with an offset depending on\nBS caching capacities. For the general case of non-uniform SIR thresholds, the\noptimization problem is non-convex and a sub-optimal placement policy is\ndesigned by approximation, which has a similar structure as in the case of\nuniform SIR thresholds and shown by simulation to be close-to-optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 15:26:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Jun 2017 19:32:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

Wearable accelerometry devices allow collection of high-density\nactivity data in large epidemiological studies both in-the-lab as well as\nin-the-wild (free-living). Such data can be used to detect and identify periods\nof sustained harmonic walking. This report aims to establish whether the micro-\nand macro-features of walking identified in the laboratory and free-living\nenvironments are associated with measures of physical function, mobility,\nfatigability, and fitness.\n  Methods. Fifty-one older adults (median age 77.5) enrolled in the\nDevelopmental Epidemiologic Cohort Study in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania were\nincluded in the analyses. The study included an in-the-lab component as well as\n7 days of monitoring in-the-wild. Participants were equipped with hip-worn\nActigraph GT3X+ activity monitors, which collect high-density raw accelerometry\ndata. We applied a walking identification algorithm to the data and defined\nfeatures of walking, such as participant-specific walking acceleration and\ncadence. The association between these walking features and physical function,\nmobility, fatigability, and fitness was quantified using linear regression\nanalysis.\n  Results. Micro-scale features of walking (acceleration and cadence) estimated\nfrom in-the-lab and in-the-wild data were associated with measures of physical\nfunction, mobility, fatigability, and fitness. In-the-lab median walking\nacceleration was strongly inversely associated with physical function,\nmobility, fatigability and fitness. Additionally, in-the-wild daily walking\ntime was inversely associated with usual- and fast-paced 400m walking time.\n  Conclusions. The proposed accelerometry-derived walking features are\nsignificantly associated with measures of physical function, mobility,\nfatigability, and fitness, which provides evidence of convergent validity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 00:10:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 21:16:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-20"}
