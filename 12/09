KaiC forms a homohexamer, with each monomer consisting of\ntwo domains, CI and CII. Both domains can bind and hydrolyze ATP, but only the\nCII domain can be phosphorylated, at two residues, in a well-defined sequence.\nWhile this system has been studied extensively, how the clock is driven\nthermodynamically has remained elusive. Inspired by recent experimental\nobservations and building on ideas from previous mathematical models, we\npresent a new, thermodynamically consistent, statistical-mechanical model of\nthe clock. At its heart are two main ideas: i) ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain\nprovides the thermodynamic driving force for the clock, switching KaiC between\nan active conformational state in which its phosphorylation level tends to rise\nand an inactive one in which it tends to fall; ii) phosphorylation of the CII\ndomain provides the timer for the hydrolysis in the CI domain. The model also\nnaturally explains how KaiA, by acting as a nucleotide exchange factor, can\nstimulate phosphorylation of KaiC, and how the differential affinity of KaiA\nfor the different KaiC phosphoforms generates the characteristic temporal order\nof KaiC phosphorylation. As the phosphorylation level in the CII domain rises,\nthe release of ADP from CI slows down, making the inactive conformational state\nof KaiC more stable. In the inactive state, KaiC binds KaiB, which not only\nstabilizes this state further, but also leads to the sequestration of KaiA, and\nhence to KaiC dephosphorylation. Using a dedicated kinetic Monte Carlo\nalgorithm, we show that the model can describe a wealth of experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 16:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-21"}

The underlying physical mechanism for VCMA is known to\ninvolve a change in the d-orbital occupation on the transition metal interface\natoms with an applied electric field. However, a simple qualitative picture of\nhow this occupation controls the magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) and even\nwhy in certain cases the MCA has opposite sign still remains elusive. In this\npaper, we exploit a simple model of orbital populations to elucidate a number\nof features typical for the interface MCA and the effect of electric field on\nit, for 3d transition metal thin films used in magnetic tunnel junctions. We\nfind that in all considered cases including the Fe (001) surface, clean\nFe1-xCox(001)/MgO interface and oxidized Fe(001)/MgO interface, the effects of\nalloying and electric field enhance the MCA energy with electron depletion\nwhich is largely explained by the occupancy of the minority-spin dxz,yz\norbitals. On the other hand, the hole doped Fe(001) exhibits an inverse VCMA,\nwhere the MCA enhancement is achieved when electrons are accumulated at the Fe\n(001)/MgO interface with applied electric field. In this regime we predict a\nsignificantly enhanced VCMA which exceeds 1pJ/Vm. Realizing this regime\nexperimentally may be favorable for a practical purpose of voltage driven\nmagnetization reversal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 16:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

Inadequate bandwidth allocation to a TCP\nflow may lead to timeout and since TCP source drops its congestion window\n($cwnd$) immediately after a timeout, it may affect the average throughput\nadversely. On the other hand, since the TCP source increases its $cwnd$ only\nlinearly upon the availability of bandwidth, any excess assignment of bandwidth\nmay remain underutilized. The proposed scheduling algorithms address this by\nallocating the resources based on $cwnd$ and TCP timeout.

It\nis remarkable both because of its effectiveness, in spite of using random\nmatrices to communicate error information, and because it completely removes\nthe taxing requirement of maintaining symmetric weights in a physical neural\nsystem. To better understand random backpropagation, we first connect it to the\nnotions of local learning and learning channels. Through this connection, we\nderive several alternatives to RBP, including skipped RBP (SRPB), adaptive RBP\n(ARBP), sparse RBP, and their combinations (e.g. ASRBP) and analyze their\ncomputational complexity.

Inspite of numerous efforts to detect WIMP, till now we have no\ndirect evidence for it. A possible explanation for this non-observation of dark\nmatter could be because of its very feeble interaction strength and hence,\nfailing to thermalise with the rest of the cosmic soup. In other words, the\ndark matter might be of non-thermal origin where the relic density is obtained\nby the so-called freeze-in mechanism. Furthermore, if this non-thermal dark\nmatter is itself produced substantially from the decay of another non-thermal\nmother particle, then their distribution functions may differ in both size and\nshape from the usual equilibrium distribution function. In this work, we have\nstudied such a non-thermal (fermionic) dark matter scenario in the light of a\nnew type of $U(1)_{\\rm B-L}$ model.

Safety verification is the problem to\ndetermine if vehicles will be able to cross the intersection without colliding\nwith current drivers' inputs. We translate this safety verification problem\ninto a jobshop scheduling problem, which minimizes the maximum lateness and\nevaluates if the optimal cost is zero. The zero optimal cost corresponds to the\ncase in which all vehicles can cross each conflict area without collisions.\nComputing the optimal cost requires solving a Mixed Integer Nonlinear\nProgramming (MINLP) problem due to the nonlinear second-order dynamics of the\nvehicles. We therefore estimate this optimal cost by formulating two related\nMixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems that assume simpler vehicle\ndynamics. We prove that these two MILP problems yield lower and upper bounds of\nthe optimal cost. We also quantify the worst case approximation errors of these\nMILP problems.

However, there are two major limitations in\nrecent studies on network embedding: (1) they are usually general-purpose\nembedding methods, which are independent of the specific tasks; and (2) most of\nthese approaches can only deal with homogeneous networks, where the\nheterogeneity of the network is ignored. Hence, challenges faced here are two\nfolds: (1) how to embed the network under the guidance of the author\nidentification task, and (2) how to select the best type of information due to\nthe heterogeneity of the network.\n  To address the challenges, we propose a task-guided and path-augmented\nheterogeneous network embedding model. In our model, nodes are first embedded\nas vectors in latent feature space. Embeddings are then shared and jointly\ntrained according to task-specific and network-general objectives. We extend\nthe existing unsupervised network embedding to incorporate meta paths in\nheterogeneous networks, and select paths according to the specific task. The\nguidance from author identification task for network embedding is provided both\nexplicitly in joint training and implicitly during meta path selection.

For both samples, $\\sigma_{\\star}$ is determined via two\ndifferent methods that are popular in the literature, and we provide fits for\neach sample based on both sets of $\\sigma_{\\star}$. We find the fit to the AGN\nsample is shallower than the fit to the quiescent galaxy sample, and that the\nslopes for each sample are in agreement with previous investigations. However,\nthe intercepts to the quiescent galaxy relations are notably higher than those\nfound in previous studies, due to the systematically lower $\\sigma_{\\star}$\nmeasurements that we obtain from IFS. We find that this may be driven, in part,\nby poorly constrained measurements of bulge effective radius ($r_{e}$) for the\nquiescent galaxy sample, which may bias the $\\sigma_{\\star}$ measurements low.\nWe use these quiescent galaxy parameterizations, as well as one from the\nliterature, to recalculate the virial scaling factor $f$. We assess the\npotential biases in each measurement, and suggest $f=4.82\\pm1.67$ as the best\ncurrently available estimate.

These systems roughly double in number density between\n$z=0$ and $z=2$-$3$, but decline by an order of magnitude from this peak by\n$z\\sim 6$. This evolution mirrors that of the global star formation rate\ndensity, which could reflect a connection between star formation feedback and\nstrong MgII absorbers. We compared our results to the Illustris cosmological\nsimulation at $z=2$-$4$ by assigning absorption to catalogued dark-matter halos\nand by direct extraction of spectra from the simulation volume. To reproduce\nour results using the halo catalogs, we require circumgalactic (CGM) MgII\nenvelopes within halos of progressively smaller mass at earlier times. This\noccurs naturally if we define the lower integration cutoff using SFR rather\nthan mass. MgII profiles calculated directly from the Illustris volume yield\nfar too few strong absorbers. We argue that this arises from unresolved phase\nspace structure of CGM gas, particularly from turbulent velocities on sub-mesh\nscales. The presence of CGM MgII at $z>6$-- just $\\sim 250$ Myr after the\nreionization redshift implied by Planck--suggests that enrichment of intra-halo\ngas may have begun before the presumed host galaxies' stellar populations were\nmature and dynamically relaxed.

The features, dictionaries and the encoding representation for\nthe classifier are all learned simultaneously. The representation is orderless\nand therefore is particularly useful for material and texture recognition. The\nEncoding Layer generalizes robust residual encoders such as VLAD and Fisher\nVectors, and has the property of discarding domain specific information which\nmakes the learned convolutional features easier to transfer. Additionally,\njoint training using multiple datasets of varied sizes and class labels is\nsupported resulting in increased recognition performance. The experimental\nresults show superior performance as compared to state-of-the-art methods using\ngold-standard databases such as MINC-2500, Flickr Material Database,\nKTH-TIPS-2b, and two recent databases 4D-Light-Field-Material and GTOS. The\nsource code for the complete system are publicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 21:27:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-12"}

However, interpretation of these images is\ndifficult because the degree of polarization is highly sensitive to the angle\nof scattering of stellar light off the disk surface. We examine how disks with\nand without gaps created by planets appear in scattered polarized light as a\nfunction of inclination angle. Isophotes of inclined disks without gaps are\ndistorted in polarized light, giving the appearance that the disks are more\neccentric or more highly inclined than they truly are. Apparent gap locations\nare unaffected by polarization, but the gap contrast changes. In face-on disks\nwith gaps, we find that the brightened far edge of the gap scatters less\npolarized light than the rest of the disk, resulting in slightly decreased\ncontrast between the gap trough and the brightened far edge. In inclined disks,\ngaps can take on the appearance of being localized \"holes\" in brightness rather\nthan full axisymmetric structures. Photocenter offsets along the minor axis of\nthe disk in both total intensity and polarized intensity images can be readily\nexplained by the finite thickness of the disk. Alone, polarized scattered light\nimages of disks do not necessarily reveal intrinsic disk structure.

We used a biogeochemical box model to test\nwhich conditions are necessary to cause large swings in atmospheric N2\npressure. Parameters for our model are constrained by observations of modern\nEarth and reconstructions of biomass burial and oxidative weathering in deep\ntime. A 1-D climate model was used to model potential effects on atmospheric\nclimate. In a second set of tests, we perturbed our box model to investigate\nwhich parameters have the greatest impact on the evolution of atmospheric pN2\nand consider possible implications for nitrogen cycling on other planets. Our\nresults suggest that (a) a high rate of biomass burial would have been needed\nin the Archean to draw down atmospheric pN2 to less than half modern levels,\n(b) the resulting effect on temperature could probably have been compensated by\nincreasing solar luminosity and a mild increase in pCO2, and (c) atmospheric\noxygenation could have initiated a stepwise pN2 rebound through oxidative\nweathering.

Here we analyse 66 numerical\nsimulations in order to explore the sensitivity of the dynamo-generated\nmagnetic field to the planets interior properties. The degree l=4 field model\nVIP4 and up-to-date interior models based on ab initio simulations serve as\nbenchmarks. Our results suggest that VIP4-like magnetic fields can be found for\na number of different models. We find that whether we assume an ideal gas or\nuse the more realistic interior model based on ab initio simulations makes no\ndifference. However, two other factors are important. Low Rayleigh number leads\nto strong axial dipole contribution while the axial dipole dominance is lost\nwhen the convective driving is too strong. The required intermediate range that\nyields Jupiter-like magnetic fields depends on the other system properties. The\nsecond factor is the convective magnetic Reynolds number profile Rmc(r), a\nproduct of the non-axisymmetric flow velocity and electrical conductivity. We\nfind that the depth where Rmc exceeds about 50 is a good proxy for the top of\nthe dynamo region. When the dynamo region sits too deep, the axial dipole is\nonce more too dominant due to geometric reasons. We extrapolated our results to\nJupiter and the result suggests that the Jovian dynamo extends to 95% of the\nplanetary radius.\n  The zonal flows in our simulations are dominated by an equatorial jet largely\nconfined to the molecular layer. Where the jet reaches down to higher\nelectrical conductivities, it is gives rise to a secondary alpha-Omega dynamo\nthat modifies the dipole-dominated field produced deeper in the planet.

The subproblems themselves can be challenging to solve when $p$ is\nlarge due to the dependencies across dimensions.

This characteristic width is higher than other young associations, which\nmay be due to incompleteness in the current census of low-mass TWA stars. A\ntentative overpopulation of isolated planetary-mass members similar to 2MASS\nJ11472421-2040204 and 2MASS J11193254-1137466 is identified: this indicates\nthat there might be as many as $10^{+13}_{-5}$ similar members of TWA with\nhot-start model-dependent masses estimated at $\\sim$ 5-7 $M_{\\rm Jup}$, most of\nwhich would be too faint to be detected in 2MASS. Our new radial velocity\nmeasurements corroborate the membership of 2MASS J11472421-2040204, and secure\nTWA 28 (M8.5$\\gamma$), TWA 29 (M9.5$\\gamma$) and TWA 33 (M4.5e) as members. The\ndiscovery of 2MASS J09553336-0208403, a young L7-type interloper unrelated to\nTWA, is also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 01:03:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 20:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

Traditional\nhand segmentation approaches rely on a large corpus of manually labeled data to\ngenerate robust hand detectors. However, these approaches still face challenges\nas the appearance of the hand varies greatly across users, tasks, environments\nor illumination conditions. A key observation in the case of many wearable\napplications and interfaces is that, it is only necessary to accurately detect\nthe user's hands in a specific situational context. Based on this observation,\nwe introduce an interactive approach to learn a person-specific hand\nsegmentation model that does not require any manually labeled training data.\nOur approach proceeds in two steps, an interactive bootstrapping step for\nidentifying moving hand regions, followed by learning a personalized user\nspecific hand appearance model. Concretely, our approach uses two convolutional\nneural networks: (1) a gesture network that uses pre-defined motion information\nto detect the hand region; and (2) an appearance network that learns a person\nspecific model of the hand region based on the output of the gesture network.\nDuring training, to make the appearance network robust to errors in the gesture\nnetwork, the loss function of the former network incorporates the confidence of\nthe gesture network while learning.

In\nthis approach, these costs are given by an underlying metric on the set of all\nagents plus alternatives. Social choice rules have access to only the ordinal\npreferences of agents but not the latent cardinal costs that induce them.\nDistortion is then defined as the ratio between the social cost (typically the\nsum of agent costs) of the alternative chosen by the mechanism at hand, and\nthat of the optimal alternative chosen by an omniscient algorithm. The\nworst-case distortion of a social choice rule is, therefore, a measure of how\nclose it always gets to the optimal alternative without any knowledge of the\nunderlying costs. Under this model, it has been conjectured that Ranked Pairs,\nthe well-known weighted-tournament rule, achieves a distortion of at most 3\n[Anshelevich et al. 2015]. We disprove this conjecture by constructing a\nsequence of instances which shows that the worst-case distortion of Ranked\nPairs is at least 5. Our lower bound on the worst case distortion of Ranked\nPairs matches a previously known upper bound for the Copeland rule, proving\nthat in the worst case, the simpler Copeland rule is at least as good as Ranked\nPairs. And as long as we are limited to (weighted or unweighted) tournament\nrules, we demonstrate that randomization cannot help achieve an expected\nworst-case distortion of less than 3. Using the concept of approximate\nmajorization within the distortion framework, we prove that Copeland and\nRandomized Dictatorship achieve low constant factor fairness-ratios (5 and 3\nrespectively), which is a considerable generalization of similar results for\nthe sum of costs and single largest cost objectives.

When the Rayleigh number is large enough, the dynamics at the\nbottom and top plates can be separated into an impact region of downwelling\nplumes, an ejection region of upwelling plumes and an interior region away from\nthe side walls. The latter is dominated by the shear of the large-scale\ncirculation (LSC) roll which fills the whole cell and continuously varies its\norientation. The working fluid is liquid mercury or gallium at a Prandtl number\nPr=0.021 for Rayleigh numbers between Ra=3e+5 and 4e+8. The generated turbulent\nmomentum transfer corresponds to macroscopic flow Reynolds numbers with values\nbetween 1800 and 46000. It is shown that the viscous boundary layers for the\nlargest Rayleigh numbers are highly transitional and obey properties that are\ndirectly comparable to transitional channel flows at friction Reynolds numbers\nRe_tau slightly below 100. The transitional character of the viscous boundary\nlayer is also underlined by the strong enhancement of the fluctuations of the\nwall stress components with increasing Rayleigh number. An extrapolation of our\nanalysis data suggests that the friction Reynolds number Re_tau in the velocity\nboundary layer can reach values of 200 for Ra beyond 1e+11.

The stability of fixed points on switching manifolds\nis investigated in scenarios for which one-sided derivatives are locally\nbounded. The lack of differentiability allows fixed points to be Milnor\nattractors despite being unstable. For this reason a measure-theoretic notion\nof stability is considered in addition to standard notions of stability.\nLocally the map is well approximated by a piecewise-linear map that is linearly\nhomogeneous when the fixed point is at the origin. For the class of continuous,\nlinearly homogeneous maps, and $o({\\bf x})$ perturbations of these maps, a\nsufficient condition for the exponential stability of the origin is obtained.\nIt is shown how the stability of the origin can be determined by analysing\ninvariant probability measures of a map on $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$.

The size-consistent effect is\neffectively incorporated by treating quadruples within the formulation of\ncoupled electron pair approximation. As in coupled-cluster theory, quadruple\nexcitations are approximated by a disconnected product of double excitations.\nDespite its conceptual similarity to the standard single- and multireference\nanalogues, such a generalization requires careful derivation, as the\nspin-projected CI space is non-orthogonal and overcomplete. Although our\nmethods generally yield better results than ECISD, size-consistency is only\napproximately retained because the action of a symmetry-projection operator is\nsize-inconsistent. In this work, we focus on simple models where\nexclusion-principle-violating terms, which eliminate undesired contributions to\nthe correlation effects, are either completely neglected or averaged. These\nmodels possess an orbital-invariant energy functional that is to be minimized\nby diagonalizing an energy-shifted effective Hamiltonian within the singles and\ndoubles manifold. This allows for a straightforward generalization of the ECISD\nanalytical gradients needed to determine molecular properties and geometric\noptimization. Given the multireference nature of the spin-projected\nHartree--Fock method, the proposed approaches are expected to handle static\ncorrelation, unlike single-reference analogues.

Even though\nmmWave bands are scarcely occupied, the design of a prospect transceiver should\nguarantee the efficient coexistence with the incumbent services in these bands.\nTo that end, in this paper, two underlay cognitive transceiver designs are\nproposed that enable the mmWave spectrum access while controlling the\ninterference to the incumbent users. MmWave systems usually require large\nantenna arrays to achieve satisfactory performance and thus, they cannot\nsupport fully digital transceiver designs due to high demands in hardware\ncomplexity and power consumption. Thus, in order to develop efficient\nsolutions, the proposed approaches are based on a hybrid analog-digital\npre-coding architecture. In such hybrid designs, the overall beamformer can be\nfactorized in a low dimensional digital counterpart applied in the baseband and\nin an analog one applied in the RF domain. The first cognitive solution\ndeveloped in this paper designs the cognitive hybrid pre-coder by maximizing\nthe mutual information between its two ends subject to interference, power and\nhardware constraints related to the analog counterpart. The second solution\naims at reduced complexity requirements and thus derives the hybrid pre-coder\nby minimizing the Frobenious norm of its difference to the optimal digital only\none. A novel solution for the post-coder at the cognitive receiver part is\nfurther proposed here based on a hardware constrained Minimum Mean Square Error\ncriterion. Simulations show that the performance of both the proposed hybrid\napproaches is very close to the one of the fully digital solution for typical\nwireless environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 09:51:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-12"}

Secondly we solve for the\ntropospheric (non-dispersive) contributions by using fast frequency-switching\nat the target mm-wavelengths.

From the geometric point of view,\nthe space of states of any system is described by a \\emph{uniform Poisson space\nwith transition probability}. Both these structures are here perceived as\nformal translations of \\emph{the fundamental twofold role of properties in\nMechanics}: they are at the same time quantities and transformations. The\nquestion becomes then to understand the precise articulation between these two\nroles. The analysis will show that Quantum Mechanics can be thought as\ndistinguishing itself from Classical Mechanics by a compatibility condition\nbetween properties-as-quantities and properties-as-transformations.\n  Moreover, this dissertation shows the existence of a tension between a\ncertain \"abstract way\" of conceiving mathematical structures, used in the\npractice of mathematical physics, and the necessary capacity to specify\nparticular states or observables. It then becomes important to understand how,\nwithin the formalism, one can construct a \\emph{labelling scheme}.

Unfortunately, due to the\nlack of mature fabrication support, QCA-based circuits often suffer from\nvarious types of manufacturing defects and variations, and therefore, are\nunreliable and error-prone. QCA-based Exclusive-OR (XOR) gates are frequently\nused in the construction of several computing subsystems such as adders, linear\nfeedback shift registers, parity generators and checkers. However, none of the\nexisting designs for QCA XOR gates have considered the issue of ensuring\nfault-tolerance. Simulation results also show that these designs can hardly\ntolerate any fault. We investigate the applicability of various existing\nfault-tolerant schemes such as triple modular redundancy (TMR), NAND\nmultiplexing, and majority multiplexing in the context of practical realization\nof QCA XOR gate. Our investigations reveal that these techniques incur\nprohibitively large area and delay and hence, they are unsuitable for practical\nscenarios. We propose here realistic designs of QCA XOR gates (in terms of area\nand delay) with significantly high fault-tolerance against all types of cell\nmisplacement defects such as cell omission, cell displacement, cell\nmisalignment and extra/additional cell deposition. Furthermore, the absence of\nany crossing in the proposed designs facilitates low-cost fabrication of such\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 11:08:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-12"}

We address the question of how large a molecular object may\nbecome by growing deterministic aggregates from single conjugated polymer\nchains. Even particles containing dozens of individual chains still behave as\nsingle quantum emitters due to efficient excitation energy transfer, while the\nbrightness is raised due to the increased absorption cross-section of the\nsuprastructure. Excitation energy can delocalize between individual polymer\nchromophores in these aggregates by both coherent and incoherent coupling,\nwhich are differentiated by their distinct spectroscopic fingerprints. Coherent\ncoupling is identified by a ten-fold increase in excited-state lifetime and a\ncorresponding spectral red shift. Exciton quenching due to incoherent FRET\nbecomes more significant as aggregate size increases, resulting in\nsingle-aggregate emission characterized by strong blinking.

The recursive GF technique is a\nstandard tool to compute this quantity numerically, but it lacks physical\ntransparency and is limited to relatively small systems. Here we present a\nnumerically efficient and physically transparent GF formalism for a general\nlayered structure. In contrast to the recursive GF that directly calculates the\nGF through the Dyson equations, our approach converts the calculation of the GF\nto the generation and subsequent propagation of a scattering wave function\nemanating from a local excitation. This viewpoint not only allows us to\nreproduce existing results in a concise and physically intuitive manner, but\nalso provides analytical expressions of the GF in terms of a generalized\nscattering matrix. This identifies the contributions from each individual\nscattering channel to the GF and hence allows this information to be extracted\nquantitatively from dual-probe STM experiments. The simplicity and physical\ntransparency of the formalism further allows us to treat the multiple\nreflection analytically and derive an analytical rule to construct the GF of a\ngeneral layered system. This could significantly reduce the computational time\nand enable quantum transport calculations for large samples. We apply this\nformalism to perform both analytical analysis and numerical simulation for the\ntwo-dimensional conductance map of a realistic graphene p-n junction.

To address these issues, the Electronic\nFrontier Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, and the University of Michigan have\nset up Let's Encrypt (LE), a certificate authority that provides both free\nX.509 certificates and software that automates the deployment of these\ncertificates. In this paper, we investigate if LE has been successful in\ndemocratizing encryption: we analyze certificate issuance in the first year of\nLE and show from various perspectives that LE adoption has an upward trend and\nit is in fact being successful in covering the lower-cost end of the hosting\nmarket.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 13:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

In\nthis paper, we explore how microtask crowdsourcing might serve as a means of\nfault localization.

Through Mechanical Turk,\nwe collected the answers of hundreds of workers to a pre-determined set of\ntemplate questions applied to the code fragments, with a replication factor of\ntwenty answers per question.

We describe the design of our experiment, discuss the\nresults, and provide an extensive analysis of different filters and their\neffects in terms of speed, cost, and effectiveness.

We performed ideal MHD simulations\nthat include the heating and cooling of the multiphase ISM, and where we treat\ndynamically the formation of H2. In a post-processing step we compute the\nabundances of species at chemical equilibrium. We show that CH+ is efficiently\nformed at the edge of clumps, in regions where the H2 fraction is low, but\nnevertheless higher than its equilibrium value, and where the gas temperature\nis high. We show that warm and out of equilibrium H2 increases the integrated\ncolumn densities of CH+ by one order of magnitude, up to values still 3-10\ntimes lower than those observed in the diffuse ISM. We balance the Lorentz\nforce with the ion-neutral drag to estimate the ion-drift velocities (vd). We\nfind that the vd distribution peaks around 0.04 km s-1, and that high vd are\ntoo rare to have a significant statistical impact on the abundances of CH+.\nCompared to previous works, our multiphase simulations reduce the spread in vd,\nand our self-consistent treatment of the ionisation leads to much reduced vd.\nNevertheless, our resolution study shows that this velocity distribution is not\nconverged: the ion-neutral drift has a higher impact on CH+ at higher\nresolution. On the other hand, our ideal MHD simulations do not include\nambipolar diffusion, which would yield lower drift velocities. Within these\nlimitations, we conclude that warm H2 is a key ingredient in the efficient\nformation of CH+ and that the ambipolar diffusion has very little influence on\nthe abundance of CH+, mainly due to the small drift velocities obtained.\nHowever, we point out that small-scale processes and other non-thermal\nprocesses not included in our MHD simulation may be of crucial importance, and\nhigher resolution studies with better controlled dissipation processes are\nneeded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 14:13:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 18:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

EG gives an estimate of the\nexcess gravity (described as an apparent dark matter density) in terms of the\nbaryonic mass distribution and the Hubble parameter. In this work we present\nthe first test of EG using weak gravitational lensing, within the regime of\nvalidity of the current model. Although there is no direct description of\nlensing and cosmology in EG yet, we can make a reasonable estimate of the\nexpected lensing signal of low redshift galaxies by assuming a background\nLambdaCDM cosmology. We measure the (apparent) average surface mass density\nprofiles of 33,613 isolated central galaxies, and compare them to those\npredicted by EG based on the galaxies' baryonic masses. To this end we employ\nthe ~180 square degrees overlap of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) with the\nspectroscopic Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We find that the\nprediction from EG, despite requiring no free parameters, is in good agreement\nwith the observed galaxy-galaxy lensing profiles in four different stellar mass\nbins.

For that we computed\nevolutionary models with the code STAREVOL for 15 < M/Msun < 100. We\nsubsequently calculated atmosphere models at specific points along the\nevolutionary tracks, using the code CMFGEN. Synthetic spectra obtained in this\nway were classified as if they were observational data. We tested our spectral\nclassification by comparison to observed spectra of various stars. We also\ncompared our results with empirical data of a large number of OB stars. We\nobtain spectroscopic sequences along evolutionary tracks. In our computations,\nthe earliest O stars (O2-3.5) appear only above ~50 Msun. For later spectral\ntypes, a similar mass limit exists, but is lower. A luminosity class V does not\ncorrespond to the entire main sequence. This only holds for the 15 Msun track.\nAs mass increases, a larger portion of the main sequence is spent in luminosity\nclass III. Above 50 Msun, supergiants appear before the end of core-hydrogen\nburning. Dwarf stars do not occur on the zero-age main sequence above 80 Msun.\nConsequently, the distribution of luminosity class V in the HR diagram cannot\nbe used to constrain the size of the convective core. The distribution of\ndwarfs and giants in the HR diagram agrees well with the location of stars\nanalyzed by means of quantitative spectroscopy. For supergiants, there is a\nslight discrepancy in the sense that luminosity class I is observed slightly\nearlier than our predictions. This is mainly due to wind densities that affect\nthe luminosity class diagnostic lines. We predict an upper mass limit for dwarf\nstars (~60 Msun) that is found consistent with the rarity of O2V stars in the\nGalaxy. Stars with WNh spectral type are not predicted by our models. Stronger\nwinds are required to produce the characteristic emission lines of these\nobjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 14:55:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

While the early literature has shown\nthem to be powerful in capturing many network features of interest, recent work\nhighlights difficulties related to the models' ill behavior, such as most of\nthe probability mass being concentrated on a very small subset of the parameter\nspace. This behavior limits both the applicability of an ERGM as a model for\nreal data and inference and parameter estimation via the usual Markov chain\nMonte Carlo algorithms.\n  To address this problem, we propose a new exponential family of models for\nrandom graphs that build on the standard ERGM framework. Specifically, we solve\nthe problem of computational intractability and `degenerate' model behavior by\nan interpretable support restriction. We introduce a new parameter based on the\ngraph-theoretic notion of degeneracy, a measure of sparsity whose value is\ncommonly low in real-worlds networks. The new model family is supported on the\nsample space of graphs with bounded degeneracy and is called\ndegeneracy-restricted ERGMs, or DERGMs for short. Since DERGMs generalize ERGMs\n-- the latter is obtained from the former by setting the degeneracy parameter\nto be maximal -- they inherit good theoretical properties, while at the same\ntime place their mass more uniformly over realistic graphs.\n  The support restriction allows the use of new (and fast) Monte Carlo methods\nfor inference, thus making the models scalable and computationally tractable.\nWe study various theoretical properties of DERGMs and illustrate how the\nsupport restriction improves the model behavior.

We show that a large coupling to a\nhigh quality factor cavity can simultaneously reduce the effect of both\nphonon-induced sources of decoherence. It first limits the effect of pure\ndephasing on the zero phonon line with indistinguishabilities above $97\\%$ up\nto $18$ K. Moreover, it efficiently redirects the phonon sidebands into the\nzero-phonon line and brings the indistinguishability of the full emission\nspectrum from $87\\%$ (resp. $24\\%$) without cavity effect to more than $99\\%$\n(resp. $76\\%$) at $0$ K (resp. $20$ K). We provide guidelines for optimal\ncavity designs that further minimize the phonon-induced decoherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 15:45:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 06:52:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

When relating\nthe black-hole electric charges to the baryon-chemical potentials it was found\nthat the phenomenologically-deduced parameters from various particle ratios in\nthe statistical thermal models agree well with the ones determined from the\nthermal radiation from charged black-hole. Accordingly, the resulting freezeout\nconditions, such as $s/T^3=7$ and $<E>/<N>=1~$GeV, are confirmed at finite\nchemical potentials, as well. Furthermore, the problematic of strangeness\nproduction in elementary collisions can be interpreted by thermal particle\nproduction from the Hawking-Unruh radiation. Consequently, the freezeout\ntemperature depends on the quark masses. This leads to a deviation from full\nequilibrium and thus a suppression of the strangeness production in the\nelementary collisions. But in nucleus-nucleus collisions, an average\ntemperature should be introduced in order to dilute the quark masses. This\nnearly removes the strangeness suppression. An extension to finite chemical\npotentials is introduced. The particle ratios of kaon-to-pion, phi-to-kaon and\nantilambda-to-pion are determined from Hawking-Unruh radiation and compared\nwith the thermal calculations and the measurements in different experiments. We\nconclude that these particle ratios can be reproduced, at least qualitatively,\nas Hawking-Unruh radiation at finite chemical potential. With increasing\nenergy, both K+/pi+ and phi/K^- keep their maximum values at low SPS energies.\nBut the further energy decrease rapidly reduces both ratios. For Lambda/pi-,\nthere is an increase with increasing collision energy, i.e. no saturation is to\nbe observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 20:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-17"}

For regression and cluster\nanalyses of continuous data, MoE usually use normal experts following the\nGaussian distribution. However, for a set of data containing a group or groups\nof observations with heavy tails or atypical observations, the use of normal\nexperts is unsuitable and can unduly affect the fit of the MoE model. We\nintroduce a robust MoE modeling using the $t$ distribution. The proposed $t$\nMoE (TMoE) deals with these issues regarding heavy-tailed and noisy data. We\ndevelop a dedicated expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the\nparameters of the proposed model by monotonically maximizing the observed data\nlog-likelihood. We describe how the presented model can be used in prediction\nand in model-based clustering of regression data. The proposed model is\nvalidated on numerical experiments carried out on simulated data, which show\nthe effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed model in terms of modeling\nnon-linear regression functions as well as in model-based clustering. Then, it\nis applied to the real-world data of tone perception for musical data analysis,\nand the one of temperature anomalies for the analysis of climate change data.\nThe obtained results show the usefulness of the TMoE model for practical\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 14:42:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-26"}
