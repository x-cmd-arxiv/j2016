However, training such\nmetrics requires large amount of labeled stereo images, which can be difficult\nor costly to collect for certain applications. The main contribution of our\nwork is a new semi-supervised method for learning deep metrics from unlabeled\nstereo images, given coarse information about the scenes and the optical\nsystem. Our method alternatively optimizes the metric with a standard\nstochastic gradient descent, and applies stereo constraints to regularize its\nprediction. Experiments on reference data-sets show that, for a given network\narchitecture, training with this new method without ground-truth produces a\nmetric with performance as good as state-of-the-art baselines trained with the\nsaid ground-truth. This work has three practical implications. Firstly, it\nhelps to overcome limitations of training sets, in particular noisy ground\ntruth. Secondly it allows to use much more training data during learning.\nThirdly, it allows to tune deep metric for a particular stereo system, even if\nground truth is not available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2016 16:09:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-06"}

How does the\npresence or absence of such features interplay with the network link structure?\nAlthough the situation here described is truly ubiquitous, there is a limited\nbody of research dealing with large graphs of this kind. Many previous works\nconsidered homophily as the only possible transmission mechanism translating\nnode features into links. Other authors, instead, developed more sophisticated\nmodels, that are able to handle complex feature interactions, but are unfit to\nscale to very large networks. We expand on the MGJ model, where interactions\nbetween pairs of features can foster or discourage link formation. In this\nwork, we will investigate how to estimate the latent feature-feature\ninteractions in this model. We shall propose two solutions: the first one\nassumes feature independence and it is essentially based on Naive Bayes; the\nsecond one, which relaxes the independence assumption assumption, is based on\nperceptrons. In fact, we show it is possible to cast the model equation in\norder to see it as the prediction rule of a perceptron. We analyze how\nclassical results for the perceptrons can be interpreted in this context; then,\nwe define a fast and simple perceptron-like algorithm for this task, which can\nprocess $10^8$ links in minutes. We then compare these two techniques, first\nwith synthetic datasets that follows our model, gaining evidence that the Naive\nindependence assumptions are detrimental in practice. Secondly, we consider a\nreal, large-scale citation network where each node (i.e., paper) can be\ndescribed by different types of characteristics; there, our algorithm can\nassess how well each set of features can explain the links, and thus finding\nmeaningful latent feature-feature interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2016 16:42:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Oct 2017 18:18:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-10"}

In real societies, it is expected that these two\nprocesses depend on and affect each other. However, little is known about the\neffects of opinion dynamics over disease dynamics and vice versa, since most\nstudies treat them separately. In this work we study the dynamics of the voter\nmodel for opinion formation intertwined with that of the contact process for\ndisease spreading, in a population of agents that interact via two types of\nconnections, social and contact. These two interacting dynamics take place on\ntwo layers of networks, coupled through a fraction $q$ of links present in both\nnetworks. The probability that an agent updates its state depends on both, the\nopinion and disease states of the interacting partner. We find that the opinion\ndynamics has striking consequences on the properties of disease spreading. The\nmost important is that the smooth (continuous) transition from a healthy to an\nendemic phase observed in the contact process, becomes abrupt (discontinuous)\nin the two-layer system. Therefore, disregarding the effects of social dynamics\non epidemics propagation may lead to a misestimation of the real magnitude of\nthe spreading. Also, an endemic-healthy discontinuous transition is found when\nthe coupling $q$ overcomes a threshold value. Furthermore, we show that the\ndisease dynamics delays the opinion consensus, leading to a consensus time that\nvaries non-monotonically with $q$ in a large range of the model's parameters. A\nmean-field approach reveals that the coupled dynamics of opinions and disease\ncan be approximately described by the dynamics of the voter model decoupled\nfrom that of the contact process, with effective probabilities of opinion and\ndisease transmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2016 18:39:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 17:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

Many presented\nstate-of-the-art denoising methods are based on the self-similarity or\npatch-based image processing. Specifically, Non-Local Means (NLM) as a\npatch-based filter has gained increasing attention in recent years.\nEssentially, this filter tends to obtain the noise-less signal value by\ncomputing the Gaussian-weighted Euclidean distance between the patch\nunder-processing and other patches inside the image. However, the NLM filter is\nsensitive to the outliers (pixels that their intensity values are far away from\nother pixels) inside the patch, meaning that the pixels with the symmetric\nlocations in the patch are assigned the same weight. This can lead to\nsub-optimal denoising performance when the destructive nature of noise\ngenerates some outliers inside patches. In this paper, we propose a new\nweighting approach to modify the Gaussian kernel of the NLM filter. Our\napproach employs the geometric distance between image intensities to come up\nwith new weights for each pixel of a patch, lowering the impact of outliers on\nthe denoising performance.

The quest for optimal approximation\nof this class has among others led to the development of curvelets,\ncontourlets, and shearlets. Due to parabolic scaling, these systems are able to\nprovide a quasi-optimal $N$-term approximation rate of order $N^{-2}$.\nReplacing parabolic scaling by $\\alpha$-scaling, one obtains $\\alpha$-curvelets\nand $\\alpha$-shearlets, which interpolate between wavelet-type systems\n($\\alpha=1$), parabolically scaled systems ($\\alpha=\\frac12$), and\nridgelet-type systems ($\\alpha=0$). Previous research shows that in the range\n$\\alpha\\in[\\frac{1}{2},1)$ they provide quasi-optimal approximation for\ncartoons of regularity $C^{1/\\alpha}$ with a rate of order $N^{-1/\\alpha}$.\n  In this work we continue to explore $\\alpha$-scaled representation systems,\nwith the aim to better understand the role of the parameter $\\alpha$ for\napproximation. Concerning $\\alpha$-curvelets with $\\alpha<1$, we prove that the\nbest possible $N$-term approximation rate achievable for cartoons with curved\nedges is limited to at most $N^{-1/(1-\\alpha)}$, independent of the smoothness\nof the cartoons. The maximal rate achievable by simple thresholding of the\nframe coefficients is even bounded by $N^{-1/\\max\\{\\alpha,1-\\alpha\\}}$.

A well known strategy due to Kleinberg-Tardos and Holenstein, with a\nclose variant (for a similar problem) due to Broder, solves this task with\ndisagreement probability at most $2 \\delta/(1+\\delta)$, where $\\delta$ is the\ntotal variation distance between $P$ and $Q$.

Here, we show that noise\ncorrelation time, by considering a genetic circuit of autoactivation, can have\nsignificant effect on the regime shift in gene expression.

We find that\nincrease in noise correlation time in degradation rate can induce a regime\nshift from low to high protein concentration state and enhance the bistable\nregime, while increase in noise correlation time in basal rate retain the\nbimodal distribution. We then show how cross-correlated colored noises in basal\nand degradation rates can induce regime shifts from low to high protein\nconcentration state, but reduce the bistable regime.

The present study is designed to determine the\neffect of turbulence-driven secondary motion on the particle dynamics.

It is found that\nthe eddy diffusivity is enhanced at depth, reaching a maximum at the \"critical\nlayer\" near 1000m. The estimate of diffusivity is used with a simple diffusive\nparameterization to estimate the meridional eddy volume flux.

The\nflexibility it offers for customers as well as for providers has become a\ncrucial factor for large parts of the computer industry.

The controlling software component, called hypervisor, provides a\nvirtualized view of the computer resources and ensures separation of different\nguest virtual machines.

The polydispersity is represented by the Schulz-Zimm chain-length\ndistribution. We specifically focus on three different polydispersities\nrepresenting sharp, moderate and extremely wide chain length distributions and\nderive explicit analytical expressions for the chain end distributions in these\nbrushes. The results are in very good agreement with numerical data obtained\nwith self-consistent field calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. With\nincreasing polydispersity, the brush density profile changes from convex to\nconcave, and for given average chain length $N_n$ and grafting density\n$\\sigma$, the brush height $H$ is found to scale as\n$(H/H_{\\mathrm{mono}}-1)\\propto(N_w/N_n-1)^{1/2}$ over a wide range of\npolydispersity indices $N_w/N_n$ (here $H_{\\mathrm{mono}}$ is the height of the\ncorresponding monodisperse brush. Chain end fluctuations are found to be\nstrongly suppressed already at very small polydispersity. Based on this\nobservation, we introduce the concept of the brush as a near-critical system\nwith two parameters (scaling variables), $(N_{n}\\sigma^{2/3})^{-1}$ and\n$(N_w/N_n-1)^{1/2}$, controlling the distance from the critical point.

We study the evolution of\nthis pattern as a function of bond percolation disorder (removal or dilution of\nlattice bonds). With increasing concentration of the bonds removed, the\nbutterfly pattern gets smoothly decimated. However, in this process of\ndecimation, bands develop interesting characteristics and features. For\nexample, in the high disorder limit, some butterfly-like pattern still persists\neven as most of the states are localized. We also analyze, in the low disorder\nlimit, the effect of percolation on wavefunctions (using inverse participation\nratios) and on band gaps in the spectrum. We explain and provide the reasons\nbehind many of the key features in our results by analyzing small clusters and\nfinite size rings.

Traditional organic\nsolvents easily reach the atmosphere as they have high vapor pressure and are\nlinked to a host of negative environmental effects including climate change,\nurban air-quality and human illness.

However,\ntheir life cycle environmental impacts as well as freshwater ecotoxicity\nimplications are poorly understood.

Ionic\nliquids consist of a large organic cation and charge-delocalized inorganic or\norganic anion of smaller size and asymmetric shape. The organic cation can\nundergo unlimited structural variations through modification of the alkyl\ngroups attached to the side chain of the base cation skeleton and most of these\nstructural variations are feasible, from chemical synthesis point of view, due\nto the easy nature of preparation of their components.

Due to their tunable nature, these molten salts have the\npotential to be used as solvents for variety of applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2016 04:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-01"}

The proposed model is based on the $M/g/c/c$ state\ndependent queuing model of Jain and Smith, and is inspired from the\ndeterministic Godunov scheme for the road traffic simulation. We first propose\na reformulation of the $M/g/c/c$ state dependent model that works with\ndensity-flow fundamental diagrams rather than density-speed relationships. We\nthen extend this model in order to consider upstream traffic demand as well as\ndownstream traffic supply. Finally, we calculate the speed and travel time\ndistributions for the $M/g/c/c$ state dependent queuing model and for the\nproposed model, and derive stationary performance measures (expected number of\ncars, blocking probability, expected travel time, and throughput). A comparison\nwith results predicted by the $M/g/c/c$ state dependent queuing model shows\nthat the proposed model correctly represents the dynamics of traffic and gives\ngood performances measures. The results illustrate the good accuracy of the\nproposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2016 00:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-02"}
