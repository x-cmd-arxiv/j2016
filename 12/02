Objective: This research aimed at comparing\nquantitatively these three safety analysis techniques with regard to their\neffectiveness, applicability, understandability, ease of use and efficiency in\nidentifying software safety requirements at the system level. Method: We\nconducted a controlled experiment with 21 master and bachelor students applying\nthese three techniques to three safety-critical systems: train door control,\nanti-lock braking and traffic collision and avoidance.

As the light-matter coupling is increased into the\ndeep strong coupling regime, the ground state turns from vacuum to become a\nsuperradiant state characterized by both atomic and photonic excitations. It is\npointed out that all four transitions are of the mean-field type, that quantum\nfluctuations are negligible, and hence these fluctuations cannot be responsible\nfor the corresponding vacuum instability. In this respect, these are not\nquantum phase transitions. In the case of the Tavis-Cummings and\nJaynes-Cummings models, the continuous symmetry of these models implies that\nquantum fluctuations are not only negligible, but strictly zero. However, all\nmodels possess a non-analyticity in the ground state in agreement with a\ncontinuous quantum phase transition. As such, it is a matter of taste whether\nthe transitions should be termed quantum or not. In addition, we also consider\nthe modifications of the transitions when photon losses are present.

Here we report on our continued development\nof Markov Chain Monte Carlo retrieval methods for addressing these issues in\nthe interpretation of such data. Specifically we explore how the unknown planet\nradius and potentially poorly known observer-planet-star phase angle impacts\nretrievals of parameters of interest such as atmospheric methane abundance,\ncloud properties and surface gravity. As expected, the uncertainty in retrieved\nvalues is a strong function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the observed\nspectra, particularly for low metallicity atmospheres, which lack deep\nabsorption signatures. Meaningful results may only be possible above certain\nSNR thresholds; for cases across a metallicity range of 1-50 times solar, we\nfind that only an SNR of 20 systematically reproduces close to the correct\nmethane abundance at all phase angles. However, even in cases where the phase\nangle is poorly known we find that the planet radius can be constrained to\nwithin a factor of two. We find that uncertainty in planet radius decreases at\nphase angles past quadrature, as the highly forward scattering nature of the\natmosphere at these geometries limits the possible volume of phase space that\nrelevant parameters can occupy.

The original\nminimal path model computes the globally minimal geodesic by solving an Eikonal\npartial differential equation (PDE). Essentially, this first-order model is\nunable to penalize curvature which is related to the path rigidity property in\nthe classical active contour models. To solve this problem, we present an\nEikonal PDE-based Finsler elastica minimal path approach to address the\ncurvature-penalized geodesic energy minimization problem. We were successful at\nadding the curvature penalization to the classical geodesic energy. The basic\nidea of this work is to interpret the Euler elastica bending energy via a novel\nFinsler elastica metric that embeds a curvature penalty. This metric is\nnon-Riemannian, anisotropic and asymmetric, and is defined over an\norientation-lifted space by adding to the image domain the orientation as an\nextra space dimension. Based on this orientation lifting, the proposed minimal\npath model can benefit from both the curvature and orientation of the paths.\nThanks to the fast marching method, the global minimum of the\ncurvature-penalized geodesic energy can be computed efficiently. We introduce\ntwo anisotropic image data-driven speed functions that are computed by\nsteerable filters. Based on these orientation-dependent speed functions, we can\napply the proposed Finsler elastica minimal path model to the applications of\nclosed contour detection, perceptual grouping and tubular structure extraction.\nNumerical experiments on both synthetic and real images show that these\napplications of the proposed model indeed obtain promising results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 16:45:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 May 2017 16:57:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 May 2018 11:44:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

The propagation of light in single-mode fibers\nis governed by the one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLS) in\nthe presence of attenuation, dispersion, and non linear effects. In this NLS\nthe role of space and time is exchanged with respect to the standard NLS as\nintroduced in the almost entire mathematical literature. Such an exchange is\nfar from being only formal as it enters in the interpretation of basic ideas as\nwell-posedness and stability, as well as in the phenomenological meaning of the\npredictions formulated by such model. In this dissertation, the physical bases\nof the optical fibers are provided, and a derivation of the NLS from the\nMaxwell's equations is reviewed. Furthermore, problems of local nature (local\nexistence of solutions, uniqueness) and problems of global nature (global\nexistence) are studied by the Kato's method based on a fixed point argument and\nStrichartz's estimates. Moreover, tools usually employed to study global\nproblems connected with finite-time blow up of solutions, are here used to show\na closeness result between the NLS for optical fibers and an integrable NLS.\nIntegrability is pursued by means of the Painlev\\'e analysis that allows to\ndescribe quite a large class of integrable equations like the transformed\nequation from the standard NLS. Among these functions, one can be described as\na standard NLS with an additional linear harmonic oscillator term. This\nequation is showed to be close in $L^2$-norm to the NLS for single-mode fibers.\nFinally, the dissertation focuses on two kinds of stationary solutions: the\nso-called time-homogenous, that is given by a stationary wave oscillating in\nspace, and the soliton-like solution.

When such excitations are present,\nthe system retains memory of initial correlations up to infinite times, thus\nevading decoherence. We demonstrate this connection in the context of the\nLuttinger model, the simplest quantum hydrodynamic model, and in the quantum\nKdV equation. In the standard Luttinger model, memory of all initial\ncorrelations is preserved throughout the time evolution up to infinitely large\ntimes, as a result of the purely ballistic dynamics. However nonlinear\ndispersion or interactions, when separately present, lead to spreading and\ndelocalisation that suppress the above effect by eliminating the memory of\nnon-Gaussian correlations. We show that, for any initial state that satisfies\nsufficient clustering of correlations, the steady state is Gaussian in terms of\nthe bosonised or fermionised fields in the dispersive or interacting case\nrespectively. On the other hand, when dispersion and interaction are\nsimultaneously present, a semiclassical approximation suggests that\nlocalisation is restored as the two effects compensate each other and solitary\nwaves are formed.

The one-loop KLT formula expresses\ngravity integrands in terms of more basic gauge invariant building blocks for\ngauge-theory amplitudes, dubbed partial integrands. The latter obey a one-loop\nanalogue of the BCJ relations, and both KLT and BCJ relations are universal to\nbosons and fermions in any number of spacetime dimensions and independent on\nthe amount of supersymmetry.

The robot might continuously learn as it explores the\nworld around it, even while deployed.

Bi-infinite trajectories form measure-preserving dynamical\nsystems, have a common asymptotic direction in $2d$, and possess other nice\nproperties. We use our theory to classify the behavior of compatible families\nof semi-infinite geodesics in stationary first- and last-passage percolation.\nWe also partially answer a question raised by C. Hoffman about the limiting\nempirical measure of weights seen by geodesics. We construct several examples:\nour main example is a standard first-passage percolation model where geodesics\ncoalesce almost surely, but have no asymptotic direction or average weight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 20:52:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 May 2018 15:14:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Dec 2018 19:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

The technique presented here leads to a general\nframework for studying families of objects on networks; each such family has a\ncorresponding dual family whose $p$-modulus is essentially the reciprocal of\nthe original family's. As an application, we give a modulus-based proof for the\nfact that effective resistance is a metric on graphs. This proof immediately\ngeneralizes to yield a family of graph metrics, depending on the parameter $p$,\nthat continuously interpolates among the shortest-path metric, the effective\nresistance metric, and the mincut ultrametric. In a second application, we\nestablish a connection between Fulkerson's blocking duality and the\nprobabilistic interpretation of modulus. This connection, in turn, provides a\nstraightforward proof of several monotonicity properties of modulus that\ngeneralize known monotonicity properties of effective resistance.

We show that both\ntransients have properties consistent with the class of calcium-rich gap\ntransients, specifically lower peak luminosities and rapid evolution compared\nto ordinary supernovae, and a nebular spectrum dominated by [Ca II] emission. A\nstriking feature of both transients is their host environments: PTF12bho is an\nintra-cluster transient in the Coma Cluster, while PTF11kmb is located in a\nloose galaxy group, at a physical offset ~150 kpc from the most likely host\ngalaxy. Deep Subaru imaging of PTF12bho rules out an underlying host system to\na limit of $M_R > -8.0$ mag, while Hubble Space Telescope imaging of PTF11kmb\nreveals a marginal counterpart that, if real, could be either a background\ngalaxy or a globular cluster. We show that the offset distribution of Ca-rich\ngap transients is significantly more extreme than that seen for Type Ia\nsupernovae or even short-hard gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). Thus, if the offsets\nare caused by a kick, they require larger kick velocities and/or longer merger\ntimes than sGRBs. We also show that almost all Ca-rich gap transients found to\ndate are in group and cluster environments with elliptical host galaxies,\nindicating a very old progenitor population; the remote locations could\npartially be explained by these environments having the largest fraction of\nstars in the intra-group/intra-cluster light following galaxy-galaxy\ninteractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 21:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2017 19:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-16"}

Previous studies have shown that light neutralino\nDM in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), with parameters defined\nat the electroweak scale, is still viable when the low energy spectrum of the\nmodel features light sleptons, in which case, the relic density constraint can\nbe fulfilled.

We have analysed the optimal choices of non-universalities\nin the soft supersymmetry-breaking parameters for both, gauginos and scalars,\nin order to avoid the stringent experimental constraints. We show that light\nneutralinos, with a mass as low as 25 GeV, are viable in supergravity scenarios\nif the gaugino mass parameters at high energy are very non universal, while the\nscalar masses can remain of the same order. These scenarios typically predict a\nvery small cross section of neutralinos off protons and neutrons, thereby being\nvery challenging for direct detection experiments. However, a potential\ndetection of smuons and selectrons at the LHC, together with a hypothetical\ndiscovery of a gamma-ray signal from neutralino annihilations in dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies could shed light on this kind of solutions. Finally, we\nhave investigated the naturalness of these scenarios, taking into account all\nthe potential sources of tuning.

In particular one phase transition we know of, the Electroweak Phase\nTransition (EWPT), could potentially be first order in BSM scenarios and\ntestable in the near future. If confirmed this could provide a mechanism for\nBaryogenesis, which is one of the most important outstanding questions in\nphysics. To reliably make predictions it is necessary to have full control of\nthe finite temperature scalar potentials. However, as we show the standard\nmethods used in BSM physics to improve phase transition calculations, resumming\nhard thermal loops, introduces significant errors into the scalar potential. In\naddition, the standard methods make it impossible to match theories to an EFT\ndescription reliably. In this paper we define a thermal resummation procedure\nbased on Partial Dressing (PD) for general BSM calculations of phase\ntransitions beyond the high-temperature approximation. Additionally, we\nintroduce the modified Optimized Partial Dressing (OPD) procedure, which is\nnumerically nearly as efficient as old incorrect methods, while yielding\nidentical results to the full PD calculation. This can be easily applied to\nfuture BSM studies of phase transitions in the early universe. As an example,\nwe show that in unmixed singlet scalar extensions of the SM, the (O)PD\ncalculations make new phenomenological predictions compared to previous\nanalyses.

This Chapter\ndescribes a mechanism that allows star-forming disc galaxies to extract gas\nfrom their coronae. Stellar feedback powers a continuous circulation (galactic\nfountain) of gas from the disc into the halo, producing mixing between\nmetal-rich disc material and metal-poor coronal gas. This mixing causes a\ndramatic reduction of the cooling time of the corona making it condense and\naccrete onto the disc. This fountain- driven accretion model makes clear\npredictions for the kinematics of the extraplanar cold/warm gas in disc\ngalaxies, which are in good agreement with a number of independent\nobservations. The amount of gas accretion predicted by the model is of the\norder of what is needed to sustain star formation. Accretion is expected to\noccur preferentially in the outer parts of discs and its efficiency drops for\nhigher coronal temperatures. Thus galaxies are able to gather new gas as long\nas they do not become too massive nor fall into large halos and maintain their\nstar-forming gaseous discs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 21:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

An\nalternate approach is to use a swarm of simple robots that work together,\nrather than a single highly capable robot. The central-place foraging algorithm\n(CPFA) is effective for coordinating robot swarm search and collection tasks.\nRobots start at a centrally placed location (nest), explore potential targets\nin the area without global localization or central control, and return the\ntargets to the nest. The scalability of the CPFA is limited because large\nnumbers of robots produce more inter-robot collisions and large search areas\nresult in substantial travel costs. We address these problems with the\nmultiple-place foraging algorithm (MPFA), which uses multiple nests distributed\nthroughout the search area. Robots start from a randomly assigned home nest but\nreturn to the closest nest with found targets. We simulate the foraging\nbehavior of robot swarms in the robot simulator ARGoS and employ a genetic\nalgorithm to discover different optimized foraging strategies as swarm sizes\nand the number of targets are scaled up. In our experiments, the MPFA always\nproduces higher foraging rates, fewer collisions, and lower travel and search\ntime compared to the CPFA for the partially clustered targets distribution. The\nmain contribution of this paper is that we systematically quantify the\nadvantages of the MPFA (reduced travel time and collisions), the potential\ndisadvantages (less communication among robots), and the ability of a genetic\nalgorithm to tune MPFA parameters to mitigate search inefficiency due to less\ncommunication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 21:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-05"}

In addition the nodes far from the entry node of the channel may be\nmore attractive for migrants in comparison to the nodes around the entry node\nof the channel.

In fact the solution is locally discretely self-similar with\nrespect to parabolic rescaling of spacetime. This demonstrates that one cannot\nhope to establish a global regularity result for the scalar defocusing NLS\nunless one uses some special property of that equation that is not shared by\nthese defocusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger systems.\n  As in a previous paper of the author considering the analogous problem for\nthe nonlinear wave equation, the basic strategy is to first select the mass,\nmomentum, and energy densities of $u$, then $u$ itself, and then finally design\nthe potential $F$ in order to solve the required equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2016 00:41:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-16"}

However, the direction of the evolution\nof high-performance processors in the last two decades have caused serious\ndegradation of the computational efficiency of iterative methods on irregular\ngrids, because of relatively low memory bandwidth. Data compression can in\nprinciple reduce the necessary memory memory bandwidth of iterative methods and\nthus improve the efficiency. We have implemented several data compression\nalgorithms on the PEZY-SC processor, using the matrix generated for the HPCG\nbenchmark as an example. For the SpMV (Sparse Matrix-Vector multiplication)\npart of the HPCG benchmark, the best implementation without data compression\nachieved 11.6Gflops/chip, close to the theoretical limit due to the memory\nbandwidth. Our implementation with data compression has achieved 32.4Gflops.\nThis is of course rather extreme case, since the grid used in HPCG is\ngeometrically regular and thus its compression efficiency is very high.\nHowever, in real applications, it is in many cases possible to make a large\npart of the grid to have regular geometry, in particular when the resolution is\nhigh. Note that we do not need to change the structure of the program, except\nfor the addition of the data compression/decompression subroutines. Thus, we\nbelieve the data compression will be very useful way to improve the performance\nof many applications which rely on the use of irregular grids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2016 01:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-05"}

We consider a social network (the host) that sells\nad-engagements to advertisers by inserting their ads, in the form of promoted\nposts, into the feeds of carefully selected \"initial endorsers\" or seed users:\nthese users receive monetary incentives in exchange for their endorsements. The\nendorsements help propagate the ads to the feeds of their followers. In this\ncontext, the problem for the host is is to allocate ads to influential users,\ntaking into account the propensity of ads for viral propagation, and carefully\napportioning the monetary budget of each of the advertisers between incentives\nto influential users and ad-engagement costs, with the rational goal of\nmaximizing its own revenue. We consider a monetary incentive for the\ninfluential users, which is proportional to their influence potential. We show\nthat revenue maximization in incentivized social advertising corresponds to the\nproblem of monotone submodular function maximization, subject to a partition\nmatroid constraint on the ads-to-seeds allocation, and submodular knapsack\nconstraints on the advertisers' budgets. This problem is NP-hard and we devise\n2 greedy algorithms with provable approximation guarantees, which differ in\ntheir sensitivity to seed user incentive costs.

This allows for a purely\nfirst class formulation that generalizes the usual relativistic description of\nspinless particles and provides several insights into the nature of spin and\nits relationship with spacetime and locality. In particular, we find that the\nspin motion acts as a Lorentz contraction on the four-velocity and that, in\naddition to proper time, spinning particles posses a second gauge invariant\nobservable which we call proper angle. Heuristically, this proper angle\nrepresents the amount of Zitterbewegung necessary for a spin transition to\noccur.

We find that the chiral chemical potential\ngenerates the parity breaking term in the electromagnetic form factor of\ncharged pions. Heavy ion collision experiments could observe the\nphenomenological consequence of this parity-odd form factor through the elastic\nscattering of a pion and a photon in the medium. Then we quantify the asymmetry\nrate of the parity violation by measuring the polarization of the photon\nassociated with the pion, and discuss how it could be measured in a definite\nlab frame. We roughly estimate the typical size of the asymmetry, just by\npicking up the pion resonant process, and find that the signal can be\nsufficiently larger than possible background events from parity-breaking\nelectroweak process.

The\nframework enables the experimenter to specify generative (encoding) models of\nfMRI timeseries, in which experimental manipulations enter a pRF model of\nneural activity, which in turns drives a nonlinear model of neurovascular\ncoupling and Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) response. The neuronal\nand haemodynamic parameters are estimated together on a voxel-by-voxel or\nregion-of-interest basis using a Bayesian estimation algorithm (variational\nLaplace). This offers several novel contributions to receptive field modelling.\nThe variance / covariance of parameters are estimated, enabling receptive\nfields to be plotted while properly representing uncertainty about pRF size and\nlocation. Variability in the haemodynamic response across the brain is\naccounted for. Furthermore, the framework introduces formal hypothesis testing\nto pRF analysis, enabling competing models to be evaluated based on their model\nevidence (approximated by the variational free energy), which represents the\noptimal tradeoff between accuracy and complexity. Using simulations and\nempirical data, we found that parameters typically used to represent pRF size\nand neuronal scaling are strongly correlated, which should be taken into\naccount when making inferences.

Dynamic SOS (DSOS) is built on top of the\nModular SOS of P. Mosses, with an underlying category theory formalization. The\nidea of Dynamic SOS is to bring out the essential differences between dynamic\nupgrade constructs and program execution constructs. The important feature of\nModular SOS (MSOS) that we exploit in DSOS is the sharp separation of the\nprogram execution code from the additional (data) structures needed at\nrun-time. In DSOS we aim to achieve the same modularity and decoupling for\ndynamic software upgrades. This is partly motivated by the long term goal of\nhaving machine-checkable proofs for general results like type safety.\n  We exemplify Dynamic SOS on two languages supporting dynamic software\nupgrades, namely the C-like Proteus, which supports updating of variables,\nfunctions, records, or types at specific program points, and Creol, which\nsupports dynamic class upgrades in the setting of concurrent objects. Existing\ntype analyses for software upgrades can be done on top of DSOS too, as we\nillustrate for Proteus.\n  As a side result we define of a general encapsulating construction on Modular\nSOS useful in situations where a form of encapsulation of the execution is\nneeded. We use encapsulation in the Creol setting of concurrent object-oriented\nprogramming with active objects and asynchronous method calls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2016 12:56:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2018 18:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-24"}

This mechanism gives voters the opportunity to verify whether the vote\nthey cast is stored in the central system correctly. However, the verification\nphase ends by displaying the cast vote in plain form on the verification\ndevice. In other words, the device on which the verification is done learns the\nvoter's choice. In this work, our aim is to investigate this verification phase\nin detail and to point out that leaking the voter's choice to the verification\napplication may harm the voter privacy. Additionally, when applied in a wide\nrange, this would even compromise the fairness and the overall secrecy of the\nelections. In this respect, we propose an alternative verification mechanism\nfor the Estonian i-voting system to overcome this vulnerability.

More concretely,\nit brings only $m$ additional symmetric key decryptions to the verification\ndevice, where $m$ denoting the number of candidates.

We studied the globule IRAS 20319+3958 in Cygnus X by means of\nvisible and near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy, complemented with\nmid-infrared Spitzer/IRAC imaging, in order to obtain a census of its stellar\ncontent and the nature of its embedded sources. Our observations show that the\nglobule contains an embedded aggregate of about 30 very young ($\\lesssim\n1$~Myr) stellar objects, for which we estimate a total mass of ~ 90 M_sun. The\nmost massive members are three systems containing early B-type stars. Two of\nthem most likely produced very compact HII regions, one of them being still\nhighly embedded and coinciding with a peak seen in emission lines\ncharacterising the photon dominated region (PDR). Two of these three systems\nare resolved binaries, and one of those contains a visible Herbig Be star. An\napproximate derivation of the mass function of the members of the aggregate\ngives hints of a slope at high masses shallower than the classical Salpeter\nslope, and a peak of the mass distribution at a mass higher than that at which\nthe widely adopted log-normal initial mass function peaks. The emission\ndistribution of H$_2$ and Br gamma, tracing the PDR and the ionised gas phase,\nrespectively, suggests that molecular gas is distributed as a shell around the\nembedded aggregate, filled with centrally-condensed ionised gas. Both, the\nmorphology and the low excitation of the HII region, indicate that the sources\nof ionisation are the B stars of the embedded aggregate, rather than the\nexternal UV field caused by the O stars of Cygnus OB2. The youth of the\nembedded cluster, combined with the isolation of the globule, suggests that\nstar formation in the globule was triggered by the passage of the ionisation\nfront.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2016 14:08:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

The parameter $\\gamma$ in turn has been constrained by\ncomparing the arrival times of photons originating in distant transient events,\nsuch as gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts as well as giant pulses of pulsars.\nThose measurements normally correspond to an individual burst event with very\nlimited energy bands and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). In this letter, the\ndiscrepancy in the pulse arrival times of the Crab Pulsar between different\nenergy bands is obtained by the phase difference between corresponding pulse\nprofiles. This allows us to compare the pulse arrival times at the largest\nenergy band differences, between radio and optical, radio and X-ray, radio and\ngamma-ray respectively. As the pulse profiles are generated by phase-folding\nthousands of individual pulses, the time discrepancies between two energy bands\nare actually measured from thousands of events at each energy band, which\ncorresponds to much higher S/N.

Our analysis of perihelion\nadvancement of a planet shows that only Case I yields a viable theory. In this\ncase the metric outside a star of mass $M_*$ can be modeled by that of a\npoint-like global monopole whose mass is $M_*$ and a deficit angle $\\Delta =\n\\sqrt{(2GH_0M_*)/(3c^3)}$, where $H_0$ is the Hubble rate and $G$ the Newton\nconstant. This deficit angle can be used to test the theory since light\nexhibits additional bending around stars given by, $\\alpha_D\\approx\n-\\pi\\Delta/2$. This angle is independent on the distance from the star and it\naffects equally light and massive particles. The effect is too small to be\nmeasurable today, but should be within reach of the next generation of high\nresolution telescopes. Finally we note that the advancement of periastron of a\nplanet orbiting around a star or black hole, which equals $\\pi\\Delta$ per\nperiod, can be also used to test the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 16:48:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 17:31:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

There is a dichotomous-context-induced superselection rule (SSR),\nin which the role of a superselection operator is played by the Pauli matrix\n$\\sigma_3$ and the role of superselection (coherent) sectors is played by the\nabove subspaces. By the SSR any superposition of states from different coherent\nsectors is a mixed state, and splitting the incident wave packet into the\ntransmitted and reflected parts is nothing but a conversion of a pure state\ninto a mixed one.
