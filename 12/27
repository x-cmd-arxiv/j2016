Here, we attempt to bridge the gap between optimistic methods and\nmulti-objective optimization. In particular, this paper is concerned with\nsolving black-box multi-objective problems given a finite number of function\nevaluations and proposes an optimistic approach, which we refer to as the\nMulti-Objective Simultaneous Optimistic Optimization (MO-SOO). Popularized by\nmulti-armed bandits, MO-SOO follows the optimism in the face of uncertainty\nprinciple to recognize Pareto optimal solutions, by combining several\nmulti-armed bandits in a hierarchical structure over the feasible decision\nspace of a multi-objective problem. Based on three assumptions about the\nobjective functions smoothness and hierarchical partitioning, the algorithm\nfinite-time and asymptotic convergence behaviors are analyzed. The finite-time\nanalysis establishes an upper bound on the Pareto-compliant unary additive\nepsilon indicator characterized by the objectives smoothness as well as the\nstructure of the Pareto front with respect to its extrema. On the other hand,\nthe asymptotic analysis indicates the consistency property of MO-SOO. Moreover,\nwe validate the theoretical provable performance of the algorithm on a set of\nsynthetic problems. Finally, three-hundred bi-objective benchmark problems from\nthe literature are used to substantiate the performance of the optimistic\napproach and compare it with three state-of-the-art stochastic algorithms,\nnamely MOEA/D, MO-CMA-ES, and SMS-EMOA in terms of two Pareto-compliant quality\nindicators. Besides sound theoretical properties, MO-SOO shows a performance on\na par with the top performing stochastic algorithm, viz.

This paper considers the application\nof separated representations for orbit uncertainty propagation, where future\nstates are expanded into a sum of products of univariate functions of initial\nstates and other uncertain parameters. An accurate generation of separated\nrepresentation requires a number of state samples that is linear in the\ndimension of input uncertainties.

To an acyclic partial matching $\\mu$ on a finite regular CW complex\n$X$, Forman introduced a discrete analogue of gradient flows. Although Forman's\ngradient flow has been proved to be useful in practical computations of\nhomology groups, it is not sufficient to recover the homotopy type of $X$.\nForman also proved the existence of a CW complex which is homotopy equivalent\nto $X$ and whose cells are in one-to-one correspondence with the critical cells\nof $\\mu$, but the construction is ad hoc and does not have a combinatorial\ndescription. By relaxing the definition of Forman's gradient flows, we\nintroduce the notion of flow paths, which contains enough information to\nreconstruct the homotopy type of $X$, while retaining a combinatorial\ndescription. The critical difference from Forman's gradient flows is the\nexistence of a partial order on the set of flow paths, from which a\n$2$-category $C(\\mu)$ is constructed. It is shown that the classifying space of\n$C(\\mu)$ is homotopy equivalent to $X$ by using homotopy theory of\n$2$-categories.

For example, doping an\nantiferromagnet gives rise to interesting phases including pseudogap states and\nhigh-temperature superconductors. A promising route towards achieving a\ncomplete understanding of these materials begins with analytic and\ncomputational analysis of simplified models. Quantum simulation has recently\nemerged as a complementary approach towards understanding these models.\nUltracold fermions in optical lattices offer the potential to answer open\nquestions on the low-temperature regime of the doped Hubbard model, which is\nthought to capture essential aspects of the cuprate superconductor phase\ndiagram but is numerically intractable in that parameter regime. A new\nperspective is afforded by quantum gas microscopy of fermions, which allows\nreadout of magnetic correlations at the site-resolved level. Here we report the\nrealization of an antiferromagnet in a repulsively interacting Fermi gas on a\n2D square lattice of approximately 80 sites. Using site-resolved imaging, we\ndetect (finite-size) antiferromagnetic long-range order (LRO) through the\ndevelopment of a peak in the spin structure factor and the divergence of the\ncorrelation length that reaches the size of the system. At our lowest\ntemperature of T/t = 0.25(2) we find strong order across the entire sample. Our\nexperimental platform enables doping away from half filling, where pseudogap\nstates and stripe ordering are expected, but theoretical methods become\nnumerically intractable. In this regime we find that the antiferromagnetic LRO\npersists to hole dopings of about 15%, providing a guideline for computational\nmethods. Our results demonstrate that quantum gas microscopy of ultracold\nfermions in optical lattices can now address open questions on the\nlow-temperature Hubbard model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2016 20:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-01"}

This paper provides an analysis of a well-known\nmodel for resource sharing, the 'share-constrained proportional allocation'\nmechanism, to realize network slicing. This mechanism enables tenants to reap\nthe performance benefits of sharing, while retaining the ability to customize\ntheir own users' allocation. This results in a network slicing game in which\neach tenant reacts to the user allocations of the other tenants so as to\nmaximize its own utility. We show that, under appropriate conditions, the game\nassociated with such strategic behavior converges to a Nash equilibrium. At the\nNash equilibrium, a tenant always achieves the same, or better, performance\nthan under a static partitioning of resources, hence providing the same level\nof protection as such static partitioning.

Gossiping is a\nwell-known approach to the problem which seeks to iteratively arrive at a\nsolution by allowing each agent to interchange information with at most one\nneighbor at each iterative step. Crafting a gossiping protocol which\naccomplishes this is challenging because gossiping is an inherently\ncollaborative process which can lead to deadlocks unless careful precautions\nare taken to ensure that it does not. Many gossiping protocols are\nrequest-based which means simply that a gossip between two agents will occur\nwhenever one of the two agents accepts a request to gossip placed by the other.\nIn this paper, we present three deterministic request-based protocols. We show\nby example that the first can deadlock. The second is guaranteed to avoid\ndeadlocks and requires fewer transmissions per iteration than standard\nbroadcast-based distributed averaging protocols by exploiting the idea of local\nordering together with the notion of an agent's neighbor queue; the protocol\nrequires the simplest queue updates, which provides an in-depth understanding\nof how local ordering and queue updates avoid deadlocks.

However, PD plots involve a serious pitfall if the\npredictor variables are far from independent, which is quite common with large\nobservational data sets. Namely, PD plots require extrapolation of the response\nat predictor values that are far outside the multivariate envelope of the\ntraining data, which can render the PD plots unreliable.

Assets are\ntraded in either an exchange or a dark pool, with the dark pool offering better\nprices but lower execution rates. Informed traders receive noisy and\nheterogeneous signals about an asset's fundamental. We find that informed\ntraders use dark pools to mitigate their information risk and there is a\nsorting effect: in equilibrium, traders with strong signals trade in exchanges,\ntraders with moderate signals trade in dark pools, and traders with weak\nsignals do not trade. As a result, dark pools have an amplification effect on\nprice discovery. That is, when information precision is high (information risk\nis low), the majority of informed traders trade in the exchange hence adding a\ndark pool enhances price discovery, whereas when information precision is low\n(information risk is high), the majority of the informed traders trade in the\ndark pool hence adding a dark pool impairs price discovery. The paper\nreconciles the conflicting empirical evidence and produces novel empirical\npredictions.

Constructing this abstraction for the entire system is\ncomputationally expensive, and does not exploit natural decompositions of many\nsystems into interacting components. We describe a methodology for\ncompositional symbolic abstraction to help scale controller synthesis for\ntemporal logic to larger systems.\n  We introduce a new relation, called (approximate) disturbance bisimulation,\nas the basis for compositional symbolic abstractions. Disturbance bisimulation\nstrengthens the standard approximate alternating bisimulation relation used in\ncontrol. It extends naturally to systems which are composed of weakly\ninterconnected sub-components possibly connected in feedback, and models the\ncoupling signals as disturbances. After proving this composability of\ndisturbance bisimulation for metric systems we apply this result to the\ncompositional abstraction of networks of input-to-state stable deterministic\nnon-linear control systems. We give conditions that allow to construct\nfinite-state abstractions compositionally for each component in such a network,\nso that the abstractions are simultaneously disturbance bisimilar to their\ncontinuous counterparts. Combining these two results, we show conditions under\nwhich one can compositionally abstract a network of non-linear control systems\nin a modular way while ensuring that the final composed abstraction is\ndisturbance bisimilar to the original system.

In a\ntypical set-up -a laser focused into a gas jet or cell- the propagation\ndistances amount to several wavelengths, and the cumulative phase-mismatch\naffects strongly the efficiency and properties of the harmonic emission.

However, recognizing faces with partial occlusion is still challenging\nfor existing face recognizers which is heavily desired in real-world\napplications concerning surveillance and security. Although much research\neffort has been devoted to developing face de-occlusion methods, most of them\ncan only work well under constrained conditions, such as all the faces are from\na pre-defined closed set. In this paper, we propose a robust LSTM-Autoencoders\n(RLA) model to effectively restore partially occluded faces even in the wild.\nThe RLA model consists of two LSTM components, which aims at occlusion-robust\nface encoding and recurrent occlusion removal respectively. The first one,\nnamed multi-scale spatial LSTM encoder, reads facial patches of various scales\nsequentially to output a latent representation, and occlusion-robustness is\nachieved owing to the fact that the influence of occlusion is only upon some of\nthe patches. Receiving the representation learned by the encoder, the LSTM\ndecoder with a dual channel architecture reconstructs the overall face and\ndetects occlusion simultaneously, and by feat of LSTM, the decoder breaks down\nthe task of face de-occlusion into restoring the occluded part step by step.\nMoreover, to minimize identify information loss and guarantee face recognition\naccuracy over recovered faces, we introduce an identity-preserving adversarial\ntraining scheme to further improve RLA. Extensive experiments on both synthetic\nand real datasets of faces with occlusion clearly demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our proposed RLA in removing different types of facial occlusion at various\nlocations. The proposed method also provides significantly larger performance\ngain than other de-occlusion methods in promoting recognition performance over\npartially-occluded faces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2016 08:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

In\nparticular, I discuss as to how the response of detectors does not necessarily\nreflect the particle content of the quantum field. I also describe an\ninteresting `inversion of statistics' that occurs in odd spacetime dimensions\nfor `odd couplings', i.e. the response of a uniformly accelerating detector is\ncharacterized by a Fermi-Dirac distribution even when it is interacting with a\nscalar field. Moreover, by coupling the detector to a quantum field that is\ngoverned by a modified dispersion relation arising supposedly due to quantum\ngravitational effects, I examine the possible Planck scale modifications to the\nresponse of a rotating detector in flat spacetime.

The trend with geometric\nenvironment is reversed at large halo mass, with haloes in knots being younger\nthan haloes of the same mass in voids.

However, data parallel processing\nprimitives such as repeated barrier and reduce operations introduce high\nsynchronization overheads.

In the\npresent paper, it is shown that the OSEE can be calculated in two-dimensional\nconformal field theory, in a number of situations that are relevant to\nquestions of simulability of long-time dynamics in one spatial dimension.\n  It is argued that: (i) thermal density matrices $\\rho \\propto e^{-\\beta H}$\nand Generalized Gibbs Ensemble density matrices $\\rho \\propto e^{- H_{\\rm\nGGE}}$ with local $H_{\\rm GGE}$ generically obey the operator area law; (ii)\nafter a global quench, the OSEE first grows linearly with time, then decreases\nback to its thermal or GGE saturation value, implying that, while the operator\narea law is satisfied both in the initial state and in the asymptotic\nstationary state at large time, it is strongly violated in the transient\nregime; (iii) the OSEE of the evolution operator $U(t) = e^{-i H t}$ increases\nlinearly with $t$, unless the Hamiltonian is in a localized phase; (iv) local\noperators in Heisenberg picture, $\\phi(t) = e^{i H t} \\phi e^{-i H t}$, have an\nOSEE that grows sublinearly in time (perhaps logarithmically), however it is\nunclear whether this effect can be captured in a traditional CFT framework, as\nthe free fermion case hints at an unexpected breakdown of conformal invariance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2016 13:30:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 12:55:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2017 15:33:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

Learning to maximize AUC\nperformance is thus an important research problem.

Batch learning methods for solving the\nkernelized version of this problem suffer from scalability and may not result\nin sparse classifiers. Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in the\ndevelopment of online or single-pass online learning algorithms that design a\nclassifier by maximizing the AUC performance. The AUC performance of nonlinear\nclassifiers, designed using online methods, is not comparable with that of\nnonlinear classifiers designed using batch learning algorithms on many\nreal-world datasets. Motivated by these observations, we design a scalable\nalgorithm for maximizing AUC performance by greedily adding the required number\nof basis functions into the classifier model.

Our study is based on\nanalysis of quasi-one-dimensional Poisson-Nernst-Planck type models for ionic\nflows through membrane channels. This class of models includes the Poisson\nequation that determines the electrical potential from the charges present and\nis in that sense consistent. Ussing's flux ratios generally depend on all\nphysical parameters involved in ionic flows, particularly, on bulk conditions\nand channel structures. Certain setups of ion channel experiments result in\nflux ratios that are universal in the sense that their values depend on bulk\nconditions but not on channel structures; other setups lead to flux ratios that\nare specific in the sense that their values depend on channel structures too.\nUniversal flux ratios could serve some purposes better than specific flux\nratios in some circumstances and worse in other circumstances. We focus on two\ntreatments of tracer flux measurements that serve as estimators of important\nproperties of ion channels. The first estimator determines the flux of the main\nion species from measurements of the flux of its tracer. Our analysis suggests\na better experimental design so that the flux ratio of the tracer flux and the\nmain ion flux is universal. The second treatment of tracer fluxes concerns\nratios of fluxes and experimental setups that try to determine some properties\nof channel structure. We analyze the two widely used experimental designs of\nestimating flux ratios and show that the most widely used method depends on the\nspatial distribution of permanent charge so this flux ratio is specific and\nthus allows estimation of (some of) the properties of that permanent charge,\neven with ideal ionic solutions. ...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2016 02:32:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-30"}

In this paper we examine\nthe nature of truth and correctness in order to construct a validation\nframework that can encompass all the varied forms of research.
