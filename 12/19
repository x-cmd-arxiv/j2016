Thus the RS\nequations contain nontrivial constraints to eliminate the redundant DOF.\nConsequently the standard procedure adopted in realizing relativistic spin-1/2\nquasi-particle is not capable of creating the RS fermion in condensed matter\nsystems. In this work, we propose a generic method to construct a Hamiltonian\nwhich implicitly contains the RS constraints, thus includes the eigenstates and\nenergy dispersions being exactly the same as those of RS equations. By\nimplementing our 16X16 or 6X6 Hamiltonian, one can realize the 3 dimensional or\n2 dimensional (2D) massive RS quasiparticles, respectively. In the\nnon-relativistic limit, the 2D 6X6 Hamiltonian can be reduced to two 3X3\nHamiltonians which describe the positive and negative energy parts\nrespectively. Due to the nontrivial constraints, this simplified 2D massive RS\nquasiparticle has an exotic property: it has vanishing orbital magnetic moment\nwhile its orbital magnetization is finite. Finally, we discuss the material\nrealization of RS quasiparticle. Our study provides an opportunity to realize\nhigher spin elementary fermions with constraints in condensed matter systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2016 16:08:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2017 09:06:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 Sep 2017 22:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-05"}

Rupert Riedl, for\nexample, an early pioneer of evolutionary developmental biology, suggested that\nthe evolution of complex adaptations is facilitated by a developmental\norganization that is itself shaped by past selection to facilitate evolutionary\ninnovation. However, selection for characteristics that enable future\ninnovation seems paradoxical: natural selection cannot favor structures for\nbenefits they have not yet produced, and favoring characteristics for benefits\nthat have already been produced does not constitute future innovation. Here we\nresolve this paradox by exploiting a formal equivalence between the evolution\nof evolvability and learning systems. We use the conditions that enable simple\nlearning systems to generalize, i.e., to use past experience to improve\nperformance on previously unseen, future test cases, to demonstrate conditions\nwhere natural selection can systematically favor developmental organizations\nthat benefit future evolvability. Using numerical simulations of evolution on\nhighly epistatic fitness landscapes, we illustrate how the structure of evolved\ngene regulation networks can result in increased evolvability capable of\navoiding local fitness peaks and discovering higher fitness phenotypes. Our\nfindings support Riedl's intuition: Developmental organizations that \"mimic\"\nthe organization of constraints on phenotypes can be favored by short-term\nselection and also facilitate future innovation. Importantly, the conditions\nthat enable the evolution of such surprising evolvability follow from the same\nnon-mysterious conditions that permit generalization in learning systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2016 17:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-20"}

To this end, we propose a two-level\ndecision-making framework where the retailer acting as upper-level agent\nfirstly announces its electricity prices of next 24 hours and customers acting\nas lower-level agents subsequently schedule their energy usages accordingly.\nFor the lower level problem, we model the price responsiveness of different\ncustomers according to their unique characteristics. For the upper level\nproblem, we optimize the dynamic prices for the retailer to maximize its profit\nsubject to realistic market constraints. The above two-level model is tackled\nby genetic algorithms (GA) based distributed optimization methods while its\nfeasibility and effectiveness are confirmed via simulation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2016 18:44:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 11:46:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Mar 2018 12:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-22"}

At low redshift,\nH-poor SLSNe are preferentially found in very blue, low-mass galaxies with high\naverage specific star-formation rates. As redshift increases, the host\npopulation follows the general evolution of star-forming galaxies towards more\nluminous galaxies. After accounting for secular evolution, we find evidence for\ndifferential evolution in galaxy mass, but not in the $B$-band and the far UV\nluminosity ($3\\sigma$ confidence). Most remarkable is the scarcity of hosts\nwith stellar masses above $10^{10}~M_\\odot$ for both classes of SLSNe.

At\na mean $\\alpha$-abundance of [(Mg,Si,Ca)/3 Fe] = 0.39$\\pm$0.03 dex, NGC 6426\nfalls on the trend drawn by the Milky Way halo and other globular clusters at\ncomparably low metallicities. The distribution of the lighter $\\alpha$-elements\nas well as the enhanced ratio [Zn/Fe] = 0.39 dex could originate from hypernova\nenrichment of the pre-cluster medium. We find tentative evidence for a spread\nin the elements Mg, Si, and Zn, indicating an enrichment scenario, where ejecta\nof evolved massive stars of a slightly older population polluted a newly born\nyounger one. The heavy element abundances in this cluster fit well into the\npicture of metal-poor globular clusters, which in that respect appear to be\nremarkably homogeneous. The pattern of the neutron-capture elements heavier\nthan Zn point towards an enrichment history governed by the r-process with only\nlittle -if any- sign of s-process contributions. This finding is supported by\nthe striking similarity of our program stars to the metal-poor field star HD\n108317.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2016 20:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

As the most comprehensive statistics, this PDF encodes all\ncosmological information of large-scale modes, therefore, could serve as the\nbasis in the LSS modelling. Following the so-called PDF-based method from\nturbulence, we write down this PDF's evolution equation, which describes the\nprobability conservation. We show that this conservation equation's\ncharacteristic curves follow the same PDF history and could be considered as an\neffective dynamics of the coarse-grained field. Unlike the EFT of LSS, which\nconceptually would work at both realization and statistics level, this\neffective dynamics is valid only statistically. However, this `statistical\nequivalence' also provides valuable insight into scale interactions at the\nstatistical level. It also enables predicting a wide variety of statistics\nbeyond the typical N-point polyspectra, including, e.g. topologies, density PDF\nand non-linear covariance matrices etc. Our formula expresses the small-scale\neffect as the ensemble average of their interactions conditional on the\nlarge-scale modes. This suggests an interesting way to measure effective terms\ndirectly from simulation. By applying the Gram-Charlier expansion, we\ndemonstrate a different structure of these effective terms. This formalism is a\nnatural framework for discussing the evolution of statistical properties of\nlarge-scale modes, and provides an alternative view for understanding the\nrelationship between general effective dynamics and standard perturbation\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2016 21:34:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 07:42:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 20:49:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

The stability of a desired steady regime (e.g., a\nsynchronized state) to large perturbations is critical in the operation of many\nreal-world networked dynamical systems such as ecosystems, power grids, the\nhuman brain, etc. This necessitates the development of appropriate quantifiers\nof stability of multiple stable states of such systems. Motivated by the\nconcept of basin stability (BS) (Menck et al., Nature Physics 9, 89 (2013)), we\npropose here the general framework of \\emph{multi-node basin stability} for\ngauging global stability and robustness of networked dynamical systems in\nresponse to non-local perturbations simultaneously affecting multiple nodes of\na system. The framework of multi-node BS provides an estimate of the critical\nnumber of nodes which when simultaneously perturbed, significantly reduces the\ncapacity of the system to return to the desired stable state. Further, this\nmethodology can be applied to estimate the minimum number of nodes of the\nnetwork to be controlled or safeguarded from external perturbations to ensure\nproper operation of the system. Multi-node BS can also be utilized for probing\nthe influence of spatially localised perturbations or targeted attacks to\nspecific parts of a network. We demonstrate the potential of multi-node BS in\nassessing the stability of the synchronized state in a deterministic scale-free\nnetwork of R\\\"{o}ssler oscillators and a conceptual model of the power grid of\nthe United Kingdom with second-order Kuramoto-type nodal dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2016 00:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

At the core of the approach is a deep feed-forward singling-out\nnetwork (SON) that is trained to map each local patch to a vectorial descriptor\nthat is sensitive to the characteristics (e.g. shape) of a central object,\nwhile being invariant to the variability of all other surrounding elements.\nGiven a SON, a local image patch can be matched to a gallery of isolated\nelements using their SON-descriptors, thus producing a hypothesis about the\nshape of the central element in that patch.

It is observed that features in\nhigher layers encode semantic context while its counterparts in lower layers\nare sensitive to discriminative appearance. Thus we exploit the hierarchical\nfeatures in different layers of a deep model and design a dual structure to\nobtain better feature representation from various streams, which is rarely\ninvestigated in previous work. To highlight geometric contours of the target,\nwe integrate the hierarchical feature maps with an edge detector as the coarse\nprior maps to further embed local details around the target. To leverage the\nrobustness of our dual network, we train it with random patches measuring the\nsimilarities between the network activation and target appearance, which serves\nas a regularization to enforce the dual network to focus on target object. The\nproposed dual network is updated online in a unique manner based on the\nobservation that the target being tracked in consecutive frames should share\nmore similar feature representations than those in the surrounding background.\nIt is also found that for a target object, the prior maps can help further\nenhance performance by passing message into the output maps of the dual\nnetwork. Therefore, an independent component analysis with reference algorithm\n(ICA-R) is employed to extract target context using prior maps as guidance.\nOnline tracking is conducted by maximizing the posterior estimate on the final\nmaps with stochastic and periodic update.

Most of this data is high\ndimensional and sparse. The need to perform an efficient search for similar\nobjects in such high dimensional big datasets is becoming increasingly common.\nEven with the rapid growth in computing power, the brute-force search for such\na task is impractical and at times impossible. Therefore it is quite natural to\ninvestigate the techniques that compress the dimension of the data-set while\npreserving the similarity between data objects.\n  In this work, we propose an efficient compression scheme mapping binary\nvectors into binary vectors and simultaneously preserving Hamming distance and\nInner Product. The length of our compression depends only on the sparsity and\nis independent of the dimension of the data. Moreover our schemes provide\none-shot solution for Hamming distance and Inner Product, and work in the\nstreaming setting as well. In contrast with the \"local projection\" strategies\nused by most of the previous schemes, our scheme combines (using sparsity) the\nfollowing two strategies: $1.$ Partitioning the dimensions into several\nbuckets, $2.$ Then obtaining \"global linear summaries\" in each of these\nbuckets. We generalize our scheme for real-valued data and obtain compressions\nfor Euclidean distance, Inner Product, and $k$-way Inner Product.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2016 06:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-20"}

In the\ncase of multipartite communication when each communicator possesses a part of\n$N$-partite entangled state, not all pairs of communicators can achieve a high\nfidelity due to monogamy property of quantum entanglement.

For the first time, we\ngive a quantification of the duration of disturbed conditions (preconditioning)\nfor interplanetary space caused by CMEs. To this aim, we investigate the plasma\nspeed component of the solar wind and the impact of in situ detected CMEs\n(ICMEs), compared to different background solar wind models (ESWF, WSA,\npersistence model) for the time range 2011-2015.

For the architecture of the\ncompact full duplex radio, we combine an analog self-interference canceler\nbased dual-polarization with high cross-polarization discrimination (XPD) and\nLong Term Evolution (LTE)-based per-subcarrier digital self-interference\ncanceler. While we consider the compactness and power efficiency of an analog\nsolution, we focus on the digital canceler design with robustness to a\nfrequency-selective channel and high compatibility with a conventional LTE\nsystem. For an over-the-air wireless experiment of full duplex testbed with a\ntwo-user-pair, we implement a full duplex MIMO physical layer (PHY), supporting\n20 MHz bandwidth, on an FPGA-based software-defined radio platform. Further, we\npropose a novel timing synchronization method to construct a more viable full\nduplex MIMO link. By having the full duplex link prototype fully operating in\nreal-time, we present the first characterization of the proposed compact full\nduplex MIMO performance depending on the transmit power of the full duplex\nnode.

An efficient methodology for\nautomatically detecting multivariate outliers is introduced. It takes advantage\nof the remarkable properties of the Invariant Coordinate Selection (ICS)\nmethod. Based on the simultaneous spectral decomposition of two scatter\nmatrices, ICS leads to an affine invariant coordinate system in which the\nEuclidian distance corresponds to a Mahalanobis Distance (MD) in the original\ncoordinates. The limitations of MD are highlighted using theoretical arguments\nin a context where the dimension of the data is large. Unlike MD, ICS makes it\npossible to select relevant components which removes the limitations. Owing to\nthe resulting dimension reduction, the method is expected to improve the power\nof outlier detection rules such as MD-based criteria. It also greatly\nsimplifies outliers interpretation. The paper includes practical guidelines for\nusing ICS in the context of a small proportion of outliers which is relevant in\nhigh reliability standards fields. The choice of scatter matrices together with\nthe selection of relevant invariant components through parallel analysis and\nnormality tests are addressed. The use of the regular covariance matrix and the\nso called matrix of fourth moments as the scatter pair is recommended. This\nchoice combines the simplicity of implementation together with the possibility\nto derive theoretical results. A simulation study confirms the good properties\nof the proposal and compares it with other scatter pairs. This study also\nprovides a comparison with Principal Component Analysis and MD. The performance\nof our proposal is also evaluated on several real data sets using a\nuser-friendly R package accompanying the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2016 10:51:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2016 08:54:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2018 20:51:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-01"}

Despite its success and wide\nadoption, MAP estimation is not theoretically well understood yet. The\nprevalent view in the community is that MAP estimation is not proper Bayesian\nestimation in a decision-theoretic sense because it does not minimise a\nmeaningful expected loss function (unlike the minimum mean squared error (MMSE)\nestimator that minimises the mean squared loss). This paper addresses this\ntheoretical gap by presenting a decision-theoretic derivation of MAP estimation\nin Bayesian models that are log-concave. A main novelty is that our analysis is\nbased on differential geometry, and proceeds as follows. First, we use the\nunderlying convex geometry of the Bayesian model to induce a Riemannian\ngeometry on the parameter space. We then use differential geometry to identify\nthe so-called natural or canonical loss function to perform Bayesian point\nestimation in that Riemannian manifold. For log-concave models, this canonical\nloss is the Bregman divergence associated with the negative log posterior\ndensity. We then show that the MAP estimator is the only Bayesian estimator\nthat minimises the expected canonical loss, and that the posterior mean or MMSE\nestimator minimises the dual canonical loss. We also study the question of MAP\nand MSSE estimation performance in large scales and establish a universal bound\non the expected canonical error as a function of dimension, offering new\ninsights into the good performance observed in convex problems.

This analysis predicts dimensional reduction, i.e., that\nthe critical properties of the random-field Ising model in $D$ dimensions are\nidentical to those of the pure Ising ferromagnet in $D-2$ dimensions. It is\nwell known that dimensional reduction is not true in three dimensions, thus\ninvalidating the perturbative renormalization group prediction. Here, we report\nhigh-precision numerical simulations of the 5D random-field Ising model at zero\ntemperature.

The trembling motion of an electron results\nfrom the interference between the positive and the negative-energy solutions of\nthe Dirac equation, separated by one MeV, leading to oscillations at extremely\nhigh frequencies which are out of reach experimentally. Recently, it was shown\ntheoretically that electrons in III-V semiconductors are governed by similar\nequations in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. The small energy splittings\nup to meV result in Zitterbewegung at much smaller frequencies which should be\nexperimentally accessible as an AC current.

Although several\nstudies have examined the association between presidential elections and stock\nreturns, very little attention has been given to the impacts of elections and\nelection induced uncertainty on stock markets. This paper explores, at sectoral\nlevel, the uncertain information hypothesis (UIH) as a means of explaining the\nreaction of markets to the arrival of unanticipated information. This\nhypothesis postulates that political uncertainty is greater prior to the\nelections (relative to pre-election period) but is resolved once the outcome of\nthe elections is determined (relative to post-election period). To this end, we\nadopt an event-study methodology that examines abnormal return behavior around\nthe election date. We show that collapsing stock returns around the election\nresult is reversed by positive abnormal return on the next day, except some\ncases where we note negative responses following the vote count. Although\nTrump's win plunges US into uncertain future, positive reactions of abnormal\nreturn are found. Therefore, our results do not support the UIH hypothesis.\nBesides, the effect of political uncertainty is sector-specific. While some\nsectors emerged winners (healthcare, oil and gas, real estate, defense,\nfinancials and consumer goods and services), others took the opposite route\n(technology and utilities). The winning industries are generally those that\nwill benefit from the new administration's focus on rebuilding infrastructure,\nrenegotiating trade agreements, reforming tax policy and labour laws,\nincreasing defense funding, easing restrictions on energy production, and\nrolling back Obamacare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2016 14:28:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 13:50:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-02"}

Estimates of the abundance of life's building blocks are\nconfounded by incomplete knowledge of the role of chirality and racemization in\norganic compounds in the origination of living organisms. Chirality is an\nessential feature of enzymes as well as many lock-and-key type structures.\nThere are four known processes that can act on complex organic molecules to\npromote racemization for abiogenesis: quantum-tunneling effects; selection via\ninteraction with circularly polarized light (CPL); templating processes; and\ninteractions with electrical and magnetic (EM) fields. These occur in different\nplaces, respectively: cold interstellar space; regions of space with energetic\nphotons, dust and/or magnetic fields; and mineral surfaces (for both templating\nand EM fields).

The wave function phase relations that are the\nactual physical \"common cause in the past\" for the observed correlation become\nalso visual and evident. Thus the diagram analysis shows that the phenomenon of\ndistant quantum correlation has simple causal and local explanation and there\nis no need to invent various extravagant constructions contradicting the\nestablished physical principles as well as usual common sense considerations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2016 15:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-03"}

We show that under\nproper diffusive scaling the random walk exhibits a non-standard limit\nbehaviour. In addition to the coordinate of the random walk in $\\mathbb Z^d$ we\nintroduce an extra variable that characterizes the position of the random walk\nin the period and show that this two-component process converges in law to a\nlimit Markov process. The components of the limit process are mutually coupled,\nthus we cannot expect that the limit behaviour of the coordinate process is\nMarkov. We also prove the convergence in the path space for the said random\nwalk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2016 11:08:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

The presence of a tax system combined with a\nredistribution process is taken into account, as well as the occurrence of tax\nevasion. In particular, the existence is postulated, in relation to the level\nof evasion, of different individual taxpayer behaviors. The effects of the\nmentioned different behaviors on shape and features of the emerging income\ndistribution profile are investigated qualitatively and quantitatively.\nNumerical solutions show that the Gini inequality index of the total population\nincreases when the evasion level is higher, but does not depend significantly\non the evasion spread. For fixed spread, the relative difference between the\naverage incomes of the worst evaders and honest taxpayers increases\napproximately as a quadratic function of the evasion level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2016 15:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

We study two facets: power the grid is unable to accept\n(curtailment), and power that is assigned zero economic value by the grid\n(negative or zero price). Collectively we term these \"stranded power\" or SP.\n  We study stranded power in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator\n(MISO), characterizing quantity and temporal structure. First, stranded power\nis available in the MISO grid 99% of the time, and often in intervals >100\nhours, with characteristic seasonal and time-of-day patterns. Average stranded\npower often exceeds 1 GW, with duty factors as high as 30%. About 30% of all\nwind generation in MISO is stranded. Examination of the top 10 individual sites\nshows stranded power can be as high as 70% duty factor and 250MW. Trends over\nthe past 3.5 years suggest stranded power is a persistent phenomenon. The study\ncharacterizes opportunities to exploit stranded power.\n  We consider using energy storage to increase the utility of stranded power.\nFor a range of power levels and uniformly-distributed storage, adding 5 hours\nof storage doubles duty factor to 30% at 4MW, but another 95 hours is required\nfor the next 15% increase. At 4MW with 50 hours of storage, only 3 of 200 sites\nreach 100% duty factor, and with 100 hours required for the next 10 sites.\nHigher power levels require 100's of hours. Storage at the top 10 sites is more\nproductive, 5 hours increases duty factor to 70% at 4MW, but further storage\nhas diminishing benefits. Studies of the amount of power served by storage show\nthat distribution to the best sites provides 2 to 3.7-fold advantages over\nuniform distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2016 22:14:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-20"}
