These objects are\nsubsequently stretched by the inflationary expansion, resulting in a broad\ndistribution of sizes. The fate of the walls after inflation depends on their\nradius. Walls smaller than a critical radius fall within the cosmological\nhorizon early on and collapse due to their own tension, forming ordinary black\nholes. But if a wall is large enough, its repulsive gravitational field becomes\ndominant much before the wall can fall within the cosmological horizon. In this\n\"supercritical\" case, a wormhole throat develops, connecting the ambient\nexterior FRW universe with an interior baby universe, where the exponential\ngrowth of the wall radius takes place. The wormhole pinches off in a time-scale\ncomparable to its light-crossing time, and black holes are formed at its two\nmouths. As discussed in previous work, the resulting black hole population has\na wide distribution of masses and can have significant astrophysical effects.\nThe mechanism of black hole formation has been previously studied for a\ndust-dominated universe. Here we investigate the case of a radiation-dominated\nuniverse, which is more relevant cosmologically, by using numerical simulations\nin order to find the initial mass of a black hole as a function of the wall\nsize at the end of inflation. For large supercritical domain walls, this mass\nnearly saturates the upper bound according to which the black hole cannot be\nlarger than the cosmological horizon. We also find that the subsequent\naccretion of radiation satisfies a scaling relation, resulting in a mass\nincrease by about a factor of 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 21:34:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2016 21:44:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 21:50:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 19:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

MagiCoder, a Natural\nLanguage Processing algorithm, is proposed for the automatic encoding of\nfree-text descriptions into MedDRA terms. MagiCoder procedure is efficient in\nterms of computational complexity (in particular, it is linear in the size of\nthe narrative input and the terminology). We tested it on a large dataset of\nabout 4500 manually revised reports, by performing an automated comparison\nbetween human and MagiCoder revisions.

Our algorithm, the Fitted Policy\nForest algorithm (FPF), computes a regression forest representing the Q-value\nand transforms it into a single tree representing the policy, while keeping\ncontrol on the size of the policy using resampling and leaf merging. We\nintroduce an adaptation of Multi-Resolution Exploration (MRE) which is\nparticularly suited to FPF. We assess the performance of FPF on three classical\nbenchmarks for reinforcement learning: the \"Inverted Pendulum\", the \"Double\nIntegrator\" and \"Car on the Hill\" and show that FPF equals or outperforms other\nalgorithms, although these algorithms rely on the use of particular\nrepresentations of the policies, especially chosen in order to fit each of the\nthree problems. Finally, we exhibit that the combination of FPF and MRE allows\nto find nearly optimal solutions in problems where $\\epsilon$-greedy approaches\nwould fail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 16:52:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-19"}

Testing different models for the suppression of non-Keplerian\nstellar signals usually plaguing radial velocity data is essential to ensuring\nfindings are robust and reproducible. Using an alternative treatment of the\nstellar noise to that discussed in the discovery paper, we re-analyse the\nradial velocity dataset that led to the detection of a candidate terrestrial\nplanet orbiting the star Proxima Centauri. We aim to confirm the existence of\nthis outstanding planet, and test the existence of a second planetary signal.\nOur technique jointly modelled Keplerian signals and residual correlated\nsignals in radial velocities using Gaussian processes.

It is a common practice to arrange the vectors of any minimal\nbasis as the rows of a polynomial matrix and to call such matrix simply a\nminimal basis. Very recently, minimal bases, as well as the closely related\npairs of dual minimal bases, have been applied to a number of problems that\ninclude the solution of general inverse eigenstructure problems for polynomial\nmatrices, the development of new classes of linearizations and\n$\\ell$-ifications of polynomial matrices, and backward error analyses of\ncomplete polynomial eigenstructure problems solved via a wide class of strong\nlinearizations. These new applications have revealed that although the\nalgebraic properties of minimal bases are rather well understood, their\nrobustness and the behavior of the corresponding dual minimal bases under\nperturbations have not yet been explored in the literature, as far as we know.\nTherefore, the main purpose of this paper is to study in detail when a minimal\nbasis $M(\\lambda)$ is robust under perturbations, i.e., when all the polynomial\nmatrices in a neighborhood of $M(\\lambda)$ are minimal bases, and, in this\ncase, how perturbations of $M(\\lambda)$ change its dual minimal bases. In order\nto study such problems, a new characterization of whether or not a polynomial\nmatrix is a minimal basis in terms of a finite number of rank conditions is\nintroduced and, based on it, we prove that polynomial matrices are generically\nminimal bases with very specific properties. In addition, some applications of\nthe results of this paper are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 17:15:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-13"}

In this paper we demonstrate that\nthe evolution of a cluster's cooling core, in terms of its density,\ntemperature, and magnetic field strength, inevitably enables the plasma\nelectrons there to quickly become Cerenkov loss dominated, with emission at the\nradio frequency of $\\lesssim$ 350 Hz, and with a rate considerably exceeding\nfree-free continuum and line emission. However, the same does not apply to the\nplasmas at the cluster's outskirts, which lacks such radiation. Owing to its\nlow frequency, the radiation cannot escape, but because over the relevant scale\nsize of a Cerenkov wavelength the energy of an electron in the gas cannot\nfollow the Boltzmann distribution to the requisite precision to ensure\nreabsorption always occurs slower than stimulated emission, the emitting gas\ncools before it reheats. This leaves behind the radiation itself, trapped by\nthe overlying reflective plasma, yet providing enough pressure to maintain\nquasi-hydrostatic equilibrium. The mass condensation then happens by\nRayleigh-Taylor instability, at a rate determined by the outermost radius where\nCerenkov radiation can occur. In this way, it is possible to estimate the rate\nat $\\ap 2 M_\\odot$~year$^{-1}$, consistent with observational inference. Thus\nthe process appears to provide a natural solution to the long standing problem\nof `cooling flow' in clusters; at least it offers another line of defense\nagainst cooling and collapse, should gas heating by AGN feedback be inadequate\nin some clusters\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 17:33:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 05:12:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 03:42:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 05:06:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

An activation state identifies who are the\nactive users who have adopted the target innovation. Given an activation state\nof a certain diffusion, effector detection aims to reveal the active users who\nare able to best explain the observed state. In this paper, we tackle the\neffector detection problem from two perspectives. The first approach is based\non the influence distance that measures the chance that an active user can\nactivate its neighbors. For a certain pair of users, the shorter the influence\ndistance, the higher probability that one can activate the other. Given an\nactivation state, the effectors are expected to have short influence distance\nto active users while long to inactive users. By this idea, we propose the\ninfluence-distance-based effector detection problem and provide a\n3-approximation. Second, we address the effector detection problem by the\nmaximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach. We prove that the optimal MLE can\nbe obtained in polynomial time for connected directed acyclic graphs. For\ngeneral graphs, we first extract a directed acyclic subgraph that can well\npreserve the information in the original graph and then apply the MLE approach\nto the extracted subgraph to obtain the effectors.

This effect is a consequence of\nquantum modifications of the hypersurface deformation algebra, which in the\nlinearized case is equivalent to a deformed version of the Poincar\\'e algebra.\nIn this paper the latter relation is applied to the LQG-inspired hypersurface\ndeformation algebra that is characterized by the above mentioned signature\nchange.\n  While the exact form of the deformed Poincar\\'e algebra is not uniquely\ndetermined, the algebra under consideration is representative enough to capture\na number of qualitative features. In particular, the analysis reveals that the\nsignature change can be associated with two symmetric invariant energy scales,\nwhich separate three physically disconnected momentum subspaces.\n  Furthermore, the invariant measure on momentum space is derived, which allows\nto properly define the average return probability, characterizing a fictitious\ndiffusion process on spacetime. The diffusion is subsequently studied in the\nmomentum representation for all possible variants of the model. Finally, the\nspectral dimension of spacetime is calculated in each case as a function of the\nscale parameter. In the most interesting case the deformation is of the\nasymptotically ultralocal type and the spectral dimension undergoes a reduction\nto $d_S = 1$ in the UV limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 20:49:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 17:24:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-21"}

A key issue is that the Bloch-dispersion\ncurves vary with the local microstructure, giving rise to hidden singularities\nassociated with band-gap edges and branch crossings. We describe an asymptotic\napproach for overcoming this difficulty, and take a first step by studying in\ndetail the simplest case of 1D Helmholtz waves. The method entails matching\nadiabatically propagating Bloch waves, captured by a multiple-scale\nWentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation, with complementary\nmultiple-scale solutions spatially localised about dispersion singularities.\nWithin the latter regions the Bloch wavenumber is nearly critical; this allows\ntheir homogenisation, following the method of high-frequency homogenisation\n(HFH), over a naturally arising scale intermediate between the periodicity\n(wavelength) and the macro-scale. Analogously to a classical turning-point\nanalysis, we show that close to a spatial band-gap edge the solution is an Airy\nfunction, only that it is modulated on the short scale by a standing-wave Bloch\neigenfunction. By carrying out the asymptotic matching between the WKB and HFH\nsolutions we provide a detailed description of Bloch-wave reflection from a\nband gap. Finally, we implement the asymptotic theory for a layered medium and\ndemonstrate excellent agreement with numerical computations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 20:50:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-13"}

In weakly ionized gas as in PPDs, magnetic flux is largely\nfrozen in the electron fluid, except when resistivity is large. When the disk\nis largely laminar, we show that the relative drift between the electrons and\nions (the Hall-drift), and the ions and neutral fluids (ambipolar-drift) can\nplay a dominant role on the transport of magnetic flux. Using two-dimensional\nsimulations that incorporate the Hall effect and ambipolar diffusion (AD) with\nprescribed diffusivities, we show that when large-scale poloidal field is\naligned with disk rotation, the Hall effect rapidly drags magnetic flux inward\nat the midplane region, while it slowly pushes flux outward above/below the\nmidplane. This leads to a highly radially elongated field configuration as a\nglobal manifestation of the Hall-shear instability. This field configuration\nfurther promotes rapid outward flux transport by AD at the midplane, leading to\ninstability saturation. In quasi-steady state, magnetic flux is transported\noutward at approximately the same rate at all heights, and the rate is\ncomparable to the Hall-free case. For anti-aligned field polarity, the Hall\neffect consistently transports magnetic flux outward, leading to a largely\nvertical field configuration in the midplane region. The field lines in the\nupper layer first bend radially inward and then outward to launch a disk wind.\nOverall, the net rate of outward flux transport is about twice faster than the\naligned case. In addition, the rate of flux transport increases with increasing\ndisk magnetization. The absolute rate of transport is sensitive to disk\nmicrophysics which remains to be explored in future studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

Most analyses have focused on the\nhigh-energy part of the spectrum, disregarding the GeV energy region where\ncosmic ray transport is harder to model and solar modulation comes into play.\nGiven the high quality of AMS measurements, it is timely to re-examine the\npositron anomaly over the entire energy range, taking into account transport\nprocesses so far neglected, e.g. convection or diffusive re-acceleration.

It\nallows to carry out extensive scans over the cosmic ray propagation parameters,\nwhich we strongly constrain by requiring that the secondary component does not\novershoot the AMS measurements. Only models with large diffusion coefficients\nsurvive this test. The positron flux is a powerful and independent probe of\ncosmic ray propagation, complementary to the boron-to-carbon ratio.

We find that for nearly 30 per cent of our sample, the 70\n$\\mu$m emission contains a significant contribution from the AGN ($> 0.5$),\nespecially at higher luminosities ($L_{14-195\\,\\rm{keV}} > 10^{42.5}$ ergs\ns$^{-1}$). Finally, we measure the local SFR-AGN luminosity relationship,\nfinding a slope of 0.18, large scatter (0.37 dex), and no evidence for an\nupturn at high AGN luminosity. We conclude with a discussion on the\nimplications of our results within the context of galaxy evolution with and\nwithout AGN feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 21:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

We found that star-forming blue\nearly-type galaxies are bulge-dominated systems with axial ratio $>$ 0.5 and\nsurface brightness profiles fitted by Sersic profiles with index ($n$) mostly\n$>$ 2. Twenty-three galaxies are found to have $n$ $<$ 2; these could be\nhosting a disc component.

The performance upper\nbound is, however, determined by an equivalent single-tier network. We further\nshow that with uniform caching probabilities regardless of content\npopularities, to achieve a target SDP, the BS density of a tier can be reduced\nby increasing the cache size of the tier when the cache size is larger than a\nthreshold; otherwise the BS density and BS cache size can be increased\nsimultaneously.

In this mini review, we discuss the general observation\nof the NMR phenomena in non-centrosymmetric NbP and NbAs. We show that NMR can\nbe contributed by intrinsic chiral anomaly of Weyl fermions and/or extrinsic\neffects, such as superimposition of Hall signals, field-dependent inhomogeneous\ncurrent flow in the bulk, i.e. current jetting, and weak localization (WL) of\ncoexistent trivial carriers. Such WL controlled NMR is heavily dependent on\nsample quality, and is characterized by pronounced crossover from positive to\nnegative MR growth at elevated temperatures, as a result of the competition\nbetween the phase coherence time and the spin-orbital scattering constant of\nthe bulk trivial pockets. Thus, the correlation of NMR and chiral anomaly needs\nto be scrutinized, without the support of other complimentary techniques. Due\nto the lifting of spin degeneracy, the spin orientations of Weyl fermions are\neither parallel or antiparallel to the momentum, a unique physical property\nknown as helicity. The conservation of helicity provides strong protection for\nthe transport of Weyl fermions, which can only be effectively scattered by\nmagnetic impurities. Chemical doping of magnetic and non-magnetic impurities\nare thus more convincing in probing the existence of Weyl fermions than the NMR\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 05:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-02"}

Frequency-hopping schemes and\northogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) can conveniently be modelled\nas block-fading channels. Applying lattices in this type of channel entails\ndividing a lattice point into multiple blocks such that fading is constant\nwithin a block but changes, independently, across blocks. The design of\nlattices for BF channels offers a challenging problem, which differs greatly\nfrom its counterparts like AWGN channels.

One way to extract the cosmological\ninformation from WL is to use peak statistics. Peaks are tracers of massive\nhalos and therefore probe the mass function. They retain non-Gaussian\ninformation and have already been shown as a promising tool to constrain\ncosmology. In this work, we develop a new model to predict WL peak counts. The\nmodel generates fast simulations based on halo sampling and selects peaks from\nthe derived lensing maps. This approach has three main advantages. First, the\nmodel is very fast: only several seconds are required to perform a realization.\nSecond, including realistic conditions is straightforward. Third, the model\nprovides the full distribution information because of its stochasticity. We\nshow that our model agrees well with N-body simulations. Then, we study the\nimpacts of the cosmology-dependent covariance on constraints and explore\ndifferent parameter inference methods. A special focus is put on approximate\nBayesian computation (ABC), an accept-reject sampler without the need to\nestimate the likelihood. We show that ABC is able to yield robust constraints\nwith much reduced time costs. Several filtering techniques are studied to\nimprove the extraction of multiscale information. Finally, the new model is\napplied to the CFHTLenS, KiDS DR1/2, and DES SV data sets.

In particular, there is no general theory which focuses on\nfiniteness of the baths of multiple conserved quantities. Then, we investigate\nhow the optimal performance of generalized heat engines with multiple conserved\nquantities alters in response to the size of the baths. In the context of\ngeneral theories of quantum thermodynamics, the size of the baths has been\ngiven in terms of the number of identical copies of a system, which does not\ncover even such a natural scaling as the volume. In consideration of the\nasymptotic extensivity, we deal with a generic scaling of the baths to\nnaturally include the volume scaling. Based on it, we derive a bound for the\nperformance of generalized heat engines reflecting finite-size effects of the\nbaths, which we call fine-grained generalized Carnot bound.

Due to the\ncontent-centric nature of future wireless communications, it is desirable to\ncache popular contents beforehand at the RRHs, to reduce the burden on the\nfronthaul and achieve energy saving through cooperative transmission. This\nmotivates our study in this paper on the energy efficient transmission in an\northogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)-based CRAN with multiple\nRRHs and users, where the RRHs can prefetch popular contents.

High order piecewise polynomials are adopted\nto represent the discrete solution at each time level and within each spatial\ncontrol volume of the computational grid, while high order of accuracy in time\nis achieved by the ADER approach.

Disease spread poses a serious\nthreat in animal and plant health and has implications for ecosystem\nfunctioning and species extinctions as well as implications in society through\nfood security and potential disease spread in humans. Space-time epidemiology\nis based on the concept that various characteristics of the pathogenic agents\nand the environment interact in order to alter the probability of disease\noccurrence and form temporal or spatial patterns. Epidemiology aims to identify\nthese patterns and factors, to assess the relevant uncertainty sources, and to\ndescribe disease in the population. Thus disease spread at the population level\ndiffers from the approach traditionally taken by veterinary practitioners that\nare principally concerned with the health status of the individual. Patterns of\ndisease occurrence provide insights into which factors may be affecting the\nhealth of the population, through investigating which individuals are affected,\nwhere are these individuals located and when did they become infected. With the\nrapid development of smart sensors, social networks, as well as digital maps\nand remotely-sensed imagery spatio-temporal data are more ubiquitous and richer\nthan ever before. The availability of such large datasets (Big data) poses\ngreat challenges in data analysis.

A simple\nextension of the SM compatible with the current theoretical and experimental\nconstraints is given by the 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) where a second Higgs\ndoublet is added to the Higgs sector. We investigate the possibility of a\nstrong first order electroweak phase transition in the CP-conserving 2HDM type\nI and type II where either of the CP-even Higgs bosons is identified with the\nSM-like Higgs boson. The renormalisation that we apply on the loop-corrected\nHiggs potential allows us to efficiently scan the 2HDM parameter space and\nsimultaneously take into account all relevant theoretical and up-to-date\nexperimental constraints. The 2HDM parameter regions found to be compatible\nwith the applied constraints and a strong electroweak phase transition are\nanalysed systematically. Our results show that there is a strong interplay\nbetween the requirement of a strong phase transition and collider phenomenology\nwith testable implications for searches at the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 10:23:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2017 05:09:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

This can be done in two ways: by comparing\narrival times of GWs and their EM counterparts and by comparing the time delays\nbetween images seen in GWs and their EM counterparts. The lensed GW-EM event is\nperhaps the best way to identify an EM counterpart. Conceptually, this method\ndoes not rely on any specific theory of massive gravitons or modified gravity.\nIts differential setting (i.e., measuring the difference between time delays in\nGW and EM domains) makes it robust against lens modeling details (photons and\nGWs travel in the same lensing potential) and against internal time delays\nbetween GW and EM emission acts. It requires, however, that the theory of\ngravity is metric and predicts gravitational lensing similar to general\nrelativity.

In addition the infiltration rate in the latter is at least\ntwo orders of magnitude greater than in the former.\n  This work is addressed to investigate imbibition of a non-wetting, albeit\nreactive, liquid into a capillary, within the framework of a simple model that\nincludes capillarity effects, viscosity and gravity. The capillary radius is\nallowed to vary, due to reaction, with both position and time, according to\neither an interface or a diffusion law. The model allows for capillary closure\nwhen reaction kinetics dominates imbibition. At short times, and depending on\nwhether infiltration is capillarity or gravity controlled, the infiltrated\nlength varies either as the square root or linearly with time. This suggest the\nfollowing track for reactive infiltration: i) In most cases, the contact angle\nis initially larger than $90^\\circ$, ii) after some time, reaction gradually\nreplaces the interface liquid/preform by the liquid/reaction product interface\nand, concomitantly, the contact angle gets closer to $90^\\circ$, iii) beyond\nthat time, gravity triggers infiltration (actually the contact angle does not\nneed to be smaller than $90^\\circ$ for the initiation of infiltration due to\nthe metallostatic pressure exerted by the liquid metal on top of the porous\npreform), iv) thereafter infiltration is controlled by viscosity and gravity,\nprovided that, due to reaction, the contact angle remains close to that at\nwhich infiltration was initiated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 11:42:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

Besides, LIME is able to take care of the user experience when\nmultiple users are facing the phone screen.

The existence of an analytic solution for the\ntwo-dimensional incompressible flow field allows the exact derivation of the\nvelocity gradient tensor and of parameters describing the local flow topology.\nStirring properties are affected not only through vorticity production and jump\nof strain intensity at the interface, but also through rotation of strain\nprincipal axes resulting from anisotropy of pressure Hessian. The strain\npersistence parameter, which measures the respective effects of strain and\neffective rotation (vorticity plus rotation rate of strain basis), reveals a\ncomplex structure. In particular, for large values of the density ratio it\nindicates dominating effective rotation in a restricted area past the\ninterface. Information on flow structure derived from the Okubo-Weiss\nparameter, by contrast, is less detailed. The influence of the density step on\nstirring properties is assessed through the Lagrangian evolution of the\ngradient of a passive scalar. Even for a moderate density ratio, alignment of\nthe scalar gradient and growth rate of its norm are deeply altered. Past the\ninterface effective rotation indeed drives the scalar gradient to align with a\ndirection determined by the local strain persistence parameter, away from the\ncompressional strain direction. The jump of strain intensity at the interface,\nhowever, opposes the lessening effect of the latter mechanism on the growth\nrate of the scalar gradient norm and promotes the rise of the gradient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 13:12:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

In one-dimension, meshes are typically specified\nusing the arclength mesh density function. This choice is well-justified for\npiecewise polynomial interpolants, but it is only justified for spectral\nmethods when model solutions include localised steep gradients. In this paper,\none-dimensional mesh density functions are presented which are based on a\nspatially localised measure of the bandwidth of the approximated model\nsolution. In considering bandwidth, these mesh density functions are\nwell-justified for spectral methods, but are not strictly tied to the error\nproperties of any particular spatial interpolant, and are hence widely\napplicable. The bandwidth mesh density functions are demonstrated by applying\nperiodic spectral and finite-difference moving mesh methods to a number of\nmodel problems in acoustics. These problems include a heterogeneous advection\nequation, the viscous Burgers' equation, and the Korteweg-de Vries equation.\nSimulation results demonstrate solution convergence rates that are up to an\norder of magnitude faster using the bandwidth mesh density functions than\nuniform meshes, and around three times faster than those using the arclength\nmesh density function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 13:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

Beginning with an\noverview of the basic concepts of cosmology, it is observed that though a\ndeterminant of local curvature, Einstein's equations of relativity do not\nconstrain the global properties of space-time. The topological requirements of\na universal space time manifold are discussed, including requirements of\nspace-time orientability and causality. The basic topological concepts used in\nclassification of spaces, i.e. the concept of the Fundamental Domain and\nUniversal covering spaces are discussed briefly. The manifold properties and\nsymmetry groups for three dimensional manifolds of constant curvature for\nnegative, positive and zero curvature manifolds are laid out.\nMulti-connectedness is explored as a possible explanation for the detected\nanomalies in the quadrupole and octopole regions of the power spectrum,\npointing at a possible compactness along one or more directions in space. The\nstatistical significance of the evidence, however, is also scrutinized and I\ndiscuss briefly the bayesian and frequentist interpretation of the posterior\nprobabilities of observing the anomalies in a Lambda CDM universe. Some of the\nmajor topologies that have been proposed and investigated as possible\ncandidates of a universal manifold are the Poincare Dodecahedron and Bianchi\nUniverses, which are studied in detail. Lastly, the methods that have been\nproposed for detecting a multi connected signature are discussed.

Here the qubit is coupled to a\nthermal bath through a tunable harmonic oscillator. On-demand initialization is\nachieved by sweeping the oscillator rapidly into resonance with the qubit. This\nresonant coupling with the engineered environment induces fast relaxation to\nthe ground state of the system, and a consecutive rapid sweep back to off\nresonance guarantees weak excess dissipation during quantum computations. We\nsolve the corresponding quantum dynamics using a Markovian master equation for\nthe reduced density operator of the qubit-bath system. This allows us to\noptimize the parameters and the initialization protocol for the qubit. Our\nanalytical calculations show that the ground-state occupation of our system is\nwell protected during the fast sweeps of the environmental coupling and,\nconsequently, we obtain an estimate for the duration of our protocol by solving\nthe transition rates between the low-energy eigenstates with the Jacobian\ndiagonalization method.

Energy\ndecay is usually described as a system leaking energy irreversibly into an\nenvironmental bath.

As the energy of a\nvibrational mode freely decays, the rate of energy decay switches abruptly to a\nlower value. This finding can be explained by a model where the measured mode\nhybridizes with other modes of the resonator at high energy. Below a threshold\nenergy, modes are decoupled, resulting in comparatively low decay rates and\ngiant quality factors exceeding 1 million.

This keeps the animal in the specific region of an\nobject that it encounters (hefting), and maintains the zero sum (coherence) of\nthe fractal, and connects the organism cyberneticly to objects that are sensed\nin its environment. The logic units evolve to store permanent memories, and add\nplus and minus pulse trains together into a single pulse train that allow the\nanimal to follow a moving object (imprinting). Additional logic units evolve\nthat allow the animal to heft using contacts with multiple objects that allow\nthe animal to return to its point of origin (reproductive migration) using\npermanent memories that are created when a pulse is not reset to zero.So,\ninformation is stored in multiple logic cells instead of a connection to one\nlogic cell, and is based upon spike timing rather than static (synaptic)\nconnections between cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 22:16:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 17:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-19"}

Our results\nindicate that MorphoNoCs can achieve latency improvements of up to 3.0x or\nenergy improvements of up to 1.37x over the base electronic network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 23:00:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2017 21:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-16"}

We explore the second-order\ncyclostationarity of the LTE SC-FDMA signals, and apply results obtained for\nthe cyclic autocorrelation function to signal detection. The proposed detection\nalgorithm provides a very good performance under various channel conditions,\nwith a short observation time and at low signal-to-noise ratios, with reduced\ncomplexity. The validity of the proposed algorithm is verified using signals\ngenerated and acquired by laboratory instrumentation, and the experimental\nresults show a good match with computer simulation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 22:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-24"}
