The\nnovelty of the game is that the game definition embeds a \\textit{coalition\nstructure formation mechanism}.

The paper defines a family of nested non-cooperative games\nparametrized by a size of a maximum coalition size. Every game in the family\nhas an equilibrium in mixed strategies. The equilibrium can generate more than\none coalition and encompasses intra and inter group externalities, what makes\nit different from the Shapley value.

One of the crucial problems in multi-layered\nsocial network analysis is community extraction. To cope with this problem the\nCLECC measure (Cross Layered Edge Clustering Coefficient) was proposed in the\nthesis. It is an edge measure which expresses how much the neighbors of two\ngiven users are similar each other. Based on this measure the CLECC algorithm\nfor community extraction in the multi-layered social networks was designed. The\nalgorithm was tested on the real single-layered social networks (SSN) and\nmulti-layered social networks (MSN), as well as on benchmark networks from GN\nBenchmark (SSN), LFR Benchmark (SSN) and mLFR Benchmark (MSN) a special\nextension of LFR Benchmark, designed as a part of this thesis, which is able to\nproduce multi-layered benchmark networks. The second research problem\nconsidered in the thesis was group evolution discovery. Studies on this problem\nhave led to the development of the inclusion measure and the Group Evolution\nDiscovery (GED) method, which is designed to identify events between two groups\nin successive time frames in the social network. The method was tested on a\nreal social network and compared with two well-known algorithms regarding\naccuracy, execution time, flexibility and ease of implementation. Finally, a\nnew approach to prediction of group evolution in the social network was\ndeveloped. The new approach involves usage of the outputs of the GED method. It\nis shown, that using even a simple sequence, which consists of several\npreceding groups sizes and events, as an input for the classifier, the learned\nmodel can produce very good results also for simple classifiers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2016 19:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-08"}

After applying uniaxial pressure to the sample in\nsitu, both the magnitude and field position of the QTM steps changed. The step\nmagnitudes were observed to grow as a function of pressure in both arrangements\nof pressure, while pressure applied along (perpendicular to) the sample's easy\naxis caused the resonant-tunneling fields to increase (decrease).

The two main mechanisms resulting in\nthe eruption of series of CMEs are sympathetic eruptions and homologous\neruptions. The interaction of successive CMEs has been observed remotely in\ncoronagraphs and heliospheric imagers, and inferred from in situ measurements.\nIt is associated with magnetic reconnection, momentum exchange, the propagation\nof a fast magnetosonic shock through a magnetic ejecta and changes in CME\nexpansion. The presence of a CME a few hours before a fast eruption is\nconnected with higher fluxes of SEPs, while CME-CME interaction occurring in\nthe corona is often associated with unusual radio bursts. Higher suprathermal\npopulation, enhanced turbulence and wave activity, stronger shocks, and\nshock-shock or shock-CME interaction have been proposed as physical mechanisms\nto explain these SEP events. When measured in situ, CME-CME interaction may be\nassociated with relatively well organized multiple-magnetic cloud events,\ninstances of shocks propagating through a previous magnetic ejecta or more\ncomplex ejecta. The compression of a CME by another and the propagation of a\nshock inside a magnetic ejecta can lead to extreme values of the southward\nmagnetic field, sometimes associated with large values of the dynamic pressure.\nThis can result in intense geomagnetic storms, but also trigger substorms and\nlarge earthward motions of the magnetopause, potentially associated with\nchanges in the outer radiation belts.

In addition, Neumann boundary-value problem of FDE\nposes significant challenges, partly due to the fact that different forms of\nFDE and different types of Neumann boundary condition have been proposed in the\nliterature depending on different applications.\n  We conduct preliminary mathematical analysis of the wellposedness of\ndifferent Neumann boundary-value problems of the FDEs. We prove that five out\nof the nine combinations of three different forms of FDEs that are closed by\nthree types of Neumann boundary conditions are well posed and the remaining\nfour do not admit a solution. In particular, for each form of the FDE there is\nat least one type of Neumann boundary condition such that the corresponding\nboundary-value problem is well posed, but there is also at least one type of\nNeumann boundary condition such that the corresponding boundary-value problem\nis ill posed. This fully demonstrates the subtlety of the study of FDE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2016 21:13:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-09"}

Nonlinear\ninteractions between the dominant ${\\bf z}_{+}$ waves and minority ${\\bf\nz}_{-}$ waves have the potential to transfer wave energy either to smaller\nperpendicular scales (\"direct cascade\") or to larger scales (\"inverse\ncascade\"). In this paper we use reduced magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations\nto investigate how the cascade rates $\\epsilon_{\\pm}$ depend on perpendicular\nwavenumber and radial distance from Sun center. For models with a smooth\nbackground atmosphere we find that an inverse cascade ($\\epsilon_{+} < 0$)\noccurs for the dominant waves at radii between 1.4 and 2.5 $R_\\odot$ and\ndimensionless wavenumbers in the inertial range ($15 < a_\\perp < 44$), and a\ndirect cascade ($\\epsilon_{+} > 0$) occurs elsewhere. For a model with density\nfluctuations there are multiple regions with inverse cascade. In both cases the\ncascade rate $\\epsilon_{+}$ varies significantly with perpendicular wavenumber,\nindicating that the cacsade is a highly non-local process. As a result of the\ninverse cascades, the enery dissipation rates are much lower than expected from\na phenomenological model, and are insufficient to maintain the temperature of\nthe background atmosphere. We conclude that RMHD models are unable to reproduce\nthe observed properties of the fast solar wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 01:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

But what\nmakes two images similar? Most existing work on visual similarity assumes that\nimages are similar because they contain the same object instance or category.\nHowever, the reason why images are similar is much more complex. For example,\nfrom the perspective of category, a black dog image is similar to a white dog\nimage. However, in terms of color, a black dog image is more similar to a black\nhorse image than the white dog image. This example serves to illustrate that\nvisual similarity is ambiguous but can be made precise when given an explicit\ncontextual perspective. Based on this observation, we propose the concept of\ncontextual visual similarity. To be concrete, we examine the concept of\ncontextual visual similarity in the application domain of image search. Instead\nof providing only a single image for image similarity search (\\eg, Google image\nsearch), we require three images. Given a query image, a second positive image\nand a third negative image, dissimilar to the first two images, we define a\ncontextualized similarity search criteria. In particular, we learn feature\nweights over all the feature dimensions of each image such that the distance\nbetween the query image and the positive image is small and their distances to\nthe negative image are large after reweighting their features. The learned\nfeature weights encode the contextualized visual similarity specified by the\nuser and can be used for attribute specific image search.

Using fluxes measured in four filters in UVIT's Far-UV (FUV) channel,\nand two filters in the near-UV (NUV) channel, we have constructed the spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) of the star WOCS-5885, after combining with flux\nmeasurements from GALEX, UIT, UVOT, SPITZER, WISE and several ground-based\nfacilities. The resulting SED spans a wavelength range of 0.15~${\\mu}$m to\n7.8~${\\mu}$m. This object is found to be one of the brightest FUV sources in\nthe cluster. An analysis of the SED reveals the presence of two components. The\ncooler component is found to have a temperature of 6,000$\\pm$150~K, confirming\nthat it is a BSS.

Some deep hashing methods have achieved promising results by taking\nadvantage of the strong representation power of deep networks recently.\nHowever, existing deep hashing methods treat all hash bits equally. On one\nhand, a large number of images share the same distance to a query image due to\nthe discrete Hamming distance, which raises a critical issue of image retrieval\nwhere fine-grained rankings are very important. On the other hand, different\nhash bits actually contribute to the image retrieval differently, and treating\nthem equally greatly affects the retrieval accuracy of image. To address the\nabove two problems, we propose the query-adaptive deep weighted hashing (QaDWH)\napproach, which can perform fine-grained ranking for different queries by\nweighted Hamming distance. First, a novel deep hashing network is proposed to\nlearn the hash codes and corresponding class-wise weights jointly, so that the\nlearned weights can reflect the importance of different hash bits for different\nimage classes. Second, a query-adaptive image retrieval method is proposed,\nwhich rapidly generates hash bit weights for different query images by fusing\nits semantic probability and the learned class-wise weights. Fine-grained image\nretrieval is then performed by the weighted Hamming distance, which can provide\nmore accurate ranking than the traditional Hamming distance. Experiments on\nfour widely used datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms eight\nstate-of-the-art hashing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 06:20:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 02:40:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

However, fortunes of Calcutta University quickly got\nintertwined with India's freedom struggle led by Mahatma Gandhi exactly at the\nsame time and the physics group got tragically disrupted.

This paper discusses the difficulties\nin reconstructing a critical history of this Calcutta school of physics during\nthe very short epoch of unmatched brilliance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 07:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

Nevertheless to increase the capability for high precision\nastrometric measurements at low radio frequencies (<8GHz) an effective\ncalibration strategy of the systematic ionospheric propagation effects that is\nwidely applicable is required. Observations at low frequencies are dominated by\ndistinct direction dependent ionospheric propagation errors, which place a very\ntight limit on the angular separation of a suitable phase referencing\ncalibrator.\n  The MultiView technique holds the key to the compensation of atmospheric\nspatial-structure errors, by using observations of multiple calibrators and 2-D\ninterpolation. In this paper we present the first demonstration of the power of\nMultiView using three calibrators, several degrees from the target, along with\na comparative study of the astrometric accuracy between MultiView and\nphase-referencing techniques.\n  MultiView calibration provides an order of magnitude improvement in\nastrometry with respect to conventional phase referencing, achieving ca. 100\nmicro-arcseconds astrometry errors in a single epoch of observations,\neffectively reaching the thermal noise limit.\n  MultiView will achieve its full potential with the enhanced sensitivity and\nmultibeam capabilities of SKA and the pathfinders, which will enable\nsimultaneous observations of the target and calibrators.

The method is to integrate\nsimultaneously the rotation and the position of the planet as well as its\ndeformation.

With this study, we generalize preexisting models to the\nspatial case and to arbitrary multipole orders using a formalism taken from\nquantum theory.

Gait rehabilitative therapy has been widely adopted to help\npatients maximize community participation and living independence. To further\nimprove the precision and efficiency of rehabilitative therapy, more objective\nmethods need to be developed based on sensory data. In this paper, an\nalgorithmic framework is proposed to provide classification of gait disorders\ncaused by two common neurological diseases, stroke and Parkinson's Disease\n(PD), from ground contact force (GCF) data. An advanced machine learning\nmethod, multi-task feature learning (MTFL), is used to jointly train\nclassification models of a subject's gait in three classes, post-stroke, PD and\nhealthy gait. Gait parameters related to mobility, balance, strength and rhythm\nare used as features for the classification. Out of all the features used, the\nMTFL models capture the more important ones per disease, which will help\nprovide better objective assessment and therapy progress tracking. To evaluate\nthe proposed methodology we use data from a human participant study, which\nincludes five PD patients, three post-stroke patients, and three healthy\nsubjects. Despite the diversity of abnormalities, the evaluation shows that the\nproposed approach can successfully distinguish post-stroke and PD gait from\nhealthy gait, as well as post-stroke from PD gait, with Area Under the Curve\n(AUC) score of at least 0.96. Moreover, the methodology helps select important\ngait features to better understand the key characteristics that distinguish\nabnormal gaits and design personalized treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 08:43:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 03:50:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 03:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-02"}

Moreover, we show that $O(\\log n\n/\\epsilon^2)$ random spanning trees are required in order to spectrally\napproximate a bounded degree graph. This result closes a previously open\nquestion on the number of random spanning trees required for saprsification.\nThird, we show that our random spanning trees based construction provides\nsecurity features for virtual networks, in the context of Software-Defined\nNetworking. Network virtualization coupled with Software-Defined Networking\nallows new on-demand management capabilities. We demonstrate such a service,\nnamely, on-demand efficient monitoring or anonymity. The proposed service is\nbased on network virtualization of expanders or sparsifiers over the physical\nnetwork. The defined virtual (or overlay) communication graphs coupled with a\nmulti-hop extension of Valiant randomization based routing lets us monitor the\nentire traffic in the network, with a very few monitoring nodes. We propose\nmethods that theoretically improve services provided by existing monitoring or\nanonymity networks, and optimize the degree of monitoring or anonymity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 09:17:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 19:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-16"}

The predominant solution is to estimate the\nblur kernel by adding a prior, but the extensive literature on the subject\nindicates the difficulty in identifying a prior which is suitably informative,\nand general. Rather than imposing a prior based on theory, we propose instead\nto learn one from the data. Learning a prior over the latent image would\nrequire modeling all possible image content. The critical observation\nunderpinning our approach is thus that learning the motion flow instead allows\nthe model to focus on the cause of the blur, irrespective of the image content.\nThis is a much easier learning task, but it also avoids the iterative process\nthrough which latent image priors are typically applied. Our approach directly\nestimates the motion flow from the blurred image through a fully-convolutional\ndeep neural network (FCN) and recovers the unblurred image from the estimated\nmotion flow. Our FCN is the first universal end-to-end mapping from the blurred\nimage to the dense motion flow. To train the FCN, we simulate motion flows to\ngenerate synthetic blurred-image-motion-flow pairs thus avoiding the need for\nhuman labeling. Extensive experiments on challenging realistic blurred images\ndemonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 10:05:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-09"}

They can be described\nphenomenologically using nonlinear stochastic differential equations, which\nconstitute the grounds for output-only model-based system identification. It\nhas been shown recently that one can extract the governing parameters of the\ninstabilities, namely the linear growth rate and the nonlinear component of the\nthermoacoustic feedback, using dynamic pressure time series only. This is\nhighly relevant for practical systems, which cannot be actively controlled due\nto a lack of cost-effective actuators. The thermoacoustic stability is given by\nthe linear growth rate, which results from the combination of the acoustic\ndamping and the coherent feedback from the flame. In this paper, it is shown\nthat it is possible to quantify the acoustic damping of the system, and thus to\nseparate its contribution to the linear growth rate from the one of the flame.\nThis is achieved by post-processing in a simple way simultaneously acquired\nchemiluminescence and acoustic pressure data.

This\nstar belongs to the group of weak G-band stars that present very strong carbon\ndeficiency in their photospheres. The paper is a part of a global investigation\ninto the properties and origin of magnetic fields in cool giants.\n  We use spectropolarimetric data, which allows the simultaneous measurement of\nthe longitudinal magnetic field $B_{l}$, line activity indicators (H$\\alpha$,\nCa\\,{\\sc ii} IRT, S-index) and radial velocity of the star, and consequently\nperform a direct comparison of their time variability. Mean Stokes V profiles\nare extracted using the least squares deconvolution (LSD) method. One map of\nthe surface magnetic field of the star is reconstructed via the Zeeman Doppler\nimaging (ZDI) inversion technique.\n  A periodogram analysis is performed on our dataset and it reveals a rotation\nperiod of 111 days. We interpret this period to be the rotation period of 37\nCom. The reconstructed magnetic map reveals that the structure of the surface\nmagnetic field is complex and features a significant toroidal component. The\ntime variability of the line activity indicators, radial velocity and magnetic\nfield $B_{l}$ indicates a possible evolution of the surface magnetic structures\nin the period from 2008 to 2011. For completeness of our study, we use\ncustomized stellar evolutionary models suited to a weak G-band star. Synthetic\nspectra are also calculated to confirm the peculiar abundance of 37 Com.\n  We deduce that 37 Com is a 6.5~$M_{\\odot}$ weak G-band star located in the\nHertzsprung gap, whose magnetic activity is probably due to dynamo action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 14:39:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) typically display periodic and\nregular peaks in the light curves during the flare emissions. Sometimes, QPPs\nshow multiple periods at the same wavelength. However, changing periods in\nvarious channels are rare. Aims. We report QPPs in a solar flare on 2014\nOctober 27. They showed a period change that depended on whether thermal or\nnonthermal components were included. The flare was simultaneously observed by\nmany instruments. Methods. Using the fast Fourier transform (FFT), we\ndecomposed the light curves at multiple wavelengths into slowly varying and\nrapidly varying signals. Then we identified the QPPs as the regular and\nperiodic peaks from the rapidly varying signals. The periods are derived with\nthe wavelet method and confirmed based on the FFT spectra of the rapidly\nvarying signals. Results. We find a period of 50 s from the thermal emissions\nduring the impulsive phase of the flare, that is, in the soft X-ray bands. At\nthe same time, a period of about 100 s is detected from the nonthermal\nemissions, such as hard X-ray and microwave channels. The period ratio is\nexactly 2.0, which might be due to the modulations of the magnetic reconnection\nrate by the fundamental and harmonic modes of magnetohydrodynamic waves. Our\nresults further show that the 100 s period is present over a broad wavelength,\nsuch as hard X-rays, extreme-UV/UV, and microwave emissions, indicating the\nperiodic magnetic reconnection in this flare. Conclusions. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first report about period changes from thermal to nonthermal\ncomponents in a single flare that occur at almost the same time. This new\nobservational finding could be a challenge to the theory of flare QPPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 15:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

Instead of the simplistic\n$K$-prescription, our n-body simulations adopt the damping formulae for\neccentricity and inclination provided by the hydrodynamical simulations of our\ncompanion paper. We follow the evolution of $11000$ numerical experiments of\nthree giant planets in the late stage of the gas disc, exploring different\ninitial configurations, planetary mass ratios and disc masses. The dynamical\nevolutions of the planetary systems are studied along the simulations, with\nemphasis on the resonance captures and inclination-growth mechanisms. Most of\nthe systems are found with small inclinations ($\\le10^{\\circ}$) at the\ndispersal of the disc. Even though many systems enter an inclination-type\nresonance during the migration, the disc usually damps the inclinations on a\nshort timescale. Although the majority of the multiple systems in our results\nare quasi-coplanar, $\\sim5\\%$ of them end up with high mutual inclinations\n($\\ge10^{\\circ}$). Half of these highly mutually inclined systems result from\ntwo- or three-body MMR captures, the other half being produced by orbital\ninstability and/or planet-planet scattering. When considering the long-term\nevolution over $100$ Myr, destabilization of the resonant systems is common,\nand the percentage of highly mutually inclined systems still evolving in\nresonance drops to $30\\%$. Finally, the parameters of the final system\nconfigurations are in very good agreement with the semi-major axis and\neccentricity distributions in the observations, showing that planet-planet\ninteractions during the disc phase could have played an important role in\nsculpting planetary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 15:19:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-09"}

In the recent years,\nmany methods and algorithms have been proposed; still, a definitive solution is\nfar from being found. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on fuzzy\nlogic. The proposed method combines in a novel way three features for\nsegmenting touching characters that have been already proposed in other studies\nbut have been exploited only singularly so far. The proposed strategy is based\non a 3--input/1--output fuzzy inference system with fuzzy rules specifically\noptimized for segmenting touching characters in the case of Latin printed and\nhandwritten characters. The system performances are illustrated and supported\nby numerical examples showing that our approach can achieve a reasonable good\noverall accuracy in segmenting characters even on tricky conditions of touching\ncharacters. Moreover, numerical results suggest that the method can be applied\nto many different datasets of characters by means of a convenient tuning of the\nfuzzy sets and rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 14:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-16"}
