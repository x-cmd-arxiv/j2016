Pot uses a new concurrency control protocol that\nexploits the serialization order to distinguish between fast and speculative\ntransaction execution modes in order to mitigate the overhead of imposing a\ndeterministic order.

We derive a system of partial differential equations of \"generalized\"\nform, involving contour averaging of a locally two-dimensional Euler flow. We\ndo not attempt here to solve the system exactly, but point out that\nnon-existence of physically acceptable solutions would most probably be a\nresult of the axial flow. Because of the axial flow the vorticity distribution\nwithin the dipole eddies is no longer of the simple Sadovskii type (vorticity\nconstant over a cross-section) obtained in the axisymmetric problem. Thus the\nsolution of the system depends upon the existence of a larger class of\npropagating two-dimensional dipoles.\n  The hairpin model is obtained by formal asymptotic analysis.

To reduce the absolute cost of the method also in the\nnon-asymptotic regime, it is equally important to choose the best possible\nnumerical timestepping method on each level. To investigate this, we also\ncompare the standard symplectic Euler method, which is used in many operational\nmodels, with two improved timestepping algorithms based on SDE splitting\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 17:32:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 09:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-21"}

This problem is motivated by and generalized from\napplications in enterprise security and attack scenario reconstruction. While\nexisting techniques focus on either reconstructing abnormal scenarios or\nfiltering out false positive alerts, it can be more advantageous to consider\nthe two perspectives simultaneously in order to improve detection accuracy and\nbetter understand anomaly behaviors. In this paper, we propose CAR, a\ncollaborative alerts ranking framework that exploits both temporal and content\ncorrelations from heterogeneous categorical alerts. CAR first builds a\ntree-based model to capture both short-term correlations and long-term\ndependencies in each alert sequence, which identifies abnormal action\nsequences. Then, an embedding-based model is employed to learn the content\ncorrelations between alerts via their heterogeneous categorical attributes.\nFinally, by incorporating both temporal and content dependencies into one\noptimization framework, CAR ranks both alerts and their corresponding alert\npatterns. Our experiments, using real-world enterprise monitoring data and real\nattacks launched by professional hackers, show that CAR can accurately identify\ntrue positive alerts and successfully reconstruct attack scenarios at the same\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 18:18:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2018 21:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-15"}

Contrary to the\ncase of Q-balls, there is no evident conserved charge that stabilizes the\nlocalized configuration. Nevertheless, in many classical numerical simulations,\nit has been shown that they are extremely long-lived. In this paper, we clarify\nthe reason for the longevity, and show how the exponential separation of time\nscales emerges dynamically. Those solutions are time-periodic with a typical\nfrequency of a mass scale of a scalar field. This observation implies that they\ncan be understood by the effective theory after integrating out relativistic\nmodes. We find that the resulting effective theory has an approximate global\nU(1) symmetry reflecting an approximate number conservation in the\nnon-relativistic regime. As a result, the profile of those solutions is\nobtained via the bounce method, just like Q-balls, as long as the breaking of\nthe U(1) symmetry is small enough. We then discuss the decay processes of the\nI-ball/oscillon by the breaking of the U(1) symmetry, namely the production of\nrelativistic modes via number violating processes. We show that the imaginary\npart is exponentially suppressed, which explains the extraordinary longevity of\nI-ball/oscillon. In addition, we find that there are some attractor behaviors\nduring the evolution of I-ball/oscillon that further enhance the lifetime.

We consider a de Sitter space with real\nprojective space $\\mathbb{R}\\text{P}^3$ spatial sections, as was originally\nunderstood by de Sitter himself. This original version of de Sitter space has\nseveral advantages over the usual de Sitter space with $\\text{S}^3$ spatial\nsections.

Here,\nwe apply a recently-developed hypergraph approach that treats network\nconnections (edges) rather than brain regions as the unit of interest, allowing\nus to describe functional network topology from a fundamentally different\nperspective. Capitalizing on a sample of 780 youth imaged as part of the\nPhiladelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, this hypergraph representation of\nresting-state functional MRI data reveals three distinct classes of\nsub-networks (hyperedges): clusters, bridges, and stars, which represent\nspatially distributed, bipartite, and focal architectures, respectively.\nCluster hyperedges show a strong resemblance to the functional modules of the\nbrain including somatomotor, visual, default mode, and salience systems. In\ncontrast, star hyperedges represent highly localized subnetworks centered on a\nsmall set of regions, and are distributed across the entire cortex. Finally,\nbridge hyperedges link clusters and stars in a core-periphery organization.\nNotably, developmental changes within hyperedges are ordered in a similar\ncore-periphery fashion, with the greatest developmental effects occurring in\nnetworked hyperedges within the functional core. Taken together, these results\nemphasize that the network organization of human brain emerges across multiple\nscales and evolves substantially through the adolescent period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 20:06:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2016 03:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-26"}

In the case of a Weyl semimetal this phase transition is particularly\nunusual because it involves the creation of bulk chiral charges and the\nnucleation of topological Fermi arcs. Here we image a topological phase\ntransition to a Weyl semimetal in Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ with changing\ncomposition $x$.

In a first reaction, the anti-protons from\nthe ELENA ring at CERN will capture a positron from a positronium target\nproducing anti-hydrogen atoms. Those interacting in the same positronium target\nwill produce in a second step anti-hydrogen ions. This results in a dependence\nfor the anti-ions production rate which is roughly proportional to the\npositronium density squared. We present a scheme to increase the anti-ions\nproduction rate in the GBAR experiment by tailoring the anti-proton to the\npositron pulse in order to maximise the temporal overlap of Ps and\nanti-protons. Detailed simulations show that an order of magnitude could be\ngained by bunching the anti-protons from ELENA.

Current work to address this Internet\ntransport ossification has led to renewed interest in UDP as an encapsulation\nfor making novel transport protocols deployable in the Internet. Examples\ninclude Google's QUIC and the WebRTC data channel. The common assumption made\nby these approaches is that encapsulation over UDP works in the present\nInternet. This paper presents a measurement study to examine this assumption,\nand provides guidance for protocol design based on our measurements.\n  The key question is \"can we run new transport protocols for the Internet over\nUDP?\" We find that the answer is largely \"yes\": UDP works on most networks, and\nimpairments are generally confined to access networks. This allows relatively\nsimple fallback strategies to work around it. Our answer is based on a twofold\nmethodology. First, we use the RIPE Atlas platform to basically check UDP\nconnectivity and first-packet latency. Second, we deploy copycat, a new tool\nfor comparing TCP loss, latency, and throughput with UDP by generating\nTCP-shaped traffic with UDP headers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 21:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-26"}

Besides predicting the text's category very\naccurately, it is also highly desirable to understand how and why the\ncategorization process takes place.

We train two word-based ML models, a convolutional neural network\n(CNN) and a bag-of-words SVM classifier, on a topic categorization task and\nadapt the LRP method to decompose the predictions of these models onto words.\nResulting scores indicate how much individual words contribute to the overall\nclassification decision.

Based on these\ndocument vectors, we introduce a measure of model explanatory power and show\nthat, although the SVM and CNN models perform similarly in terms of\nclassification accuracy, the latter exhibits a higher level of explainability\nwhich makes it more comprehensible for humans and potentially more useful for\nother applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2016 00:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

Hence, recovering the system\ndynamics from experimentally observed neuronal time series, like multiple\nsingle-unit (MSU) recordings or neuroimaging data, is an important step toward\nunderstanding its computations. Ideally, one would not only seek a state space\nrepresentation of the dynamics, but would wish to have access to its governing\nequations for in-depth analysis. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a\ncomputationally powerful and dynamically universal formal framework which has\nbeen extensively studied from both the computational and the dynamical systems\nperspective. Here we develop a semi-analytical maximum-likelihood estimation\nscheme for piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) within the statistical framework of\nstate space models, which accounts for noise in both the underlying latent\ndynamics and the observation process. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is\nused to infer the latent state distribution, through a global Laplace\napproximation, and the PLRNN parameters iteratively. After validating the\nprocedure on toy examples, the approach is applied to MSU recordings from the\nrodent anterior cingulate cortex obtained during performance of a classical\nworking memory task, delayed alternation. A model with 5 states turned out to\nbe sufficient to capture the essential computational dynamics underlying task\nperformance, including stimulus-selective delay activity. The estimated models\nwere rarely multi-stable, but rather were tuned to exhibit slow dynamics in the\nvicinity of a bifurcation point. In summary, the present work advances a\nsemi-analytical (thus reasonably fast) maximum-likelihood estimation framework\nfor PLRNNs that may enable to recover the relevant dynamics underlying observed\nneuronal time series, and directly link them to computational properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2016 01:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

The mechanism exploits local\nnonadiabatic effects at a conical intersection, turning them from a decoherence\nsource into an asset. The conical intersection is a consequence of the exciton\npulses moving along a linear Rydberg chain and approaching an additional\nlinear, perpendicularly aligned Rydberg chain.

This\ninformation is important when synthesizing images of different virtual camera\nviewpoints via depth-image-based rendering (DIBR). It has been shown that depth\nimages can be efficiently coded using contour-adaptive codecs that preserve\nedge sharpness, resulting in visually pleasing DIBR-synthesized images.\nHowever, contours are typically losslessly coded as side information (SI),\nwhich is expensive if the object shapes are complex.\n  In this paper, we pursue a new paradigm in depth image coding for\ncolor-plus-depth representation of a 3D scene: we pro-actively simplify object\nshapes in a depth and color image pair to reduce depth coding cost, at a\npenalty of a slight increase in synthesized view distortion. Specifically, we\nfirst mathematically derive a distortion upper-bound proxy for 3DSwIM---a\nquality metric tailored for DIBR-synthesized images. This proxy reduces\ninterdependency among pixel rows in a block to ease optimization.

The formation of a\nDCBH requires a strong external radiation field to suppress $\\rm H_2$ formation\nand cooling in a collapsing gas cloud. Such strong field is not easily achieved\nby first stars or normal star-forming galaxies. Here we investigate a scenario\nin which the previously-formed DCBH can provide the necessary radiation field\nfor the formation of additional ones. Using one-zone model and the simulated\nDCBH Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) filtered through absorbing gas\ninitially having column density $N_{\\rm H}$, we derive the critical field\nintensity, $J_{\\rm LW}^{\\rm crit}$, to suppress $\\rm H_2$ formation and\ncooling.

We study two\nfundamental analysis problems. The soundness problem consists in deciding if it\nis always possible for a negotiation to terminate successfully, whatever the\ncurrent state is. Given a sound negotiation, the summarization problem aims at\ncomputing an equivalent one-step negotiation with the same input/output\nbehavior. The soundness and summarization problems can be solved by means of\nsimple algorithms acting on the state space of the negotiation, which however\nface the well-known state explosion problem. We study alternative algorithms\nthat avoid the construction of the state space. In particular, we define\nreduction rules that simplify a negotiation while preserving the\nsound/non-sound character of the negotiation and its summary. In a first result\nwe show that our rules are complete for the class of weakly deterministic\nacyclic negotiations, meaning that they reduce all sound negotiations in this\nclass, and only them, to equivalent one-step negotiations. This provides\nalgorithms for both the soundness and summarization problems that avoid the\nconstruction of the state space. We then study the class of deterministic\nnegotiations. Our second main result shows that the rules are also complete for\nthis class, even if the negotiation contains cycles. Moreover, we present an\nalgorithm that completely reduces all sound deterministic negotiations, and\nonly them, in polynomial time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2016 09:33:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-26"}

We apply the\neffective field theory so obtained to address calculations in a hot medium\nwhich models the early stages of the universe evolution. In particular, we\napply it to the case of a heavy Majorana neutrino decaying in a hot plasma of\nStandard Model particles, whose temperature is much smaller than the mass of\nthe Majorana neutrino but still much larger than the electroweak scale, and the\nderivation of the neutrino thermal width is revisited in an EFT fashion.\nAssuming the same hierarchy between heavy neutrino masses and the temperature,\nwe compute systematically thermal corrections to the direct and indirect CP\nasymmetries in the Majorana neutrino decays.

In QDA, a separate covariance\nmatrix is estimated for each group. If there are more variables than\nobservations in the groups, the usual estimates are singular and cannot be used\nanymore. Assuming homoscedasticity, as in LDA, reduces the number of parameters\nto estimate. This rather strong assumption is however rarely verified in\npractice. Regularized discriminant techniques that are computable in\nhigh-dimension and cover the path between the two extremes QDA and LDA have\nbeen proposed in the literature. However, these procedures rely on sample\ncovariance matrices. As such, they become inappropriate in presence of cellwise\noutliers, a type of outliers that is very likely to occur in high-dimensional\ndatasets. In this paper, we propose cellwise robust counterparts of these\nregularized discriminant techniques by inserting cellwise robust covariance\nmatrices. Our methodology results in a family of discriminant methods that (i)\nare robust against outlying cells, (ii) cover the gap between LDA and QDA and\n(iii) are computable in high-dimension. The good performance of the new methods\nis illustrated through simulated and real data examples.

This motivates a natural comparison between,\non the one hand, adiabatic preparation of steady states of Lindbladian\ngenerators and, on the other hand, relaxation towards the same steady states\nsubject to the final Lindbladian of the adiabatic process. In this work we thus\nadopt the perspective that the goal is the most efficient possible preparation\nof such steady states, rather than ground states. Using known rigorous bounds\nfor the open-system adiabatic theorem and for mixing times, we are then led to\na disturbing conclusion that at first appears to doom efforts to build physical\nquantum annealers: relaxation seems to always converge faster than adiabatic\npreparation. However, by carefully estimating the adiabatic preparation time\nfor Lindbladians describing thermalization in the low temperature limit, we\nshow that there is, after all, room for an adiabatic speedup over relaxation.\nTo test the analytically derived bounds for the adiabatic preparation time and\nthe relaxation time, we numerically study three models: a dissipative\nquasi-free fermionic chain, a single qubit coupled to a thermal bath, and the\n\"spike\" problem of $n$ qubits coupled to a thermal bath. Via these models we\nfind that the answer to the \"which wins\" question depends for each model on the\ntemperature and the system-bath coupling strength. In the case of the \"spike\"\nproblem we find that relaxation during the adiabatic evolution plays an\nimportant role in ensuring a speedup over the final-time relaxation procedure.\nThus, relaxation-assisted adiabatic preparation can be more efficient than both\npure adiabatic evolution and pure relaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2016 14:19:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2017 17:52:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

We present newly acquired laboratory measurements of\nsilicate compounds taken at the Soleil synchrotron facility in Paris using the\nLucia beamline. The dust absorption profiles resulting from this campaign were\nused in this pilot study to model the absorption by interstellar dust along the\nline of sight of the low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) GX 5-1. The measured\nlaboratory cross-sections were adapted for astrophysical data analysis and the\nresulting extinction profiles of the Si K-edge were implemented in the SPEX\nspectral fitting program. We derive the properties of the interstellar dust\nalong the line of sight by fitting the Si K-edge seen in absorption in the\nspectrum of GX 5-1. We measured the hydrogen column density towards GX 5-1 to\nbe $3.40\\pm0.1\\times10^{22} \\rm cm^{-2}$. The best fit of the silicon edge in\nthe spectrum of GX 5-1 is obtained by a mixture of olivine and pyroxene. In\nthis study, our modeling is limited to Si absorption by silicates with\ndifferent Mg:Fe ratios. We obtained an abundance of silicon in dust of\n$4.0\\pm0.3\\times10^{-5}$ per H atom and a lower limit for total abundance,\nconsidering both gas and dust, of $>4.4\\times10^{-5}$ per H atom, which leads\nto a gas to dust ratio of >0.22. Furthermore, an enhanced scattering feature in\nthe Si K-edge may suggest the presence of large particles along the line of\nsight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2016 14:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

How the stability of these oscillators is affected by the\nintrinsic noise of the interactions between the components and the stochastic\nexpression of their genes, has been studied in considerable detail. However, as\nall biological oscillators reside in growing and dividing cells, an important\nquestion is how these oscillators are perturbed by the cell cycle.

It allows for deep insight into the underlying\nphysics of polaron formation as well as for inclusion of many physical\nconstraints, such as excluding crossing diagrams and double occupation\nconstraint, which are not included in the Self-Consistent Born Approximation.\nHere we examine the role and importance of such constraints by analyzing\nvarious spectral functions obtained in second order VA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2016 15:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-26"}

It was observed that the leading solutions employed convolutional\nnetworks and used the provided set of nodule candidates. The combination of\nthese solutions achieved an excellent sensitivity of over 95% at fewer than 1.0\nfalse positives per scan. This highlights the potential of combining algorithms\nto improve the detection performance.

The tensor product is linearly\nextended to act synchronously across the entire entangled system. When\nsimulating an entangled system, the conventional approach is possible and\npractical if both parts of the entangled system exist within the same physical\nsimulator. However, if we wish to simulate an entangled system across a\ndistributed network, sending half of the entangled pair to another simulator on\nanother computer system, the synchronous approach becomes difficult. In the\nfirst part of this paper, we demonstrate a method of simulating operations on\nentangled states in a distributed environment which is equivalent to the\nconventional approach. The advantage to our approach is that we can simulate\ndistributed quantum systems on physically distributed hardware. Such a system\nadvances the possibilities of demonstrating distributed quantum algorithms for\nresearch, teaching, and learning.\n  Further, the security of quantum key exchange depends on successfully\ndetecting the presence of an eavesdropper.

Hadronic matter is treated in the non-linear relativistic\nmean-field approximation, and quark matter is modeled by three-flavor local and\nnon-local Nambu$-$Jona-Lasinio (NJL) models with repulsive vector interactions.\nThe transition from hadronic to quark matter is constructed by considering\neither a soft phase transition (Gibbs construction) or a sharp phase transition\n(Maxwell construction). We find that high-mass neutron stars with masses up to\n$2.1-2.4 M_\\odot$ may contain a mixed phase with hadrons and quarks in their\ncores, if global charge conservation is imposed via the Gibbs conditions.\nHowever, if the Maxwell conditions is considered, the appearance of a pure\nquark matter core either destabilizes the star immediately (commonly for\nnon-local NJL models) or leads to a very short hybrid star branch in the\nmass-radius relation (generally for local NJL models).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2016 04:44:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

It seems natural\nto make a set of fundamental constants more consistent and more effective if\nused to build Planck units only limit values. To this end, in addition to the\nlimit values $\\hbar $ and $c$ we introduce an additional limit value - a\nmaximum power in nature.
