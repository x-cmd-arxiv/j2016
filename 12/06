We\nmodel the underlying hypothesis, which relates data points to labels, as a\ngraph signal, defined over some graph (network) structure intrinsic to the\ndataset. Following the key principle of supervised learning, i.e., similar\ninputs yield similar outputs, we require the graph signals induced by labels to\nhave small total variation. Accordingly, we formulate the problem of learning\nthe labels of data points as a non-smooth convex optimization problem which\namounts to balancing between the empirical loss, i.e., the discrepancy with\nsome partially available label information, and the smoothness quantified by\nthe total variation of the learned graph signal. We solve this optimization\nproblem by appealing to a recently proposed preconditioned variant of the\npopular primal-dual method by Pock and Chambolle, which results in a sparse\nlabel propagation algorithm. This learning algorithm allows for a highly\nscalable implementation as message passing over the underlying data graph. By\napplying concepts of compressed sensing to the learning problem, we are also\nable to provide a transparent sufficient condition on the underlying network\nstructure such that accurate learning of the labels is possible. We also\npresent an implementation of the message passing formulation allows for a\nhighly scalable implementation in big data frameworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 16:04:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 15:41:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 May 2017 16:57:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 07:53:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

We consider the\ncase of co-existing macrocell BS, small cell BSs, and private femtocell access\npoints (FAPs). Three different network scenarios are investigated, depending on\nthe status of the FAPs, i.e., HetNets without FAPs, HetNets with closed FAPs,\nand HetNets with semi-closed FAPs. A unified framework is proposed to\nsimultaneously allocate spectrum resources to users in an energy efficient\nmanner and switch off redundant small cell BSs. The high complexity dual\ndecomposition technique is employed to achieve optimal solutions for the\nproblem. A low complexity iterative algorithm is also proposed and its\nperformances are compared to those of the optimal technique. The particularly\ninteresting case of semi-closed FAPs, in which the FAPs accept to serve\nexternal users, achieves the highest energy efficiency due to increased degrees\nof freedom.

There exist quite a few works, which propose Trust\nMetrics to compute and predict trust scores between users based on their\ninteractions.

These problems are addressed here by (a) a field normalisation\nformula, the Mean Normalised Log-transformed Citation Score (MNLCS) that allows\nsimple confidence limits to be calculated and is similar to a proposal of\nLundberg, (b) field normalisation formulae for the proportion of cited articles\nin a set, the Equalised Mean-based Normalised Proportion Cited (EMNPC) and the\nMean-based Normalised Proportion Cited (MNPC), to deal with mostly uncited data\nsets, (c) a sampling strategy to minimise data collection costs, and (d) free\nunified software to gather the raw data, implement the sampling strategy, and\ncalculate the indicator formulae and confidence limits. The approach is\ndemonstrated (but not fully tested) by comparing the Scopus citations, Mendeley\nreaders and Wikipedia mentions of research funded by Wellcome, NIH, and MRC in\nthree large fields for 2013-2016. Within the results, statistically significant\ndifferences in both citation counts and Mendeley reader counts were found even\nfor sets of articles that were less than six months old. Mendeley reader counts\nwere more precise than Scopus citations for the most recent articles and all\nthree funders could be demonstrated to have an impact in Wikipedia that was\nsignificantly above the world average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 17:02:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 12:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-22"}

This formalism allows for the simultaneous resummation of\nlogarithmic contributions that are enhanced at small $Q_T$ and at partonic\nthreshold. We extend joint resummation to next-to-next-to leading logarithmic\naccuracy and we present resummed and matched results for three different\nphenomenological setups. In particular, we study the production of a $Z$ boson\nat the Tevatron and at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), as well as the\nproduction of a heavier $Z^\\prime$ at the LHC. We compare our findings to\nstandard $Q_T$ resummation, as well as to fixed-order perturbation theory. We\nfind that joint resummation provides a moderate (but not flat) correction with\nrespect to $Q_T$ resummation and it leads to a reduction of the scale\ndependence of the results. However, our study also shows some limitations of\nthis formalism. While the use of joint resummation for $Z$ production at the\nTevatron and $Z^\\prime$ production at the LHC appears to be justified, our\nimplementation suffers from a stronger dependence on power corrections for\nprocesses which are further away from threshold, such as $Z$ production at the\nLHC, for which we cannot claim an improvement over standard $Q_T$ resummation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 17:02:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 20:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-13"}

In this paper,\nwe envision a collaborative joint caching and processing strategy for on-demand\nvideo streaming in MEC networks. Our design aims at enhancing the widely used\nAdaptive BitRate (ABR) streaming technology, where multiple bitrate versions of\na video can be delivered so as to adapt to the heterogeneity of user\ncapabilities and the varying of network connection bandwidth. The proposed\nstrategy faces two main challenges: (i) not only the videos but their\nappropriate bitrate versions have to be effectively selected to store in the\ncaches, and (ii) the transcoding relationships among different versions need to\nbe taken into account to effectively utilize the processing capacity at the MEC\nservers. To this end, we formulate the collaborative joint caching and\nprocessing problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) that minimizes the\nbackhaul network cost, subject to the cache storage and processing capacity\nconstraints. Due to the NP-completeness of the problem and the impractical\noverheads of the existing offline approaches, we propose a novel online\nalgorithm that makes cache placement and video scheduling decisions upon the\narrival of each new request.

Yet, little is\nknown hitherto about the underlying mechanisms governing scientific creative\nprocesses, largely due to that a paper's references, at best, only partially\nreflect its authors' actual information consumption. This work represents an\ninitial step towards fine-grained understanding of creative processes in\nscientific enterprise. In specific, using two web-scale longitudinal datasets\n(120.1 million papers and 53.5 billion web requests spanning 4 years), we\ndirectly contrast authors' information consumption behaviors against their\nknowledge products. We find that, of 59.0\\% papers across all scientific\nfields, 25.7\\% of their creativity can be readily explained by information\nconsumed by their authors. Further, by leveraging these findings, we develop a\npredictive framework that accurately identifies the most critical knowledge to\nfostering target scientific innovations. We believe that our framework is of\nfundamental importance to the study of scientific creativity. It promotes\nstrategies to stimulate and potentially automate creative processes, and\nprovides insights towards more effective designs of information recommendation\nplatforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 17:44:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-06"}

We compute accurate\nlong-time numerical integrations of (about 2.5 million) non-interacting\ntest-particles initially located in the region between the orbits of Prometheus\nand Pandora, and address whether they escape or remain trapped in this region.\nWe obtain a wide region of initial conditions of the test particles that remain\nconfined. We consider a dynamical stability indicator for the test particles'\nmotion defined by computing the ratio of the standard deviation over the\naverage value of relevant dynamical quantities, in particular, for the\nmean-motion and the semi-major axis. This indicator separates clearly a subset\nof trapped initial conditions that appear as very localized stripes in the\ninitial semi-major axis and eccentricity space for the most stable orbits.\nRetaining only these test particles, we obtain a narrow eccentric ring which\ndisplays sharp edges and collective alignment.

How does biological tissue absorb\nelectromagnetic radiation? Astonishingly, we do not have a definite answer to\nthese simple questions because the microscopic processes governing the\nabsorption of electromagnetic waves by water are largely unclarified. This\nabsorption can be quantified by dielectric loss spectra, which reveal a huge\npeak at a frequency of the exciting electric field of about 20 GHz and a\ngradual tailing off towards higher frequencies. The microscopic interpretation\nof such spectra is highly controversial and various superpositions of\nrelaxation and resonance processes ascribed to single-molecule or\nmolecule-cluster motions have been proposed for their analysis. By combining\ndielectric, microwave, THz, and far-infrared spectroscopy, here we provide\nnearly continuous temperature-dependent broadband spectra of water. Moreover,\nwe find that corresponding spectra for aqueous solutions reveal the same\nfeatures as pure water. However, in contrast to the latter, crystallization in\nthese solutions can be avoided by supercooling. As different spectral\ncontributions tend to disentangle at low temperatures, this enables to\ndeconvolute them when approaching the glass transition under cooling. We find\nthat the overall spectral development, including the 20 GHz feature (employed\nfor microwave heating), closely resembles the behavior known for common\nsupercooled liquids. Thus, water's absorption of electromagnetic waves at room\ntemperature is not unusual but very similar to that of glass-forming liquids at\nelevated temperatures, deep in the low-viscosity liquid regime, and should be\ninterpreted along similar lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 18:07:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2017 15:57:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2017 11:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

Two scenarios are considered: (i) when the transmitter has\ncausal knowledge of the channel state (i.e., the state is visible), and (ii)\nwhen the channel state is unknown at the transmitter, but observations of it\nare available at the transmitter through feedback (i.e., the state is hidden).\nIn both scenarios, matching outer and inner bounds on the rates of\ncommunication are derived and the capacity region is determined. It is shown\nthat similar results carry over to channels with memory and delayed feedback\nand memoryless compound channels with feedback. When the state is visible, the\ncapacity region has a single-letter characterization and is in terms of a\nlinear program. Two optimal coding schemes are devised that use feedback to\nkeep track of the sent/received packets via a network of queues: a\nprobabilistic scheme and a deterministic backpressure-like algorithm. The\nformer bases its decisions solely on the past channel state information and the\nlatter follows a max-weight queue-based policy. The performance of the\nalgorithms are analyzed using the frameworks of rate stability in networks of\nqueues, max-flow min-cut duality in networks, and finite-horizon Lyapunov drift\nanalysis. When the state is hidden, the capacity region does not have a\nsingle-letter characterization and is, in this sense, uncomputable.\nApproximations of the capacity region are provided and two optimal coding\nalgorithms are outlined. The first algorithm is a probabilistic coding scheme\nthat bases its decisions on the past L acknowledgments and its achievable rate\nregion approaches the capacity region exponentially fast in L. The second\nalgorithm is a backpressure-like algorithm that performs optimally in the long\nrun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 19:19:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2017 15:03:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 2018 08:06:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-21"}

Multi-commodity multicast models a\nclassic information dissemination problem in networks where the primary\ncommunication constraint is the number of connections that a node can make, not\nlink bandwidth.\n  Multi-commodity multicast is closely related to the problem of finding a\nsubgraph, $H$, of optimal poise, where the poise is defined as the sum of the\nmaximum degree of $H$ and the maximum distance between any source-destination\npair in $H$. We first show that the minimum poise subgraph for single-commodity\nmulticast can be approximated to within a factor of $O(\\log k)$ with respect to\nthe value of a natural LP relaxation in an instance with $k$ terminals. This is\nthe first upper bound on the integrality gap of the natural LP.

This improves on the previous best bound of\n$O(n^{2}D^{2})$ and is also asymptotically tight.\n  The new bound leads to the following large deviation inequality for an\n$L$-Lipschitz function $g$ over an isotropic logconcave density $p$: for any\n$t>0$, \\[ Pr_{x\\sim p}\\left(\\left|g(x)-\\bar{g}\\right|\\geq L\\cdot\nt\\right)\\leq\\exp(-\\frac{c\\cdot t^{2}}{t+\\sqrt{n}}) \\] where $\\bar{g}$ is the\nmedian or mean of $g$ for $x\\sim p$; this generalizes and improves on previous\nbounds by Paouris and by Guedon-Milman. The technique also bounds the ``small\nball'' probability in terms of the Cheeger constant, and recovers the current\nbest bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 20:36:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 20:40:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 27 Jan 2019 04:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-29"}

The first\nnear-complete high-resolution disk survey in both dust and gas in a single\nstar-forming region has been carried out in Lupus, finding surprisingly low\ngas/dust ratios. The goal of this work is to fully exploit CO isotopologues\nobservations in Lupus, comparing them with physical-chemical model results, in\norder to obtain gas masses for a large number of disks. We have employed\nphysical-chemical models to analyze continuum and CO isotopologues observations\nof Lupus disks, including isotope-selective processes and freeze-out. Employing\nalso the ALMA 13CO-only detections, disk gas masses have been calculated for a\ntotal of 34 sources, expanding the sample of 10 disks studied by Ansdell et al.\n(2016), where also C18O was detected. We confirm that overall gas-masses are\nvery low, often smaller than 1 $M_{\\rm J}$, if volatile carbon is not depleted.\nAccordingly, global gas/dust ratios predominantly between 1 and 10. Low\nCO-based gas masses and gas/dust ratios may indicate rapid loss of gas, or\nalternatively chemical evolution, e.g. via sequestering of carbon from CO to\nmore complex molecules, or carbon locked up in larger bodies. Current ALMA\nobservations cannot distinguish between these two hypotheses. We have simulated\nboth scenarios, but chemical model results do not allow us to rule out one of\nthe two. Assuming that all Lupus disks have evolved mainly due to viscous\nprocesses over the past few Myr, the observed correlation between the current\nmass accretion rate and dust mass found by Manara et al. (2016) implies a\nconstant gas-to-dust ratio, which is close to 100 based on the observed $M_{\\rm\ndisk}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm acc}$ ratio.

As a\nresult, Hessian-weighted k-means clustering is proposed for clustering network\nparameters to quantize.

Given the fact that chain\nrigidity often plays a critical role in understanding the glass-formation of\npolymer materials, the GET was originally developed based on models of\nsemiflexible chains. Consequently, all previous calculations within the GET\nconsidered polymers with some degree of chain rigidity. Motivated by unexpected\nresults from computer simulations of fully flexible polymer melts concerning\nthe dependence of thermodynamic and dynamic properties on the cohesive\ninteraction strength ($\\epsilon$), the present paper employs the GET to explore\nthe influence of $\\epsilon$ on glass-formation in models of polymer melts with\na vanishing bending rigidity, i.e., fully flexible polymer melts. In accord\nwith simulations, the GET for fully flexible polymer melts predicts that basic\ndimensionless thermodynamic properties (such as the thermal expansion\ncoefficient and isothermal compressibility) are universal functions of the\ntemperature scaled by $\\epsilon$ in the regime of low pressures. Similar\nscaling behavior is also found for the configurational entropy density in the\nGET for fully flexible polymer melts. Moreover, we find that the characteristic\ntemperatures of glass-formation increase linearly with $\\epsilon$ and that the\nfragility is independent of $\\epsilon$ in fully flexible polymer melts,\npredictions that are again consistent with simulations of glass-forming polymer\nmelts composed of fully flexible chains. Beyond an explanation of these general\ntrends observed in simulations, the GET for fully flexible polymer melts\npredicts the presence of a positive residual configurational entropy at low\ntemperatures, indicating a return to Arrhenius relaxation in the low\ntemperature glassy state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 21:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

The regularity results of the present paper are applied to\nsolve $L^p$ Dirichlet problems for $\\mathcal\nL=$div$A(\\nabla\\cdot)+B\\cdot\\nabla$ when $A$ and $B$ satisfy a natural and\nfamiliar Carleson measure condition. We show solvability of the $L^p$ Dirichlet\nboundary value problem for $p$ in the range where $A$ is $p$-elliptic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 21:45:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2017 10:24:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 12:41:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 31 Mar 2018 18:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-03"}

In this\nstudy, we assume that S2 is formed by irradiation (photolysis and/or\nradiolysis) of S-bearing molecules embedded in the icy grain precursors of\ncomets, and that the cosmic ray flux simultaneously creates voids in ices\nwithin which the produced molecules can accumulate. We investigate the\nstability of S2 molecules in such cavities, assuming that the surrounding ice\nis made of H2S or H2O. We show that the stabilization energy of S2 molecules in\nsuch voids is close to that of the H2O ice binding energy, implying that they\ncan only leave the icy matrix when this latter sublimates. Because S2 has a\nshort lifetime in the vapor phase, we derive that its formation in grains via\nirradiation must occur only in low density environments such as the ISM or the\nupper layers of the protosolar nebula, where the local temperature is extremely\nlow. In the first case, comets would have agglomerated from icy grains that\nremained pristine when entering the nebula.

In such a system information security is\nconsidered as a major challenge. From a customer perspective, one of the big\nrisks in adopting big data systems is in trusting the provider who designs and\nowns the infrastructure from accessing user data. Yet there does not exist much\nin the literature on detection of insider attacks. In this work, we propose a\nnew system architecture in which insider attacks can be detected by utilizing\nthe replication of data on various nodes in the system. The proposed system\nuses a two-step attack detection algorithm and a secure communication protocol\nto analyze processes executing in the system. The first step involves the\nconstruction of control instruction sequences for each process in the system.\nThe second step involves the matching of these instruction sequences among the\nreplica nodes. Initial experiments on real-world hadoop and spark tests show\nthat the proposed system needs to consider only 20% of the code to analyze a\nprogram and incurs 3.28% time overhead. The proposed security system can be\nimplemented and built for any big data system due to its extrinsic workflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 23:23:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

The deployment of small cells in 5G networks is meant to\nreduce latency, backhaul traffic and increase radio access capacity. In this\ncontext, mobile edge computing technology will be used to manage dedicated\ncache space in the radio access network. Thus, mobile network operators will be\nable to provision OTT content providers with new caching services to enhance\nthe quality of experience of their customers on the move. In turn, the cache\nmemory in the mobile edge network will become a shared resource. Hence, we\nstudy a competitive caching scheme where contents are stored at given price set\nby the mobile network operator. We first formulate a resource allocation\nproblem for a tagged content provider seeking to minimize the expected missed\ncache rate. The optimal caching policy is derived accounting for popularity and\navailability of contents, the spatial distribution of small cells, and the\ncaching strategies of competing content providers. It is showed to induce a\nspecific order on contents to be cached based on their popularity and\navailability. Next, we study a game among content providers in the form of a\ngeneralized Kelly mechanism with bounded strategy sets and heterogeneous\nplayers. Existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium are proved.

Most methods in the literature would fail when the training samples are\nheavily occluded, corrupted or have significant illumination or viewpoint\nvariations. Besides, most of the existing methods and especially deep\nlearning-based methods, need large training sets to achieve a satisfactory\nrecognition performance. Although using the pre-trained network on a generic\nlarge-scale dataset and fine-tune it to the small-sized target dataset is a\nwidely used technique, this would not help when the content of base and target\ndatasets are very different. To address these issues, we propose a joint\nprojection and low-rank dictionary learning method using dual graph constraints\n(JP-LRDL). The proposed joint learning method would enable us to learn the\nfeatures on top of which dictionaries can be better learned, from the data with\nlarge intra-class variability. Specifically, a structured class-specific\ndictionary is learned and the discrimination is further improved by imposing a\ngraph constraint on the coding coefficients, that maximizes the intra-class\ncompactness and inter-class separability. We also enforce low-rank and\nstructural incoherence constraints on sub-dictionaries to make them more\ncompact and robust to variations and outliers and reduce the redundancy among\nthem, respectively. To preserve the intrinsic structure of data and penalize\nunfavourable relationship among training samples simultaneously, we introduce a\nprojection graph into the framework, which significantly enhances the\ndiscriminative ability of the projection matrix and makes the method robust to\nsmall-sized and high-dimensional datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 23:49:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

This property seems to be a\ncharacteristic feature of biological and technological evolution and is\nstrongly tied to the generative potential associated with combinatorics, which\nallows the system to grow and expand their available state spaces.\nInterestingly, many complex systems presumably displaying OEE, from language to\nproteins, share a common statistical property: the presence of Zipf's law.\nGiven an inventory of basic items (such as words or protein domains) required\nto build more complex structures (sentences or proteins) Zipf's law tells us\nthat most of these elements are rare whereas a few of them are extremely\ncommon. Using Algorithmic Information Theory, in this paper we provide a\nfundamental definition for open-endedness, which can be understood as {\\em\npostulates}. Its statistical counterpart, based on standard Shannon Information\ntheory, has the structure of a variational problem which is shown to lead to\nZipf's law as the expected consequence of an evolutionary process displaying\nOEE. We further explore the problem of information conservation through an OEE\nprocess and we conclude that statistical information (standard Shannon\ninformation) is not conserved, resulting into the paradoxical situation in\nwhich the increase of information content has the effect of erasing itself. We\nprove that this paradox is solved if we consider non-statistical forms of\ninformation.

A three-fold rotational mode of protons\nactivated around 80 K reduces the lifetimes of acoustic and optical phonons\ndown to about 4.5 ps and below 1 ps at 150 K, respectively. The orthorhombic to\ntetragonal phase transition takes place with a slower four-fold rotational mode\nof the C-N axis concomitantly setting in at ~ 165 K, above which the optical\nphonons are too broadened to be distinguished whereas the acoustic ones are\nstill robust. The significantly reduced lifetimes of optical phonons are linked\nto the smaller mobility of charge carriers while the ultralow lattice thermal\nconductivity is attributed to nanoscale mean free paths of acoustic phonons.\nThese microscopic insights provide a solid standing point, on which perovskite\nsolar cells can be understood more accurately and their performances are\nperhaps further optimized.

However, in contrast to modeling standards based on the\nMeta-Object Facility (MOF) and domain-specific languages typically used in\nmodel-driven engineering (MDE), the bigraphical theory lacks a precise\ndefinition of an abstract syntax for bigraphical modeling languages.

Moreover, tools can be hardly integrated with\nstandard MDE technologies in order to build sophisticated tool chains and\nmodeling environments, as required for systematic engineering of large systems\nor fostering experimental work to evaluate the bigraphical theory in real-world\napplications.

The\nproposed framework can seamlessly integrate feature extraction and shape prior\nexploring, and estimate the complete boundary with a sequential manner. Our\nframework is composed of three key modules. Firstly, we serialize the static 2D\nprostate ultrasound images into dynamic sequences and then predict prostate\nshapes by sequentially exploring shape priors.

However, most existing methods\nrepresent a video by either aggregating or projecting all its frames into a\nsingle datum point, which may easily cause severe information loss. In this\npaper, we propose an efficient QBIVR framework to enable an effective and\nefficient video search with image query. We first define a\nsimilarity-preserving distance metric between an image and its orthogonal\nprojection in the subspace of the video, which can be equivalently transformed\nto a Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem.\n  Besides, to boost the efficiency of solving the MIPS problem, we propose two\nasymmetric hashing schemes, which bridge the domain gap of images and videos.\nThe first approach, termed Inner-product Binary Coding (IBC), preserves the\ninner relationships of images and videos in a common Hamming space. To further\nimprove the retrieval efficiency, we devise a Bilinear Binary Coding (BBC)\napproach, which employs compact bilinear projections instead of a single large\nprojection matrix. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four real-world\nvideo datasets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed approaches as\ncompared to the state-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2016 04:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

Recently, various\nnon-oblivious randomized reduction methods have been developed and deployed for\nsolving many numerical problems such as matrix product approximation, low-rank\nmatrix approximation, etc. However, they are less explored for the machine\nlearning tasks, e.g., classification. More seriously, the theoretical analysis\nof excess risk bounds for risk minimization, an important measure of\ngeneralization performance, has not been established for non-oblivious\nrandomized reduction methods. It therefore remains an open problem what is the\nbenefit of using them over previous oblivious random projection based\napproaches. To tackle these challenges, we propose an algorithmic framework for\nemploying non-oblivious randomized reduction method for general empirical risk\nminimizing in machine learning tasks, where the original high-dimensional\nfeatures are projected onto a random subspace that is derived from the data\nwith a small matrix approximation error.

The proposed solution allows to conduct experiments\nwithout having a deep technical understanding of cloud-computing, HPC, fault\ntolerance, or data management in order to leverage the benefits of cloud\ncomputing. In the current version, we have focused on biophysics and structural\nchemistry experiments, based on the analysis of big data from synchrotrons and\natomic force microscopy. The domain experts noted the time savings for\ncomputing and data management, as well as user-friendly interface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2016 05:58:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

The doping dependence of the resistivity and\nHall number at low temperatures are characteristic of a system near a quantum\nphase transition or a Fermi Surface Reconstruction (FSR) point. The spin\nmagnetoresistance drops to zero near the critical point. The data presented in\nthis paper were compiled during the 2004-2007 period but were never published\nin this comprehensive form. Because of the recent interest in very similar\nresults now being found in the normal state of hole-doped cuprates, we believe\nthe results of our older, mostly unpublished, work will be of interest to the\npresent community of cuprate researchers. In particular, Fig.11 shows the large\nchange in Hall number at the FSR point in \\PCCO, similar to that found recently\nin YBCO and LSCO (See ref[1] and [2]). Also, Fig.6 illustrates how the\nresistivity upturn is affected by the FSR. The cause of the resistivity upturn\nhas been attributed to the loss of carriers at doping below the FSR in the\nhole-doped cuprates (see Ref. 3), however, this scenario does not explain the\ndata for PCCO. The upturn in n-doped cuprates is more-likely due to a\ncombination of carrier decrease and a change in the scattering rate below the\nFSR (see also Ref. 4). The change in spin scattering below the FSR is\nillustrated by Fig.18 in this paper. Chen et al.

In this network, two source nodes communicate with each other with the\nhelp of an amplify-and-forward relay which may perform Byzantine attacks by\nforwarding altered symbols to the sources. For simple investigating the\ndetectability of attacks conducted in Gaussian channels, we focus on the MA\nchannel of the network, while assuming the BC channel is noiseless. Upon such\nmodel, we propose a attack detection scheme implemented in the sources.\nSpecifically, we consider a open wireless propagation environment that allows\nthe symbols, forwarded by the relay, to go through a continuous channel and\narrive to the sources. With the observations of the source, we develop a\ndetection scheme for the source by comparing the joint empirical distribution\nof its received and transmitted signals with the known channel statistics. The\nmain contribution of this paper is to prove that if and only if the Gaussian\nrelay network satisfies a non-manipulable channel condition, the proposed\ndetection scheme can detect arbitrary attacks that allows the stochastic\ndistributions of altered symbols to vary arbitrarily and depend on each other.\nNo pre-shared secret or secret transmission is needed for the detection.\nFurthermore, we also prove that for the considered Gaussian two-way relay\nnetworks, the non-manipulable channel condition is always satisfied. This\nresult indicates that arbitrary attacks conducted in MA Gaussian channels are\ndetectable by only using observations, while providing a base for attack\ndetection in more general Gaussian networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2016 08:47:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

Fixing the radiative damping and\nmomentum drag timescales to be of the order of a few days, a state of SR is\nshown to emerge under steady large-scale and random small-scale vorticity\nforcing. In the first example, the stationary response to a pair of equal and\noppositely signed vortices placed on the equator is considered. Here, the\nequatorial flux budget is dominated by the eddy fluxes and these drive the\nsystem into a state of SR. Eventually, the flux associated with the momentum\ndrag increases to balance the eddy fluxes, resulting in a steady state with a\nSR jet at the equator. The initial value problem with these twin vortices also\nexhibits SR driven by eddy fluxes. Curiously, this transient solution\nspontaneously propagates westward and continually circumnavigates the globe. It\nis worth emphasizing that this SR state does not rely on any particular form of\ndissipation at large scales, and is in fact observed even in the absence of any\nlarge-scale damping mechanism. In the second example, a random small-scale\nvorticity forcing is applied across the tropics. The statistically steady state\nobtained is fairly turbulent in nature, but here too, the eddy fluxes dominate,\nand the system exhibits SR. It is important to note that in both these cases,\nthe direct forcing of the zonal mean zonal flow is zero by construction, and\nthe eddy fluxes at the equator are responsible for its eastward acceleration.\nFurther, in both these examples, the rotational part of the flow dominates the\nmomentum fluxes as well as the stationary zonal mean zonal flow itself.\nArguments based on the nature of potential vorticity and enstrophy are put\nforth to shed some light on these results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2016 09:18:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

The one-component or $N_{\\rm OP} =1$ order\nparameter is one of the physical strains, and the Landau free energy has a\ntriple well, describing a first-order transition. We numerically study the\nevolution of the strain-strain correlation, and find that it exhibits dynamical\nscaling, with a coarsening length $L(t) \\sim t^{\\alpha}$.

It has been shown that it represents an\nextremal member of the set of effective field theories with enhanced soft\nlimit. This property makes its tree-level S-matrix fully on-shell\nreconstructible and representable by means of the Cachazo-He-Yuan\nrepresentation. The enhanced soft limit is a consequence of new hidden symmetry\nof the Special Galileon action, however, until now, the origin of this peculiar\nsymmetry has remained unclear. In this paper we interpret this symmetry as a\nspecial transformation of the coset space $GAL(D,1)/SO(1,D-1)$ and show, that\nthere exists a three-parametric family of invariant Galileon actions. The\nlatter family is closed under duality which appears as a natural generalization\nof the above mentioned symmetry. We also present a geometric construction of\nthe Special Galileon action using $D$-dimensional brane propagating in\n$2D$-dimensional flat pseudo-riemannian space. Within such framework, the\nSpecial Galileon symmetry emerges as an $U(1,D-1)$ symmetry of the target\nspace, which can be treated as a $D$-dimensional K\\\"ahler manifold. Such a\ntreatment allows for classification of the higher order invariant Lagrangians\nneeded as counterterms on the quantum level.

In order to trigger the formation\nof a penumbra, large inclinations in the magnetic field are necessary. In\nsunspots, the penumbra develops and establishes by colonising both umbral areas\nand granulation, that is, penumbral magneto-convection takes over in umbral\nregions with $B_{\\rm ver} < B^{\\rm stable}_{\\rm ver}$, as well as in granular\nconvective areas. Eventually, a stable umbra-penumbra boundary settles at\n$B^{\\rm stable}_{\\rm ver}$. Here, we aim to study the development of a penumbra\ninitiated at the boundary of a pore, where the penumbra colonises the entire\npore ultimately. We have used Hinode/SOT G-band images to study the evolution\nof the penumbra. Hinode/SOT spectropolarimetric data were used to infer the\nmagnetic field properties in the studied region. The penumbra forms at the\nboundary of a pore located close to the polarity inversion line of NOAA\\,10960.\nAs the penumbral bright grains protrude into the pore, the magnetic flux in the\nforming penumbra increases at the expense of the pore magnetic flux.\nConsequently, the pore disappears completely giving rise to an orphan penumbra.\nAt all times, the vertical component of the magnetic field in the pore is\nsmaller than $B^{\\rm stable}_{\\rm ver} \\approx 1.8$~kG.

We\npropose to improve data-efficiency by factoring typically considered contexts\ninto two components: target-type contexts that correspond to a desired outcome\nof the learned behavior, e.g. target position for throwing a ball; and\nenvironment type contexts that correspond to some state of the environment,\ne.g. initial ball position or wind speed.

Coded signals together with pulse compression are\nsuccessfully used in radar and communication to increase the amount of\ntransmitted energy. Previous research verified significant improvement in SNR\nand imaging depth for ultrasound imaging with coded signals. Since pulse\ncompression needs to be applied at each transducer element, the implementation\nof coded excitation (CE) in array imaging is computationally complex. Applying\npulse compression on the beamformer output reduces the computational load but\nalso degrades both the axial and lateral point spread function (PSF)\ncompromising image quality. In this work we present an approach for efficient\nimplementation of pulse compression by integrating it into frequency domain\nbeamforming. This method leads to significant reduction in the amount of\ncomputations without affecting axial resolution. The lateral resolution is\ndictated by the factor of savings in computational load. We verify the\nperformance of our method on a Verasonics imaging system and compare the\nresulting images to time-domain processing. We show that up to 77 fold\nreduction in computational complexity can be achieved in a typical imaging\nsetups. The efficient implementation makes CE a feasible approach in array\nimaging paving the way to enhanced SNR as well as improved imaging depth and\nframe-rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2016 10:55:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

This\npaper contributes to this research frontier, by exploring the extent to which\nlocal commuting patterns can be estimated from data drawn from Twitter.

On the one hand, federated identity\nensures usability and provides economic benefits to service providers. On the\nother hand, it poses serious privacy threats to users as well as service\nproviders. The current technology, which is prevalently deployed on the\nInternet, allows identity providers to track the user's behavior across a broad\nrange of services.\n  In this work, we propose PRIMA, a universal credential-based authentication\nsystem for supporting federated identity management in a privacy-preserving\nmanner. Basically, PRIMA does not require any interaction between service\nproviders and identity providers during the authentication process, thus\npreventing identity providers to profile users' behavior. Moreover, throughout\nthe authentication process, PRIMA provides a mechanism for controlled\ndisclosure of the users' private information.

With pressure, this phase transition temperature $T_{\\rm M}$ is\nenhanced reaching 32 K at 8 GPa, which is the highest transition temperature so\nfar recorded for the Yb-based heavy fermion compounds. The power-law exponent\n$\\alpha$ in $\\rho=\\rho_0+ AT^{\\alpha}$ below $T_{\\rm M}$ gradually changes from\n3/2 to 5/2 with increasing pressure from 2 to 8 GPa.

One such problem is the online machine\ncovering problem on identical machines.

When a job arrives, we are allowed to reassign some jobs as long\nas their total size is (at most) proportional to the processing time of the\narriving job. The proportionality constant is called the migration factor of\nthe algorithm. Using a rounding procedure with useful structural properties for\nonline packing and covering problems, we design first a simple $(1.7 +\n\\varepsilon)$-competitive algorithm using a migration factor of\n$O(1/\\varepsilon)$ which maintains at every arrival a locally optimal solution\nwith respect to the Jump neighborhood.

Disk models show that carbon-rich or near-carbon-rich niches may\nemerge and cool carbon planets may trace these particular stages of planetary\nevolution. We extend our kinetic cloud formation model by including carbon seed\nformation and the formation of C[s], TiC[s], SiC[s], KCl[s], and MgS[s] by\ngas-surface reactions. The seed formation efficiency is lower in carbon-rich\natmospheres than in oxygen-rich gases due to carbon being a very effective\ngrowth species. The consequence is that less particles will make up a cloud for\nC/O_0>1. The cloud particles will be smaller in size than in an oxygen-rich\natmosphere. An increasing initial C/O ratio does not revert this trend because\na much greater abundance of condensible gas species exists in a rich carbon\nenvironment.

For recordings from a\nsurface sensor array where each trace contains a time-delayed arrival from the\nevent, we propose an autocorrelation-based stacking method that designs a\ndenoising filter from all the traces, as well as a multi-channel detection\nscheme. This approach circumvents the issue of time aligning the traces prior\nto stacking because every trace's autocorrelation is centered at zero in the\nlag domain.

The main reasons are systematic uncertainties due to the\nconfinement of quarks and gluons, as well as kinematical constraints which\nlimit the accessible energy scales. We here show how continuum extrapolated\nlattice data may overcome such problems and provide excellent probes of\nrenormalized perturbation theory. This work corresponds to an essential step in\nthe ALPHA collaboration's project to determine the $\\Lambda$-parameter in\n3-flavour QCD. I explain the basic techniques used in the high energy regime,\nnamely the use of mass-independent renormalization schemes for the QCD coupling\nconstant in a finite Euclidean space time volume. When combined with finite\nsize techniques this allows one to iteratively step up the energy scale by\nfactors of 2, thereby quickly covering two orders of magnitude in scale. We may\nthen compare perturbation theory (with $\\beta$-functions available up to 3-loop\norder) to our non-perturbative data for a 1-parameter family of running\ncouplings. We conclude that a target precision of 3 percent for the\n$\\Lambda$-parameter requires non-perturbative data up to scales where\n$\\alpha_s\\approx 0.1$, whereas the apparent precision obtained from applying\nperturbation theory around $\\alpha_s \\approx 0.2$ can be misleading.

Compared with ordinary compression methods,\nthis potential advantage of model-based coding in the transmission of data\narises from the fact that both the transmitter (\"Alice\") and the receiver\n(\"Bob\") are equipped with a grammar for the kind of data that is to be\ntransmitted, which means that, to achieve lossless transmission of a body of\ndata from Alice and Bob, a relatively small amount of information needs to be\nsent. Preliminary trials indicate that, with model-based coding, the volume of\ninformation to be sent from Alice to Bob to achieve lossless transmission of a\ngiven body of data may be less than $6\\%$ of the volume of information that\nneeds to be sent when ordinary compression methods are used.\n  Until recently, it has not been feasible to convert John Pierce's vision into\nsomething that may be applied in practice.

Our strategy is to define a fractional calculus for a certain class of\ndistributions using the convolution group. When acting on causal functions,\nthis fractional calculus agrees with the traditional Riemann-Liouville\ndefinition for $t>0$ but includes some singularities at $t=0$ so that the group\nproperty holds. Then, making use of this fractional calculus, we introduce the\ngeneralized definition of Caputo derivatives. The new definition is consistent\nwith various definitions in literature while reveals the underlying group\nstructure. Since the new definition is valid for a class of locally integrable\nfunctions that can blow up in finite time, it provides a framework for\nsolutions to fractional ODEs and fractional PDEs with very weak conditions. The\nunderlying group property makes many properties of Caputo derivatives natural.\nIn particular, it allows us to de-convolve the fractional differential\nequations to integral equations with completely monotone kernels, which then\nenables us to prove the general Gr\\\"onwall inequality (or comparison principle)\nwith the most general conditions. This then provides the essential tools for\n{\\it a priori} energy estimates of fractional PDEs. Some other fundamental\nresults for fractional ODEs are also established within this frame under very\nweak conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2016 15:40:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Jul 2017 17:12:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 03:06:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 14:25:13 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 23 Jun 2018 14:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-26"}

This theory utilizes exact solutions of\nfermions embedded in external plane waves which carry over to a strong field\nfermion propagator. When these strong field fermions also interact with probe\nphotons, the transition probability is enhanced in a series of resonances when\nthe kinematics allow the virtual fermion to go on-shell. An analysis of\nparameters shows that contemporary experiments could already produce these\npredicted resonances. With appropriate tuning, resonances can be made\narbitrarily sharp, leading to precision calculations of resonance locations and\nwidths, and the runing of coupling constants in strong background fields. New\ntests of QED could be performed leading to ramifications for our understanding\nof the quantum vacuum. Such tests extend to QFT in background potentials in\ngeneral, which may throw light on BSM theories such as QFT in curved\nspace-times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 17:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-30"}
