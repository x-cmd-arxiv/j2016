Under dc voltage bias $V$, spectral density of noise\nmeasured within a very large bandwidth enables to deduce the current-current\ncorrelator in the time domain by Fourier transform. This correlator exhibits\nregular oscillations proving that electrons try to cross the junction\nregularly, every $h/eV$. Using harmonic and bi-harmonic ac voltage bias, we\nthen show that quasiparticles excitations can be transferred through the\njunction in a controlled way.

Since the\nmassive SM-MIMO concept combines the benefits of both the SM and massive MIMO\ntechniques, it has recently attracted substantial research interest. In this\npaper, we study the achievable uplink spectral efficiency (SE) of a multi-cell\nmassive SM-MIMO system, and derive closed-form expressions to asymptotically\nlower-bound the SE yielded by two linear BS combining schemes, including\nmaximum ratio (MR) combining and zero forcing (ZF) combining, when a\nsufficiently large number of BS antennas are equipped. The derivation takes\ninto account the impact of transmitter spatial correlations, of imperfect\nchannel estimations, of user-specific power controls and of different pilot\nreuse factors. The proposed asymptotic bounds are shown to be tight, even when\nthe scale of BS antennas is limited. The new SE results facilitate a\nsystem-level investigation of the optimal number of uplink transmit antennas\n(TAs) $N$ with respect to SE maximization. Explicitly, we provide theoretical\ninsights on the SE of massive SM-MIMO systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nmassive SM-MIMO systems are capable of outperforming the SE of conventional\nmassive MIMOs relying on single-TA UEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2016 16:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

Besides the previously known\nhexagonal SiC sheet, we identified two types of hitherto-unknown structural\nmotifs with distinctive bonding features. The first type of 2D SiC monolayer,\nincluding t-SiC and t-Si$_2$C sheet, can be described by tetragonal lattice.\nAmong them,t-SiC monolayer sheet is featured by each carbon atom binds with\nfour neighboring silicon atoms in almost the same plane, constituting a\nquasi-planar four-coordinated rectangular moiety.

Monotonic schemes that combine\nexplicit time stepping with dG space discretization are very common, but the\ndesign of such schemes for implicit time stepping is rare, and it had only been\nattained so far for 1D problems. The proposed scheme is based on an artificial\ndiffusion that linearly depends on a shock detector that identifies the\ntroublesome areas. In order to define the new shock detector, we have\nintroduced the concept of discrete local extrema. The diffusion operator is a\ngraph-Laplacian, instead of the more common finite element discretization of\nthe Laplacian operator, which is essential to keep monotonicity on general\nmeshes and in multi-dimension. The resulting nonlinear stabilization is\nnon-smooth and nonlinear solvers can fail to converge.

This is a\nfascinating regularity, as it holds for various classes of securities, on\nvarious markets, and on various time scales.

Agent-based\nmodels of financial markets, on the other hand, exhibit realistic price\nchanges, but they involve relatively complicated, and often mathematically\nintractable, mechanisms. This paper identifies a simple principle behind the\npower law: the feedback intrinsic to the very idea of speculation, namely\nbuying when one expects a price rise (and selling when one expects a price\nfall). By this feedback, price changes follow a random coefficient\nautoregressive process, and therefore they have a power law by Kesten theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2016 18:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

However, the resulting clusters are typically presented\nwithout any guarantees on their robustness; slightly changing the used data\nsample or re-running a clustering algorithm involving some stochastic component\nmay lead to completely different clusters. There is, hence, a need for\ntechniques that can quantify the instability of the generated clusters. In this\nstudy, we propose a technique for quantifying the instability of a clustering\nsolution and for finding robust clusters, termed core clusters, which\ncorrespond to clusters where the co-occurrence probability of each data item\nwithin a cluster is at least $1 - \\alpha$. We demonstrate how solving the core\nclustering problem is linked to finding the largest maximal cliques in a graph.\nWe show that the method can be used with both clustering and classification\nalgorithms. The proposed method is tested on both simulated and real datasets.\nThe results show that the obtained clusters indeed meet the guarantees on\nrobustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2016 19:39:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Dec 2016 17:56:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-02"}

Of\nparticular interest is the occurrence of reciprocal sign epistasis, which is a\nnecessary condition for multipeaked genotypic fitness landscapes. Here we\ncompute the probability that a pair of randomly chosen mutations interacts sign\nepistatically, which is found to decrease with increasing phenotypic dimension\n$n$, and varies nonmonotonically with the distance from the phenotypic optimum.\nWe then derive expressions for the mean number of fitness maxima in genotypic\nlandscapes comprised of all combinations of $L$ random mutations.

The dependence of the complexity\non the model parameters is found to be surprisingly rich, and three distinct\nphases characterized by different landscape structures are identified.

Those algorithms have been wildly used as a preprocessing step in\ncomputer vision works, as they can enormously reduce the number of entries of\nsubsequent algorithms. In this work, we propose an alternative superpixel\nsegmentation method based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM) by assuming that each\nsuperpixel corresponds to a Gaussian distribution, and assuming that each pixel\nis generated by first randomly choosing one distribution from several Gaussian\ndistributions which are defined to be related to that pixel, and then the pixel\nis drawn from the selected distribution. Based on this assumption, each pixel\nis supposed to be drawn from a mixture of Gaussian distributions with unknown\nparameters (GMM). An algorithm based on expectation-maximization method is\napplied to estimate the unknown parameters. Once the unknown parameters are\nobtained, the superpixel label of a pixel is determined by a posterior\nprobability. The success of applying GMM to superpixel segmentation depends on\nthe two major differences between the traditional GMM-based clustering and the\nproposed one: data points in our model may be non-identically distributed, and\nwe present an approach to control the shape of the estimated Gaussian functions\nby adjusting their covariance matrices. Our method is of linear complexity with\nrespect to the number of pixels. The proposed algorithm is inherently parallel\nand can get faster speed by adding simple OpenMP directives to our\nimplementation. According to our experiments, our algorithm outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art superpixel algorithms in accuracy and presents a competitive\nperformance in computational efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2016 02:58:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 02:28:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

We demonstrate reconfigurable multiscale interactions and assembly of\ncolloids mediated by defects in cholesteric liquid crystals that are probed by\nmeans of laser manipulation and three-dimensional imaging. We find that\ncolloids attract via distance-independent elastic interactions when pinned to\nthe ends of cholesteric oily streaks, line defects at which one or more layers\nare interrupted. However, dislocations and oily streaks can also be optically\nmanipulated to induce kinks, allowing one to lock them into the desired\nconfigurations that are stabilized by elastic energy barriers for structural\ntransformation of the particle-connecting defects. Under the influence of\nelastic energy landscape due to these defects, sublamellar-sized colloids\nself-assemble into structures mimicking the cores of dislocations and oily\nstreaks. Interactions between these defect embedded colloids can be varied from\nattractive to repulsive by optically introducing dislocation kinks. The\nreconfigurable nature of defect-particle interactions allows for patterning of\ndefects by manipulation of colloids and, in turn, patterning of particles by\nthese defects, thus achieving desired colloidal configurations on scales\nranging from the size of defect core to the sample size. This defect-colloidal\nsculpturing may be extended to other lamellar media, providing the means for\noptically guided self-assembly of mesoscopic composites with predesigned\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2016 03:12:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-30"}

A bipartite graph is said to be\nDM-irreducible if its DM-decomposition consists of a single component.\n  In this paper, we focus on the problem of making a given bipartite graph\nDM-irreducible by adding edges. When the input bipartite graph is balanced\n(i.e., both sides have the same number of vertices) and has a perfect matching,\nthis problem is equivalent to making a directed graph strongly connected by\nadding edges, for which the minimum number of additional edges was\ncharacterized by Eswaran and Tarjan (1976).\n  We give a general solution to this problem, which is divided into three\nparts. We first show that our problem can be formulated as a special case of a\ngeneral framework of covering supermodular functions, which was introduced by\nFrank and Jord\\'an (1995) to investigate the directed connectivity augmentation\nproblem. Secondly, when the input graph is not balanced, the problem is solved\nvia matroid intersection. This result can be extended to the minimum cost\nversion in which the addition of an edge gives rise to an individual cost.\nThirdly, for balanced input graphs, we devise a combinatorial algorithm that\nfinds a minimum number of additional edges to attain the DM-irreducibility,\nwhile the minimum cost version of this problem is NP-hard. These results also\nlead to min-max characterizations of the minimum number, which generalize the\nresult of Eswaran and Tarjan.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2016 09:04:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 06:15:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2018 08:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-16"}

We consider one, two- and three dimensional systems, and calculate the\nthermoelectric properties using the Boltzmann equation approach within the\nconstant quasi-particle lifetime approximation. $n = 2$ corresponds to the\nusual parabolic band structure, while the band shape for $n = 4, 6$ has a flat\nportion at the band edge, so that the density of states diverges at the bottom\nof the band.

It is found that the pudding mold type band has a\ncoexistence of large Seebeck coefficient and large electric conductivity, and\nsmall Lorenz number in the Wiedemann--Franz law due to the specific band shape.\nWe also find that the low dimensionality of the band structure can contribute\nto large electronic conductivity and hence a small Lorenz number.

The proposed approach exploits social strategic relationships\nbetween user equipments (UEs) and their physical proximity to optimize the\noverall network performance. This problem is formulated as a matching game\nbetween UEs and their serving nodes (SNs) in which, an SN can be a small cell\nbase station (SCBS) or an important UE with D2D capabilities. The problem is\ncast as a many-to-one matching game in which UEs and SNs rank one another using\npreference relations that capture both the wireless aspects (i.e., received\nsignal strength, traffic load, etc.) and users' social ties (e.g., UE proximity\nand social distance). Due to the combinatorial nature of the network-wide UE-SN\nmatching, the problem is decomposed into a dynamic clustering problem in which\nSCBSs are grouped into disjoint clusters based on mutual interference.\nSubsequently, an UE-SN matching game is carried out per cluster. The game under\nconsideration is shown to belong to a class of matching games with\nexternalities arising from interference and peer effects due to users social\ndistance, enabling UEs and SNs to interact with one another until reaching a\nstable matching.

For\ndistinguishing between ordered and chaotic motion we use the Smaller ALingment\nIndex (SALI) method, a fast yet very accurate tool. Undoubtedly, the most\nimportant elements of the dynamics are the normally hyperbolic invariant\nmanifolds (NHIMs) located in the vicinity of the index 1 Lagrange points $L_2$\nand $L_3$.

A clear age gradient observed in the spatial distribution of young\nsources in the surrounding might be a strong argument in favor of triggering.\nWe have observed the Galactic HII region RCW120 with herschel PACS and SPIRE\nphotometers at 70, 100, 160, 250, 350 and 500$\\mu$m. We produced temperature\nand H$_2$ column density maps and use the getsources algorithm to detect\ncompact sources and measure their fluxes at herschel wavelengths. We have\ncomplemented these fluxes with existing infrared data. Fitting their spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) with a modified blackbody model, we derived their\nenvelope dust temperature and envelope mass. We computed their bolometric\nluminosities and discuss their evolutionary stages. The herschel data, with\ntheir unique sampling of the far infrared domain, have allowed us to\ncharacterize the properties of compact sources observed towards RCW120 for the\nfirst time. We have also been able to determine the envelope temperature,\nenvelope mass and evolutionary stage of these sources. Using these properties\nwe have shown that the density of the condensations that host star formation is\na key parameter of the star-formation history, irrespective of their projected\ndistance to the ionizing stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2016 11:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

The method is pressure-based and semi-implicit and\nis able to deal with all Mach number flows. In our scheme, the discrete\npressure is defined on the primal grid, while the discrete velocity field and\nthe density are defined on a face-based staggered dual grid. All convective\nterms are discretized explicitly, while the pressure terms appearing in the\nmomentum and energy equation are discretized implicitly. Substitution of the\nmomentum equation into the energy equation yields a linear system for the\nscalar pressure as the only unknown. The enthalpy and the kinetic energy are\ntaken explicitly and are then updated using a simple Picard procedure. Thanks\nto the use of a staggered grid, the final pressure system is a very sparse\nblock five-point system for three dimensional problems. The viscous terms and\nthe heat flux are also discretized making use of the staggered grid by defining\nthe viscous stress tensor and the heat flux vector on the dual grid, which\ncorresponds to the use of a lifting operator on the dual grid. The time step of\nour new numerical method is limited by a CFL condition based only on the fluid\nvelocity and not on the sound speed. This makes the method particularly\ninteresting for low Mach number flows. Finally, a very simple combination of\nartificial viscosity and the a posteriori MOOD technique allows to deal with\nshock waves and thus permits also to simulate high Mach number flows. We show\ncomputational results for a large set of two and three-dimensional benchmark\nproblems, including both low and high Mach number flows and using polynomial\napproximation degrees up to p=4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2016 12:19:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

Based on a result by\nvon Stengel and Zamir [2010], the notions of commitment value and commitment\noptimal strategies for each player are discussed as a possible solution\nconcept. It is shown that in non-degenerate bimatrix games (a) pure commitment\noptimal strategies together with the follower's best response constitute Nash\nequilibria, and (b) strategies that participate in a completely mixed Nash\nequilibrium are strictly worse than commitment optimal strategies, provided\nthey are not matrix game optimal.

In particular, since the\ndiscovery by Lord Rayleigh surface waves in solids focus increased attention of\nscientists, because their experimental and theoretical studies can serve as the\nsource of unique information about the surface impact on the dynamics and\nstructure of the atomic lattice, structural instabilities and phase transitions\ninduced by the surface, and explore the properties of phonons in\nspatially-confined systems The existence of purely shear surface wave is\nimpossible in non-piezoelectrics within the framework of the classical theory\nof elasticity, because the Rayleigh surface waves have different polarization\nand are the mixture of shear and dilatational waves. We showed that the\n\"forbidden\" shear surface wave (shortly Flexo-SW) can propagate near the\nsurface of all crystalline dielectrics due to the omnipresent flexoelectric\ncoupling. The appearance and penetration depth of the Flexo-SW is ruled by the\nflexocoupling strength. In particular the penetration depth of transverse\nacoustic mode diverges in the absence of the flexoelectric coupling and so\nthese waves become indistinguishable from the bulk waves. For paraelectrics\nsuch as strontium titanate with typical flexoeletric coefficients (~2V) the\npenetration depth of the Flexo-SW can reach more than tens microns at THz\nfrequencies. The circumstances can explain the absence of experimental\nobservations of the missed surface waves in thick layers and bulk materials.\nHowever we predict that the peaks of neutron intensity corresponding to the\nsurface Flexo-SW and bulk phonon modes can be separated in non-piezoelectric\nthin films of thickness ~(20 - 50)nm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2016 15:08:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}

The\nground-state phase diagram of the model is constructed in the randomness versus\nthe frustration ($J_2/J_1$) plane, with the aim of clarifying the effects of\nrandomness and frustration in stabilizing a variety of distinct phases. We find\nthat the randomness induces the gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL)-like state,\nthe random-singlet state, in a wide range of parameter space. The observed\nrobustness of the random-singlet state suggests that the gapless QSL-like\nbehaviors might be realized in a wide class of frustrated quantum magnets\npossessing a certain amount of randomness or inhomogeneity, without fine-tuning\nthe interaction parameters. Possible implications to recent experiments on the\nhoneycomb-lattice magnets Ba$_3$CuSb$_2$O$_9$ and 6HB-Ba$_3$NiSb$_2$O$_9$\nexhibiting the gapless QSL-like behaviors are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Dec 2016 14:36:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2017 08:22:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

In the process, we extend IF logic to include semantic games with\nchance moves and dub this extension stochastic IF logic. Finally, we use\nstochastic IF logic to analyze the Sleeping Beauty problem, leading to the\nconclusion that the thirders are correct while identifying the main error in\nthe halfers' argument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2016 19:20:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-12"}
