Under such\nstrong confinement, the homogeneous nucleation process of water is avoided,\nwhich allows the confined water to keep its liquid state at temperatures and\npressures that are inaccessible to the bulk water. By measuring the average\ndensity of the confined heavy water, we observe a likely first-order\nlow-density liquid (LDL) to high-density liquid (HDL) transition in the deeply\ncooled region of the confined heavy water. The phase separation starts from\n1.12 +- 0.17 kbar and 215 +- 1K and extends to higher pressures and lower\ntemperatures in the phase diagram. This starting point could be the\nliquid-liquid critical point of the confined water. The locus of the Widom line\nis also estimated. The observation of the liquid-liquid transition in the\nconfined water has potential to explain the mysterious behaviors of water at\nlow temperatures. In addition, it may also have impacts on other disciplines,\nbecause the confined water system represents many biological and geological\nsystems in which water resides in nanoscopic pores or in the vicinity of\nhydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2016 16:17:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-13"}

Inspired by a recent\nwork of Mukherjee and Varadhan on large deviations of the occupation measure of\nBrownian motion, we define a suitable topology on the space of partitioned\nsubprobability measures and prove that this topology is compact. Then using a\nvariant of the cavity method from the theory of spin glasses, we show that any\nlimit law of a sequence of endpoint distributions must satisfy a fixed point\nequation on this abstract space, and that the limiting free energy of the model\ncan be expressed as the solution of a variational problem over the set of fixed\npoints. As a first application of the theory, we prove that in an environment\nwith finite exponential moment, the endpoint distribution is asymptotically\npurely atomic if and only if the system is in the low temperature phase. The\nanalogous result for a heavy-tailed environment was proved by Vargas in 2007.\nAs a second application, we prove a subsequential version of the longstanding\nconjecture that in the low temperature phase, the endpoint distribution is\nasymptotically localized in a region of stochastically bounded diameter.

A\nprominent example is the sparse subspace clustering (SSC) algorithm by\nElhamifar and Vidal, which performs spectral clustering based on an adjacency\nmatrix obtained by sparsely representing each data point in terms of all the\nother data points via the Lasso. When the number of data points is large or the\ndimension of the ambient space is high, the computational complexity of SSC\nquickly becomes prohibitive. Dyer et al. observed that SSC-OMP obtained by\nreplacing the Lasso by the greedy orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm\nresults in significantly lower computational complexity, while often yielding\ncomparable performance. The central goal of this paper is an analytical\nperformance characterization of SSC-OMP for noisy data. Moreover, we introduce\nand analyze the SSC-MP algorithm, which employs matching pursuit (MP) in lieu\nof OMP. Both SSC-OMP and SSC-MP are proven to succeed even when the subspaces\nintersect and when the data points are contaminated by severe noise. The\nclustering conditions we obtain for SSC-OMP and SSC-MP are similar to those for\nSSC and for the thresholding-based subspace clustering (TSC) algorithm due to\nHeckel and B\\\"olcskei. Analytical results in combination with numerical results\nindicate that both SSC-OMP and SSC-MP with a data-dependent stopping criterion\nautomatically detect the dimensions of the subspaces underlying the data.\nMoreover, experiments on synthetic and on real data show that SSC-MP compares\nvery favorably to SSC, SSC-OMP, TSC, and the nearest subspace neighbor\nalgorithm, both in terms of clustering performance and running time. In\naddition, we find that, in contrast to SSC-OMP, the performance of SSC-MP is\nvery robust with respect to the choice of parameters in the stopping criteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2016 18:33:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jun 2018 12:34:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-11"}

While this review is concerned\nwith hybrid semiconductor / molecular effects (see Refs. 1,2 for earlier\nreviews on this topic), issues related to formation of monolayers and contacts,\nas well as charge transport that is solely dominated by molecules, have been\nreviewed elsewhere[3-6], including by us recently[7].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2016 21:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-17"}

All the recurrent flares\noccurred within a short interval of time (less than 4 hours), showed very\nsimilar plasma morphology and were all confined, until the last one when a\nlarge-scale eruption occurred. The C-class flares are characterized by the\nappearance, at approximatively the same locations, of two bright and compact\nfootpoint sources of $\\approx$~3--10~MK evaporating plasma, and a semi-circular\nribbon. During all the flares, the continuous brightening of a spine-like hot\nplasma ($\\approx$~10~MK) structure is also observed. Spectroscopic observations\nwith Hinode/EIS are used to measure and compare the blueshift velocities in the\n\\fexxiii\\ emission line and the electron number density at the flare footpoints\nfor each flare. Similar velocities, of the order of 150--200~km~s$^{-1}$, are\nobserved during the C2.0 and C4.7 confined flares, in agreement with the values\nreported by other authors in the study of the last M1.8 class flare. On the\nother hand, lower electron number densities and temperatures tend to be\nobserved in flares with lower peak soft X-ray flux.In order to investigate the\nhomologous nature of the flares, we performed a Non-Linear Force-Free Field\n(NLFFF) extrapolation of the 3D magnetic field configuration in the corona. The\nNLFFF extrapolation and the Quasi-Separatrix Layers (QSLs) provide the magnetic\nfield context which explains the location of the kernels, spine-like and\nsemi-circular brightenings observed in the (non-eruptive) flares. Given the\nabsence of a coronal null point, we argue that the homologous flares were all\ngenerated by the continuous recurrence of bald patch reconnection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 00:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

One way to overcome this limitation is to\nuse photons that arrive during the frame transfer of the CCD, forming vertical\nread-out streaks for bright sources. We calibrate these read-out streaks for\nphotometry of bright sources observed with XMM-OM. The bright source limit for\nread-out streak photometry is set by the recharge time of the MCPs. For XMM-OM\nwe find that the MCP recharge time is 0.55 ms. We determine that the effective\nbright limits for read-out streak photometry with XMM-OM are approximately 1.5\nmagnitudes brighter than the bright source limits for normal aperture\nphotometry in full-frame images.

The near-void and radially-outwards propagating\nion-wake channel of a few plasma skin-depth radius, is explored for application\nto \"Crunch-in\" regime of positron acceleration. The coupling from the electron\nwakefield mode to the ion-mode dictates the long-term evolution of the plasma\nand the time for its relaxation back to an equilibrium, limiting the\nrepetition-rate of a plasma accelerator. Using an analytical model it is shown\nthat it is the time asymmetric phases of the oscillating radial electric fields\nof the nearly-stationary electron bubble that excite time-averaged inertial ion\nmotion radially. The electron compression in the back of the bubble sucks-in\nthe ions whereas the space-charge within the bubble cavity expels them, driving\na cylindrical ion-soliton structure with on-axis and bubble-edge\ndensity-spikes. Once formed, the channel-edge density-spike is sustained over\nthe length of the plasma and driven radially outwards by the thermal pressure\nof the wake energy in electrons. Its channel-like structure is independent of\nthe energy-source, electromagnetic wave or particle beam, driving the bubble\nelectron wake. Particle-In-Cell simulations are used to study the ion-wake\nsoliton structure, its driven propagation and its use for positron acceleration\nin the \"Crunch-in\" regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 02:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

However, most previous MIL methods on this\nissue ignore the global similarity among positive instances and that negative\ninstances are non-i.i.d., usually resulting in the detection of TPI not precise\nand sensitive to outliers. To the end, we propose a positive instance detection\nvia graph updating for multiple instance learning, called PIGMIL, to detect TPI\naccurately. PIGMIL selects instances from working sets (WSs) of some working\nbags (WBs) as positive candidate pool (PCP). The global similarity among\npositive instances and the robust discrimination of instances of PCP from\nnegative instances are measured to construct the consistent similarity and\ndiscrimination graph (CSDG). As a result, the primary goal (i.e. TPI detection)\nis transformed into PCP updating, which is approximated efficiently by updating\nCSDG with a random walk ranking algorithm and an instance updating strategy. At\nlast bags are transformed into feature representation vector based on the\nidentified TPIs to train a classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nhigh precision of PIGMIL's detection of TPIs and its excellent performance\ncompared to classic baseline MIL methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 06:12:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-13"}

In contrast to the initial understanding, the minima of the\nconduction band are predicted to be spin split. Because of this splitting and\nthe spin-polarized character of the valence bands, the lowest-lying excitonic\nstates in WX2 (X=S, Se) are expected to be spin-forbidden and optically dark.\nTo date, however, there has been no direct experimental probe of these dark\nband-edge excitons, which strongly influence the light emission properties of\nthe material.

Greatly increased emission and valley lifetimes were\nobserved for the brightened dark states as a result of their spin\nconfiguration. These studies directly probe the excitonic spin manifold and\nprovide a new route to tune the optical and valley properties of these\nprototypical two-dimensional semiconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 07:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-14"}

However, as the U5MR\ndecreases, the share of neonatal deaths (within the first month) tends to\nincrease, warranting increased efforts in monitoring this indicator in addition\nto the U5MR. A Bayesian splines regression model is presented for estimating\nneonatal mortality rates (NMR) for all countries. In the model, the\nrelationship between NMR and U5MR is assessed and used to inform estimates, and\nspline regression models are used to capture country-specific trends. As such,\nthe resulting NMR estimates incorporate trends in overall child mortality while\nalso capturing data-driven trends. The model is fitted to 195 countries using\nthe database from the United Nations Interagency Group for Child Mortality\nEstimation, producing estimates from 1990, or earlier if data are available,\nuntil 2015. The results suggest that, above a U5MR of 34 deaths per 1000 live\nbirths, at the global level, a 1 per cent increase in the U5MR leads to a 0.6\nper cent decrease in the ratio of NMR to U5MR. Below a U5MR of 34 deaths per\n1000 live births, the proportion of deaths under-five that are neonatal is\nconstant at around 54 per cent. However, the relationship between U5MR and NMR\nvaries across countries. The model has now been adopted by the United Nations\nInter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 07:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

The stress can be\nalleviated by selection of resistant individuals (host and bacteria) and by\nsecretion of a detoxification agent (\"detox\"). By defining a new measure,\ntermed the Lamarckian, we show that selection of resistant bacteria over one\ngeneration of hosts leads to stress-dependent increase in the tolerance of the\nhost's offspring. This benefit is mediated by co-alleviation of toxic and\nphysiologic stress. Prolonged exposure leads to further adaptation by 'group\nselection' of bacterial communities with higher detox per bacterium. These\nfindings show that Lamarckian adaptation can arise via interactions between two\nlevels of Darwinian selection within a holobiont system.

A challenging problem encountered in this context pertains to\ndetermining the attributes of a set of vertices given those of another subset\nat possibly different time instants. Leveraging spatiotemporal dynamics can\ndrastically reduce the number of observed vertices, and hence the cost of\nsampling. Alleviating the limited flexibility of existing approaches, the\npresent paper broadens the existing kernel-based graph function reconstruction\nframework to accommodate time-evolving functions over possibly time-evolving\ntopologies. This approach inherits the versatility and generality of\nkernel-based methods, for which no knowledge on distributions or second-order\nstatistics is required. Systematic guidelines are provided to construct two\nfamilies of space-time kernels with complementary strengths. The first\nfacilitates judicious control of regularization on a space-time frequency\nplane, whereas the second can afford time-varying topologies. Batch and online\nestimators are also put forth, and a novel kernel Kalman filter is developed to\nobtain these estimates at affordable computational cost. Numerical tests with\nreal data sets corroborate the merits of the proposed methods relative to\ncompeting alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 11:12:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 May 2017 08:29:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-25"}

This paper\nproposes a Gaussian relational topic model for connection discovery using user\nshared images in social media. The proposed model not only models user\ninterests as latent variables through their shared images, but also considers\nthe connections between users as a result of their shared images. It explicitly\nrelates user shared images to user connections in a hierarchical, systematic\nand supervisory way and provides an end-to-end solution for the problem.

Existing metrics typically count instances of abuse and sometimes\nnormalize these counts by taking into account the advertised address space of\nthe provider.

Each SIB monitors and\nprocesses 75 temperature sensors mainly located in the focal plane and also\ndistributed inside the camera-head electronics.

A decision-matrix software reads the sensor\nstatus continuously and determines whether the camera is in a safe state or\nnot. All error and warnings flags are sent to the detector control software\nframework and the end user directly. These flags are also stored every 100 ms\ntogether with the image data.

If dissipation in Saturn is as large\nas the astrometric observations suggest, conventional models predict that\nMimas' initial orbit should be located inside Saturn's synchronous orbit or\neven inside its Roche limit. Using simple structure models and assuming\nSaturn's core to be viscoelastic, we look for dissipation models which are\nconsistent with both the latest astrometric observations and with Mimas'\norbital migration. Firstly, using a two-layer model of Saturn's interior\nstructure, we constrain the ranges of rigidity and viscosity of Saturn's core\nwhich are consistent with Saturn's dissipation derived from astrometric\nobservations at the tidal frequencies of Enceladus, Tethys, and Dione. Next,\nwithin the constrained viscosity and rigidity ranges, we calculate Mimas'\nsemi-major axis considering the frequency dependence of viscoelastic\ndissipation in Saturn's core. By the two calculations, we evaluate (1)\nSaturnian models which can explain the astrometrically determined Saturnian\ndissipation, and (2) whether Mimas' initial semi-major axis is larger than the\nsynchronous orbit. We show that if the core is assumed to be solid with a\nviscosity of 10^{13}-10^{14} Pa s, the lower boundary of the observed Saturnian\ndissipation at tidal frequencies of Enceladus, Tethys, and Dione can be\nexplained by our model. In this viscosity range, Mimas can stay outside the\nsynchronous orbit and the Roche limit for 4.5 billion years of evolution.

We present visualizations of the fluid flow and\ntemperature distribution and find a strong impact of the spin on vortex\nstructure and nonaxisymmetric deformation. We compute the radial mass\ndistribution and the rotation profile in the equatorial plane using recently\ndeveloped measures independent of spatial gauge, revealing slowly rotating\ncores that can be well approximated by the cores of spherical stars. We also\nstudy the influence of the spin on the inspiral phase and the gravitational\nwave (GW) signal. Using a newly developed analysis method, we further show that\ngravitational waveforms from BNS mergers can exhibit one or more phase jumps\nafter merger, which occur together with minima of the strain amplitude. We\nprovide a natural explanation in terms of the remnant's quadrupole moment, and\nshow that cancellation effects due to phase jumps can have a strong impact on\nthe GW power spectrum.

The gravitational\ncollapse of a large sample of model cores in the mass range 0.1-2.0 Msun is\ninvestigated. Numerical simulations were started at the pre-stellar phase and\nterminated at the end of the embedded phase when 90% of the initial core mass\nhad been accreted onto the forming protostar plus disk system. The disk\nformation and evolution was studied using numerical hydrodynamics simulations,\nwhile the formation and evolution of the central star was calculated using a\nstellar evolution code. Three scenarios for mass accretion from the disk onto\nthe star were considered: hybrid accretion in which a fraction of accreted\nenergy absorbed by the protostar depends on the accretion rate, hot accretion\nwherein a fraction of accreted energy is constant, and cold accretion wherein\nall accretion energy is radiated away. Our conclusions on the nature of VeLLOs\ndepend crucially on the character of protostellar accretion. In the hybrid\naccretion scenario, most VeLLOs (90.6%) are expected to be the first\nhydrostatic cores (FHSCs) and only a small fraction (9.4%) are true protostars.\nIn the hot accretion scenario, all VeLLOs are FHSCs due to overly high\nphotospheric luminosity of protostars. In the cold accretion scenario, on the\ncontrary, the majority of VeLLOs belong to the Class I phase of stellar\nevolution. The reason is that the stellar photospheric luminosity, which sets\nthe floor for the total internal luminosity of a young star, is lower in cold\naccretion, thus enabling more VeLLOs in the protostellar stage. VeLLOs are\nrelatively rare objects occupying 7%-11% of the total duration of the embedded\nphase and their masses do not exceed 0.3 Msun.

The origin of this force lies in the symmetry breaking\ninduced by the particle rotation in the vacuum and thermal fluctuations of its\ndipole moment, and, therefore, in contrast to lateral Casimir forces previously\ndescribed in the literature for corrugated surfaces, it exists despite the\ntranslational invariance of the planar surface. Working within the framework of\nfluctuational electrodynamics, we derive analytical expressions for the lateral\nforce and analyze its dependence on the geometrical and material properties of\nthe system. In particular, we show that the direction of the force can be\ncontrolled by adjusting the particle-surface distance, which may be exploited\nas a new mechanism to manipulate nanoscale objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 15:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

If G is a well-covered graph, has at least two\nvertices, and G-v is well-covered for every vertex v, then G is a\n1-well-covered graph (Staples, 1975). We call G a {\\lambda}-quasi-regularizable\ngraph if {\\lambda} |S| =< |N(S)| for every independent set S of G. The\nindependence polynomial I(G;x) is the generating function of independent sets\nin a graph G (Gutman & Harary, 1983). The Roller-Coaster Conjecture (Michael &\nTravis, 2003), saying that for every permutation {\\sigma} of the set\n{({\\alpha}/2),...,{\\alpha}} there exists a well-covered graph G with\nindependence number {\\alpha} such that the coefficients (s_{k}) of I(G;x) are\nchosen in accordance with {\\sigma}, has been validated in (Cutler & Pebody,\n2017). In this paper, we show that independence polynomials of\n{\\lambda}-quasi-regularizable graphs are partially unimodal. More precisely,\nthe coefficients of an upper part of I(G;x) are in non-increasing order. Based\non this finding, we prove that the domain of the Roller- Coaster Conjecture can\nbe shortened for well-covered graphs and 1-well-covered graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 15:14:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-13"}

In response, several\nmain-memory encryption schemes have been proposed to prevent such attacks. Also\nhardware vendors have acknowledged the threat and already announced respective\nhardware extensions. Intel's SGX and AMD's SME will provide means to encrypt\nparts of the RAM to protect security-relevant assets that reside there.\nEncrypting the RAM will protect the user's content against passive\neavesdropping. However, the level of protection it provides in scenarios that\ninvolve an adversary who is not only able to read from RAM but can also change\ncontent in RAM is less clear. Obviously, encryption offers some protection\nagainst such an \"active\" adversary: from the ciphertext the adversary cannot\nsee what value is changed in the plaintext, nor predict the system behaviour\nbased on the changes. But is this enough to prevent an active adversary from\nperforming malicious tasks? This paper addresses the open research question\nwhether encryption alone is a dependable protection mechanism in practice when\nconsidering an active adversary. To this end, we first build a software based\nmemory encryption solution on a desktop system which mimics AMD's SME.\nSubsequently, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept fault attack on this system, by\nwhich we are able to extract the private RSA key of a GnuPG user.

Another problem is that\nwith over a billion objects, only a few cpu cycles are available per object if\none wants to process them within a second, making traditional methods by\nrendering glyphs not viable.

In a second time, the proposed methods are applied\nto two data sets obtained from real radiological contamination measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 14:33:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 May 2017 10:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-30"}

However, the\nprimary focus has been placed on their kinematic applications, such as\ndeployable space structures and sandwich core materials, by leveraging the\ncompactness and auxeticity of planar origami platforms. Here, we present\nvolumetric origami cells -- specifically triangulated cylindrical origami (TCO)\n-- with tunable stability and stiffness, and demonstrate their feasibility as\nnon-volatile mechanical memory storage devices. We show that a pair of origami\ncells can develop a double-well potential to store bit information without the\nneed of residual forces. What makes this origami-based approach more appealing\nis the realization of two-bit mechanical memory, in which two pairs of TCO\ncells are interconnected and one pair acts as a control for the other pair.\nUsing TCO-based truss structures, we present an experimental demonstration of\npurely mechanical one- and two-bit memory storage mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2016 19:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}
