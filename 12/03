The ability to engineer the\nprocesses responsible for dissipation and coupling is fundamental to manipulate\nthe state of such systems. This is particularly important in oscillatory states\nwhose dynamic response is used for many applications, e.g. micro and\nnano-mechanical resonators or sensing and timing, qubits for quantum\nengineering, and vibrational modes for optomechanical devices. In situations\nwhere stable oscillations are required, the energy dissipated by the\nvibrational modes is usually compensated by replenishment from external energy\nsources. Consequently, if the external energy supply is removed, the amplitude\nof oscillations start to decay immediately, since there is no means to\nrestitute the energy dissipated. Here, we demonstrate a novel strategy to\nmaintain stable oscillations, i.e. with constant amplitude and frequency,\nwithout supplying external energy to compensate losses. The fundamental\nintrinsic mechanism of mode coupling is used to redistribute and store\nmechanical energy among vibrational modes and coherently transfer it back to\nthe principal mode when the external excitation is off. To experimentally\ndemonstrate this phenomenon that defies physical intuition, we exploit the\nnonlinear dynamic response of microelectromechanical (MEMS) oscillators to\ncouple two different vibrational modes through an internal resonance. Since the\nunderlying mechanism describing the fundamentals of this new phenomenon is\ngeneric and representative of a large variety of systems, the presented method\nprovides a new dissipation engineering strategy that would enable a new\ngeneration of autonomous devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2016 16:49:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 02:06:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2016 06:34:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

Objective: To explore the\nuse of pilot case studies in the design of full-scale case studies, and to\nreport the main lessons learned from an industrial pilot study. Method: We\ndesigned and conducted an exploratory case study to identify new relevant\nresearch variables that influence the innovative behaviour of software\nengineers in the industrial setting and to refine the full-scale case study\ndesign for the next phase of our research. Results: The use of a pilot case\nstudy identified several important research variables that were missing in the\ninitial framework.

Conclusions: When a\nresearch topic has not been fully discovered or understood, it is difficult to\ncreate a case study design that covers the relevant research variables and\ntheir potential relationships.

However, direct observational evidence\nfor this accretion phenomenon has been elusive. Theoretically, the accreted gas\ncoming from the intergalactic medium is expected to orbit about the halo,\ndelivering not just fuel for star-formation but also angular momentum to the\ngalaxy. This accreting material is thus expected to form a gaseous structure\nthat should be co-rotating with the host once at $r<0.3\\;R_{\\rm vir}$ or\n$r<10-30$ kpc. Because of the rough alignment between the star-forming disk and\nthis extended gaseous structure, the accreting material can be most easily\ndetected with the combination of background quasars and integral field units\n(IFUs).

Balanced homodyne detection (BHD) allows for a quantum noise limited\nreadout of arbitrary light field quadratures, and has therefore been suggested\nas a vital building block for upgrades to Advanced LIGO and third generation\nobservatories. In terms of the practical implementation of BHD, we develop a\nfull framework for analyzing the static optical high order modes (HOMs)\noccurring in the BHD paths related to the misalignment or mode matching at the\ninput and output ports of the laser interferometer. We find the effects of HOMs\non the quantum noise limited sensitivity is independent of the actual\ninterferometer configuration, e.g. Michelson and Sagnac interferometers are\neffected in the same way. We show that output misalignment only effects the\nhigh frequency part of the quantum noise limited sensitivity. However, at low\nfrequencies, HOMs reduce the interferometer response and the radiation pressure\nnoise by the same amount and hence the quantum noise limited sensitivity is not\nnegatively effected. We show that the input misalignment to the interferometer\nproduces the same effect as output misalignment and additionally decreases the\npower inside the interferometer. We also analyze dynamic HOM effects, such as\nbeam jitter created by the suspended mirrors of the BHD. Our analyses can be\ndirectly applied to any BHD implementation in a future GWD. Moreover, we apply\nour analytical techniques to the example of the speed meter proof of concept\nexperiment under construction in Glasgow. We find that for our experimental\nparameters, the performance of our seismic isolation system in the BHD paths is\ncompatible with the design sensitivity of the experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2016 16:46:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2017 19:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

In order to design and implement CTQWs in a\nrealistic scenario, one needs effective simulation tools for Hamiltonians that\ntake into account static noise and fluctuations in the lattice, i.e.\nHamiltonians containing stochastic terms. To this aim, we suggest a parallel\nalgorithm based on the Taylor series expansion of the evolution operator, and\ncompare its performances with those of algorithms based on the exact\ndiagonalization of the Hamiltonian or a 4-th order Runge-Kutta integration. We\nprove that both Taylor-series expansion and Runge-Kutta algorithms are reliable\nand have a low computational cost, the Taylor-series expansion showing the\nadditional advantage of a memory allocation not depending on the precision of\ncalculation.

In particular, for the $d$-wave case, a very\nrobust two-dimensional Weyl superconductor (dWSC) is realized independent of\nthe orientation of the spontaneous magnetization of the half-metal. The\nquasiparticle spectra of the dWSC show interesting evolution with the direction\nof the magnetization, featured by a series of Lifshitz transitions in the\nzero-energy contour of the quasiparticle spectrum. For a general magnetization\norientation of the half-metal, the state is a combination of a superconducting\ncomponent and a normal fluid component and is different from all known forms of\npairings. In addition, we find a transition between type-I and type-II Weyl\nnodes. This is also the first example of a type-II Weyl node in the presence of\nsuperconducting correlation. The symmetries and topological properties of the\nsystem are analyzed.

Our key contribution is TerpreT, a domain-specific\nlanguage for expressing program synthesis problems. A TerpreT model is composed\nof a specification of a program representation and an interpreter that\ndescribes how programs map inputs to outputs. The inference task is to observe\na set of input-output examples and infer the underlying program. From a TerpreT\nmodel we automatically perform inference using four different back-ends:\ngradient descent (thus each TerpreT model can be seen as defining a\ndifferentiable interpreter), linear program (LP) relaxations for graphical\nmodels, discrete satisfiability solving, and the Sketch program synthesis\nsystem. TerpreT has two main benefits. First, it enables rapid exploration of a\nrange of domains, program representations, and interpreter models. Second, it\nseparates the model specification from the inference algorithm, allowing proper\ncomparisons between different approaches to inference.\n  We illustrate the value of TerpreT by developing several interpreter models\nand performing an extensive empirical comparison between alternative inference\nalgorithms on a variety of program models. To our knowledge, this is the first\nwork to compare gradient-based search over program space to traditional\nsearch-based alternatives. Our key empirical finding is that constraint solvers\ndominate the gradient descent and LP-based formulations.\n  This is a workshop summary of a longer report at arXiv:1608.04428\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2016 20:08:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-05"}

This conceptually novel approach combines the advantages of both\nmachine-learning and template-fitting methods by building template SEDs\ndirectly from the training data. This is made computationally tractable with\nGaussian Processes operating in flux--redshift space, encoding the physics of\nredshift and the projection of galaxy SEDs onto photometric band passes. This\nmethod alleviates the need of acquiring representative training data or\nconstructing detailed galaxy SED models; it requires only that the photometric\nband passes and calibrations be known or have parameterized unknowns.

Parity-violation (PV) in the hadronic\nweak interaction and the search for exotic forces that depend on the relative\nspin and velocity, are two questions of fundamental physics that can be studied\nvia the neutron spin rotations that arise from the interaction of polarized\ncold neutrons and unpolarized matter. The Neutron Spin Rotation (NSR)\ncollaboration developed a neutron polarimeter, capable of determining neutron\nspin rotations of the order of $10^{-7}$ rad per meter of traversed material.\nThis paper describes two key components of the NSR apparatus, responsible for\nthe transport and manipulation of the spin of the neutrons before and after the\ntarget region, which is surrounded by magnetic shielding and where residual\nmagnetic fields need to be below 100 \\textmu G. These magnetic field devices,\ncalled input and output coils, provide the magnetic field for adiabatic\ntransport of the neutron spin in the regions outside the magnetic shielding\nwhile producing a sharp nonadiabatic transition of the neutron spin when\nentering/exiting the low-magnetic-field region. In addition, the coils are self\ncontained, forcing the return magnetic flux into a compact region of space to\nminimize fringe fields outside. The design of the input and output coil is\nbased on the magnetic scalar potential method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2016 22:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

To bridge the gap between the theory\nand practice, we propose a new analytical framework called the success\nprobability of exploration.

It has been proposed that magnetized winds, launched\nfrom the ionized disk surface, could drive accretion in the presence of a\nlarge-scale magnetic field. The efficiency and the impact of these surface\nwinds on the disk structure is still highly uncertain. We present the first\nglobal simulations of a weakly ionized disk that exhibits large-scale\nmagnetized winds. We also study the impact of self-organization, which was\npreviously demonstrated only in non-stratified models. We perform numerical\nsimulations of stratified disks with the PLUTO code. We compute the ionization\nfraction dynamically, and account for all three non-ideal MHD effects: ohmic\nand ambipolar diffusions, and the Hall drift. Simplified heating and cooling\ndue to non-thermal radiation is also taken into account in the disk atmosphere.\nWe find that disks can be accreting or not, depending on the configuration of\nthe large-scale magnetic field. Magnetothermal winds, driven both by magnetic\nacceleration and heating of the atmosphere, are obtained in the accreting case.\nIn some cases, these winds are asymmetric, ejecting predominantly on one side\nof the disk. The wind mass loss rate depends primarily on the average ratio of\nmagnetic to thermal pressure in the disk midplane. The non-accreting case is\ncharacterized by a meridional circulation, with accretion layers at the disk\nsurface and decretion in the midplane.

In particular, the\nextent to which the recurrent parameters can be compressed and the impact on\nshort-term memory performance, is not well understood. In this paper, we study\nthe effect of complexity reduction, through singular value decomposition rank\nreduction, on RNN and minimal gated recurrent unit (MGRU) networks for several\ntasks.

We apply\nthese methods to re-assess and update results from previous FRB surveys,\nfinding as follows. 1) Thirteen FRBs detected across five\nhigh-Galactic-latitude (> 30$^\\circ$) surveys are highly significant $(p =\n5\\times 10^{-5})$ evidence of a higher rate relative to the single FRB detected\nacross four low-latitude (< 5$^\\circ$) surveys, even after accounting for\neffects that dampen Galactic plane sensitivity. High- vs. mid-latitude (5 to\n15$^\\circ$) is marginally significant $(p = 0.03)$. 2) A meta analysis of\ntwelve heterogeneous surveys gives an FRB rate of 2866 sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$\nabove 1 Jy at high Galactic latitude (95% confidence 1121 to 7328) and 285\nsky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ at low/mid latitudes (95% from 48 to 1701). 3) Using the\nParkes HTRU high-latitude setup requires 193 observing hours to achieve 50%\nprobability of detecting an FRB and 937 hours to achieve 95% probability, based\non the ten detections of (Champion et al. 2016) and appropriately accounting\nfor uncertainty in the unknown Poisson rate. 4) Two quick detections at Parkes\nfrom a small number of high-latitude fields (Ravi et al. 2015; Petroff et al.\n2015) tentatively favor a look long survey style relative to the scan wide HTRU\nsurvey, but only at $p = 0.07$ significance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2016 23:37:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-06"}

The\nefficiency of existing estimators depends critically on correctly specifying\nthe conditional expectation of the estimating function given the observed\ncomponents of the random observations. When the conditional expectation is not\ncorrectly specified, the efficiency of estimation can be severely compromised\neven if the propensity function (of missingness) is correctly specified. We\npropose an efficient estimator which enjoys the double-robustness property and\ncan achieve the semiparametric efficiency bound within the class of the\nestimating functions that are generated by the estimating function of\nestimating equations, if both the propensity model and the regression model (of\nthe conditional expectation) are specified correctly. Moreover, if the\npropensity model is specified correctly but the regression model is\nmisspecified, the proposed estimator still achieves a semiparametric efficiency\nlower bound within a more general class of estimating functions. Simulation\nresults suggest that the proposed estimators are robust against\nmisspecification of the propensity model or regression model and outperform\nmany existing competitors in the sense of having smaller mean-square errors.\nMoreover, using our approach for statistical inference requires neither\nresampling nor kernel smoothing.

The multiply-and-accumulate operations\nperform discrete-time charge-domain signal processing using passive switches\nand 300 aF unit capacitors. The computation is digitized with a 6 b\nasynchronous successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter. The\nanalyses of incomplete charge accumulation and thermal noise are discussed. The\ndesign was fabricated in 40 nm CMOS, and experimental measurements of\nmultiplication are illustrated using matched filtering and image convolutions\nto analyze noise and offset. Two applications are highlighted: 1)\nenergy-efficient feature extraction layer performing both compression and\nclassification in a neural network for an analog front end and 2) analog\nacceleration for solving optimization problems that are traditionally performed\nin the digital domain. The chip obtains measured efficiencies of 8.7 TOPS/W at\n1 GHz for the first application and 7.7 TOPS/W at 2.5 GHz for the second\napplication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2016 07:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-06"}

Two nonsmooth\nalgorithms are proposed to achieve the distributed average tracking goal. In\nour first proposed algorithm, each agent tracks the average of the reference\ninputs, where each agent is required to have access to only its own position\nand the relative positions between itself and its neighbors. To relax the\nrestrictive assumption on admissible reference inputs, we propose the second\nalgorithm. A filter is introduced for each agent to generate an estimation of\nthe average of the reference inputs. Then, each agent tracks its own generated\nsignal to achieve the average tracking goal in a distributed manner.

Using the derived $^{13}$CO\ncube, we have identified 187 high-significance ($> 8\\sigma$) GMCs by employing\nthe CLUMPFIND algorithm. The molecular gas masses of GMCs $M_{\\rm ^{13}CO}$,\nderived from the $^{13}$CO data, range from $1.8 \\times 10^4 ~ M_\\odot$ to $4.2\n\\times 10^7 ~M_\\odot$.\n  A mass function of GMCs in NGC 1068 has been obtained for the first time at\n$\\sim$100 pc resolution.

In particular, we consider one-dimensional quasiperiodic models\nwith single-particle mobility edges. Although a conventional perspective\nsuggests that delocalized states act as a thermalizing bath for the localized\nstates in the presence of of interactions, there is evidence that such systems\ncan display non-ergodicity. This is in part due to the fact that the\ndelocalized states do not have any kind of protection due to symmetry or\ntopology and are thus susceptible to localization. A study of non-interacting\nincommensurate models shows that they admit extended, partially extended, and\nfully localized many-body states. These models cannot thermalize dynamically\nand remain localized upon the introduction of interactions. In particular, for\na certain range of energy, the system can host a non-ergodic extended (i.e.\nmetallic) phase in which the energy eigenstates violate the eigenstate\nthermalization hypothesis (ETH) but the entanglement entropy obeys volume-law\nscaling. The level statistics and entanglement growth also indicate the lack of\nergodicity in these models. The phenomenon of localization and non-ergodicity\nin a system with interactions despite the presence of single-particle\ndelocalized states is closely related to the so-called \"many-body proximity\neffect\" and can also be observed in models with disorder coupled to systems\nwith delocalized degrees of freedom. Many-body localization in systems with\nincommensurate potentials (without single-particle mobility edges) have been\nrealized experimentally, and we show how this can be modified to study the the\neffects of such mobility edges. Demonstrating the failure of thermalization in\nthe presence of a single-particle mobility edge in the thermodynamic limit\nwould indicate a more robust violation of the ETH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2016 15:48:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

The second\nstage is fine grouping based on genomic characteristics, such as copy number\nvariation and somatic mutation, of patients in a subgroup resulting from the\nfirst stage. Generally, this framework offers a mechanism to mix multiple forms\nof data, both phenotypic and genomic, to most effectively define individual\npatients for personalized predictions. This method provides the ability to\ndetect correlation among all factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2016 17:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-06"}

For instance, ice sheet melt may contribute\nsignificantly to global sea level rise. Understanding the current state of WAIS\nis therefore of great interest. WAIS is drained by fast-flowing glaciers which\nare major contributors to ice loss. Hence, understanding the stability and\ndynamics of glaciers is critical for predicting the future of the ice sheet.\nGlacier dynamics are driven by the interplay between the topography,\ntemperature and basal conditions beneath the ice. A glacier dynamics model\ndescribes the interactions between these processes. We develop a hierarchical\nBayesian model that integrates multiple ice sheet surface data sets with a\nglacier dynamics model. Our approach allows us to (1) infer important\nparameters describing the glacier dynamics, (2) learn about ice sheet\nthickness, and (3) account for errors in the observations and the model.\nBecause we have relatively dense and accurate ice thickness data from the\nThwaites Glacier in West Antarctica, we use these data to validate the proposed\napproach.
