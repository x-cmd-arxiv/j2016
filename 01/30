The issue is often addressed by allowing for a meridional circulation,\nbut this is not devoid of theoretical complications. Models of rotation in the\nSun which maintain strict radiative equilibrium, making use of the observation\nthat the Sun is not in a state of barotropic rotation, have recently been\nsuggested. To investigate the dynamical behaviour of these solutions, we study\nthe local stability of stratified, weakly magnetized, differentially rotating\nfluids to non-axisymmetric perturbations. Finite heat conductivity, kinematic\nviscosity, and resistivity are present. The evolution of local embedded\nperturbations is governed by a set of coupled, ordinary differential equations\nwith time-dependent coefficients. Two baroclinic models of rotation for the\nupper radiative zone and tachocline are studied: (i) an interpolation based on\nhelioseismology data, (ii) a theoretical solution directly compatible with\nradiative equilibrium. The growth of the local Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke\ninstability appears to be suppressed, largely because of the viscosity. An\nextensive exploration of wavenumber space is carried out, with and without a\nmagnetic field. Although we easily find classical local instabilities when they\nought formally to be present, for the Sun the analysis reveals neither unstable\nsolutions, nor even solutions featuring a large transient growth. We have not\nruled out larger scale or nonlinear instabilities, nor have we rigorously\nproven local stability.

A much studied class of problems targets uniform sampling of\nsimple graphs with given degree sequence or also with given degree correlations\nexpressed in the form of a joint degree matrix. One approach is to use Markov\nchains based on edge switches (swaps) that preserve the constraints, are\nirreducible (ergodic) and fast mixing. In 1999, Kannan, Tetali and Vempala\n(KTV) proposed a simple swap Markov chain for sampling graphs with given degree\nsequence and conjectured that it mixes rapidly (in poly-time) for arbitrary\ndegree sequences. While the conjecture is still open, it was proven for special\ndegree sequences, in particular, for those of undirected and directed regular\nsimple graphs, of half-regular bipartite graphs, and of graphs with certain\nbounded maximum degrees. Here we prove the fast mixing KTV conjecture for\nnovel, exponentially large classes of irregular degree sequences. Our method is\nbased on a canonical decomposition of degree sequences into split graph degree\nsequences, a structural theorem for the space of graph realizations and on a\nfactorization theorem for Markov chains. After introducing bipartite splitted\ndegree sequences, we also generalize the canonical split graph decomposition\nfor bipartite and directed graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2016 19:16:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 18:15:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

The most\ncommon track finding techniques in use today, however, are those based on the\nKalman Filter. Significant experience has been accumulated with these\ntechniques on real tracking detector systems, both in the trigger and offline.\nThey are known to provide high physics performance, are robust, and are in use\ntoday at the LHC.

This is accounted for by the diminishing impact of the\nviscous stresses exerted within Ekman boundary layers and the associated\nvertical momentum transport by Ekman pumping. By contrast, in the nonlinear\nregime recent experiments and supporting simulations are now providing evidence\nthat the efficiency of heat transport remains strongly influenced by Ekman\npumping in the rapidly rotating limit. In this paper, a reduced model is\ndeveloped for the case of low Rossby number convection in a plane layer\ngeometry with no-slip upper and lower boundaries held at fixed temperatures. A\ncomplete description of the dynamics requires the existence of three distinct\nregions within the fluid layer: a geostrophically balanced interior where fluid\nmotions are predominately aligned with the axis of rotation, Ekman boundary\nlayers immediately adjacent to the bounding plates, and thermal wind layers\ndriven by Ekman pumping in between. The reduced model uses a classical Ekman\npumping parameterization to alleviate the need for spatially resolving the\nEkman boundary layers. Results are presented for both linear stability theory\nand a special class of nonlinear solutions described by a single horizontal\nspatial wavenumber. It is shown that Ekman pumping allows for significant\nenhancement in the heat transport relative to that observed in simulations with\nstress-free boundaries. Without the intermediate thermal wind layer the\nnonlinear feedback from Ekman pumping would be able to generate a heat\ntransport that diverges to infinity. This layer arrests this blowup resulting\nin finite heat transport at a significantly enhanced value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2016 20:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

The origin of these Ultra\nDiffuse Galaxies (UDGs) remains puzzling, as the interpretation of the\nobservational results has been hindered by the subjective selection of UDGs,\nand the limited study of only the Coma (and some examples in the Virgo-)\ncluster. We extend the study of UDGs using 8 clusters in the redshift range\n0.044<z<0.063 with deep g- and r-band imaging data taken with MegaCam at the\nCFHT. We describe an automatic selection pipeline for quantitative\nidentification, tested for completeness using image simulations of these\ngalaxies. We find that the abundance of the UDGs we can detect increases with\ncluster mass, reaching ~200 in typical haloes of M200~10^15 Msun. The cluster\nUDGs have colours consistent with the cluster red sequence, and have a steep\nsize distribution that declines as n~r_eff^-3.4. Their radial distribution is\nsignificantly steeper than NFW in the outskirts, and is significantly shallower\nin the inner parts. They follow the same radial distribution as the more\nmassive quiescent galaxies in the clusters, except within the core region of\nr<0.15XR200 (or <300 kpc). Within this region the number density of UDGs drops\nand is consistent with zero. These diffuse galaxies can only resist tidal\nforces down to this cluster-centric distance if they are highly centrally\ndark-matter dominated. The observation that the radial distribution of more\ncompact dwarf galaxies (r_eff<1.0 kpc) with similar luminosities follows the\nsame distribution as the UDGs, but exist down to a smaller distance of 100kpc\nfrom the cluster centres, indicates that they may have similarly massive\nsub-haloes as the UDGs.

This recent quenching is confirmed by strong Balmer\nabsorption, particularly $H\\delta$. Remarkably, this proves that at least some\nintermediate-mass galaxies have already quenched as early as $z\\sim2.8$.\nAdditionally, we have measured a velocity dispersion\n($\\sigma=187\\pm43~\\mathrm{km/s}$), making this the highest-redshift quiescent\ngalaxy with a dispersion measurement. We confirm that this galaxy falls on the\nsame mass fundamental plane (MFP) as galaxies at z=2.2, consistent with little\nto no evolution in the MFP up to z=2.8. Overall this galaxy is proof of\nexistence of intermediate-mass quenched galaxies in the distant universe, and\nthat lensing is a powerful tool for determining their properties with improved\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2016 21:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

These 'binomial quantum codes' are formed from a finite\nsuperposition of Fock states weighted with binomial coefficients. The binomial\ncodes can exactly correct errors that are polynomial up to a specific degree in\nbosonic creation and annihilation operators, including amplitude damping and\ndisplacement noise as well as boson addition and dephasing errors. For\nrealistic continuous-time dissipative evolution, the codes can perform\napproximate quantum error correction to any given order in the timestep between\nerror detection measurements. We present an explicit approximate quantum error\nrecovery operation based on projective measurements and unitary operations. The\nbinomial codes are tailored for detecting boson loss and gain errors by means\nof measurements of the generalized number parity. We discuss optimization of\nthe binomial codes and demonstrate that by relaxing the parity structure, codes\nwith even lower unrecoverable error rates can be achieved. The binomial codes\nare related to existing two-mode bosonic codes but offer the advantage of\nrequiring only a single bosonic mode to correct amplitude damping as well as\nthe ability to correct other errors. Our codes are similar in spirit to 'cat\ncodes' based on superpositions of the coherent states, but offer several\nadvantages such as smaller mean number, exact rather than approximate\northonormality of the code words, and an explicit unitary operation for\nrepumping energy into the bosonic mode. The binomial quantum codes are\nrealizable with current superconducting circuit technology and they should\nprove useful in other quantum technologies, including bosonic quantum memories,\nphotonic quantum communication, and optical-to-microwave up- and\ndown-conversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2016 21:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jul 2016 16:46:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2016 18:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-19"}

We started an observational\ncampaign within the GAPS collaboration to search for and characterize planets\nin OCs We monitored the Praesepe member Pr0211 to improve the eccentricity of\nthe Hot-Jupiter (HJ) already known to orbit this star and search for additional\nplanets. An eccentric orbit for the HJ would support a planet-planet scattering\nprocess after its formation. From 2012 to 2015, we collected 70 radial velocity\n(RV) measurements with HARPS-N and 36 with TRES of Pr0211. Simultaneous\nphotometric observations were carried out with the robotic STELLA telescope in\norder to characterize the stellar activity. We discovered a long-term trend in\nthe RV residuals that we show to be due to the presence of a second, massive,\nouter planet. Orbital parameters for the two planets are derived by\nsimultaneously fitting RVs and photometric light curves, with the activity\nsignal modelled as a series of sinusoids at the rotational period of the star\nand its harmonics. We confirm that Pr0211b has a nearly circular orbit ($e =\n0.02 \\pm 0.01$), with an improvement of a factor two with respect to the\nprevious determination of its eccentricity, and estimate that Pr0211c has a\nmass $M_p\\sin i = 7.9 \\pm 0.2 M_J$, a period $P>$3500 days and a very eccentric\norbit ($e>$0.60). Such peculiar systems may be typical of open clusters if the\nplanet-planet scattering phase leading to the formation of HJs is caused by\nstellar encounters rather than unstable primordial orbits. Pr0211 is the first\nmulti-planet system discovered around an OC star.

X-ray reverberation is detected from an\nincreasing sample of Seyfert galaxies and a number of common properties are\nobserved, including a transition from the characteristic reverberation\nsignature at high frequencies to a hard lag within the continuum component at\nlow frequencies, as well a pronounced dip in the reverberation lag at 3keV.\nThese features are not trivially explained by the reverberation of X-rays\noriginating from simple point sources. We therefore model reverberation from\ncoronae extended both over the surface of the disc and vertically. Causal\npropagation through its extent for both the simple case of constant velocity\npropagation and propagation linked to the viscous timescale in the underlying\naccretion disc is included as well as stochastic variability arising due to\nturbulence locally on the disc.

These are functions on chord diagrams satisfying so-called\n4-term relations. In the study of the sl2 weight system, it was shown that its\nvalue on a chord diagram depends on the intersection graph of the diagram\nrather than on the diagram itself. Moreover, it was shown that the value of\nthis weight system on an intersection graph depends on the cy- cle matroid of\nthe graph rather than on the graph itself. This result arose the question\nwhether there is a natural way to introduce a 4-term relation on the space\nspanned by matroids, similar to the one for graphs. It happened however that\nthe answer is negative: there are graphs having isomorphic cycle matroids such\nthat applying the \"second Vassiliev move\" to a pair of corresponding vertices\na;b of the graphs we obtain two graphs with nonisomorphic matroids.\n  The goal of the present paper is to show that the situation is different for\nbinary delta-matroids: one can define both the first and the second Vassiliev\nmoves for binary delta-matroids and introduce a 4-term relation for them in\nsuch a way that the mapping taking a chord diagram to its delta-matroid\nrespects the corresponding 4-term relations. Moreover, this mapping admits a\nnatural extension to chord diagrams on several circles, which correspond to\nsingular links. Delta-matroids were introduced by A. Bouchet for the purpose of\nstudying embedded graphs, whence their relationship with (multiloop) chord\ndiagrams is by no means unexpected.

Furthermore each modality has also been exploited to search for more\ngeneralized axion-like particles, that will also be discussed in this report.\nWe are hopeful, even optimistic, that the next review of the subject will\nconcern the discovery of the axion, its properties, and its exploitation as a\nprobe of early universe cosmology and structure formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2016 23:42:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-02"}

Using both\ntailored 1D atmospheric models and 3D hydrodynamical models, we derive\nmagnesium isotopic ratios from four features of MgH near 5135{\\AA} in 13 giants\nnear the tip of the RGB, using high signal-to-noise, high-resolution spectra.\nWe derive the magnesium isotopic ratios for all stars and find no significant\noffset of the isotopic distribution between the pristine and the polluted\npopulations. Furthermore, we do not detect any statistically significant\ndifferences in the spread in the Mg isotopes in either population. No trends\nwere found between the Mg isotopes and [Al/Fe]. The inclusion of 3D atmospheres\nhas a significant impact on the derived 25Mg/24Mg ratio, increasing it by a\nfactor of up to 2.5, compared to 1D. The 26Mg/24Mg ratio, on the other hand,\nessentially remains unchanged. We confirm the results seen from other globular\nclusters, where no strong variation in the isotopic ratios is observed between\nstellar populations, for observed ranges in [Al/Fe]. We see no evidence for any\nsignificant activation of the Mg-Al burning chain. The use of 3D atmospheres\ncauses an increase of a factor of up to 2.5 in the fraction of 25Mg, resolving\npart of the discrepancy between the observed isotopic fraction and the\npredictions from pollution models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2016 02:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

In a recent\nstudy, we showed that mutual exclusive combinations of genetic events in cancer\nhint at naturally occurring synthetic lethal combinations, and therefore by\nsystematically mining for these combinations we can identify novel therapeutic\ntargets for cancer. Based on this, we had identified a list of 718 genes that\nare mutually exclusive to six DNA-damage response genes in cancer. Here, we\nextend these results to identify a subset of 43 genes whose over-expression\ncorrelates with significantly poor survival in estrogen receptor-negative\nbreast cancers, and thus provide a promising list of potential therapeutic\ntargets and/or biomarkers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2016 09:55:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-02"}

Existing VM management algorithms fall into two\ncategories based on whether the VMs' resource demands are assumed to be static\nor dynamic. The former category fails to maximize the resource utilization as\nthey cannot adapt to the dynamic nature of VMs' resource demands. Most\napproaches in the latter category are heuristical and lack theoretical\nperformance guarantees. In this work, we formulate dynamic VM management as a\nlarge-scale Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and derive an optimal\nsolution. Our analysis of real-world data traces supports our choice of the\nmodeling approach. However, solving the large-scale MDP problem suffers from\nthe curse of dimensionality. Therefore, we further exploit the special\nstructure of the problem and propose an approximate MDP-based dynamic VM\nmanagement method, called MadVM. We prove the convergence of MadVM and analyze\nthe bound of its approximation error. Moreover, MadVM can be implemented in a\ndistributed system, which should suit the needs of real data centers. Extensive\nsimulations based on two real-world workload traces show that MadVM achieves\nsignificant performance gains over two existing baseline approaches in power\nconsumption, resource shortage and the number of VM migrations. Specifically,\nthe more intensely the resource demands fluctuate, the more MadVM outperforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2016 09:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-02"}

Such geometries are endowed with a group\nsymmetry under Klein, which is equivalent to the phenomenological symmetry, and\nmany of them have an essential physical interpretation. That is why they are to\nbe defined precisely and explored as purely mathematical objects. In this\nmonograph we treat the mathematical basics of the TPS and present the results\nof attempts at classification that have been obtained by now. We hope that the\nmonograph will be of interest for research workers and teachers, senior and\npost graduate students, as well as to all those interested in algebra, geometry\nand theoretical physics who would like to use the TPS in their research\nprojects or could want to contribute to the development of its mathematical\napparatus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2016 14:26:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Apr 2019 13:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

The use of a fan beam\nsource illumination to speed up data acquisition relative to a pencil beam\npresents computational challenges. To facilitate the use of iterative\nalgorithms based on a penalized Poisson log-likelihood function, efficient\ncomputational implementation of the forward and backward models are needed. Our\nproposed implementation exploits physical symmetries and structural properties\nof the system and suggests a joint system-algorithm design, where the system\ndesign choices are influenced by computational considerations, and in turn lead\nto reduced reconstruction time. Computational-time speedups of approximately\n146 and 32 are achieved in the computation of the forward and backward models,\nrespectively. Results validating the forward model and reconstruction algorithm\nare presented on simulated analytic and Monte Carlo data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2016 16:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-22"}

At the present time,\ncomputational chemistry has reached a certain maturity which allows prediction\nof materials properties that are difficult to observe experimentally. However,\nunderstanding of the roles of dopants on the oxygen ion conduction in CeO2 is\nstill incomplete for quantitatively reliable analysis due to strong electron\ncorrelation of 4f electrons. In this study, density functional theory\ncalculations with Hubbard U corrections are conducted to discuss ionic/covalent\ninteractions in rare-earth-doped CeO2 and their consequences to oxygen ion\nconduction. The study suggests that the variable occupancy of empty 4f orbitals\nis important typically for early Ln elements to produce the covalent\ninteractions that essentially affect formation and migration of oxygen\nvacancies. This finding is important in understanding the factors responsible\nfor oxygen ion diffusion in doped CeO2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2016 03:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

We\nlooked for communities within the network and characterized them in terms of\nmembers' attributes, such as electoral district and party. To gain insight on\nthe nested structure of communities, we constructed a hierarchical tree of\nmembers from the correlation matrix.

Finally, we investigated the\nrole played by specific individuals, at a local level. In particular, whether\nthey act as proponents who gather consensus, or as signers.

Here, these limitations\nare dealt with by the definition of two independent bipartite networks: a\ndestination share network and\\ a\\ commodity share network.
