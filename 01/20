It\nis known that when the matrices of the set have a common nonincreasing\npolyhedral norm, all infinite products converge to zero if and only if all\ninfinite periodic products with period smaller than a certain value converge to\nzero, and bounds exist on that value.\n  We provide a stronger bound holding for both polyhedral norms and polyhedral\nseminorms. In the latter case, the matrix products do not necessarily converge\nto 0, but all trajectories of the associated system converge to a common\ninvariant space. We prove our bound to be tight, in the sense that for any\npolyhedral seminorm, there is a set of matrices such that not all infinite\nproducts converge, but every periodic product with period smaller than our\nbound does converge.\n  Our technique is based on an analysis of the combinatorial structure of the\nface lattice of the unit ball of the nonincreasing seminorm. The bound we\nobtain is equal to half the size of the largest antichain in this lattice.\nExplicitly evaluating this quantity may be challenging in some cases. We\ntherefore link our problem with the Sperner property: the property that, for\nsome graded posets, -- in this case the face lattice of the unit ball -- the\nsize of the largest antichain is equal to the size of the largest rank level.\n  We show that some sets of matrices with invariant polyhedral seminorms lead\nto posets that do not have that Sperner property.

The comparison with ad-hoc\nchemo-spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution indicates that the mass of\nthe Halpha emitting gas in the tail is comparable to that of the cold phase\nstripped from the disc, suggesting that the gas is ionised within the tail\nduring the stripping process.

In this thesis we approach affine and\nprojective planes from a constructive point of view and we base our geometry on\nlocal rings instead of fields. We start by constructing projective and affine\nplanes over local rings and establishing forms of Desargues' Theorem and\nPappus' Theorem which hold for these. From this analysis we derive coherent\ntheories of projective and affine planes. The great Greek mathematicians of the\nclassical period used geometry as the basis for their theory of quantities. The\nmodern version of this idea is the reconstruction of algebra from geometry. We\nshow how we can construct a local ring whenever we are given an affine or a\nprojective plane. This enables us to describe the classifying toposes of our\ntheories of affine and projective planes as extensions of the Zariski topos by\ncertain group actions. Through these descriptions of the classifying toposes,\nthe links between the theories of local rings, affine and projective planes\nbecome clear. In particular, the geometric morphisms between these classifying\ntoposes are all induced by group homomorphisms even though they demonstrate\ncomplicated constructions in geometry. In this thesis, we also prove results in\ntopos theory which are applied to these geometric morphisms to give Morita\nequivalences between some further theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 17:03:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Here, we consider an incompressible and flat elastomer film of an\naxisymmetric shape confined between two large hard co-planar substrates, with\nthe axis of the film perpendicular to the substrates. We address the impact\nthat thermal fluctuations of the cross-links have on the free energy of elastic\ndeformation of the system, subject to the requirement that the fluctuating\nelastomer cannot detach from the substrates. We examine the behavior of the\ndeformation free energy for one case where a rigid pinning boundary condition\nis applied to a class of elastic fluctuations at the confining surfaces, and\nanother case where the same elastic fluctuations are subjected to soft \"gluing\"\npotentials. We find that there can be significant departures (both quantitative\nand qualitative) from the prediction of classical rubber elasticity theory when\nelastic fluctuations are included. Finally, we compare the character of the\nattractive part of the elastic fluctuation-induced, or pseudo-Casimir, stress\nwith the standard thermal Casimir stress in confined but non-elastomeric\nsystems, finding the same power law decay behavior when a rigid pinning\nboundary condition is applied, for the case of the gluing potential, we find\nthat the leading order correction to the attractive part of the fluctuation\nstress decays inversely with the inter-substrate separation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 17:26:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2016 05:28:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 12:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-12"}

Researchers proposed the Economic Complexity Index (ECI) and\nthe country Fitness index to estimate a country's number of capabilities from\ninternational export data; these measures predict economic growth better than\nconventional variables such as human capital. This paper offers a simpler\nmeasure of a country's knowhow, Log Product Diversity (or LPD, the logarithm of\na country's number of products), which can be derived from a one-parameter\ncombinatorial model of production in which a set of knowhows combine with some\nprobability to turn raw materials into a product. ECI and log-fitness can be\ninterpreted theoretically (using the combinatorial model) and empirically as\npotentially noisy estimates of LPD; moreover, controlling for natural\nresources, the simple measure better explains the cross-country differences in\nGDP and in GDP per capita.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 17:38:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 20:50:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 22 Jul 2018 22:14:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 04:00:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2023 18:36:27 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 16:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

Tiny neutrino masses are naturally\ngenerated by the loop effect of new particles with their couplings and masses\nto be of order 0.1-1 and TeV, respectively. The lightest right-handed neutrino,\nwhich runs in the three-loop diagram, can be a dark matter candidate. In\naddition, the deviation in the measured value of the muon anomalous magnetic\nmoment from its prediction in the standard model can be compensated by one-loop\ndiagrams with exotic multi-charged leptons and scalar bosons. For the diphoton\nevent, an additional isospin singlet real scalar field plays the role to\nexplain the excess by taking its mass of 750 GeV, where it is produced from the\ngluon fusion production via the mixing with the standard model like Higgs\nboson. We find that the cross section of the diphoton process can be obtained\nto be a few fb level by taking the masses of new charged particles to be about\n375 GeV and related coupling constants to be order 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 19:12:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

One efficient way to investigate competing\norders is to first classify different class of excitations in a given quantum\nphase, then study their competing responses under various external probes. This\nstrategy may not only lead to deep understanding of the quantum phase itself,\nbut also its deep connections to various other quantum phases nearby. We\nimplement this approach by studying the Rotated Ferromagnetic Heisenberg model\n(RFHM) in two different transverse fields $h_x$ and $h_z$ which can be\nintuitively visualized as studying spin-orbit couplings (SOC) effects in 2d\nIsing or anisotropic XY model in a transverse field. At a special SOC class, it\nwas known that the RFHM at a zero field owns an exact ground state called Y-x\nstate. It supports non only the commensurate C-C$_0$ and C-C$_{\\pi} $ magnons,\nbut also the in-commensurate C-IC magnons. These magnons are non-relativistic,\nnot contained in the exact ground state, so need to be thermally excited. Their\ndramatic response under the longitudinal $ h_y $ field was recently worked out\nby the authors. Here we find they respond very differently under the two\ntransverse fields. Any $h_x$ ($h_z$) changes the collinear Y-x state to a\ncanted co-planar YX-x (YZ-x) state which suffers quantum fluctuations. The\nC-C$_0$, C-C$_{\\pi} $ and C-IC magnons sneak into the quantum ground state,\nbecome relativistic and play leading roles even at $ T=0 $. We map out the\nboundaries among the C-C$_0$, C-C$_{\\pi} $ and C-IC magnons, especially the\ndetailed evolution of the C-IC magnons inside the canted phases. As $h_x$\n($h_z$) increases further, the C-C$_0$ magnons always win the competition and\nemerge as the seeds to drive a transition from the YX-x (YZ-x) to the X-FM (\nZ-FM ) which is shown to be in the 3d Ising universality class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 20:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}

This can be explained if the\nSU(2)$_R$ charged gauge bosons $W_R^\\pm$ have a mass of around 2 TeV and a\nright-handed neutrino with a mass of ${\\cal O}(1)$ TeV mainly decays to\nelectron. Indeed, recent results in several other experiments, especially that\nfrom the ATLAS diboson resonance search, also indicate signatures of such a 2\nTeV gauge boson. However, a lack of the same-sign electron events in the CMS\n$eejj$ search challenges the interpretation of the right-handed neutrino as a\nMajorana fermion. Taking this situation into account, in this paper, we\nconsider a possibility of explaining the CMS $eejj$ excess based on the\n$SU(2)_L\\otimes SU(2)_R\\otimes U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge theory with pseudo-Dirac\nneutrinos. We find that both the CMS excess events and the ATLAS diboson\nanomaly can actually be explained in this framework without conflicting with\nthe current experimental bounds. This setup in general allows sizable\nleft-right mixing in both the charged gauge boson and neutrino sectors, which\nenables us to probe this model through the trilepton plus missing-energy search\nat the LHC.

Preliminary\nsimulations show that, depending on threshold, a discrimination of 99.99\\% to\n99.9999+\\% can be achieved, which is on par or better than many current\nexperiments. A prototype is being built at the University at Albany, SUNY. The\nprototype is currently undergoing seals, thermal, and compression testing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 23:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-11"}

This method relies on hyperbolic\ntangent functions of rational arguments as connecting functions at the\ndiscontinuities, each argument being the reciprocal of Newton binomials that\ndepend on the abscissae that define the domain of the discontinuous function\nand upon the abscissae of discontinuities. Our approximants take the form of\nlinear combinations of such hyperbolic tangent functions with coefficients that\nare obtained by solving a linear system of inhomogeneous equations whose\nrighthand sides are the partition functions that define the given discontinuous\nfunction. These approximants are analytic, and being free from the Gibbs\nphenomenon certainly converge at the discontinuity points much better than\nother known approximants to discontinuous functions, typical relative errors\nbeing of the order of 10-14 even when as close as 10-12 to the discontinuity\npoints. Moreover, they can be readily scaled to larger intervals. Our method is\nhere illustrated with a representative set of discontinuous mathematical\nphysics functions, and by studying the dynamics of an oscillator subjected to a\ndiscontinuous force, but it can be applied to important cases of discontinuous\nfunctions in physics, mathematics, engineering and physical chemistry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 23:32:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 03:59:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

Here, we\nshow that EIT can be achieved by engineering decay rates in a superconducting\ncircuit QED system through a classical driving field on the qubit. Without such\na driving field, the superconducting qubit and the cavity field are\napproximately decoupled in the large detuning regime, and thus the eigenstates\nof the system are approximately product states of the cavity field and qubit\nstates. However, the driving field can strongly mix these product states and\nso-called polariton states can be formed. The weights of the states for the\nqubit and cavity field in the polariton states can be tuned by the driving\nfield, and thus the decay rates of the polariton states can be changed.

This mass is an order of magnitude\ngreater than originally reported. Using the latest (M_bh)-n, (M_bh)-(M_sph,*)\nand (M_bh)-sigma relations, the expected black hole mass is respectively\n(0.57^{+1.29}_{-0.40})x10^9 M_sun, (1.58^{+4.04}_{-1.13})x10^9 M_sun, and\n(2.27^{+4.04}_{-1.44})x10^9 M_sun (using sigma=300 km/s) for which the\n`sphere-of-influence' is 0\".31.

We deconvolve their ground-based V and I images obtained with FORS2\nat the VLT with initial spatial resolutions between 0.4 and 0.8 arcsec to\nachieve a final resolution of 0.1 arcsec with 0.05 arcsec pixels, which is\nclose to the resolution of the ACS at the HST.

We find that 50% of cluster spiral galaxies have disc V-I\ncolours redder by more than 1 sigma of the mean colours of their field\ncounterparts. This is well above the 16% expected for a normal distribution\ncentred on the field disc properties. The prominence of galaxies with red discs\ndepends neither on the mass of their parent cluster nor on the distance of the\ngalaxies to the cluster cores.

A general consensus on extractive summarization is that both\nrelevance and coverage are critical issues to address.

Maximal margin relevance (MMR) is a\nwidely-cited method since it takes both relevance and redundancy into account\nwhen generating a summary for a given document. In addition to MMR, there is\nonly a dearth of research concentrating on reducing redundancy or increasing\ndiversity for the spoken document summarization task, as far as we are aware.\nMotivated by these observations, two major contributions are presented in this\npaper. First, in contrast to MMR, which considers coverage by reducing\nredundancy, we propose two novel coverage-based methods, which directly\nincrease diversity.

The protection of equipment from beam accidents is more recent.\nIt is related to the increasing beam power of high-power proton accelerators\nsuch as ISIS, SNS, ESS and the PSI cyclotron, to the emission of synchrotron\nlight by electron-positron accelerators and FELs, and to the increase of energy\nstored in the beam (in particular for hadron colliders such as LHC).

Machine protection includes beam and equipment monitoring, a system to\nsafely stop beam operation (e.g. dumping the beam or stopping the beam at low\nenergy) and an interlock system providing the glue between these systems. The\nmost recent accelerator, the LHC, will operate with about 3x10 14 protons per\nbeam, corresponding to an energy stored in each beam of 360 MJ. This energy can\ncause massive damage to accelerator equipment in case of uncontrolled beam\nloss, and a single accident damaging vital parts of the accelerator could\ninterrupt operation for years.

The source showed numerous\ntype-I burst episodes during the XMM-Newton observation, and for this reason we\nstudied separately the persistent and burst epochs. We described the persistent\nemission with a combination of two soft thermal components, a cold thermal\nComptonization component (~2 keV) and an additional hard X-ray emission\ndescribed by a power-law (photon index ~2.3). The continuum components can be\nassociated with an accretion disc, the neutron star (NS) surface and a thermal\nComptonization emission coming out of an optically thick plasma region, while\nthe origin of the high energy tail is still under debate. In addition, a number\nof broad (~0.1-0.4 keV) emission features likely associated to reflection\nprocesses have been observed in the XMM-Newton data. The estimated 1.0-50 keV\nunabsorbed luminosity of the source is ~5x10^37 erg/s, about 25% of the\nEddington limit assuming a 1.4 solar mass NS.

The ferromagnetic stability of Mn doped\nGaAs, we find, increases with confinement therefore providing a route to higher\nferromagnetic transition temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 09:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

Firstly, we highlight the\nsimilarities between the ontologies of Kastner's possibilist transactional\ninterpretation (PTI) of quantum mechanics - an extension of Cramer's\ntransactional interpretation - and the authors' hidden-measurement\ninterpretation (HMI). Secondly, we observe that although a weighted symmetry\nbreaking (WSB) process was proposed in the PTI, to explain the actualization of\nincipient transactions, no specific mechanism was actually provided to explain\nwhy the weights of such symmetry breaking are precisely those given by the Born\nrule. In other terms, PTI, similarly to decoherence theory, doesn't explain a\nquantum measurement in a complete way, but just the transition from a pure\nstate to a fully reduced density matrix state. On the other hand, the recently\nderived extended Bloch representation (EBR) - a specific implementation the HMI\n- precisely provides such missing piece of explanation, i.e., a qualitative\ndescription of the WSB as a process of actualization of hidden\nmeasurement-interactions and, more importantly, a quantitative prediction of\nthe values of the associated weights that is compatible with the Born rule of\nprobabilistic assignment. Therefore, from the PTI viewpoint, the EBR provide\nthe missing link for a complete description of a quantum measurement. However,\nEBR is in a sense more general than PTI, as it does not rely on the specific\nnotion of transaction, and therefore remains compatible with other physical\nmechanisms that could be at the origin of the measurement-interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 10:05:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-06"}

In the\nunderdoped copper-oxides, high-temperature superconductivity condenses instead\nfrom a nonconventional metallic \"pseudogap\" phase that exhibits a variety of\nnon-Fermi liquid properties. Recently, it has become clear that a charge\ndensity wave (CDW) phase exists within the pseudogap regime, appearing at a\ntemperature $T_{CDW}$ just above $T_c$. The near coincidence of $T_c$ and\n$T_{CDW}$, as well the coexistence and competition of CDW and superconducting\norder below $T_c$, suggests that they are intimately related.

Our results suggest that the\nsuperfluid in underdoped cuprates is a condensate of coherently-mixed\nparticle-particle and particle-hole pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 10:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-21"}

The low frequencies\nhelp determine the kinematically relevant, low-wavenumber components of the\nvelocity model, which are in turn needed to avoid convergence of FWI to\nspurious local minima. However, acquiring data below 2 or 3 Hz from the field\nis a challenging and expensive task. In this paper we explore the possibility\nof synthesizing the low frequencies computationally from high-frequency data,\nand use the resulting prediction of the missing data to seed the frequency\nsweep of FWI. As a signal processing problem, bandwidth extension is a very\nnonlinear and delicate operation. It requires a high-level interpretation of\nbandlimited seismic records into individual events, each of which is\nextrapolable to a lower (or higher) frequency band from the non-dispersive\nnature of the wave propagation model. We propose to use the phase tracking\nmethod for the event separation task. The fidelity of the resulting\nextrapolation method is typically higher in phase than in amplitude. To\ndemonstrate the reliability of bandwidth extension in the context of FWI, we\nfirst use the low frequencies in the extrapolated band as data substitute, in\norder to create the low-wavenumber background velocity model, and then switch\nto recorded data in the available band for the rest of the iterations. The\nresulting method, EFWI for short, demonstrates surprising robustness to the\ninaccuracies in the extrapolated low frequency data. With two synthetic\nexamples calibrated so that regular FWI needs to be initialized at 1 Hz to\navoid local minima, we demonstrate that FWI based on an extrapolated [1, 5] Hz\nband, itself generated from data available in the [5, 15] Hz band, can produce\nreasonable estimations of the low wavenumber velocity models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 10:42:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-21"}

It is found that, despite being routinely used, an\nartificial collisionality is not a viable way of preventing recurrence in\nnumerical simulations without compromising the kinetic nature of the solution.\nMoreover, it is shown how numerical effects associated to the generation of\nfine velocity scales, can modify the physical features of the system evolution\neven in nonlinear regime.

Specifically, memristors are an emerging high-density\ntechnology where the individual memristors can be used as storage or to perform\ncomputation. The voltage applied across a memristor determines its behavior\n(storage vs. compute), which enables a configurable memristor substrate that\ncan embed computation with storage.\n  This paper explores accelerating point and range search queries as instances\nof the more general configurable combined compute and storage capabilities of\nmemristor arrays. We first present MemCAM, a configurable memristor-based\ncontent addressable memory for the cases when fast, infrequent searches over\nlarge datasets are required. For frequent searches, memristor lifetime becomes\na concern. To increase memristor array lifetime we introduce hybrid data\nstructures that combine trees with MemCAM using conventional CMOS\nprocessor/cache hierarchies for the upper levels of the tree and configurable\nmemristor technologies for lower levels.\n  We use SPICE to analyze energy consumption and access time of memristors and\nuse analytic models to evaluate the performance of configurable hybrid data\nstructures. The results show that with acceptable energy consumption our\nconfigurable hybrid data structures improve performance of search intensive\napplications and achieve lifetime in years or decades under continuous queries.\nFurthermore, the configurability of memristor arrays and the proposed data\nstructures provide opportunities to tune the trade- off between performance and\nlifetime and the data structures can be easily adapted to future memristors or\nother technologies with improved endurance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 14:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-21"}

First, by using\nnon-negative tensor factorization (NTF), we are able to cluster human behavior\nbased on spatio-temporal dimensions. Second, for understanding these clusters,\nwe propose to use HypTrails, a Bayesian approach for expressing and comparing\nhypotheses about human trails. To formalize hypotheses we utilize data that is\npublicly available on the Web, namely Foursquare data and census data provided\nby an open data platform. By applying this combination of approaches to taxi\ndata in Manhattan, we can discover and explain different patterns in human\nmobility that cannot be identified in a collective analysis.

Within the old Themis family a young sub-family, Beagle,\nformed less than 10 Myr ago, has been identified. We present the results of a\nspectroscopic survey in the visible and near infrared range of 22 Themis and 8\nBeagle families members. The Themis members investigated exhibit a wide range\nof spectral behaviors, while the younger Beagle family members look spectrally\nbluer with a smaller spectral slope variability. The best meteorite spectral\nanalogues found for both Themis and Beagle families members are carbonaceous\nchondrites having experienced different degrees of aqueous alteration,\nprevalently CM2 but also CV3 and CI, and some of them are chondrite samples\nbeing unusual or heated. We extended the spectral analysis including the data\navailable in the literature on Themis and Beagle families members, and we\nlooked for correlations between spectral behavior and physical parameters using\nthe albedo and size values derived from the WISE data. The analysis of this\nlarger sample confirm the spectral diversity within the Themis family and that\nBeagle members tend to be bluer and to have an higher albedo. The differences\nbetween the two family may be partially explained by space weathering\nprocesses, which act on these primitive surfaces in a similar way than on\nS-type asteroids, i.e. producing reddening and darkening. However we see\nseveral Themis members having albedos and spectral slopes similar to the young\nBeagle members. Alternative scenarios are proposed including heterogeneity in\nthe parent body having a compositional gradient with depth, and/or the survival\nof projectile fragments having a different composition than the parent body.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 14:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-21"}

This work reported 11 microwave type III pair events in 9 flares\nobserved by radio spectrometers in China and the Czech Republic at frequency of\n0.80 - 7.60 GHz during 1994 - 2014. These type III pairs occurred in flare\nimpulsive and postflare phases with separate frequency in range of 1.08 - 3.42\nGHz and frequency gap 10 - 1700 MHz. The frequency drift increases with the\nseparate frequency (f_{x}), the lifetime of each burst is anti-correlated to\nf_{x}, while the frequency gap is independent to f_{x}. In most events, the\nnormal branches are drifting obviously faster than the RS branches. The type\nIII pairs occurring in flare impulsive phase have lower separate frequency,\nlonger lifetime, wider frequency gap, and slower frequency drift than that\noccurring in postflare phase.

The\nelectromagnetic bandgap (EBG) effect in metasurfaces prevents all surface modes\nfrom propagating in a certain frequency band. While metasurfaces provide a\nnumber of important applications in microwave antennas and antenna arrays,\ntheir features are also highly suitable for MRI applications. In this work we\nmanufacture and experimentally study finite samples based on mushroom-type EBG\nmetasurfaces and employ them for suppression of inter-element coupling in\ndipole transmit coil arrays for body imaging at 7T. We show experimentally that\nemployment of the samples EBG leads to reduction of coupling between adjacent\nclosely-spaced dipole antenna elements of a 7T transmit/receive body array,\nwhich reduces scattering losses in neighboring channels and thereby improves\nthe B1+ efficiency. The setup consists of two fractionated dipole antennas\npreviously designed by the authors for body imaging at 7 Tesla. These are\nplaced on top of a body-mimicking phantom and equipped with the manufactured\nfinite-size sample of the metasurface tuned to have EBG properties at the\nLarmor frequency of 298 MHz. To improve the detection range of the B1+ field\ndistribution of the top elements, four additional elements were positioned\nalong the bottom side of the phantom. Scattering matrix measurements show that\ncoupling between the two top elements is indeed reduced while the measurements\nperformed on a 7T MRI machine confirm the array's B1+ efficiency improvement\ndue to reduced scattering losses. This study provides a tool for the decoupling\nof dipole antennas in ultrahigh field transmit arrays, possibly resulting in\ndenser element placement and/or larger subject-element spacing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 15:58:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

The growth of these perturbations leads to filament fragmentation\nand the formation of cores. Most previous work on this subject has been\nconfined to the growth and fragmentation of equilibrium filaments and has found\nthat there exists a preferential fragmentation length scale which is roughly 4\ntimes the filament's diameter. Our results show a more complicated dispersion\nrelation with a series of peaks linking perturbation wavelength and growth\nrate. These are due to gravo-acoustic oscillations along the longitudinal axis\nduring the sub-critical phase of growth. The positions of the peaks in growth\nrate have a strong dependence on both the mass accretion rate onto the filament\nand the temperature of the gas. When seeded with a multi-wavelength density\npower spectrum there exists a clear preferred core separation equal to the\nlargest peak in the dispersion relation. Our results allow one to estimate a\nminimum age for a filament which is breaking up into regularly spaced\nfragments, as well as a maximum accretion rate. We apply the model to\nobservations of filaments in Taurus by Tafalla & Hacar (2015) and find\naccretion rates consistent with those estimated by Palmeirim et al. (2013).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 12:05:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 11:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

All nodes are single-input single-output (SISO) and\nhalf-duplex, i.e., they cannot transmit and receive data simultaneously. The\noutage probability is analyzed and we show comparisons of outage probability\nwith various scenarios under Rayleigh fading channel. Our results show that the\nrelay selection with EDDF and network coding (RS-EDDF&NC) scheme has the best\nperformance in the sense of outage probability upon the considered\ndecode-and-forward (DF) relaying if there exist sufficiently relays. In\naddition, the performance loss is large if we select a relay at random. This\nshows the importance of relay selection strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 12:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-26"}
