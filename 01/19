Although its\ncomputational and statistical properties have been recently studied, the\nperformance of convex clustering has not yet been investigated in the\nhigh-dimensional clustering scenario, where the data contains a large number of\nfeatures and many of them carry no information about the clustering structure.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that the performance of convex clustering could\nbe distorted when the uninformative features are included in the clustering. To\novercome it, we introduce a new clustering method, referred to as Sparse Convex\nClustering, to simultaneously cluster observations and conduct feature\nselection. The key idea is to formulate convex clustering in a form of\nregularization, with an adaptive group-lasso penalty term on cluster centers.\nIn order to optimally balance the tradeoff between the cluster fitting and\nsparsity, a tuning criterion based on clustering stability is developed. In\ntheory, we provide an unbiased estimator for the degrees of freedom of the\nproposed sparse convex clustering method. Finally, the effectiveness of the\nsparse convex clustering is examined through a variety of numerical experiments\nand a real data application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 16:03:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2016 03:26:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 14:38:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 16:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

In low-mass stars, their dissipation plays a\nprominent role in the long-term orbital evolution of short-period planets.\nTurbulent convection can sustain differential rotation in their envelope, with\nan equatorial acceleration (as in the Sun) or deceleration, which can modify\nthe waves' propagation properties. We explore in this first paper the general\npropagation properties of free linear inertial waves in a differentially\nrotating homogeneous fluid inside a spherical shell. We assume that the angular\nvelocity background flow depends on the latitudinal coordinate only, close to\nwhat is expected in the external convective envelope of low-mass stars. We use\ni) an analytical approach in the inviscid case to get the dispersion relation,\nfrom which we compute the characteristic trajectories along which energy\npropagates. This allows us to study the existence of attractor cycles and infer\nthe different families of inertial modes; ii) high-resolution numerical\ncalculations based on a spectral method for the viscous problem. We find that\nmodes that propagate in the whole shell (D modes) behave the same way as with\nsolid-body rotation. However, another family of inertial modes exists (DT\nmodes), which can propagate only in a restricted part of the convective zone.\nOur study shows that they are less common than D modes and that the\ncharacteristic rays and shear layers often focus towards a wedge - or\npoint-like attractor. More importantly, we find that for non-axisymmetric\noscillation modes, shear layers may cross a corotation resonance with a local\naccumulation of kinetic energy. Their damping rate scales very differently from\nwhat we obtain for standard D modes and we show an example where it is\nindependent of viscosity (Ekman number) in the astrophysical regime in which it\nis small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 17:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

An accurate determination of\nf_gas(z) for a large sample of hot (kT_e > 5 keV), dynamically relaxed clusters\ncould therefore be used as a probe of the cosmological expansion up to z < 2.\nThe fraction f_gas(z) would remain constant only when the \"correct\" cosmology\nis used to fit the data.

We discuss how to construct the theory from the extrinsic curvature\nof the constant scalar field hypersurface, and find a simple expression for the\naction which guarantees the existence of the primary constraint necessary to\navoid the Ostrogradsky instability. Our analysis is completely gauge-invariant.\nHowever we confirm that, mixing together beyond Horndeski with a different\norder of Horndeski, obstructs the construction of this primary constraint.\nInstead, when the mixing is between actions of the same order, the theory can\nbe mapped to Horndeski through a generalised disformal transformation. This\nmapping however is impossible with beyond Horndeski alone, since we find that\nthe theory is invariant under such a transformation. The picture that emerges\nis that beyond Horndeski is a healthy but isolated theory: combined with\nHorndeski, it either becomes Horndeski, or likely propagates a ghost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 19:25:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 11:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

However, about a third of the more massive galaxies at those times\nwere quiescent in the sense that their observed stellar populations are\ninconsistent with rapid star formation. The reduced star formation activity is\noften attributed to gaseous outflows driven by feedback from supermassive black\nholes, but the impact of black hole feedback on galaxies in the young Universe\nis not yet definitively established. We analyze the origin of quiescent\ngalaxies with the help of ultra-high resolution, cosmological simulations that\ninclude feedback from stars but do not model the uncertain consequences of\nblack hole feedback. We show that dark matter halos with specific accretion\nrates below ~0.25-0.4 per Gyr preferentially host galaxies with reduced star\nformation rates and red broad-band colors. The fraction of such halos in large\ndark matter only simulations matches the observed fraction of massive quiescent\ngalaxies (~10^10-10^11 Msun).

An uncoordinated interference is an example of\ninterference which cannot be aligned coordinately with interference from\ncoordinated part and consequently, the performance of interference alignment\napproaches is degraded.

We examine two Milky Way-like galaxies from the\nMaGICC cosmological simulations (a) with dark matter only and (b) with baryonic\nphysics included. The inclusion of baryons drives the shape of the DM halo to\nbecome more spherical and makes the velocity distribution of dark matter\nparticles less anisotropic especially at large heliocentric velocities, thereby\nmaking the SHM a better fit. We also note that we do not find a significant\ndisk-like rotating dark matter component in either of the two galaxy halos with\nbaryons that we examine, suggesting that dark disks are not a generic\nprediction of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We conclude that in the\nSolar neighborhood, the SHM is in fact a good approximation to the true dark\nmatter distribution in these cosmological simulations (with baryons) which are\nreasonable representations of the Milky Way, and hence can also be used for the\npurpose of dark matter direct detection calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 21:10:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 16:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-08"}

An important application of this method is the determination of\nCepheid distances, in view of the calibration of their distance scale. However,\nthe conversion of radial to pulsational velocities in the PoP method relies on\na poorly calibrated parameter, the projection factor (p-factor). We aim to\nmeasure empirically the value of the p-factors of a homogeneous sample of nine\nGalactic Cepheids for which trigonometric parallaxes were measured with the\nHubble Space Telescope Fine Guidance Sensor.

The recent\navailability of significant numbers of multi-model (MME) and multi-initial\ncondition (MICE) ensembles allows for the first time a direct sensitivity\nanalysis of CIV versus model response variability (MRV). Understanding the\nrelative agreement and variability of MME and MICE ensembles for multiple\nregions, resolutions, and projection horizons is critical for focusing model\nimprovements, diagnostics, and prognosis, as well as impacts, adaptation, and\nvulnerability studies.

Many\nof these algorithms employ sub-sampling, as a way to either speed up the\ncomputations and/or to implicitly implement a form of statistical\nregularization. In this paper, we consider second-order iterative optimization\nalgorithms and we provide bounds on the convergence of the variants of Newton's\nmethod that incorporate uniform sub-sampling as a means to estimate the\ngradient and/or Hessian. Our bounds are non-asymptotic and quantitative. Our\nalgorithms are global and are guaranteed to converge from any initial iterate.\n  Using random matrix concentration inequalities, one can sub-sample the\nHessian to preserve the curvature information. Our first algorithm incorporates\nHessian sub-sampling while using the full gradient. We also give additional\nconvergence results for when the sub-sampled Hessian is regularized by\nmodifying its spectrum or ridge-type regularization. Next, in addition to\nHessian sub-sampling, we also consider sub-sampling the gradient as a way to\nfurther reduce the computational complexity per iteration.

Using random matrix concentration inequalities, one can\nsub-sample in a way that the curvature information is preserved.

It also showed that among the eight sampling techniques, RU and\nLRU have the worst performance while other techniques (i.e., RO, C-LRUO and\nC-LROU) performed well only on some classes. The best performing techniques in\nall data sets were SMOTE, SMOTERandRep, and LRO having the lowest F-measure\nvalues between 0.5 and 0.65. The results using G-mean showed that the\noversampling technique that attained the highest G-mean value is LRO (0.86),\nnext is C-LROU (0.85), then SMOTE (0.84) and finally is SMOTERandRep (0.83).\nCombining the result of the two metrics (F-measure and G-mean), only the three\nsampling techniques are considered as good performing (i.e., LRO, SMOTE, and\nSMOTERandRep).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 23:31:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

It is a group-theoretic cryptographic protocol\nthat allows two users to construct a shared secret via a Diffie-Hellman-type\nscheme over an insecure channel.\n  Building on the refuted 2012 permutation-based attack of\nKalka-Teichner-Tsaban, in 2015 Ben-Zvi-Blackburn-Tsaban (BBT) presented a\nheuristic attack that attempts to recover the AEDH shared secret. In their\npaper BBT reference the AEDH protocol as presented to ISO for certification\n(ISO 29167-20) by SecureRF. The ISO draft contains two profiles using the\nAlgebraic Eraser. One profile is unaffected by this attack; the second profile\nis subject to their attack provided the attack runs in real time. This is not\nthe case in most practical deployments.\n  The BBT attack is simply a targeted attack that does not attempt to break the\nmethod, system parameters, or recover any private keys. Rather, its limited\nfocus is to recover the shared secret in a single transaction. In addition, the\nBBT attack is based on several conjectures that are assumed to hold when\nparameters are chosen according to standard distributions, which can be\nmitigated, if not avoided. This paper shows how to choose special distributions\nso that these conjectures do not hold making the BBT attack ineffective for\nbraid groups with sufficiently many strands. Further, the BBT attack assumes\nthat certain data is available to an attacker, but there are realistic\ndeployment scenarios where this is not the case, making the attack fail\ncompletely. In summary, the BBT attack is flawed (with respect to the SecureRF\nISO draft) and, at a minimum, over-reaches as to its applicability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 03:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

In this work, we report NPR in\nsingle-layer graphene ribbons, which results from the compressive edge stress\ninduced warping of the edges. The effect is robust, as the NPR is observed for\ngraphene ribbons with widths smaller than about 10 nm, and for tensile strains\nsmaller than about 0.5%, with NPR values reaching as large as -1.51. The NPR is\nexplained analytically using an inclined plate model, which is able to predict\nthe Poisson's ratio for graphene sheets of arbitrary size. The inclined plate\nmodel demonstrates that the NPR is governed by the interplay between the width\n(a bulk property), and the warping amplitude of the edge (an edge property),\nwhich eventually yields a phase diagram determining the sign of the Poisson's\nratio as a function of the graphene geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 04:03:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 05:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-15"}

In this paper, using tools from graph theory and additive number\ntheory, we solve several open problems and conjectures concerning bounds and\nconstructions for separating hash families. Firstly, we discover that the\ncardinality of a separating hash family satisfies a Johnson-type inequality. As\na result, we obtain a new upper bound, which is superior to all previous ones.\nSecondly, we present a construction for an infinite class of perfect hash\nfamilies. It is based on the Hamming graphs in coding theory and generalizes\nmany constructions that appeared before. It provides an affirmative answer to\nboth Bazrafshan-Trung's open problem on separating hash families and\nAlon-Stav's conjecture on parent-identifying codes. Thirdly, let $p_t(N,q)$\ndenote the maximal cardinality of a $t$-perfect hash family of length $N$ over\nan alphabet of size $q$. Walker II and Colbourn conjectured that\n$p_3(3,q)=o(q^2)$. We verify this conjecture by proving\n$q^{2-o(1)}<p_3(3,q)=o(q^2)$. Our proof can be viewed as an application of\nRuzsa-Szemer{\\'e}di's (6,3)-theorem. We also prove\n$q^{2-o(1)}<p_4(4,q)=o(q^2)$. Two new notions in graph theory and additive\nnumber theory, namely rainbow cycles and $R$-sum-free sets, are introduced to\nprove this result.

New IRAM 30m HERA CO(2-1) data of NGC 4501 and NGC 4567/68 are\npresented. We find an increase in the molecular fraction where the ISM is\ncompressed. The gas is close to self-gravitation in compressed regions. This\nleads to an increase in gas pressure and a decrease in the ratio between the\nmolecular fraction and total ISM pressure. The overall Kennicutt Schmidt\nrelation based on a pixel-by-pixel analysis at ~1.5 kpc resolution is not\nsignificantly modified by compression. However, we detected continuous regions\nof low molecular star formation efficiencies in the compressed parts of the\ngalactic gas disks. The data suggest that a relation between the molecular star\nformation efficiency SFE_H2 and gas self-gravitation exists. Both systems show\nspatial variations in the star formation efficiency with respect to the\nmolecular gas that can be related to environmental compression of the ISM. An\nanalytical model was used to investigate the dependence of SFE_H2 on\nself-gravitation. The model correctly reproduces the correlations between\nR_mol/P_tot, SFE_H2, and Toomre Q if different global turbulent velocity\ndispersions are assumed for the three galaxies. We found that variations in the\nN_H_2/I_CO conversion factor can mask most of the correlation between SFE_H2\nand the Q parameter. Dynamical simulations were used to compare the effects of\nram pressure and tidal ISM compression. We conclude that a gravitationally\ninduced ISM compression has the same consequences as ram pressure compression:\n(i) an increasing gas surface density, (ii) an increasing molecular fraction,\nand (iii) a decreasing R_mol/P_tot in the compressed region due to the presence\nof nearly self-gravitating gas. The response of SFE_H2 to compression is more\ncomplex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 11:55:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

Such self-ordering\neffects resulting in periodic lattices via bimodal symmetry breaking have been\nexperimentally observed with cold gases and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)\ninside an optical resonator.

In\ncontrast to previous works, no spatial light modes are preselected by any\nboundary conditions and the transition from homogeneous to periodic order\namounts to a crystallization of both light and ultracold atoms breaking a\ncontinuous translational symmetry.

Progress has been hampered\nboth by the irreproducibility of much of the experimental data, and the lack of\nany generally-accepted theoretical explanation. The characteristic signature is\na virtually anhysteretic, temperature-independent magnetization curve which\nsaturates in an applied field that is several orders of magnitude greater than\nthe magnetization. It appears as if a tiny volume fraction, < 0.1%, of the\nsamples is magnetic and that the energy scale of the problem is unusually high\nfor spin magnetism. Here we investigate the effect of dispersing 4 nm CeO2\nnanoparticles with powders of gamma-Al2O3, sugar or latex microspheres. The\nsaturation magnetization, Ms ~ 60 A/m for compact samples, is maximized by 1\nwt% lanthanum doping. Dispersing the CeO2 nanopowder reduces its magnetic\nmoment by up to an order of magnitude. There is a characteristic length scale\nof order 100 nm for the magnetism to appear in CeO2 nanoparticle clusters. The\nphenomenon is explained in terms of a giant orbital paramagnetism that appears\nin coherent mesoscopic domains due to resonant interaction with zero-point\nfluctuations of the vacuum electromagnetic field. The theory explains the\nobserved temperature-independent magnetization curve and its doping and\ndispersion dependence, based on a length scale of 300 nm that corresponds to\nthe wavelength of a maximum in the UV absorption spectrum of the magnetic CeO2\nnanoparticles.

First, decreasing inter-wire\nspacing increases interline capacitive coupling, which adversely affects\ntransmission energy and delay. Second, lower voltage swings render the\ntransmission susceptible to various noise sources. Coding can be used to\naddress both these problems. So-called crosstalk-avoidance codes mitigate\ncapacitive coupling, and traditional error-correction codes introduce\nresilience against channel errors.\n  Unfortunately, crosstalk-avoidance and error-correction codes cannot be\ncombined in a straightforward manner. On the one hand, crosstalk-avoidance\nencoding followed by error-correction encoding destroys the crosstalk-avoidance\nproperty. On the other hand, error-correction encoding followed by\ncrosstalk-avoidance encoding causes the crosstalk-avoidance decoder to fail in\nthe presence of errors. Existing approaches circumvent this difficulty by using\nadditional bus wires to protect the parities generated from the output of the\nerror-correction encoder, and are therefore inefficient.\n  In this work we propose a novel joint crosstalk-avoidance and\nerror-correction coding and decoding scheme that provides higher bus\ntransmission rates compared to existing approaches. Our joint approach\ncarefully embeds the parities such that the crosstalk-avoidance property is\npreserved. We analyze the rate and minimum distance of the proposed scheme. We\nalso provide a density evolution analysis and predict iterative decoding\nthresholds for reliable communication under random bus erasures. This density\nevolution analysis is nonstandard, since the crosstalk-avoidance constraints\nare inherently nonlinear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 15:44:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}
