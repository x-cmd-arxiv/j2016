We use VIMOS integral-field spectroscopic\nobservations for the intermediate-mass E0 galaxy NGC4458 and age-date its\nnuclear disc via high-resolution fitting of various model spectra. We find that\nthe nuclear disc is at least 6 Gyr old. A clue to gain narrow limits to the\nstellar age is our knowledge of the nuclear disc contribution to the central\nsurface brightness.\n  The presence of an old nuclear disk, or the absence of disruptive encounters\nsince z~0.6, for a small galaxy such as NGC4458 which belongs to the Virgo\ncluster, may be consistent with a hierarchical picture for galaxy formation\nwhere the smallest galaxies assembles earlier and the crowded galactic\nenvironments reduce the incidence of galaxy mergers. On the other hand, NGC4458\ndisplays little or no bulk rotation except for a central kpc-scale\nkinematically-decoupled core. Slow rotation and decoupled core are usually\nexplained in terms of mergers. The presence and age of the nuclear disc\nconstraint these mergers to have happened at high redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 16:00:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

This improves upon the previous constructive\nbound of $O(t^{1/2} \\log n)$ based on algorithmic variants of the partial\ncoloring method, and for small $s$ (e.g.$s=\\textrm{poly}(t)$) comes close to\nthe non-constructive $O((t \\log n)^{1/2})$ bound due to Banaszczyk. Previously,\nno algorithmic results better than $O(t^{1/2}\\log n)$ were known even for $s =\nO(t^2)$. Our method is quite robust and we give several refinements and\nextensions.

(2014). The\nmost probable physical mechanism to explain the optical variability in this LC\nclass is time-dependent mass accretion onto the stellar photosphere, producing\ntransient hot spots. As evidence in favor of this hypothesis, multi-epoch high\nresolution spectra for a subset of these stars shows that their veiling levels\nalso vary in time and that this veiling variability is consistent in both\namplitude and timescale with the optical LC morphology. Furthermore, the\nveiling variability is well-correlated with the strength of the HeI 6678A\nemission line, a feature predicted by models to arise in accretion shocks on or\nnear the stellar photosphere. Stars with accretion burst LC morphology\n(Stauffer et al. 2014) are also attributed to variable mass accretion. Both the\nstochastic and accretion burst LCs can be explained by a simple model of\nrandomly occurring flux bursts, with the stochastic LC class having a higher\nfrequency of lower amplitude events. Based on their UV excesses, veiling, and\nmean Ha equivalent widths, members of the stochastic LC class have only\nmoderate time-averaged mass accretion rates. The most common feature of their\nHa profiles is for them to exhibit blue-shifted absorption features, most\nlikely originating in a disk wind. The lack of periodic signatures in the LCs\nsuggests that little of the variability is due to long-lived hot spots rotating\ninto or out of our line of sight; instead, the primary driver of the observed\nphotometric variability is likely to be instabilities in the inner disk that\nlead to variable mass accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 17:46:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

The underlying\ncontinuum is well fit by a blackbody with $T_{\\mathrm{UV}} = 3.5 \\times 10^{4}$\nK, an order of magnitude smaller than the temperature inferred from X-ray\nspectra (and significantly more precise than previous efforts based on optical\nand near-UV photometry). Super-imposed on this blue continuum, we detect three\nclasses of features: narrow absorption from the Milky Way (probably a\nhigh-velocity cloud), and narrow absorption and broad (FWHM $\\approx 2000$-8000\nkm s$^{-1}$) emission lines at/near the systemic host velocity. The absorption\nlines are blueshifted with respect to the emission lines by $\\Delta v =\n-(250$-400) km s$^{-1}$. Due both to this velocity offset and the lack of\ncommon low-ionization features (Mg II, Fe II), we argue these arise from the\nsame absorbing material responsible for the low-velocity outflow discovered at\nX-ray wavelengths. The broad nuclear emission lines display a remarkable\nabundance pattern: N III], N IV], He II are quite prominent, while the common\nquasar emission lines of C III] and Mg II are weak or entirely absent.

The LERGs have SFRs that are shifted to even\nlower values with a median Delta SFR = -0.5 dex. In contrast, mid-IR selected\nAGN have, on average, SFRs enhanced by a factor ~1.5. We interpret the\ndifferent distributions of Delta SFR amongst the different AGN classes in the\ncontext of the relative contribution of triggering by galaxy mergers. Whereas\nthe LERGs are predominantly fuelled through low accretion rate secular\nprocesses which are not accompanied by enhancements in SFR, mergers, which can\nsimultaneously boost SFRs, most frequently lead to powerful, obscured AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 19:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

At the moment, there does not exist a special dataset\nwhere all identifiers are grouped to namespaces, and therefore we need to\ncreate such a dataset ourselves.\n  To do that, we need to find groups of documents that use identifiers in the\nsame way. This can be done with cluster analysis methods. We argue that\ndocuments can be represented by the identifiers they contain, and this approach\nis similar to representing textual information in the Vector Space Model.\nBecause of this, we can apply traditional document clustering techniques for\nnamespace discovery.\n  Because the problem is new, there is no gold standard dataset, and it is hard\nto evaluate the performance of our method. To overcome it, we first use Java\nsource code as a dataset for our experiments, since it contains the namespace\ninformation. We verify that our method can partially recover namespaces from\nsource code using only information about identifiers.\n  The algorithms are evaluated on the English Wikipedia, and the proposed\nmethod can extract namespaces on a variety of topics. After extraction, the\nnamespaces are organized into a hierarchical structure by using existing\nclassification schemes such as MSC, PACS and ACM.

When combined with the classical Einstein field equations this\ngives an extremely successful empirical model of classical gravity and\nclassical matter --- at least as long as one does not ask too many awkward\nquestions about global issues, (such as global topology and global causal\nstructure). We feel however that this is a tactical error --- even without\ninvoking full-fledged \"quantum gravity\" we know that the standard model of\nparticle physics is also an extremely good representation of some parts of\nempirical reality; and we had better be able to carry over all the good\nfeatures of the standard model of particle physics --- at least into the realm\nof semi-classical quantum gravity.

So on physical grounds spacetime should be parallelizable.\nThis strongly suggests that the metric is not the fundamental physical\nquantity; a very good case can be made for the tetrad being more fundamental\nthan the metric. Furthermore, a globally-defined \"almost complex structure\" is\nalmost unavoidable.

This\npaper focuses on a two-fold problem. On the one hand, the interface description\nlanguage must be flexible enough for maintaining service compatibility in a\nvariety of different contexts without modification of the service itself. On\nthe other hand, the composition of interfaces in a distributed environment must\nbe provably consistent. The existing approaches for checking compatibility of\nservice choreographies are either inflexible (WS-CDL and WSCI) or require\nbehaviour specification associated with each service, which is often impossible\nto provide in practice.\n  We present a novel approach for automatic interface configuration in\ndistributed stream-connected components operating as closed-source services\n(i.e. the behavioural protocol is unknown).

Our aim is to determine the frequency and orbital parameters of\nbinary systems among the CEMP-s stars, which exhibit strong enhancements of\nneutron-capture elements associated with the s-process. This allows us to test\nwhether local mass transfer from a binary companion is necessary and sufficient\nto explain their dramatic carbon excesses. Eighteen of the 22 stars exhibit\nclear orbital motion, yielding a binary frequency of 82+-10%, while four stars\nappear to be single (18+-10%). We thus confirm that the binary frequency of\nCEMP-s stars is much higher than for normal metal-poor giants, but not 100% as\npreviously claimed. Secure orbits are determined for 11 of the binaries and\nprovisional orbits for six long-period systems (P > 3,000 days), and orbital\ncircularisation time scales are discussed. The conventional scenario of local\nmass transfer from a former AGB binary companion does appear to account for the\nchemical composition of most CEMP-s stars. However, the excess of C and\ns-process elements in some single CEMP-s stars was apparently transferred to\ntheir natal clouds by an external (distant) source. This finding has important\nimplications for our understanding of carbon enrichment in the early Galactic\nhalo and some high-redshift DLA systems, and of the mass loss from extremely\nmetal-poor AGB stars.

However, when compared with local samples these are turbulent\ndiscs with high gas to baryonic mass fractions, ~35%, and the majority are\nconsistent with being marginally unstable (Toomre Q~1). There is no strong\ncorrelation between galaxy averaged velocity dispersion and the total star\nformation rate, suggesting that feedback from star formation is not the origin\nof the elevated turbulence. We postulate that it is the ubiquity of high\n(likely molecular) gas fractions and the associated gravitational instabilities\nthat drive the elevated star-formation rates in these typical z~1 galaxies,\nleading to the ten-fold enhanced star-formation rate density.

This can occur only if, despite their vast microscopic\ndifferences, a common statistical mechanical model describes their phase\ntransitions. The antiferromagnetic (AFM)-ic models for the latter two, just as\nthe loop-current model for the cuprates, map to the dissipative XY model. The\nsolution of this model in 2+1 D reveals that the critical fluctuations are\ndetermined by topological excitations, vortices and a variety of instantons,\nand not by renormalized spin-wave theories of the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson type,\nadapted by Moriya, Hertz and others for quantum-criticality. The absorptive\npart of the fluctuations is a separable function of momentum ${\\bf q}$,\nmeasured from the ordering vector, and of the frequency $\\omega$ and the\ntemperature $T$ which scale as $\\tanh(\\omega/2T)$ at criticality. Direct\nmeasurements of the fluctuations by neutron scattering in the\nquasi-two-dimensional heavy fermion and Fe-based compounds, near their\nantiferromagnetic quantum critical point, are consistent with this form. Such\nfluctuations, together with the vertex coupling them to fermions, lead to a\nmarginal fermi-liquid, with the imaginary part of the self-energy $\\propto\nmax(\\omega, T)$ for all momenta, a resistivity $\\propto T$, a $T \\ln T$\ncontribution to the specific heat, and other singular fermi-liquid properties\ncommon to these diverse compounds, as well as to d-wave superconductivity.

We present a preliminary analysis of the neutrino signal\npredicted by CITE and compare it to the neutrino burst of SN1987A. For strong\nCCSNe, as SN1987A, CITE predicts a proto-neutron star (PNS) accretion phase,\naccompanied by the corresponding neutrino luminosity, that can last a few\nseconds and that is cut-off abruptly by black hole (BH) formation. The neutrino\nluminosity can later be revived by accretion disc emission after a dead time of\nfew to a few ten seconds. In contrast, the neutrino mechanism for CCSNe\npredicts a shorter PNS accretion phase, followed by a slowly declining PNS\ncooling luminosity. We repeat statistical analyses used in the literature to\ninterpret the neutrino mechanism, and apply them to CITE. The first 1-2 sec of\nthe neutrino burst are equally compatible with CITE and with the neutrino\nmechanism. However, the data hints to a luminosity drop at t=2-3 sec, in some\ntension with the neutrino mechanism while being naturally attributed to BH\nformation in CITE. The occurrence of neutrino events at 5 sec in SN1987A\nsuggests that the accretion disc formed by that time. We perform 2D numerical\nsimulations, showing that CITE may be able to accommodate this disc formation\ntime while reproducing the ejected $^{56}$Ni mass and ejecta kinetic energy\nwithin factors 2-3 of observations. We estimate the disc neutrino luminosity\nand show that it can roughly match the data. This suggests that direct BH\nformation is compatible with the neutrino burst of SN1987A. With current\nneutrino detectors, the neutrino burst of the next Galactic CCSN may give us\nfront-row seats to the formation of an event horizon in real time. Access to\nphenomena near the event horizon motivates the construction of a few Megaton\nneutrino detector that should observe extragalactic CCSNe on a yearly basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 21:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

In this paper we present a catalog of the\ncontinuum sources in the first half of the survey (l=14.0-37.9deg and\nl=47.1-51.2deg, |b|<1.1deg) at a spatial resolution of 10-25\", with a spatially\nvarying noise level of ~0.3-1 mJy/beam.

Since the spatial distribution of the\nunresolved objects is evenly distributed and not confined to the Galactic\nplane, most of them are extragalactic. Thanks to the broad bandwidth of the\nobservations from 1 to 2 GHz, we are able to determine a reliable spectral\nindex for ~1800 sources. The spectral index distribution reveals a\ndouble-peaked profile with maxima at spectral indices of alpha = -1 and alpha =\n0 , corresponding to steep declining and flat spectra, respectively.

It was discovered that spherical partial waves of in-going and\nout-going matter can be described by unitary evolution operators independently,\nwhich allows for studies of space-time properties that were not possible\nbefore. Unitarity dictates space-time, as seen by a distant observer, to be\ntopologically non-trivial. Consequently, Hawking particles are only locally\nthermal, but globally not: we explain why Hawking particles emerging from one\nhemisphere of a black hole must be 100 % entangled with the Hawking particles\nemerging from the other hemisphere. This produces exclusively pure quantum\nstates evolving in a unitary manner, and removes the interior region for the\noutside observer, while it still completely agrees locally with the laws of\ngeneral relativity.

Accounting for\ncriticality remains a challenge as sensitivity to perturbation suggests a lack\nof robustness. Furthermore, change induced by perturbation may not be adaptive.\nComplicating matters further critical phenomena can result from\nhistory-dependent stochastic processes. A question central to distinguishing\namong these conflicting views of criticality is to what degree criticality can\nbe controlled by the components of the system. We address the control of\ncriticality using data on conflict dynamics and fight sizes from an animal\nsociety model system (Macaca nemestrina, n=48).

The most primitive metal-poor stars are important for studying the\nconditions of the early galaxy and are also relevant to big bang\nnucleosynthesis. Aims. Our objective is to find the brightest (V<14) most\nmetal-poor stars. Methods. Candidates were selected using a new method, which\nis based on the mismatch between spectral types derived from colors and\nobserved spectral types. They were observed first at low resolution with EFOSC2\nat the NTT/ESO to obtain an initial set of stellar parameters. The most\npromising candidate, 2MASS J18082002-5104378 (V=11.9), was observed at high\nresolution (R=50 000) with UVES at the VLT/ESO, and a standard abundance\nanalysis was performed. Results. We found that 2MASS J18082002-5104378 is an\nultra metal-poor star with stellar parameters Teff = 5440 K, log g = 3.0 dex,\nvt = 1.5 km/s, [Fe/H] = -4.1 dex.

The ability to predict the presence of clouds/hazes a priori is an\nimportant goal when faced with limited telescope resources and advancements in\natmospheric characterization that rely on the detection of spectroscopic\nfeatures. As a means to identify favorable targets for future studies with HST\nand JWST, we use published HST/WFC3 transmission spectra to determine the\nstrength of each planet's water feature, as defined by the H2O - J index. By\nexpressing this parameter in units of atmospheric scale height, we provide a\nmeans to efficiently compare the size of spectral features over a physically\ndiverse sample of exoplanets.

Second, we deduce some results in the category of\nfibrations with these notions instead of unique path lifting such as the\nexistence of products and coproducts. Also, we give a brief comparison of these\nnew categories to some categories of the other generalizations of covering\nmaps.

The operation of symmetrically\nswapping two edges between the trees, such that the result is a different pair\nof disjoint spanning trees, is called an edge exchange or a symmetric base\nexchange. The graph of symmetric base exchanges of a bispanning graph contains\na vertex for every valid pair of disjoint spanning trees, and edges between\nthem to represent all possible edge exchanges. We are interested in a\nrestriction of these graphs to only unique symmetric base exchanges, which are\nedge exchanges wherein selecting one edge leaves only one choice for selecting\nthe other. In this thesis, we discuss the structure of the graph of unique\nsymmetric edge exchanges, and the open question whether these are connected for\nall bispanning graphs.

However, tissue\npatterns can vary according to the utilized imaging system and are\nintrinsically correlated to the scale of analysis. In the case of ultrasound,\nthe Nakagami distribution is a general model of the ultrasonic backscattering\nenvelope under various scattering conditions and densities where it can be\nemployed for characterizing image texture, but the subtle intra-heterogeneities\nwithin a given mass are difficult to capture via this model as it works at a\nsingle spatial scale. This paper proposes a locally adaptive 3D\nmulti-resolution Nakagami-based fractal feature descriptor that extends\nNakagami-based texture analysis to accommodate subtle speckle spatial frequency\ntissue intensity variability in volumetric scans.

The eID system ensures unique identification and secure\nauthentication for citizens protecting access to applications where sensitive\nand personal data is involved. In particular, the Austrian eID system supports\nthree main use cases: Identification and authentication of Austrian citizens,\nelectronic representation, and foreign citizen authentication at Austrian\npublic sector applications. For supporting all these use cases, several\ncomponents -- either locally deployed in the applications' domain or centrally\ndeployed -- need to communicate with each other. While local deployments have\nsome advantages in terms of scalability, still a central deployment of all\ninvolved components would be advantageous, e.g. due to less maintenance\nefforts. However, a central deployment can easily lead to load bottlenecks\nbecause theoretically the whole Austrian population as well as -- for foreign\ncitizens -- the whole EU population could use the provided services. To\nmitigate the issue on scalability, in this paper we propose the migration of\nmain components of the ecosystem into a public cloud. However, a move of\ntrusted services into a public cloud brings up new obstacles, particular with\nrespect to privacy. To bypass the issue on privacy, in this paper we propose an\napproach on how the complete Austrian eID ecosystem can be moved into a public\ncloud in a privacy-preserving manner by applying selected cryptographic\ntechnologies (in particular using proxy re-encryption and redactable\nsignatures). Applying this approach, no sensitive data will be disclosed to a\npublic cloud provider by still supporting all three main eID system use cases.\nWe finally discuss our approach based on selected criteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2016 10:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-15"}

We study a quarter of a\ncentury of standard Johnson differential V photometry of the RS CVn binary BM\nCVn. Our main aims are to determine the activity cycles, the rate of surface\ndifferential rotation and the rotation period of the active longitudes of BM\nCVn. The Continuous Period Search (CPS) is applied to the photometry. The\nchanges of the mean and amplitude of the light curves are used to search for\nactivity cycles. The rotation period changes give an estimate of the rate of\nsurface differential rotation. The Kuiper method is applied to the epochs of\nthe primary and secondary minima to search for active longitudes. The\nphotometry reveals the presence of a stable mean light curve (MLC) connected to\nthe orbital period P_orb = 20d.6252 of this binary. We remove this MLC from the\noriginal V magnitudes which gives us the corrected V' magnitudes. These two\nsamples of V and V' data are analysed separately with CPS.

Luminous blue variables (LBVs) are rare massive stars with very high\nluminosity. They are characterized by strong photo-metric and spectroscopic\nvariability related to transient eruptions. The mechanisms at the origin of\nthese eruptions is not well known. In addition, their formation is still\nproblematic and the presence of a companion could help to explain how they\nform. Aims. This article presents a study of seven LBVs (about 20% of the known\nGalactic population), some Wolf-Rayet stars, and massive binaries. We probe the\nenvironments that surround these massive stars with near-, mid-, and\nfar-infrared images, investigating potential nebula/shells and the companion\nstars. Methods. To investigate large spatial scales, we used seeing-limited and\nnear diffraction-limited adaptive optics images to obtain a differential\ndiagnostic on the presence of circumstellar matter and to determine their\nextent. From those images, we also looked for the presence of binary companions\non a wide orbit. Once a companion was detected, its gravitational binding to\nthe central star was tested. Tests include the chance projection probability,\nthe proper motion estimates with multi-epoch observations, flux ratio, and star\nseparations. Results. We find that two out of seven of LBVs may have a wide\norbit companion. Most of the LBVs display a large circumstellar envelope or\nseveral shells. In particular, HD168625, known for its rings, possesses several\nshells with possibly a large cold shell at the edge of which the rings are\nformed.

The phenomenon occurs due to coupling between\nnormal and rotational degrees-of-freedom such that the effective normal force\nbecomes attractive rather than repulsive. Despite a rich literature, the\nforward evolution problem remains unsolved other than in certain restricted\ncases in 2D with single contact points. Various practical consequences of the\ntheory are revisited, including models for robotic manipulators, and the\nstrange behaviour of chalk when pushed rather than dragged across a blackboard.\n  Reviewing recent theory, a general formulation is proposed, including a\nPoisson or energetic impact law. The general problem in 2D with a single point\nof contact is discussed and cases or inconsistency or indeterminacy enumerated.\nStrategies to resolve the paradox via contact regularisation are discussed from\na dynamical systems point of view. By passing to the infinite stiffness limit\nand allowing impact without collision, inconsistent and indeterminate cases are\nshown to be resolvable for all open sets of conditions. However, two\nunavoidable ambiguities that can be reached in finite time are discussed in\ndetail, so called dynamic jam and reverse chatter. A partial review is given of\n2D cases with two points of contact showing how a greater complexity of\ninconsistency and indeterminacy can arise. Extension to fully three-dimensional\nanalysis is briefly considered and shown to lead to further possible\nsingularities.

Moreover, using optimality in probability is\ncomputationally promising for a class of discrete event simulation-based\noptimization problems, since it can reduce computational complexity by orders\nof magnitude compared to general simulation-based optimization methods using\noptimality in expectation. Accordingly, we have developed an \"Omega Median\nAlgorithm\" in order to effectively obtain the champion solution and to fully\nutilize the efficiency of well-developed off-line algorithms to further\nfacilitate timely decision making. An inventory control problem with\nnonstationary demand is included to illustrate and interpret the use of the\nOmega Median Algorithm, whose performance is tested using simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2016 10:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-15"}

In the monitored period the\ncontinua and H$\\gamma$ fluxes changed for around two times, while the H$\\beta$\nflux changed around 1.4 times. We found the periodical variations in the\nphotometric flux with the periods of 1200, 1850 and 4000 days, and 4500 days\nperiodicity in the spectroscopic variations. However, the periodicity of\n4000-4500 days covers only one cycle of variation and should be confirmed with\na longer monitoring campaign. There is an indication of the period around 1300\ndays in the spectroscopic light curves, but with small significance level,\nwhile the 1850 days period could not be clearly identified in the spectroscopic\nlight curves. The line profiles have not significantly changed, showing an\nimportant red asymmetry and broad line peak redshifted around +1000 km\ns$^{-1}$. However, H$\\beta$ shows broader mean profile and has a larger\ntime-lag ($\\tau\\sim120$ days) than H$\\gamma$ ($\\tau\\sim60$ days).

This is done by\nperturbatively expanding the gyrokinetic equation in large flux surface shaping\nmode number. It is found that the momentum flux generated by shaping that lacks\nmirror symmetry (which is necessarily up-down asymmetric) has a power law\nscaling with the shaping mode number. However, the momentum flux generated by\nmirror symmetric flux surface shaping (even if it is up-down asymmetric) decays\nexponentially with large shaping mode number.

The probability oscillation dynamics can be physically\nobserved in nanoscale photoexcitation transfer in a quantum-dot network, where\nthe existence probability of an exciton at the bottom energy level of a quantum\ndot fluctuates dif- ferently with a parameter setting. We evaluate the ensemble\naverage of the time-averaged mean square displacement (ETMSD) of the time\nseries obtained from the quantum-dot network model that generates various\noscillatory behaviors because the ETMSD exhibits characteristic changes\ndepending on the fluctuating bias; in the case of normal diffusion, the\nasymptotic behavior of the ETMSD is proportional to the time (i.e., a linear\ngrowth function), whereas it grows nonlinearly with an exponent greater than 1\nin the case of superdiffusion. We find that the diffusion can be accelerated\nsignificantly when the fluctuating bias is characterized as weak chaos owing to\nthe transient nonstationarity of its biases, in which the spectrum contains\nhigh power at low frequen- cies.

The model is applicable to\nany nucleus irrespective of its mass and neutron- and proton-number parity. It\nproperly includes polarization effects caused by an interplay between the long-\nand short-range forces acting in the atomic nucleus.\n  [Methods] The method is based on solving the Hill-Wheeler-Griffin equation\nwithin a model space built of linearly-dependent states having good angular\nmomentum and properly treated isobaric spin. The states are generated by means\nof the isospin and angular-momentum projection applied to a set of low-lying\n(multi)particle-(multi)hole deformed Slater determinants calculated using the\nself-consistent Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach.\n  [Results] The theory is applied to calculate energy spectra in N~Z nuclei\nthat are relevant from the point of view of a study of superallowed Fermi\nbeta-decays. In particular, a new set of the isospin-symmetry-breaking\ncorrections to these decays is given.\n  [Conclusions] It is demonstrated that the NCCI model is capable to capture\nmain features of low-lying energy spectra in light and medium-mass nuclei using\nrelatively small model space and without any local readjustment of its\nlow-energy coupling constants. Its flexibility and a range of applicability\nmakes it an interesting alternative to the conventional nuclear shell model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2016 13:53:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-30"}

However, reliability of\nPFM signals is often problematic and their quantification is challenging and\nthus not widely applied. Here, we present a study of the reproducibility of PFM\nsignals and of the so-called PFM background signal which has been reported in\nliterature. We find that PFM signals are generally reproducible to certain\nextents. The PFM signal difference between 180{\\deg} domains on\nperiodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN) is taken as the reference signal in a\nlarge number of measurements, carried out in a low frequency regime (30-70\nkHz). We show that in comparison to Pt coated tips, diamond coated tips exhibit\nimproved signal stability, lower background signal and less imaging artifacts\nrelated to PFM which is reflected in the spread of measurements. This is\nattributed to the improved mechanical stability of the conductive layer. The\naverage deviation of the mean PFM signal is 38.3%, for a diamond coated tip.\nAlthough this deviation is relatively high, it is far better than values from\nliterature which showed a deviation of approx. 73.1%. Additionally, we find\nthat the average deviation of the background signal from 0 is 11.6% of the PPLN\ndomain contrast. Thus, the background signal needs to be taken into account\nwhen quantifying PFM signals and should be subtracted from PFM signals. Those\nresults are important for quantification of PFM signals, since PPLN might be\nused for this purpose when PFM signals measured on PPLN are related to its\nmacroscopic d33 coefficient. Finally, the crucial influence of sample polishing\non PFM signals is shown and we recommend to use a multistep polishing route\nwith a final step involving 200 nm sized colloidal silica particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2016 15:03:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-15"}

Method: By means of the Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) technique\nthe topic of random walk in random environment is here considered in the case\nof a passively diffusing particle in a crowded environment made of randomly\nmoving and interacting obstacles. Results: The relevant physical quantity which\nis worked out is the diffusion cofficient of the passive tracer which is\ncomputed as a function of the average inter-obstacles distance.

Hence, if\nsuch a slowing down could compromise the efficiency of the task to be performed\nby the test molecule, some accelerating factor would be required.\nIntermolecular electrodynamic forces are good candidates as accelerating\nfactors because they can act at a long distance in a medium like the cytosol\ndespite its ionic strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2016 15:38:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-15"}

Using the most common model to tackle this problem, a rapidly rotating\nand differentially cooled spherical shell containing an incompressible and\nviscous liquid is numerically investigated. To gain the physical basics, we\nconsider a simple, equatorial symmetric perturbation of the CMB heat flux\nshaped as a spherical harmonic $Y_{11}$. The thermodynamic properties of the\ninduced flows mainly depend on the degree of nonlinearity parametrised by a\nhorizontal Rayleigh number $Ra_h=q^\\ast Ra$, where $q^\\ast$ is the relative CMB\nheat flux anomaly amplitude and $Ra$ is the Rayleigh number which controls\nradial buoyancy-driven convection. Depending on $Ra_h$ we characterise three\nflow regimes through their spatial patterns, heat transport and flow speed\nscalings: in the linear conductive regime the radial inward flow is found to be\nphase shifted $90^\\circ$ eastwards from the maximal heat flux as predicted by a\nlinear quasi-geostrophic model for rapidly rotating spherical systems. The\nadvective regime is characterised by an increased $Ra_h$ where nonlinearities\nbecome significant, but is still subcritical to radial convection. There the\nupwelling is dispersed and the downwelling is compressed by the thermal\nadvection into a spiralling jet-like structure. As $Ra_h$ becomes large enough\nfor the radial convection to set in, the jet remains identifiable on\ntime-average and significantly alters the global heat budget in the convective\nregime. Our results suggest, that the boundary forcing not only introduces a\nnet horizontal heat transport but also suppresses the convection locally to\nsuch an extent, that the net Nusselt number is reduced by up to 50\\%, even\nthough the mean CMB heat flux is conserved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2016 15:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-26"}

The competing Cournot firms\nproduce low-cost but limited quantities of a single homogeneous product. For\nadditional procurements, they may refer to a revenue-maximizing supplier who\nsets a wholesale price prior to their orders. We express this chain as a\ntwo-stage game and study its equilibrium under two different information\nlevels: complete and incomplete information on the side of the supplier about\nthe actual market demand. In the deterministic case, we derive the unique\nsubgame perfect Nash equilibrium for different values of the retailers'\ncapacity levels, supplier's cost and market demand. To study the incomplete\ninformation case, we model demand uncertainty via a continuous probability\ndistribution. Under mild assumptions, we characterize the supplier's optimal\npricing policy as a fixed point of a proper translation of his expectation\nabout the orders that he will receive from the retailers. If this expectation\nis decreasing in his price, then such an optimal policy always exists and is\nunique. Based on this characterization, we are able to proceed with comparative\nstatics and sensitivity analysis, both analytically and numerically. Incomplete\ninformation gives rise to market inefficiencies because the supplier may ask\nfor a too high price. Increasing supplier's cost results in increasing\nwholesale prices, decreasing orders from the retailers and hence decreasing\nconsumer surplus. Increasing retailers' production capacities results in\ndecreasing wholesale prices and increasing consumer surplus. Finally, as the\nnumber of second-stage retailers increases, the supplier's profit may initially\nrise but eventually drops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 16:20:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 13:34:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2016 14:04:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 09:34:13 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 09:55:57 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 24 Dec 2018 09:12:35 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 17:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-19"}
