The variational formulations allow us to employ meshes\nwith cells of arbitrary aspect ratios. We develop a refinement scheme\ngenerating highly anisotropic partitions that is inspired by shearlet systems.\nWe establish approximation rates for N-term approximations from corresponding\npiecewise polynomials for certain compact cartoon classes of functions. In\ncontrast to earlier results in a curvelet or shearlet context the cartoon\nclasses are concisely defined through certain characteristic parameters and the\ndependence of the approximation rates on these parameters is made explicit\nhere. The approximation rate results serve then as a benchmark for subsequent\napplications to adaptive Galerkin solvers for transport equations. In numerical\nexperiments, the new algorithms track C^2-curved shear layers and\ndiscontinuities stably and accurately, and realize essentially optimal rates.\nFinally, we treat parameter dependent transport problems, which arise in\nkinetic models as well as in radiative transfer. In heterogeneous media these\nproblems feature propagation of singularities along curved characteristics\nprecluding, in particular, fast marching methods based on ray-tracing. Since\nnow the solutions are functions of spatial variables and parameters one has to\naddress the curse of dimensionality.

However recently a number of\nobservational programmes, particularly of NGC5548 with Swift, have shown that\nthe UV/optical variations lag behind the X-ray variations in a manner strongly\nsupportive of X-ray reprocessing. Somewhat surprisingly the implied size of the\naccretion disc is ~3x greater than expected from a standard, smooth,\nShakura-Sunyaev thin disc model. Although the difference may be explained by a\nclumpy accretion disc, it is not clear whether the difference will occur in all\nAGN or whether it may change as, eg, a function of black hole mass, accretion\nrate or disc temperature. Measurements of interband lags for most AGN require\nlong timescale monitoring, which is hard to arrange. However for low mass (<1\nmillion solar mass) AGN, the combination of XMM-Newton EPIC (X-rays) with the\noptical monitor in fast readout mode allows an X-ray/UV-optical lag to be\nmeasured within a single long observation.

The experiment uses\nelectromagnetic forcing with an approximately sinusoidal spatial profile to\ndrive a quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) shear flow in a thin layer of electrolyte\nsuspended on a thin lubricating layer of a dielectric fluid. Theoretical\nanalysis is based on a 2D model (Suri ${\\it et al.}$ 2014), derived from first\nprinciples by depth-averaging the full three-dimensional Navier-Stokes\nequations. As the strength of the forcing is increased, the Q2D flow in the\nexperiment undergoes a series of bifurcations, which is compared with results\nfrom direct numerical simulations of the 2D model. The effects of confinement\nand the forcing profile are studied by performing simulations that assume\nspatial periodicity and strictly sinusoidal forcing, as well as simulations\nwith realistic no-slip boundary conditions and an experimentally validated\nforcing profile. We find that only the simulation subject to physical no-slip\nboundary conditions and a realistic forcing profile provides close,\nquantitative agreement with the experiment.

Despite considerable progress on several fronts,\nthe approximability of these problems is still badly understood. This is the\ncase even when the underlying graph is a tree, which is one of the most-studied\ngraph structures in this context and the focus of this paper. In their simplest\nversion, a fire spreads from one fixed vertex step by step from burning to\nadjacent non-burning vertices, and at each time step, $B$ many non-burning\nvertices can be protected from catching fire. The Firefighter problem asks, for\na given $B$, to maximize the number of vertices that will not catch fire,\nwhereas RMFC (on a tree) asks to find the smallest $B$ that allows for saving\nall leaves of the tree. Prior to this work, the best known approximation ratios\nwere an $O(1)$-approximation for the Firefighter problem and an $O(\\log^*\nn)$-approximation for RMFC, both being LP-based and essentially matching the\nintegrality gaps of two natural LP relaxations.\n  We improve on both approximations by presenting a PTAS for the Firefighter\nproblem and an $O(1)$-approximation for RMFC, both qualitatively matching the\nknown hardness results.

We\nalso introduce the state-of-the-art particle splitting method based on the\nVoronoi tessellation and achieve an extremely high mass resolution of ~10^{-5}\nMsun (10 earth masses) in the central region. We follow the thermal evolution\nof several early clouds with various metallicities. We show that the condition\nfor cloud fragmentation depends not only on the gas metallicity but also on the\ncollapse timescale. In many cases, the cloud fragmentation is prevented by the\nchemical heating owing to molecular hydrogen formation even though dust cooling\nbecomes effective. Meanwhile, in several cases, efficient OH and H2O cooling\npromotes the cloud elongation, and then cloud \"filamentation\" is driven by dust\nthermal emission as a precursor of eventual fragmentation. While the filament\nfragmentation is driven by rapid gas cooling with >10^{-5} Zsun, fragmentation\noccurs in a different manner by the self-gravity of a circumstellar disk with\n<10^{-5} Zsun. We use a semi-analytic model to estimate the number fraction of\nthe clouds which undergo the filament fragmentation to be a several percents\nwith 10^{-5}--10^{-4} Zsun. Overall, our simulations show a viable formation\npath of the recently discovered Galactic low-mass stars with extremely small\nmetallicities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2016 11:22:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Aug 2018 18:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-30"}

We show that applying a local filtering technique improves the\npreservation of all kinds of properties. In addition, we propose a new\nsparsification method (\\textit{Local Degree}) which preserves edges leading to\nlocal hub nodes.

However, accurately\nassessing methods for protein function prediction and tracking progress in the\nfield remain challenging. Methodology: We have conducted the second Critical\nAssessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA), a timed challenge to assess\ncomputational methods that automatically assign protein function. One hundred\ntwenty-six methods from 56 research groups were evaluated for their ability to\npredict biological functions using the Gene Ontology and gene-disease\nassociations using the Human Phenotype Ontology on a set of 3,681 proteins from\n18 species.

This heat exchange may have enhanced the growth rate of their mass\nsufficiently to explain structure formation in the early universe, a phenomenon\nwhich cannot be understood from adiabatic density perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2016 14:53:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2016 12:23:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2021 11:54:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

The basic\nconcepts of the corresponding theory were introduced by Markov in 1907 on\ncoding literary texts. Since then, the Markov Chain theory was developerd by a\nnumber of leading mathematicians, such as Kolmogorov, Feller etc. However, only\nfrom the 1960's the importance of this theory to the Natural, Social and most\nof the other Applied Sciences has been recognized. In this review paper we\npresent applications of finite Markov Chains to management problems, which can\nbe solved, as most of the problems concerning applications of Markov chains in\ngeneral do, by distinguishing between two types of Chains, the Ergodic and the\nAbsorbing ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2016 23:45:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-09"}

This percussion instrument consists of\ntwo drums played by two hands, structurally different and produces different\nharmonic sounds. Earlier work has done labeling tabla strokes from real time\nperformances by testing neural networks and tree based classification methods.\nThe current work extends previous work by C. V. Raman and S. Kumar in 1920 on\nspectrum modeling of tabla strokes. In this paper we have studied spectral\ncharacteristics (by wavelet analysis by sub band coding method and using\ntorrence wavelet tool) of nine strokes from each of five tablas using Wavelet\ntransform. Wavelet analysis is now a common tool for analyzing localized\nvariations of power within a time series and to find the frequency distribution\nin time frequency space. Statistically, we will look into the patterns depicted\nby harmonics of different sub bands and the tablas. Distribution of dominant\nfrequencies at different sub-band of stroke signals, distribution of power and\nbehavior of harmonics are the important features, leads to categorization of\ntabla.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2016 06:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-12"}
