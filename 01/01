The symmetry generators of 2nd\norder superintegrable systems in 2 dimensions close under commutation to define\nquadratic algebras, a generalization of Lie algebras. Distinct systems on\nconstant curvature spaces are related by geometric limits, induced by\ngeneralized In\\\"on\\\"u-Wigner Lie algebra contractions of the symmetry algebras\nof the underlying spaces. These have physical/geometric implications, such as\nthe Askey scheme for hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials. However, the limits\nhave no satisfactory Lie algebra contraction interpretations for underlying\nspaces with 1- or 0-dimensional Lie algebras.

This approach provides estimators which are (i)\nconsistent and asymptotically normally distributed, (ii) applicable to various\nclasses of time series models, (iii) straightforward to implement and (iv)\ncomputationally efficient. The framework is based on the recently developed\nGeneralized Method of Wavelet Moments (GMWM) and a new robust estimator of the\nwavelet variance. Compared to existing methods, the latter directly estimates\nthe quantity of interest while performing better in finite samples and using\nmilder conditions for its asymptotic properties to hold. Moreover, results are\ngiven showing the identifiability of the GMWM for various classes of time\nseries models thereby allowing this method to consistently estimate many models\n(and combinations thereof) under mild conditions.

Then, the $P$-wave neutron superfluid in\nthese non-superconducting regions will couple to the stellar plasma by\nscattering of protons off the quasiparticles that are confined in the cores of\nneutron vortices by the strong (nuclear) force. The dynamical timescales\nassociated with this interaction span from several minutes at the crust-core\ninterface to a few seconds in the deep core. We show that (a) the rapid\ncrust-core coupling is incompatible with oscillation models of magnetars that\ncompletely decouple the core superfluid from the crust and (b) magnetar\nprecession is damped by the coupling of normal fluids to the superfluid core\nand, if observed, needs to be forced or continuously excited by seismic\nactivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 2016 07:21:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2016 21:24:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-22"}

This\nthree-dimensional model combines predictive analytic theory for the atmospheric\ncirculation and dayside-nightside temperature differences over a range of\nequilibrium temperature, atmospheric composition, and potential frictional drag\nstrengths with numerical solutions of the circulation that verify this analytic\ntheory. This analytic theory shows that the longitudinal propagation of waves\nmediates dayside-nightside temperature differences in hot Jupiter atmospheres,\nanalogous to the wave adjustment mechanism that regulates the thermal structure\nin Earth's tropics. These waves can be damped in hot Jupiter atmospheres by\neither radiative cooling or potential frictional drag. This frictional drag\nwould likely be caused by Lorentz forces in a partially ionized atmosphere\nthreaded by a background magnetic field, and would increase in strength with\nincreasing temperature. Additionally, the amplitude of radiative heating and\ncooling increases with increasing temperature, and hence both radiative\nheating/cooling and frictional drag damp waves more efficiently with increasing\nequilibrium temperature. Radiative heating and cooling play the largest role in\ncontrolling dayside-nightside temperature temperature differences in both our\nanalytic theory and numerical simulations, with frictional drag only important\nif it is stronger than the Coriolis force.

Expressed as matrices, the smoothing\nfilters must be row normalized so that each row sums to unity. Surprisingly, if\nwe apply a column normalization before the row normalization, the performance\nof the smoothing filter can often be significantly improved. Prior works showed\nthat such performance gain is related to the Sinkhorn-Knopp balancing\nalgorithm, an iterative procedure that symmetrizes a row-stochastic matrix to a\ndoubly-stochastic matrix. However, a complete understanding of the performance\ngain phenomenon is still lacking.\n  In this paper, we study the performance gain phenomenon from a statistical\nlearning perspective. We show that Sinkhorn-Knopp is equivalent to an\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm of learning a Gaussian mixture model of\nthe image patches. By establishing the correspondence between the steps of\nSinkhorn-Knopp and the EM algorithm, we provide a geometrical interpretation of\nthe symmetrization process. This observation allows us to develop a new\ndenoising algorithm called Gaussian mixture model symmetric smoothing filter\n(GSF). GSF is an extension of the Sinkhorn-Knopp and is a generalization of the\noriginal smoothing filters. Despite its simple formulation, GSF outperforms\nmany existing smoothing filters and has a similar performance compared to\nseveral state-of-the-art denoising algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 2016 15:44:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 02:10:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

We employ the homogenized model of such medium to compute intervals ---\nband gaps --- of the incident wave frequencies for which acoustic waves cannot\npropagate. It was demonstrated that the band gaps distribution can be\ninfluenced by changing the shape of inclusions. Therefore, we deal with the\nshape optimization problem to maximize low-frequency band gaps; their bounds\nare determined by analysing the effective mass tensor of the homogenized\nmedium. Analytic transformation formulas are derived which describe dispersion\neffects of resizing the inclusions. The core of the problem lies in sensitivity\nof the eigenvalue problem associated with the microstructure. Computational\nsensitivity analysis is developed, which allows for efficient usage of the\ngradient based optimization methods. Numerical examples with 2D structures are\nreported to illustrate the effects of optimization with stiffness constraint.\nThis study is aimed to develop modelling tools which can be used in optimal\ndesign of new acoustic devices for \"smart systems\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 2016 00:29:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 15:31:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 14:34:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-14"}

The\naim of this paper is to present an algorithm designed to recognize binding\npatches and supporting structural scaffolds of interacting heterodimer protein\nchains using the Gaussian Network Model (GNM). The recognition is based on the\n(self)adjustable identification of kinetically hot residues, i.e., residues\nwith highest contributions to the weighted sum of fastest modes per chain\nextracted via GNM, and their connection to possible binding scaffolds. The\nalgorithm adjusts the number of modes used in the GNM's weighted sum\ncalculation using the ratio of predicted and expected numbers of target\nresidues (contact and first layer residues). This approach produces very good\nresults when applied to chains forming heterodimers, especially with dimers\nwith high chain length ratios. The protocol's ability to recognize near native\ndecoys was compared to the ability of the statistical potential of Lu and\nSkolnick using the Sternberg and Vakser decoy dimers sets. The statistical\npotential produced better overall results, but in a number of cases its\npredicting ability was comparable, or even worse than the ability of the\nadjustable GNM approach. The results presented in this paper suggest that in\nheterodimers, at least one partnering chain has interacting scaffold determined\nby the immovable kinetically hot residues. In many cases interacting chains\n(especially if being of noticeably different sizes), either behave as rigid\nlock and key, or exhibit opposite dynamic behaviors. While the binding surface\nof one of the chains is rigid and stable, its partner's interacting scaffold is\nmore flexible and adaptable.\n  Authors note: The approach described here was initially given as a rough\ndraft in 2013 [1]. The next manuscript will describe the behavior of protein\ndimers incorrectly characterized with the present approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 2016 11:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-22"}
