To avoid this situation, we introduce in this paper a broader\ndefinition of superunitary representation, relying on a new definition of\nHilbert superspace. The latter is inspired by the notion of Krein space and was\ndeveloped initially for noncommutative supergeometry. For Heisenberg\nsupergroups, this new approach yields a smooth generalization, whatever the\nsignature, of the unitary representation theory of the classical Heisenberg\ngroup. First, we obtain Schrodinger-like representations by quantizing generic\ncoadjoint orbits. They satisfy the new definition of irreducible superunitary\nrepresentations and serve as ground to the main result of this paper: a\ngeneralized Stone-von Neumann theorem. Then, we obtain the superunitary dual\nand build a group Fourier transformation, satisfying Parseval theorem. We\neventually show that metaplectic representations, which extend Schrodinger-like\nrepresentations to metaplectic supergroups, also fit into this definition of\nsuperunitary representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2016 16:17:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2017 20:46:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-05"}

However, the performance of packet caching at\ncommodity routers is restricted by the small capacity of their SRAM, which\nholds the index for the packets stored at the, slower, DRAM. We therefore\npropose Object-oriented Packet Caching (OPC), a novel caching scheme that\novercomes the SRAM bottleneck, by combining object-level indexing in the SRAM\nwith packet-level storage in the DRAM. We implemented OPC and experimentally\nevaluated it over various cache placement policies, showing that it can enhance\nthe impact of ICN packet-level caching, reducing both network and server load.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2016 16:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-28"}

It has\nbeen recently proposed that properties of the accretion flow around Sgr A* can\nbe probed through its interactions with the stellar wind of nearby massive\nstars belonging to the S-cluster. When a star intercepts the accretion disk,\nthe ram and thermal pressures of the disk terminate the stellar wind leading to\nthe formation of a bow shock structure. Here, a semi-analytical model is\nconstructed which describes the geometry of the termination shock formed in the\nwind. With the employment of numerical hydrodynamic simulations, this model is\nboth verified and extended to a region prone to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.\nBecause the characteristic wind and stellar velocities are in $\\sim10^{8}$ cm\ns$^{-1}$ range, the shocked wind may produce detectable X-rays via thermal\nbremsstrahlung emission. The application of this model to the pericenter\npassage of S2, the brightest member of the S-cluster, shows that the shocked\nwind produces roughly a month long X-ray flare with a peak luminosity of\n$L\\approx 4 \\times 10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for a stellar mass-loss rate, disk\nnumber density, and thermal pressure strength of $\\dot{M}_{\\rm w}= 10^{-7}\nM_\\odot\\, {\\rm yr}^{-1}$, $n_{\\rm d} = 10^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$, and $\\alpha=0.1$,\nrespectively.

We place the galaxy on four different orbits in a\nVirgo-like cluster and evolve it for 10 Gyr. As a reference case we also evolve\nthe same model in isolation. Tidally induced bars form on all orbits soon after\nthe first pericenter passage and survive until the end of the evolution.

All bars undergo extended\nperiods of buckling instability that occur earlier and lead to more pronounced\nboxy/peanut shapes when the tidal forces are stronger.

Commonly used nodes use state-of-the-art\ntransceivers like the CC430 from Texas Instruments with integrated signal\nstrength measurement for this purpose. This has the disadvantage, that the\nsignal strength measurement is strongly dependent on the orientation of the\nnode through the antennas inhomogeneous radiation pattern as well as it has a\nsmall accuracy on long ranges. Also, the nodes overall attenuation and output\npower has to be calibrated and interference and multipath effects appear in\nclosed environments. Another possibility to trilaterate the position of a\nsensor node is the time of flight measurement. This has the advantage, that the\nposition can also be estimated on long ranges, where signal strength methods\ngive only poor accuracy. In this paper we present an investigation of the\nsuitability of the state-of-the-art transceiver CC430 for a system based on\ntime of flight methods and give an overview of the optimal settings under\nvarious circumstances for the in-field application. For this investigation, the\nsystematic and statistical errors in the time of flight measurements with the\nCC430 have been investigated under a multitude of parameters.

In particular the\nfossilized birth-death tree prior and the Lewis-Mk model of discrete\nmorphological evolution allow for the estimation of both divergence times and\nphylogenetic relationships between fossil and extant taxa. We exploit this\nstatistical framework to investigate the internal consistency of these models\nby producing phylogenetic estimates of the age of each fossil in turn, within\ntwo rich and well-characterized data sets of fossil and extant species\n(penguins and canids). We find that the estimation accuracy of fossil ages is\ngenerally high with credible intervals seldom excluding the true age and median\nrelative error in the two data sets of 5.7% and 13.2% respectively. The median\nrelative standard error (RSD) was 9.2% and 7.2% respectively, suggesting good\nprecision, although with some outliers. In fact in the two data sets we analyze\nthe phylogenetic estimates of fossil age is on average < 2 My from the midpoint\nage of the geological strata from which it was excavated. The high level of\ninternal consistency found in our analyses suggests that the Bayesian\nstatistical model employed is an adequate fit for both the geological and\nmorphological data, and provides evidence from real data that the framework\nused can accurately model the evolution of discrete morphological traits coded\nfrom fossil and extant taxa. We anticipate that this approach will have diverse\napplications beyond divergence time dating, including dating fossils that are\ntemporally unconstrained, testing of the \"morphological clock\", and for\nuncovering potential model misspecification and/or data errors when\ncontroversial phylogenetic hypotheses are obtained based on combined divergence\ndating analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2016 16:55:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 May 2016 05:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

To meet these objectives,\nthe KM3NeT Collaboration plans to build a new Research Infrastructure\nconsisting of a network of deep-sea neutrino telescopes in the Mediterranean\nSea. A phased and distributed implementation is pursued which maximises the\naccess to regional funds, the availability of human resources and the\nsynergetic opportunities for the earth and sea sciences community. Three\nsuitable deep-sea sites are identified, namely off-shore Toulon (France), Capo\nPassero (Italy) and Pylos (Greece). The infrastructure will consist of three\nso-called building blocks. A building block comprises 115 strings, each string\ncomprises 18 optical modules and each optical module comprises 31\nphoto-multiplier tubes. Each building block thus constitutes a 3-dimensional\narray of photo sensors that can be used to detect the Cherenkov light produced\nby relativistic particles emerging from neutrino interactions. Two building\nblocks will be configured to fully explore the IceCube signal with different\nmethodology, improved resolution and complementary field of view, including the\nGalactic plane. One building block will be configured to precisely measure\natmospheric neutrino oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2016 17:38:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 08:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

Even though massless scalars have been the focus of\ninterest in spontaneous scalarization so far, recent observations of binary\nsystems rule out most of their interesting parameter space. We point out that\nadding a mass term to the scalar field potential is a natural extension to the\nmodel that avoids these observational bounds if the Compton wavelength of the\nscalar is small compared to the binary separation. Our model is formally\nsimilar to the asymmetron scenario recently introduced in application to\ncosmology, though here we are interested in consequences for neutron stars and\nthus consider a mass term that does not modify the geometry on cosmological\nscales. We review the allowed values for the mass and scalarization parameters\nin the theory given current binary system observations and black hole spin\nmeasurements. We show that within the allowed ranges, spontaneous scalarization\ncan have nonperturbative, strong effects that may lead to observable signatures\nin binary neutron star or black hole-neutron star mergers, or even in isolated\nneutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2016 18:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

These steps take the form of a narrow strip\nof graphitic silicon. In some cases - specifically, for Si(553)-Au and\nSi(557)-Au - a large fraction of the silicon atoms at the exposed edge of this\nstrip are known to be spin-polarized and charge-ordered along the edge. The\nperiodicity of this charge ordering is always commensurate with the structural\nperiodicity along the step edge and hence leads to highly ordered arrays of\nlocal magnetic moments that can be regarded as \"spin chains\". Here, we\ndemonstrate theoretically as well as experimentally that the closely related\nSi(775)-Au surface has - despite its very similar overall structure - zero spin\npolarization at its step edge.

Variability studies require simultaneous\ncoverage, ideally sampling different flux states of each source. This is\nachieved using X-ray observations by disentangling the high-energy end of the\nsynchrotron emission and the low-energy end of the Compton emission, which are\nproduced by the same electron population. We focused on a sample of 29 TeV\ngamma-ray emitting blazars with the best signal-to-noise X-ray observations\ncollected with Swift/XRT in the energy range of 0.3-10 keV during 10 years of\nSwift/XRT operations.

The analysis of\nmulti-epoch observations revealed that the break energy of X-ray spectrum\nvaries only by a small factor with flux changes. Flux variability is more\npronounced in the synchrotron domain (high-energy end of the electron\ndistribution) than in the Compton domain (low energy end of the electron\ndistribution). The spectral shape of the Compton domain is stable, while the\nflux of the synchrotron domain is variable. These changes cannot be described\nby simple variations of the cut-off energy, suggesting that the high-energy end\nof the electron distribution is not generally well-described by cooling only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2016 18:47:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-28"}

The dot is coupled to one end of the topological wire but isolated from\nany reservoir, and is capacitively coupled to a charge sensor for measurement.\nThe combined parity of the MBS-dot system is conserved and charge transfer\nbetween the MBS and dot only occurs through resonant tunnelling. Resonance is\ncontrolled by the dot potential through a local gate and by the MBS energy\nsplitting due to the overlap of the MBS pair wavefunctions. The latter\nsplitting can be tuned from zero (topologically protected regime) to a finite\nvalue by gate-driven shortening of the topological wire. Simulations show that\nthe oscillatory nature of the MBS splitting is not a fundamental obstacle to\nreadout, but requires precise gate control of the MBS spatial position and dot\npotential. With experimentally realistic parameters, we find that high-fidelity\nparity readout is achievable given nanometer-scale spatial control of the MBS,\nand that there is a tradeoff between required precisions of temporal and\nspatial control. Use of the scheme to measure the MBS splitting versus\nseparation would present a clear signature of topological order, and could be\nused to test the robustness of this order to spatial motion, a key requirement\nin certain schemes for scalable topological qubits.

In this work,\nthe Secret-Key generation based on a compound source is studied where the\nrealization of the source statistic is unknown. The protocol should guarantee\nthe security and reliability of the generated Secret-Key, simultaneously for\nall possible realizations of the compound source. A single-letter lower-bound\nof the Secret-Key capacity for a finite compound source is derived as a\nfunction of the public communication rate constraint. A multi-letter capacity\nformula is further computed for a finite compound source for the case in which\nthe public communication is unconstrained.

A\nsequence of vertices in a graph $G$ is called a total dominating sequence if\nevery vertex $v$ in the sequence totally dominates at least one vertex that was\nnot totally dominated by any vertex that precedes $v$ in the sequence, and at\nthe end all vertices of $G$ are totally dominated. While the length of a\nshortest such sequence is the total domination number of $G$, in this paper we\ninvestigate total dominating sequences of maximum length, which we call the\nGrundy total domination number, $\\gamma_{\\rm gr}^t(G)$, of $G$. We provide a\ncharacterization of the graphs $G$ for which $\\gamma_{\\rm gr}^t(G)=|V(G)|$ and\nof those for which $\\gamma_{\\rm gr}^t(G)=2$.

Associated with\nthe $B-L$ gauge symmetry breaking by a VEV of the $B-L$ Higgs field, the seesaw\nmechanism for generating the neutrino mass is automatically implemented after\nthe electroweak symmetry breaking in the SM.

While data cleaning tools can purge datasets of many errors\nbefore the data is used, applications and users interacting with the data can\nintroduce new errors.

The deep\nfeatures obtained at the top fully-connected layer of the CNN (FC-features)\nexhibit rich global semantic information and are extremely effective in image\nclassification. On the other hand, the convolutional features in the middle\nlayers of the CNN also contain meaningful local information, but are not fully\nexplored for image representation. In this paper, we propose a novel\nLocally-Supervised Deep Hybrid Model (LS-DHM) that effectively enhances and\nexplores the convolutional features for scene recognition. Firstly, we notice\nthat the convolutional features capture local objects and fine structures of\nscene images, which yield important cues for discriminating ambiguous scenes,\nwhereas these features are significantly eliminated in the highly-compressed FC\nrepresentation. Secondly, we propose a new Local Convolutional Supervision\n(LCS) layer to enhance the local structure of the image by directly propagating\nthe label information to the convolutional layers. Thirdly, we propose an\nefficient Fisher Convolutional Vector (FCV) that successfully rescues the\norderless mid-level semantic information (e.g. objects and textures) of scene\nimage. The FCV encodes the large-sized convolutional maps into a fixed-length\nmid-level representation, and is demonstrated to be strongly complementary to\nthe high-level FC-features. Finally, both the FCV and FC-features are\ncollaboratively employed in the LSDHM representation, which achieves\noutstanding performance in our experiments.

Two\ncriteria for statistical convergence are derived; according to the first\ncriterion, at least $10^3$ hops appear to be necessary for convergent results,\nwhereas $10^4$ saltations seem to be the minimum required in order to achieve\nstatistical convergence in accordance with the second criterion.

For arbitrary Reynolds\nnumbers Re, this transformation allows the solution of the initial-value\nproblem for an arbitrary three-dimensional (3D) disturbance via a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) initial-value problem at a smaller Reynolds number Re2D.\nIts implications for the transient growth of arbitrary 3D disturbances is\nstudied. Using the Squire transformation, the general solution of the\ninitial-value problem is shown to predict large-Reynolds-number scaling for the\noptimal gain at all optimization times t with t/Re finite or large. This result\nis an extension of the well-known scaling laws first obtained by Gustavsson (J.\nFluid Mech., vol. 224, 1991, pp. 241-260) and Reddy & Henningson (J.

It is,\nthus, demonstrated that the long-time optimal growth of 3D perturbations as\ngiven by the exponential growth (or decay) of the leading eigenmode times an\nextra gain representing its receptivity, may be decomposed as a product of the\ngains arising from purely 2D mechanisms and an analytical contribution\nrepresenting 3D growth mechanisms equal to 1+(\\beta Re/Re2D)2G, where \\beta is\nthe spanwise wavenumber and G is a known expression. For example, when the\nleading eigenmode is an Orr-Sommerfeld mode, it is given by the product of\nrespective gains from the 2D Orr mechanism and an analytical expression\nrepresenting the 3D lift-up mechanism.

In addition,\nthe results indicate that the tensor couplings of vector mesons $\\omega$ and\n$\\rho$ lead to obvious enhancement of the total neutrino emissivity for the\nnucleonic direct URCA processes, which must accelerate the cooling rate of the\nnon-superfluid neutron star matter. However, when considering only the tensor\ncoupling of vector meson $\\rho$, the neutrino emissivity for the nucleonic\ndirect URCA processes slightly declines at low densities and significantly\nincreases at high densities.That is to say that the tensor coupling of vector\nmeson $\\rho$ leads to the slow cooling rate of a low-mass neutron star and\nrapid cooling rate of a massive neutron star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 00:19:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-29"}

Only the streamwise-uniform and nearly\nstreamwise-uniform disturbances are highly influenced by the Rayleigh number Ra\nand Prandtl number Pr. The maximum optimal transient growth G max of\nstreamwise-uniform disturbances increases slowly with increasing Ra and\ndecreasing Pr. For all Ra and Pr, at moderately large Reynolds numbersRe, the\nsupremum of G max is always attained for streamwise-uniform perturbations (or\nnearly streamwise-uniform perturbations, in the case of plane Couette flow)\nwhich produce large streamwise streaks and Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection rolls\n(RB). The optimal growth curves retain the same large-Reynolds-number scaling\nas in pure shear flow. A 3D vector model of the governing equations\ndemonstrates that the short-time behavior is governed by the classical lift-up\nmechanism and that the influence of Ra on this mechanism is secondary and\nnegligible. The optimal input for the largest long-time response is given by\nthe adjoint of the dominant eigenmode with respect to the energy scalar\nproduct: the RBeigenmode without its streamwise velocity component. These\nshort-time and long-time responses depict, to leading order, the optimal\ntransient growth G(t). At moderately large Ra (or small Pr at a fixed Ra), the\ndominant adjoint mode is a good approximation to the optimal initial condition\nfor all time. Over a general class of norms that can be considered as growth\nfunctions, the results remain qualitatively similar, for example, the dominant\nadjoint eigenmode still approximates the maximum optimal response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 01:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-29"}

We discuss the boiling crisis, a transition between two regimes of\nboiling: nucleate and film boiling. The boiling crisis results in a sharp\ndecrease in the heat transfer rate, which can cause a major accident in\nindustrial heat exchangers. In this communication, we present a physical model\nof the boiling crisis based on the vapor recoil effect. Under the action of the\nvapor recoil the gas bubbles begin to spread over the heater thus forming a\ngerm for the vapor film. The vapor recoil force not only causes its spreading,\nit also creates a strong adhesion to the heater that prevents the bubble\ndeparture, thus favoring the further spreading. Near the liquid-gas critical\npoint, the bubble growth is very slow and allows the kinetics of the bubble\nspreading to be observed. Since the surface tension is very small in this\nregime, only microgravity conditions can preserve a convex bubble shape. In the\nexperiments both in the Mir space station and in the magnetic levitation\nfacility, we directly observed an increase of the apparent contact angle and\nspreading of the dry spot under the bubble. Numerical simulations of the\nthermally controlled bubble growth show this vapor recoil effect too thus\nconfirming our model of the boiling crisis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 07:37:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-29"}

Specifically, we first propose the grouped\ntransmission scheme at the transmitter, where multiple SM signals in several\ncontinuous time slots are grouped to carry the common spatial constellation\nsymbol to introduce the desired structured sparsity. Accordingly, a structured\nsubspace pursuit (SSP) algorithm is proposed at the receiver to jointly detect\nmultiple SM signals by leveraging the structured sparsity. In addition, we also\npropose the SM signal interleaving to permute SM signals in the same\ntransmission group, whereby the channel diversity can be exploited to further\nimprove the signal detection performance. Theoretical analysis quantifies the\nperformance gain from SM signal interleaving, and simulation results\ndemonstrate the near-optimal performance of the proposed scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 09:38:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 16:43:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2016 11:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

The brightest and the\nlongest of these, the Sagittarius stream, reaches out to large Galactocentric\ndistances and hence can deliver the tightest constraints on the Galaxy's\npotential. In this contribution, we revisit the idea that the Sagittarius\nStream was formed from a rotating progenitor. We demonstrate that the angle\nbetween the disk's angular momentum and the progenitor's orbital angular\nmomentum does not remain constant throughout the disruption. Instead, it\nundergoes a dramatic evolution caused, in part, by the changes in the\nprogenitor's moment of inertia tensor. We show that, even in a spherical\npotential, the streams produced as a result of a disky dwarf disruption appear\nto be \"precessing\". Yet, this debris plane evolution is illusory as it is\nsolely caused by the swaying and wobbling of the progenitor's disk. Stream\nplane precession is therefore not an unambiguous indicator of asphericity of\nthe dark halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 10:46:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 11:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-18"}

Particle tracking in the lab frame\nusually treats time as an independent variable. Then, the evolution of electron\nbeams is treated according to the absolute time convention (non-standard clock\nsynchronization). This point has never received attention in the accelerator\ncommunity. There are two ways of coupling fields and particles. The first,\nLorentz's way, consists in `translating' Maxwell's electrodynamics to the\nabsolute time world-picture. The second, Einstein's way, consists in\n`translating' particle tracking results to the electromagnetic world-picture.\nConventional particle tracking shows that the electron beam direction changes\nafter a transverse kick, while the orientation of the microbunching fronts\nstays unvaried. We show that under Einstein's time order, in the\nultrarelativistic asymptote the orientation of the planes of simultaneity is\nalways perpendicular to the electron beam velocity. This allows for the\nproduction of coherent undulator radiation from a modulated electron beam in\nthe kicked direction without suppression. We hold a recent FEL study at the\nLCLS as experimental evidence of microbunching wavefront readjusting after a\nlarge kick. In a previous paper we quantitatively described this result\ninvoking the aberration of light, corresponding to Lorentz's way of coupling\nfields and particles. Here we give details of the Lorentz's approach used in\nthat paper. We also demonstrate that an `inverse translation' of particle\ntracking results to the standard time order resolves puzzles related with the\nstrong qualitative disagreement between simulations and experiments.

There are three well-known relationships between working\nmemory processes and specific frequency bands of subcortical oscillations,\nnamely: the storage of new information which correlates positively with\nbeta/gamma-frequency band oscillations, the maintenance of information while\nignoring irrelevant stimulation which is directly linked to theta-frequency\nband oscillations, and the clearance of memory which is associated with\nalpha-frequency band oscillations.

These will probe young gazeous exoplanets at\nlarge separations (~1au) but, because of uncalibrated aberrations that induce\nspeckles in the coronagraphic images, they are not able to detect older and\nfainter planets. There are always aberrations that are slowly evolving in time.\nThey create quasi-static speckles that cannot be calibrated a posteriori with\nsufficient accuracy. An active correction of these speckles is thus needed to\nreach very high contrast levels (>1e7). This requires a focal plane wavefront\nsensor. Our team proposed the SCC, the performance of which was demonstrated in\nthe laboratory. As for all focal plane wavefront sensors, these are sensitive\nto chromatism and we propose an upgrade that mitigates the chromatism effects.\nFirst, we recall the principle of the SCC and we explain its limitations in\npolychromatic light.

It thereby provides a\npromising route towards efficient SW generation and propagation, with potential\napplications in spintronic and magnonic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 13:43:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 15:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-06"}

On the contrary, limited attention has been\npaid to the revaluation of an unconditioned stimulus (UCS), which, as\nexperimentally observed by various researchers in the last four decades, occurs\nout of classical conditioning. For this reason, no analytical or quantitative\ntheory has been developed for this phenomenon and its dynamics. Unluckily,\nmodels based on classical conditioning are unable to explain or predict\nimportant psychophysiological phenomena, such as the failure of the extinction\nof emotional responses in certain circumstances. In this manuscript an\nanalytical representation of UCS revaluation learning is developed; this allows\nus to identify the conditions determining the \"inextinguishability\" (or\nresistant-to-extinction) property of emotional responses and reactions (such as\nthose observed in evaluative conditioning, in the nonreinforcement presentation\nof a conditioned inhibitor, in post-traumatic stress disorders and in panic\nattacks). Furthermore, an analysis of the causal relation existing between\nclassical conditioning and UCS revaluation is provided. Starting from this\nresult, a theory of implicit emotional learning and a novel interpretation of\nclassical conditioning are derived. Moreover, we discuss how the proposed\ntheory can lead to the development of new methodologies for the detection and\nthe treatment of undesired or pathological emotional responses, and can inspire\nanimal models for resistant-to-extinction responses and reactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 14:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-29"}

The effect of this dramatic change on the transport\nproperties strongly depends on the orientation of the in-plane magnetic field\nwith respect to the propagation direction of the charge carriers and the angle\nat which they impinge on the electrostatic potentials. For magnetic fields\noriented parallel to the potential boundaries an additional propagating mode\nthat results from the splitting into Dirac cones enhances the transmission\nprobability for charge carriers tunneling through the potentials and increases\nthe corresponding conductance. Our results show that the chiral suppression of\ntransmission at normal incidence is turned into a chiral enhancement when the\nmagnetic field increases, thus indicating a transition from a bilayer to a\nmonolayer-like system at normal incidence. Further, we find that the typical\ntransmission resonances stemming from confinement in a potential barrier are\nshifted to higher energy and are eventually transformed into anti-resonances\nwith increasing magnetic field. For magnetic fields oriented perpendicular to\nthe potential boundaries we find a very pronounced transition from a bilayer\nsystem to two separated monolayer-like systems with Klein tunneling emerging at\ncertain incident angles symmetric around 0, which also leaves a signature in\nthe conductance. For both orientations of the magnetic field, the transmission\nprobability is still correctly described by pseudospin conservation. Finally,\nto motivate the large in-plane magnetic field, we show that its energy spectrum\ncan be mimicked by specific lattice deformations such as a relative shift of\none of the layers.

The standard model, disrupted\nmagnetic braking (DMB), reproduces the gap by postulating that CVs transform\ninto inconspicuous detached white dwarf (WD) plus main sequence (MS) systems,\nwhich no longer resemble CVs. However, observational evidence for this standard\nmodel is currently indirect and thus this scenario has attracted some criticism\nthroughout the last decades. Here we perform a simple but exceptionally strong\ntest of the existence of detached CVs (dCVs). If the theory is correct dCVs\nshould produce a peak in the orbital period distribution of detached close\nbinaries consisting of a WD and an M4-M6 secondary star. We measured six new\nperiods which brings the sample of such binaries with known periods below 10 h\nto 52 systems. An increase of systems in the ~2-3 h orbital period range is\nobserved. Comparing this result with binary population models we find that the\nobserved peak can not be reproduced by PCEBs alone and that the existence of\ndCVs is needed to reproduce the observations. Also, the WD mass distribution in\nthe gap shows evidence of two populations in this period range, i.e. PCEBs and\nmore massive dCVs, which is not observed at longer periods. We therefore\nconclude that CVs are indeed crossing the gap as detached systems, which\nprovides strong support for the DMB theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 14:54:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

We consider both these problems in\nnetworks whose nodes are equipped with not necessarily distinct labels called\ncolors, and ports at each node of degree $d$ are arbitrarily numbered\n$0,1,\\dots, d-1$. Colored networks are generalizations both of labeled networks\nand anonymous networks.\n  In colored networks, topology recognition and leader election are not always\nfeasible.

Then we show\nthat a two-level system can be left excited after interacting with an\nultrashort pulse whose spectral width is larger than the transition frequency,\nand that the excitation probability depends not on the field amplitude but on\nthe field intensity. The latter makes the excitation profile have the same spot\nsize as the ultrashort pulse.

Its application\ncovers a broad range of objects and scales from planets up to galaxies.\nEspecially the dynamical friction, caused by the forming wake behind the\nobject, plays an important role for the dynamics of the system. To calculate\nthe dynamical friction, standard formulae, based on linear theory are often\nused. It is our goal to check the general validity of these formulae and\nprovide suitable expressions for the dynamical friction acting on the moving\nobject, based on the basic physical parameters of the problem. We perform\nsequences of high resolution numerical studies of rigid bodies moving\nsupersonically through a homogeneous medium, and calculate the total drag\nacting on the object, which is the sum of gravitational and hydro drag. We\nstudy cases without gravity with purely hydrodynamical drag, as well as\ngravitating objects. From the final equilibrium state of the simulations, we\ncompute for gravitating objects the dynamical friction by direct numerical\nintegration of the gravitational pull acting on the embedded object. The\nnumerical experiments confirm the known scaling laws for the dependence of the\ndynamical friction on the basic physical parameters as derived in earlier\nsemi-analytical studies. As a new important result we find that the shock's\nstand-off distance is revealed as the minimum spatial interaction scale of\ndynamical friction. Below this radius, the gas settles into a hydrostatic\nstate, which causes no net gravitational pull onto the moving body. Finally, we\nderive an analytic estimate for the stand-off distance that can be used to\ncalculate the dynamical friction force.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 15:19:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

In diesem Beitrag werden alle notwendigen\nAbbildungsregeln hergeleitet und ihre einfache Anwendung zur L\\\"osung von\nKontaktproblemen anhand von aktuellen Beispielen und bisher ungel\\\"osten\nProblemen erl\\\"autert.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2016 16:20:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-16"}

For the first time, we consider\nits consistency and stability, which depend on the dissipation of a\ntransmembrane potential formed by the respiratory chain in the plasmatic\nmembrane of a cell. The phase-parametric characteristic of the dynamics of the\nATP level depending on a given parameter is constructed. The scenario of\nformation of multiple autoperiodic and chaotic modes is presented. Poincar\\'{e}\nsections and mappings are constructed. The stability of modes and the\nfractality of the obtained bifurcations are studied. The full spectra of\nLyapunov indices, divergences, KS-entropies, horizons of predictability, and\nLyapunov dimensionalities of strange attractors are calculated. Some\nconclusions about the structural-functional connections determining the\ndependence of the cell respiration cyclicity on the synchronization of the\nfunctioning of the tricarboxilic acid cycle and the electron transport chain\nare presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 14:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-01"}
