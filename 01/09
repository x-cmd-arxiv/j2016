In agreement with recent work, we find\nthat discs with radially decreasing temperature profiles and short thermal\nrelaxation time-scales, are subject to the axisymmetric VSI. In three\ndimensions, the resulting velocity perturbations give rise to\nquasi-axisymmetric potential vorticity perturbations that break-up into\ndiscrete vortices, in a manner that is reminiscent of the Rossby wave\ninstability. Discs with very short thermal evolution time-scales (i.e.\n{\\tau}<0.1 local orbit periods) develop strong vorticity perturbations that\nroll up into vortices that have small aspect ratios ({\\chi}<2) and short\nlifetimes (~ a few orbits). Longer thermal time-scales give rise to vortices\nwith larger aspect ratios (6<{\\chi}<10), and lifetimes that depend on the\nentropy gradient. A steeply decreasing entropy profile leads to vortex\nlifetimes that exceed the simulation run times of hundreds of orbital periods.\nVortex lifetimes in discs with positive or weakly decreasing entropy profiles\nare much shorter, being 10s of orbits at most, suggesting that the subcritical\nbaroclinic instability plays an important role in sustaining vortices against\ndestruction through the elliptical instability. Applied to the outer regions of\nprotoplanetary discs, where the VSI is most likely to occur, our results\nsuggest that vortices formed by the VSI are likely to be short lived\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2016 16:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-01"}

This observational paper has been prepared in the context of the\nlarge multi-wavelength effort by many observers with the aim of following up\nthe transient flaring event of V404 Cygni that took place for several weeks in\n2015 June. Aims. Our main original aim was to contribute to the study of this\ntransient source by acquiring broad-band photometric observations during its\nmost active flaring phases. Nevertheless, after a detailed analysis of the\ndata, several interesting results were obtained that encouraged a dedicated\npublication. Methods. The methodology used was based on broad-band differential\nCCD photometry. This outburst of V404 Cygni rendered the source a very bright\ntarget easily within reach of small educational telescopes. Therefore, the 41\ncm telescope available at the Astronomical Observatory of the University of\nJa\\'en was used in this work. Results. We detected variability at different\ntime scales, both in amplitude and colour. Individual optical flares appear\nevery half hour on average during our 3 h long observation, although\nlarge-amplitude (\\sim 1 mag) variations are also observed to occur on intervals\nas short as 10 minutes. Also, colour variations appear to be highly correlated\nin a colour-colour diagram. Another remarkable finding is the detection of time\nlag, from about one to a fraction of a minute between light curves in different\nfilters (VRcIc). Conclusions. The observed behaviour is tentatively interpreted\nin an scenario based on the ejection of non-thermal emitting, relativistic\nplasmons, with their synchrotron spectra extending up to optical wavelengths.\nThis would render some of the V404 Cygni flares very similar to those of the\nwell-know microquasar GRS 1915+105\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2016 16:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

A common requirement in this setting\nis to approximate posterior probabilities of positive and negative classes for\na previously unseen data point. This problem can be decomposed into two steps:\n(i) the development of accurate predictors that discriminate between positive\nand unlabeled data, and (ii) the accurate estimation of the prior probabilities\nof positive and negative examples. In this work we primarily focus on the\nlatter subproblem. We study nonparametric class prior estimation and formulate\nthis problem as an estimation of mixing proportions in two-component mixture\nmodels, given a sample from one of the components and another sample from the\nmixture itself. We show that estimation of mixing proportions is generally\nill-defined and propose a canonical form to obtain identifiability while\nmaintaining the flexibility to model any distribution. We use insights from\nthis theory to elucidate the optimization surface of the class priors and\npropose an algorithm for estimating them. To address the problems of\nhigh-dimensional density estimation, we provide practical transformations to\nlow-dimensional spaces that preserve class priors.

An application to image features extracted from melanoma\nmicroscopy slides demonstrate the utility of the proposed transformation in\naddressing data with excessive skewness, heteroscedasticity and influential\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2016 19:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-11"}

The new architecture yields a low-dimensional model of price\nmovements deep into the limit order book, allowing more effective use of\ninformation from deep in the limit order book (i.e., many levels beyond the\nbest bid and best ask). This \"spatial neural network\" models the joint\ndistribution of the state of the limit order book at a future time conditional\non the current state of the limit order book. The spatial neural network\noutperforms other models such as the naive empirical model, logistic regression\n(with nonlinear features), and a standard neural network architecture. Both\nneural networks strongly outperform the logistic regression model. Due to its\nmore effective use of information deep in the limit order book, the spatial\nneural network especially outperforms the standard neural network in the tail\nof the distribution, which is important for risk management applications. The\nmodels are trained and tested on nearly 500 stocks. Techniques from deep\nlearning such as dropout are employed to improve performance.

The percolating ferromagnetic-clusters\npossibly start a magnetic ordering at the Curie temperature of 201.5(5)~K. The\nnon-ferromagnetic phases mainly consist of antiferromagnetic-clusters with size\nsmaller than the ferromagnetic-clusters.

Here, we\naim to reproduce the low $\\alpha$-element scatter observed in metal-poor stars.\nWe first demonstrate that as stellar particles inside simulations drop below a\nmass threshold, increases in the resolution produce an unacceptably large\nscatter as one particle is no longer a good approximation of an entire stellar\npopulation.

Core fragmentation is a vital step for the formation of stars.\nObservations suggest a connection to the filamentary structure of the cloud gas\nbut it remains unclear which process is responsible. We show that the\ngravitational instability process of an isothermal cylinder can account for the\nexhibited fragmentation under the assumption that the perturbation grows on the\ndominant wavelength. We use numerical simulations with the code RAMSES,\nestimate observed column densities and line-of-sight velocities and compare\nthem to the observations. A critical factor for the observed fragmentation is\nthat cores grow by redistributing mass within the filament and thus the density\nbetween the cores decreases over the fragmentation process. This often leads to\nwrong dominant wavelength estimates as it is strongly dependent on the initial\ncentral density. We argue that non-linear effects also play an important role\non the evolution of the fragmentation. Once the density perturbation grows\nabove the critical line-mass, non-linearity leads to an enhancement of the\ncentral core density in comparison to the analytical prediction. Choosing the\ncorrect initial conditions with perturbation strengths of around 20\\%, leads to\ninclination corrected line-of-sight velocities and central core densities\nwithin the observational measurement error in a realistic evolution time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2016 21:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 May 2017 12:12:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

Such a scenario predicts the existence of an extended main sequence\nturn off (eMSTO) only in clusters with escape velocities above a certain\nthreshold ($>15$ km s$^{-1}$), which would allow them to retain or accrete gas\nthat eventually would fuel a secondary extended star-formation episode.

Besides, from detailed observation of structural dynamics during\nphase transition, we discover that the global phase transition is associated\nwith changes in the equilibrium value and fluctuations of each polarization\ncomponent, including the ones already averaging to zero, Contrary to the\nconventional understanding that temperature increase generally causes\nbond-softening transition, the x polarization component exhibits a\nbond-hardening character during the orthorhombic to tetragonal transition.\nThese results provide further insights about the temperature-driven phase\ntransitions in BaTiO$_3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2016 21:19:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

With a primary focus on the selectin family of cell-adhesion\ncomplexes, we discuss the positives and negatives of phenomenological models\nand the importance of evaluating the physical relevance of fitting parameters.\nWe describe a microscopic theory for selectins, which provides a structural\nbasis for catch bonds and predicts a crucial allosteric role for residues\nAsn82--Glu88. We emphasize the need for new theories and simulations that can\nmimic experimental conditions, given the complex response of cell adhesion\ncomplexes to force and their potential role in a variety of biological\ncontexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2016 23:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-12"}

We employ a renormalization\nscheme that introduces the ratio of the gluon mass parameter $m$ to the\nsaturation value of the gluon propagator. This, along with the mass $m(\\mu)$\nand the strong coupling $\\alpha_s(\\mu)$, provided the fit parameters for\ncomparison with $SU(3)$ lattice results renormalized at the scale $\\mu$. We\nobtain two types of solutions with satisfactory fits. Within the proposed\nexpansion, we show the conditions under which it is possible to obtain an\nexactly vanishing longitudinal self energy for any gauge parameter $\\xi$ in the\nbackground field case. However, such a result in conventional covariant gauges\nis unattainable by the given expansion as it is, indicating that more\nsophisticated versions with dressed vertices are likely necessary. We argue\nthat the conditions under which transversality takes place are consistent with\nSchwinger-Dyson results for the ghost dressing function also.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2016 02:45:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2016 19:50:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-28"}

A transposition scale is\nintroduced to provide a set of intervals commensurate with the musical scale,\nsuch as chromatic or just intonation scales. A sequence of intervals selected\nfrom the transposition scale is used to shift instrument frequency at\npredefined times during the composition which serves as a harmonic sequence of\na composition. A transposition sequence constructed in such a way can be\nextended to a hierarchy of sequences. The fundamental sound frequency of an\ninstrument is obtained as a product of the base frequency, instrument key\nfactor, and a cumulative product of respective factors from all the harmonic\nsequences. The multiplication factors are selected from subsets of rational\nnumbers, which form instrument scales and transposition scales of different\nlevels. Each harmonic sequence can be related to its own transposition scale,\nor a single scale can be used for all levels. When composing for an orchestra\nof instruments, harmonic sequences and instrument scales can be assigned\nindependently to each musical instrument. The method solves the problem of\nusing just intonation scale across multiple octaves as well as simplifies\nwriting of instrument scores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2016 03:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-12"}

Both groups also noted that, curiously\nand confusingly coincident with the frequency dependent delay, the Crab Pulsar\nalso underwent an unusual slowing down, which they believed to be unrelated to\nthe Crab Nebula and instead intrinsic to the Crab Pulsar, resulting in an\nadditional delay that was frequency independent. However, it now appears that\none of the groups attributes the frequency independent delay also to refractive\neffects. This work aims to verify whether at least a part of the frequency\nindependent delay is indeed due to intrinsic slowing down of the Crab Pulsar.\nTiming analysis of the Crab Pulsar's October 1997 event has been done in\nX-rays, which are not delayed by the refractive and diffractive effects that\naffect radio waves; at X-rays only the intrinsic slowing down should contribute\nto any observed delay. Data mainly from the PCA instrument aboard the RXTE\nsatellite have been used, along with a small amount of data from the PDS\ninstrument aboard the BeppoSAX satellite. Analysis of the X-ray data, using the\nvery accurate reference timing mode derived at radio frequencies, strongly\nsupports the intrinsic slowing down hypothesis. Analysis using the reference\ntiming model derived self-consistently from the limited X-ray data, which is\nless accurate, is not completely unambiguous regarding the above two\nhypotheses, but provides reasonable support for the intrinsic slowing down\nhypothesis. A significant fraction of the frequency independent delay during\nthe October 1997 event is indeed due to intrinsic slowing down of the Crab\nPulsar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2016 10:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

Using a maximum\nlikelihood approach, we jointly fit the stellar mass function and specific\naccretion rate distribution function, with the X-ray luminosity function as an\nadditional constraint. Our best fit model characterizes the SARDF as a double\npower-law with mass dependent but redshift independent break whose low\nlambda_SAR slope flattens with increasing redshift while the normalization\nincreases. This implies that, for a given stellar mass, higher lambda_SAR\nobjects have a peak in their space density at earlier epoch compared to the\nlower lambda_SAR ones, following and mimicking the well known AGN cosmic\ndownsizing as observed in the AGN luminosity function. The mass function of\nactive galaxies is described by a Schechter function with a almost constant\nMstar* and a low mass slope alpha that flattens with redshift. Compared to the\nstellar mass function, we find that the HGMF has a similar shape and that, up\nto log((Mstar/Msun)~11.5 the ratio of AGN host galaxies to star forming\ngalaxies is basically constant (~10%). Finally, the comparison of the AGN HGMF\nfor different luminosity and specific accretion rate sub-classes with the\nphenomenological model prediction by Peng et al.

In this contribution, we discuss the role of uncertainties\nin the NEOTwIST asteroid deflection demonstration concept, a low-cost kinetic\nimpactor design elaborated in the framework of the NEOShield project. The aim\nof NEOTwIST is to change the spin state of a known and well characterized\nnear-Earth object, in this case the asteroid (25143) Itokawa. Fast events such\nas the production of the impact crater and ejecta are studied via cube-sat\nchasers and a flyby vehicle.

Recently, cooling down with a large\nspatial temperature gradient attracts much attention for successful reductions\nof trapped vortices. The purpose of the present paper is to propose a model to\nexplain the observed efficient flux expulsions and the role of spatial\ntemperature gradient during the cool-down of cavity. In the vicinity of a\nregion with a temperature close to the critical temperature Tc,the critical\nfields are strongly suppressed and can be smaller than the ambient magnetic\nfield. A region with a lower critical field smaller than the ambient field is\nin the vortex state. As a material is cooled down, a region with a temperature\nclose Tc associating the vortex state domain sweeps and passes through the\nmaterial. In this process, vortices contained in the vortex state domain are\ntrapped by pinning centers that randomly distribute in the material. A number\nof trapped vortices can be naively estimated by using the analogy with the\nbeam-target collision event. Based on this result, the residual resistance is\nevaluated. We find that a number of trapped vortices and the residual\nresistance are proportional to the strength of the ambient magnetic field and\nthe inverse of the temperature gradient. The obtained residual resistance\nagrees well with experimental results. A material property dependence of a\nnumber of trapped vortices is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2016 14:36:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 02:04:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-31"}
