With this comprehensive understanding and intuitive\ngeometric interpretation, we use the Raman process to create and tailor as well\nas study and characterize exotic topological spin textures in spinor BECs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2016 19:26:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 04:33:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

DES is using a wide-field camera (DECam)\non the 4m Blanco Telescope in Chile to image 5000 sq deg of the sky in five\nfilters (grizY). By its completion the survey is expected to have generated a\ncatalogue of 300 million galaxies with photometric redshifts and 100 million\nstars. In addition, a time-domain survey search over 27 sq deg is expected to\nyield a sample of thousands of Type Ia supernovae and other transients. The\nmain goals of DES are to characterise dark energy and dark matter, and to test\nalternative models of gravity; these goals will be pursued by studying large\nscale structure, cluster counts, weak gravitational lensing and Type Ia\nsupernovae. However, DES also provides a rich data set which allows us to study\nmany other aspects of astrophysics. In this paper we focus on additional\nscience with DES, emphasizing areas where the survey makes a difference with\nrespect to other current surveys. The paper illustrates, using early data (from\n`Science Verification', and from the first, second and third seasons of\nobservations), what DES can tell us about the solar system, the Milky Way,\ngalaxy evolution, quasars, and other topics. In addition, we show that if the\ncosmological model is assumed to be Lambda+ Cold Dark Matter (LCDM) then\nimportant astrophysics can be deduced from the primary DES probes.

In principle this can be determined by comparing the maximum\nentropy given the bivariate probability distributions to the true joint\nentropy.

Evidence of ongoing\nstar formation is seen in approximately 7% of the sample. The SFR of these\ngalaxies is less than 0.1 $M_{\\odot}yr^{-1}$. They also tend to be radio faint\n($P<10^{22}\\,WHz^{-1}$). There is a nearly equal fraction of star forming\ngalaxies in radio faint ($P<10^{22}\\,WHz^{-1}$) and radio bright galaxies\n($P\\geq10^{22}\\,WHz^{-1}$) suggesting that both star formation and radio mode\nfeedback are constrained to be very low in our sample. We notice that our\ngalaxy sample and the Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) follow similar trends\nin radio power versus SFR. This may be produced if both radio power and SFR are\nrelated to stellar mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2016 21:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

Here we, for the first time, establish a rigorous classification\nof topological metals that are protected by the PT symmetry using KO-theory. As\na physically realistic example, a PT-invariant nodal loop (NL) model in a 3D\nBrillouin zone is constructed, whose topological stability is revealed through\nits PT-symmetry-protected nontrivial Z2 topological charge. Based on these\nexact results, we propose an experimental scheme to realize and to detect\ntunable PT-invariant topological NL states with ultracold atoms in an optical\nlattice, in which atoms with two hyperfine spin states are loaded in a\nspin-dependent 3D OL and two pairs of Raman lasers are used to create\nout-of-plane spin-flip hopping with site-dependent phase. Such a realistic\ncold-atom setup can yield topological NL states, having a tunable ring-shaped\nband-touching line with the two-fold degeneracy in the bulk spectrum and\nnon-trivial surface states. The states are actually protected by the combined\nPT symmetry even in the absence of both P and T symmetries, and are\ncharacterized by a Z2-type invariant (a quantized Berry phase). Remarkably, we\ndemonstrate with numerical simulations that (i) the characteristic NL can be\ndetected by measuring the atomic transfer fractions in a Bloch-Zener\noscillation; (ii) the topological invariant may be measured based on the\ntime-of-flight imaging; and (iii) the surface states may be probed through\nBragg spectroscopy.

Following that this\nsurface density of 20 Msun/pc^2 well explains dwarf satellites in the Milky Way\nand Andromeda, we find that the evolution of the dark halo in this common\nsurface-density scale is characterized by the rapid increase of the halo mass\nassembled by the redshift z_TT of the tidal truncation by its host halo, at\nearly epochs of z_TT >~ 6 or V_max <~ 22 km/s.

Here we present an alternative\ninterpretation to these delayed-choice experiments. We notice that as all\ncomposite devices of MZI including BS2 are purely classical, the inserting and\nremoving operation of BS2 imposes a time-modulated Hamiltonian\nH_mod(t)=a(t)H_in+b(t)H_out, instead of a quantum superposition of H_in and\nH_out as H=a_wH_in+b_pH_out, to act upon the incident wave function. Solution\nof this quantum scattering problem, rather than the long held quantum\neigen-problem yields a synchronically time-modulated output wave function as\n\\psi_mod=a(t)\\psi_wave+b(t)\\psi_particle. As a result, the probability of\nparticle output from the MZI behaves as if they are in the superposition of the\nwave and particle state when many events over time accumulation are counted and\naveraged. We expect these elementary but insightful analyses will shed a new\nlight on exploring basic physics beyond the long-held wisdom of wave-particle\nduality and principle of complementarity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 05:06:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-05"}

The instability is\nthe result of a resonant interaction between a Rossby wave and a gravity wave\nwhich we refer to as Z-modes. The associated critical layer is the location\nwhere the Doppler shifted frequency of a distant Rossby wave equals the local\nBrunt-Vaisala frequency.

We address the\nrepair problem when a device storing data leaves the cell. We introduce a\nrepair scheduling where repair is performed periodically and derive analytical\nexpressions for the overall communication cost of content download and data\nrepair as a function of the repair interval. The derived expressions are then\nused to evaluate the communication cost entailed by DS using several erasure\ncorrecting codes. Our results show that DS can reduce the communication cost\nwith respect to the case where content is downloaded only from the BS, provided\nthat repairs are performed frequently enough. If devices storing content arrive\nto the cell, the communication cost using DS is further reduced and, for large\nenough arrival rate, it is always beneficial.

Numerous modern systems\nindeed generate ranking data, representing for instance ordered results to a\nquery or user preferences. Each such ranking usually involves a small but\nvarying subset of the whole catalog of items only. The study of the variability\nof these data, i.e. the statistical analysis of incomplete rank-ings, is\nhowever a great statistical and computational challenge, because of their\nheterogeneity and the related combinatorial complexity of the problem. Whereas\nmany statistical methods for analyzing full rankings (orderings of all the\nitems in the catalog) are documented in the dedicated literature, partial\nrankings (full rankings with ties) or pairwise comparisons, only a few\napproaches are available today to deal with incomplete ranking, relying each on\na strong specific assumption. It is the purpose of this article to introduce a\nnovel general framework for the statistical analysis of incomplete rankings. It\nis based on a representation tailored to these specific data, whose\nconstruction is also explained here, which fits with the natural multi-scale\nstructure of incomplete rankings and provides a new decomposition of rank\ninformation with a multiresolu-tion analysis interpretation (MRA). We show that\nthe MRA representation naturally allows to overcome both the statistical and\ncomputational challenges without any structural assumption on the data. It\ntherefore provides a general and flexible framework to solve a wide variety of\nstatistical problems, where data are of the form of incomplete rankings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 07:40:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-05"}

The model is then refined\nin two different directions. By allowing partial overlapping between\nconsecutive beads, we break the spherical symmetry and thus provide a severe\nconstraint on the possible conformations of the chain. This leads to a single\nhelix or a double helix ground state, depending on the range of the\ninteractions. Alternatively, we introduce additional spherical beads at\nspecific positions to represent the steric hindrance of the side chains in real\nproteins. The ground state in this case is found to be again a globule, thus\nshowing that contrary to some recent suggestions, side chains alone are not\nsufficient to insure a protein-like structure. Finally, we show that a\ncombination of the above two effects increases the stability of the obtaining\nsecondary structures, in agreement with previous results. The fundamental role\nplayed by the range of the square-well attraction is highlighted, and it is\nshown that they play a role similar to that found in simple liquids and\npolymers. Perspectives in terms of protein folding are finally discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 09:36:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2016 07:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-21"}

Is it optical pumping that first prepares a thermal ensemble,\nwith coherent superposition developing subsequently or is it the other way\nround: coherently superposed atoms driven to steady state via optical pumping?\nUsing a stroboscopic probing technique, here we experimentally explore these\nquestions. A 100 ns pulse is used to probe an experimentally simulated, closed\nthree-level, lambda-like configuration in rubidium atoms, driven by strong\ncoherent control and incoherent fields. Temporal evolution of probe\ntransmission shows an initial overshoot with turn-on of control, resulting in a\nscenario akin to lasing without inversion (LWI). The corresponding rise time is\ndictated by coherent dynamics, with a distinct experimental signature of\nhalf-cycle Rabi flop in a thermal ensemble of atoms. Our results indicate that,\nin fact, optical pumping drives the atoms to a steady state in a significantly\nlonger time-scale that sustains superposed dark states. Eventual control\nturn-off leads to a sudden fall in transmission with an ubiquitous signature\nfor identifying closed and open systems. Numerical simulations and toy-model\npredictions confirm our claims.

In particular, we show that\nno polynomial-time approximation to within a ratio of $\\sqrt{n}/4$ or less is\npossible, unless ${\\rm P}={\\rm NP}$. Furthermore, we develop a\n$(1+\\sqrt{n})$-approximation algorithm and thus settle the approximability of\ncomputing motivating subgraphs. Secondly, we study motivating reward\nconfigurations, where non-negative rewards $r(v)$ may be placed on arbitrary\nvertices $v$ of $G$. The agent only receives the rewards of visited vertices.\nAgain we give an NP-completeness result for deciding the existence of a\nmotivating reward configuration within a fixed budget $b$. This result even\nholds if $b=0$, which in turn implies that no efficient approximation of a\nminimum $b$ within a ration grater or equal to $1$ is possible, unless ${\\rm\nP}={\\rm NP}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 12:27:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-05"}

That functor, from the category of sets to itself, is\npostulated to be an equivalence on the full subcategory of finite sets onto\nitself and to preserve finite projective limits (equivalently, to preserve\nfinite products and equalizers). Secondly, \"Local\" non-standard analysis is\nintroduced as a structure which I call lim-rim, in particular exact lim-rims.\nThe interplay between these, and ultrafilters and ultrapowers, and also\ncardinality relations and notions depending on a cardinality such as saturation\nand what I call \"confinement\" and \"exactness\", are investigated.\n  In particular, one constructs non-standard analyses, with \"good\" kinds of\nlim-rims. In these one may say that *A - \"the adjunction of all possible limits\nfrom A\" - plays a role analogous to that of the algebraic closure of a field -\n\"the adjunction of all roots of polynomials\". Then in the same spirit as with\nthe latter, one has uniqueness up to isomorphism, and also universality and\nhomogeneity, provided one has enough General Continuum Hypothesis. The\ncardinality of *A will be something like $2^{2^{|A|}}$, and one has a high\ndegree of saturation.\n  Also, one notes that the functor * can be applied again to *A, giving **A,\n***A, and so forth.

This result suggests that in the noisy networks with\ncollective harmonic motions, the optimality of transport can be occurred in\nsuch a way that the contribution of incoherent term is more than the coherent\none.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 13:26:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 May 2018 10:23:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

Bipartite lattice geometries have allowed us to implement appropriate\nband structures, which meet three basic requirements: the existence of\nmetastable excited states sufficiently protected from collisional band\nrelaxation, a mechanism to excite the atoms initially prepared in the lowest\nband with moderate entropy increase, and the possibility of cross-dimensional\ntunneling dynamics, necessary to establish coherence along all lattice axes. A\nvariety of bands can be selectively populated and a subsequent thermalisation\nprocess leads to the formation of a condensate in the lowest energy state of\nthe chosen band. As examples the 2nd, 4th and 7th bands in a bipartite square\nlattice are discussed. In the 2nd and 7th band, the band geometry can be tuned\nsuch that two inequivalent energetically degenerate energy minima arise at the\n$X_{\\pm}$-points at the edge of the 1st Brillouin zone. In this case even a\nsmall interaction energy is sufficient to lock the phase between the two\ncondensation points such that a complex-valued chiral superfluid order\nparameter can emerge, which breaks time reversal symmetry. In the 4th band a\ncondensate can be formed in the $\\Gamma$-point in the center of the 1st\nBrillouin zone, which can be used to explore topologically protected band\ntouching points. The new techniques to access orbital degrees of freedom in\nhigher bands greatly extend the class of many-body scenarios that can be\nexplored with bosons in optical lattices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 13:35:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-04"}

We generalize the\nmulticomponent WR model by replacing the hard-core exclusion between unlike\nparticles by more realistic large (but finite) repulsion. The model is solved\nexactly on the Bethe lattice with an arbitrary coordination number. The\nnumerical calculations, based on the corner transfer matrix renormalization\ngroup, are performed for the two-dimensional square lattice. The results for\n$M=4$ indicate that the second-order phase transitions from the disordered gas\nto the demixed phase become of first order, for an arbitrarily large finite\nrepulsion. The results for $M\\ge M_0$ show that, as the repulsion weakens, the\nregion of crystal phase diminishes itself. For weak enough repulsions, the\ndirect transition between the crystal and demixed phases changes into a\nseparate pair of crystal-gas and gas-demixed transitions; this is an example of\na disorder-disorder reentrant transition via an ordered crystal phase. If the\nrepulsion between unlike species is too weak, the crystal phase disappears from\nthe phase diagram.

Gas hydrodynamical effects can additionally strip gas\nand dust from galaxies. The properties of the ICL can therefore help constrain\nthe physical processes at work in clusters by serving as a fossil record of the\ninteraction history. The present study is designed to characterise this ICL in\na ~10^14 M_odot and z~0.53 cluster of galaxies from imaging and spectroscopic\npoints of view. By applying a wavelet-based method to CFHT Megacam and WIRCAM\nimages, we detect significant quantities of diffuse light. These sources were\nthen spectroscopically characterised with MUSE. MUSE data were also used to\ncompute redshifts of 24 cluster galaxies and search for cluster substructures.\nAn atypically large amount of ICL has been detected in this cluster. Part of\nthe detected diffuse light has a very weak optical stellar component and\napparently consists mainly of gas emission, while other diffuse light sources\nare clearly dominated by old stars. Furthermore, emission lines were detected\nin several places of diffuse light. Our spectral analysis shows that this\nemission likely originates from low-excitation parameter gas. The stellar\ncontribution to the ICL is about 2.3x10^9 yrs old even though the ICL is not\ncurrently forming a large number of stars. On the other hand, the contribution\nof the gas emission to the ICL in the optical is much greater than the stellar\ncontribution in some regions, but the gas density is likely too low to form\nstars. These observations favour ram pressure stripping, turbulent viscous\nstripping, or supernovae winds as the origin of the large amount of\nintracluster light. Since the cluster appears not to be in a major merging\nphase, we conclude that ram pressure stripping is the most plausible process\nthat generates the observed ICL sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 14:42:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

Different geometrical\nconfigurations were considered in order to investigate the main characteristics\nof the flow as a function of the aspect ratio (AR) of the canopy. To this end,\na summary of the two-dimensional fields of the fundamental turbulence\nparameters is given for AR ranging from 1 to 2. The results show that the flow\nfield depends strongly on AR only within the canyon, while the outer flow seems\nto be less sensitive to this parameter. This is not true for the vertical\nmomentum flux, which is one of the parameters most affected by AR, both within\nand outside the canyon. The experiments also indicate that, when (i.e. the\nskimming flow regime), the roughness sub-layer extends up to a height equal to\n1.25 times the height of the obstacles (H), surmounted by an inertial sub-layer\nthat extends up to 2.7 H. In contrast, for (i.e. the wake-interference regime)\nthe inertial sub-layer is not present. This has significant implications when\nusing similarity laws for deriving wind and turbulence profiles in canopy\nflows.

The first one is based on the\nfluctuating strain rate tensor, while the second is related to the mean strain\nrate tensor. It is shown that the two expressions give similar results, but the\nformer is more complicated, suggesting that the latter might be used in\nnumerical models with a certain degree of reliability. Finally, the data\npresented can also be used as a dataset for the validation of numerical models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 15:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

Yet, network links usually represent\nonly parts of filaments, which, when neglected, may lead to erroneous\nconclusions from network-based analyses. The existing alternatives to detect\nfilaments in network representations require tuning of parameters over a large\nrange of values and treat all filaments equally, thus, precluding automated\nanalysis of diverse filamentous systems. Here, we propose a fully automated and\nrobust optimisation-based approach to detect filaments of consistent\nintensities and angles in a given network. We test and demonstrate the accuracy\nof our solution with contrived, biological, and cosmic filamentous structures.\nIn particular, we show that the proposed approach provides powerful automated\nmeans to study properties of individual actin filaments in their network\ncontext. Our solution is made publicly available as an open-source tool,\nDeFiNe, facilitating decomposition of any given network into individual\nfilaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 10:23:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-01"}
