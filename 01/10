Macrocell users are primary users (PUs)\nwhile those within local cells, e.g., femtocell users, or desiring\ncost-effective services, e.g., roamers, are identified as secondary users\n(SUs). The SUs share the spectrum resources of the PUs in a underlay way, thus\nthe transmit power of a secondary is strictly limited by the primary's\ntolerable interference power. Given such constraints, a cooperative relaying\ntransmission between a SU and the macrocell base station (BS) is necessary. In\norder to guarantee the success of dual-hop relaying and avoid multi-hop\nrelaying, a new cooperative paradigm is proposed, where an idle PU (instead of\na secondary as assumed in general) in the vicinity of a target SU is chosen to\nserve as a relaying node, thanks to the fact that any PU can always transmit to\nthe macrocell BS directly.

The primarily goal of\nthis work is to assess whether disk irradiation by a Pre-Main Sequence star\nwould influence the photophoretic transport. To do so, we have implemented an\nevolving 1+1D model of an accretion disk, including advanced numerical\ntechniques, undergoing a time-dependent irradiation, consistent with the\nevolution of the proto-Sun along the Pre-Main Sequence. The photophoresis is\ndescribed using a formalism introduced in several previous works. Adopting the\nopacity prescription used in these former studies, we find that the disk\nirradiation enhances the photophoretic transport: the assumption of a disk\ncentral hole of several astronomical units in radius is no longer strictly\nrequired, whereas the need for an ad hoc introduction of photoevaporation is\nreduced. However, we show that a residual trail of small particles could\nannihilate the photophoretic driven transport via their effect on the opacity.\nWe have also confirmed that the thermal conductivity of transported aggregates\nis a crucial parameter which could limit or even suppress the photophoretic\nmigration and generate several segregation effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2016 18:29:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-12"}

The I-Love-Q relations (between\nthe moment of inertia, the tidal deformability and the quadrupole moment) are\nhowever approximately insensitive to this structure. These relations become\nexact for stationary black holes in General Relativity as shown by the no-hair\ntheorems. In this paper, we take the first steps toward studying how the\napproximate I-Love-Q relations become exact in the limit as compact stars\nbecome black holes. To do so, we consider a toy model, i.e. incompressible\nstars with anisotropic pressure, which allows us to model an equilibrium\nsequence of stars with their compactness approaching the black hole limit\narbitrarily closely. We extract the I-Love-Q trio by numerically constructing\nsuch a sequence in the slow-rotation and small-tide approximations. We find\nthat the I-Love-Q relations approach the black hole limit in a nontrivial way,\nwith the quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability changing sign as the\ncompactness and the amount of anisotropy are increased. Generalizing Maclaurin\nspheroids to anisotropic stars, we show that the multipole moments also change\nsign in the Newtonian limit as the amount of anisotropy is increased. We also\nprove analytically that the stellar moment of inertia reaches the black hole\nlimit as the compactness reaches the black hole value in the strongly\nanisotropic limit. Modeling the black hole limit through a sequence of\nanisotropic stars, however, fails when considering other theories of gravity.\nWe calculate the scalar dipole charge and the moment of inertia in a\nparity-violating modified theory and find that these quantities do not tend to\ntheir black hole counterparts as the anisotropic stellar sequence approaches\nthe black hole limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2016 01:50:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 May 2016 18:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-27"}

In order to cope with such conditions the\nALICE Time Projection Chamber (TPC) needs to be upgraded. After the upgrade the\nTPC will run in a continuous mode, without any degradation of the momentum and\ndE/dx resolution compared to the performance of the present TPC. Since readout\nby multi-wire proportional chambers is no longer feasible with these\nrequirements, new technologies have to be employed. In the new readout chambers\nthe electron amplification is provided by a stack of four Gas Electron\nMultiplier (GEM) foils. Their high voltage settings and orientation have been\noptimised to provide an energy resolution better then 12% at the photopeak of\n55Fe. At the same settings the Ion BackFlow into the drift volume is less than\n1% of the effective number of ions produced during gas amplification and the\nprimary ionisations. This is necessary to prevent the accumulation of space\ncharge, which eventually will distort the field in the drift volume. To ensure\nstable operation at the high loads during LHC run 3 the chambers have to be\nrobust against discharges, too. With the selected configuration in a quadruple\nGEM stack the discharge probability is kept at the level of $10^{-12}$\ndischarges per incoming hadron. An overview of the ALICE TPC upgrade activities\nwill be given in these proceedings and the optimised settings foreseen for the\nGEM stacks of the future readout chambers are introduced. Furthermore the\noutcome of two beam time campaigns at SPS and PS (at CERN) in the end of 2014\nis shown. At this campaigns the stability against discharges and the dE/dx\nperformance of a full size readout chamber prototype was tested. In addition it\nis reported on charging-up studies of 4GEM stacks and on tests of\nelectromagnetic sagging of large GEM foils.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2016 07:02:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 14:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-12"}

In this paper, a new\nwireless energy harvesting protocol is proposed for an underlay cognitive relay\nnetwork with multiple primary user (PU) transceivers. In this protocol, the\nsecondary nodes can harvest energy from the primary network (PN) while sharing\nthe licensed spectrum of the PN. In order to assess the impact of different\nsystem parameters on the proposed network, we first derive an exact expression\nfor the outage probability for the secondary network (SN) subject to three\nimportant power constraints: 1) the maximum transmit power at the secondary\nsource (SS) and at the secondary relay (SR), 2) the peak interference power\npermitted at each PU receiver, and 3) the interference power from each PU\ntransmitter to the SR and to the secondary destination (SD). To obtain\npractical design insights into the impact of different parameters on successful\ndata transmission of the SN, we derive throughput expressions for both the\ndelay-sensitive and the delay-tolerant transmission modes. We also derive\nasymptotic closed-form expressions for the outage probability and the\ndelay-sensitive throughput and an asymptotic analytical expression for the\ndelay-tolerant throughput as the number of PU transceivers goes to infinity.\nThe results show that the outage probability improves when PU transmitters are\nlocated near SS and sufficiently far from SR and SD.
