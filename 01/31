With further increase of voltage, this saturation breaks down\n(overlimiting conductance, OLC). In open systems OLC is mediated by a\nmicroscale vortical flow which develops as a result of electroconvective\ninstability (ECI) of quiescent CP near LC. Electroconvection (EC) is a flow\ndriven by the electric force acting either upon the space charge of the\ninterfacial EDL (electroosmosis, EO) or the residual space charge of the\nquasielectroneutral bulk (bulk EC). There are two types of EO, the equilibrium\nand the nonequilibrium one. The former relates to the action of the tangential\nelectric field upon the space charge of the EDL, and the latter pertains to the\nsimilar action upon the extended space charge, forming next to the EDL near LC.\nFor a perfectly charge-selective interface, CP is stable under the equilibrium\nEO or bulk EC, but nonequilibrium EO may cause ECI. For this reason until\nrecently, ECI in CP was attributed to this latter mechanism. Lately, it was\nshown that imperfect charge-selectivity of the interface makes equilibrium ECI\npossible, driven by either equilibrium EO or bulk EC, or both. Here we identify\nand analyze the major surface and bulk factors affecting the ECI. These factors\n(diffusioosmosis, EO, bulk EC, and some newly identified ones) are\nmanifestations of the electric force and pressure gradient, balanced by the\nviscous force acting in various locations in solution. The contribution of\nthese factors to ECI in CP is analyzed for a varying interface permselectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2016 16:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

In the context of absorption imaging in\ndiffuse optical tomography, one approach to addressing this bottleneck proposed\nrecently (de Sturler, et al, 2015) reformulates the viewing of the forward\nproblem as a differential algebraic system, and then employs model order\nreduction (MOR). However, the construction of the reduced model requires the\nsolution of several full order problems (i.e. the full discretized PDE for\nmultiple right-hand sides) to generate a candidate global basis. This step is\nthen followed by a rank-revealing factorization of the matrix containing the\ncandidate basis in order to compress the basis to a size suitable for\nconstructing the reduced transfer function. The present paper addresses the\ncosts associated with the global basis approximation in two ways. First, we use\nthe structure of the matrix to rewrite the full order transfer function, and\ncorresponding derivatives, such that the full order systems to be solved are\nsymmetric (positive definite in the zero frequency case). Then we apply MOR to\nthe new formulation of the problem. Second, we give an approach to computing\nthe global basis approximation dynamically as the full order systems are\nsolved. In this phase, only the incrementally new, relevant information is\nadded to the existing global basis, and redundant information is not computed.\nThis new approach is achieved by an inner-outer Krylov recycling approach which\nhas potential use in other applications as well. We show the value of the new\napproach to approximate global basis computation on two DOT absorption image\nreconstruction problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2016 16:54:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 00:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-08"}

However, by calculating the Wigner quasi--probability distribution for\nvarious initial field states, we show that unique quantum features in optical\nphase space, absent from the linear amplifier, are maintained for extended\ntimes. These features are related to the discrete nature of the two--photon\nmatter--field interaction, and fingerprint the initial field state at\nthermodynamic times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2016 18:40:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-17"}

We discuss the physical\nparameters of the jets and their relation with other phenomena such as H alpha\nsurges, nonthermal type III radio bursts and hard X-ray emission. Using AIA\nwavelength channels sensitive to coronal temperatures, we studied the\ntemperature distribution in the jets using the line-of-sight Differential\nEmission Measure technique. We also investigated the role of the photospheric\nmagnetic field using the LOS magnetogram data from the HMI. The lifetime of\njets range from 5 to 39 minutes with an average of 18 minutes and their\nvelocities range from 87 to 532 km/s with an average of 271 km/s. Most of the\njets are co-temporal with nonthermal type III radio bursts observed by the\nWind/WAVES spacecraft. We confirm the source region of these bursts using the\nPotential Field Source Surface technique. 10 out of 20 events showed that the\njets originated in a region of flux cancellation and 6 jets in a region of flux\nemergence. 4 events showed flux emergence and then cancellation during the jet\nevolution. DEM analyses showed that for most of the spires of the jets, the DEM\npeaked at around log T [K] = 6.2/6.3. In addition, we derived an emission\nmeasure and a lower limit of electron density at the location of the spire and\nthe footpoint. These results are in agreement with those obtained earlier by\nstudying individual active region jets. The observation of flux cancellation,\nthe association with HXR emission and emission of nonthermal type III radio\nbursts, suggest that the initiation and therefore, heating is taking place at\nthe base of the jet. This is also supported by the high temperature plasma\nrevealed by the DEM analysis in the jet footpoint. Our results provide\nsubstantial constraints for theoretical modeling of the jets and their\nthermodynamic nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2016 19:12:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

The method receives an image of a transparent vessel\ncontaining a material and the contour of the vessel in the image. The boundary\nof the material in the vessel is found by the graph cut method. In general the\nmethod uses the vessel region of the image to create a graph, where pixels are\nvertices, and the cost of an edge between two pixels is inversely correlated\nwith their intensity difference. The bottom 10% of the vessel region in the\nimage is assumed to correspond to the material phase and defined as the graph\nand source.

Moreover, similar\nto the $2D$ case, we find that some seemingly possible symmetry\nfractionalization patterns are actually anomalous and cannot be realized\nstrictly in $3D$. We detect such anomalies using the flux fusion method we\nintroduced previously in $2D$. To illustrate these ideas, we use the $3D$ $Z_2$\ngauge theory with $Z_2$ global symmetry as an example, and enumerate and\ndescribe the corresponding SET phases. In particular, we find four\nnon-anomalous SET phases and one anomalous SET phase, which we show can be\nrealized as the surface of a $4D$ system with symmetry protected topological\norder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2016 02:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-11"}

DRR identifies the nonlinear features\nthrough multivariate regression to ensure the reduction in redundancy between\nhe PCA coefficients, the reduction of the variance of the scores, and the\nreduction in the reconstruction error. More importantly, unlike other nonlinear\ndimensionality reduction methods, the invertibility, volume-preservation, and\nstraightforward out-of-sample extension, makes DRR interpretable and easy to\napply.

However, analytical estimates can be\nobtained only for particular combinations of analytical models of signal and\nnoise, thus precluding its straightforward extension to deal with other\narbitrary noise sources. In this paper, we propose an alternative non-explicit\nway to take into account the relations among natural image wavelet coefficients\nfor denoising: we use support vector regression (SVR) in the wavelet domain to\nenforce these relations in the estimated signal. Since relations among the\ncoefficients are specific to the signal, the regularization property of SVR is\nexploited to remove the noise, which does not share this feature. The specific\nsignal relations are encoded in an anisotropic kernel obtained from mutual\ninformation measures computed on a representative image database. Training\nconsiders minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the\nestimated and actual probability functions of signal and noise in order to\nenforce similarity. Due to its non-parametric nature, the method can eventually\ncope with different noise sources without the need of an explicit\nre-formulation, as it is strictly necessary under parametric Bayesian\nformalisms. Results under several noise levels and noise sources show that: (1)\nthe proposed method outperforms conventional wavelet methods that assume\ncoefficient independence, (2) it is similar to state-of-the-art methods that do\nexplicitly include these relations when the noise source is Gaussian, and (3)\nit gives better numerical and visual performance when more complex, realistic\nnoise sources are considered.

Contrarily to previous approaches, PPA reduces to performing\nsimple univariate regressions, which makes it computationally feasible and\nrobust. Moreover, PPA shows a number of interesting analytical properties.\nFirst, PPA is a volume-preserving map, which in turn guarantees the existence\nof the inverse. Second, such an inverse can be obtained in closed form.\nInvertibility is an important advantage over other learning methods, because it\npermits to understand the identified features in the input domain where the\ndata has physical meaning. Moreover, it allows to evaluate the performance of\ndimensionality reduction in sensible (input-domain) units. Volume preservation\nalso allows an easy computation of information theoretic quantities, such as\nthe reduction in multi-information after the transform. Third, the analytical\nnature of PPA leads to a clear geometrical interpretation of the manifold: it\nallows the computation of Frenet-Serret frames (local features) and of\ngeneralized curvatures at any point of the space. And fourth, the analytical\nJacobian allows the computation of the metric induced by the data, thus\ngeneralizing the Mahalanobis distance.

In this work,\nwe propose a solution to this problem by using a family of Rotation-based\nIterative Gaussianization (RBIG) transforms. The general framework consists of\nthe sequential application of a univariate marginal Gaussianization transform\nfollowed by an orthonormal transform. The proposed procedure looks for\ndifferentiable transforms to a known PDF so that the unknown PDF can be\nestimated at any point of the original domain. In particular, we aim at a zero\nmean unit covariance Gaussian for convenience. RBIG is formally similar to\nclassical iterative Projection Pursuit (PP) algorithms. However, we show that,\nunlike in PP methods, the particular class of rotations used has no special\nqualitative relevance in this context, since looking for interestingness is not\na critical issue for PDF estimation. The key difference is that our approach\nfocuses on the univariate part (marginal Gaussianization) of the problem rather\nthan on the multivariate part (rotation). This difference implies that one may\nselect the most convenient rotation suited to each practical application. The\ndifferentiability, invertibility and convergence of RBIG are theoretically and\nexperimentally analyzed. Relation to other methods, such as Radial\nGaussianization (RG), one-class support vector domain description (SVDD), and\ndeep neural networks (DNN) is also pointed out. The practical performance of\nRBIG is successfully illustrated in a number of multidimensional problems such\nas image synthesis, classification, denoising, and multi-information\nestimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2016 11:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-02"}

The few statistical approaches that do consider both\nphenomena simultaneously follow parametric formulations based on empirical\nmodels. Therefore, it may be argued that the behavior does not come directly\nfrom the color statistics but from the convenient functional form adopted. In\naddition, many times the whole statistical analysis is based on simplified\ndatabases that disregard relevant physical effects in the input signal, as for\ninstance by assuming flat Lambertian surfaces. Here we address the simultaneous\nstatistical explanation of (i) the nonlinear behavior of achromatic and\nchromatic mechanisms in a fixed adaptation state, and (ii) the change of such\nbehavior. Both phenomena emerge directly from the samples through a single\ndata-driven method: the Sequential Principal Curves Analysis (SPCA) with local\nmetric. SPCA is a new manifold learning technique to derive a set of sensors\nadapted to the manifold using different optimality criteria. A new database of\ncolorimetrically calibrated images of natural objects under these illuminants\nwas collected. The results obtained by applying SPCA show that the\npsychophysical behavior on color discrimination thresholds, discount of the\nilluminant and corresponding pairs in asymmetric color matching, emerge\ndirectly from realistic data regularities assuming no a priori functional form.\nThese results provide stronger evidence for the hypothesis of a statistically\ndriven organization of color sensors.

One alternative to\nDeep Level introduction is the use of a quantum box, which is a hole\nquantum-well and an electron barrier. In all of these cases the buried gate\nmodulates the drain-source current. This principle was formerly evaluated with\nrealistic simulations parameters and this shows that a measurable signal is\nobtained for an energy deposition of a minimum-ionizing particle within a\nlimited silicon thickness. In this work a quantitative study of the response of\nsuch a pixel to Minimum Ionizing Particles. The influence of some parameters\nsuch as the thickness of the pixel and its lateral dimensions, on the operation\nof the pixel is studied here using current available simulation tools, in\nquantum mode when a narrow Ge layer is used as a buried gate. A bias sequence\nis introduced here to separate the operation of the pixel in detection and\nreadout mode. The first frabrication technique introduced is deep impurity\nimplantation, followed by annealing. Recent work on quantum boxes and dots\nopens the possibility to the use Ge boxes as a DTG.Ion implantation and\nalternative methods such an epitaxial growth DTG can be reasonably considered.\nIf the related bottlenecks are overcome the pixel should be a good candidate\nfor high luminosity particle collider inner detectors, provides that its\npotential radiation hardness is proven sufficient for these applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2016 15:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-02"}

Drag-free technology is one of the\ntechnologies that is fundamental for LISA-Pathfinder, an ESA mission whose\nlaunch is planned for the end of September 2015. A purely drag-free object is\ndefined by the absence of all external forces other than gravity. This is not a\nnatural condition and thus requires a proper design of a spacecraft, whose core\nis an object in free-fall, called test mass (TM). The purity of the drag-free\norbit depends on the spacecraft capability of protecting the TM from\ndisturbances, which indeed has limitations. According to a NASA study, such a\nconcept provides substantial economies for LEO satellites. At the same time, a\ndrag-free motion is required in many missions of fundamental physics. eLISA is\nan ESA concept mission aimed at opening a new window to the universe, black\nholes, and massive binary systems by means of gravitational waves.\nLISA-Pathfinder is in charge of proving the eLISA concept. In this frame, the\nsystem holding the TM during launch and releasing it in free-fall before the\nscience phase represents a single point of failure for the whole mission. This\nthesis describes the phenomena, operations, issues, tests, activities, and\nsimulations linked to the release following a system engineering approach.\nExperimental studies have been carried out to investigate this phenomenon in\nconditions representative of the LISA-Pathfinder flight environment. The last\npart of the thesis is dedicated to the preliminary design of the housing of the\nTM in the frame of a low-cost mission conceived at Stanford (USA). The ambition\nof this work is increasing the maturity of the technology needed in drag-free\nprojects and therefore provide a starting point for future fascinating and\nchallenging missions of this kind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2016 15:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-02"}
