Next, we summarize\nour results for three asteroid families, namely (1726) Hoffmeister, (1128)\nAstrid and (1521) Seinajoki which have irregular distributions of their members\nin the proper elements space, indicative of the effect of the resonance. We\nconfirm this by performing a set of numerical simulations, showcasing that the\nperturbing action of Ceres through its linear nodal secular resonance is\nessential to reproduce the actual shape of the families.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 17:05:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

Based on analytical\nconsiderations, this mechanism has been recently identified as been potentially\nable to prevent the production of small dust grains in debris discs and cut off\ntheir size distribution at sizes larger than the blow-out size. We numerically\ninvestigate the importance of this effect to find under which conditions it can\nleave a signature in the small-size end of a disc's particle size distribution\n(PSD). An important part of this work is to map out, in a disc at steady-state,\nwhat is the most likely collisional origin for micron-sized grains, in terms of\nthe sizes of their collisional progenitors. We implement, for the first time,\nthe surface energy constraint into a collisional evolution code. We consider a\ndebris disc extending from 50 to 100AU and 2 different stellar types. We also\nconsider two levels of stirring in the disc: dynamically \"hot\" (e=0.075) and\n\"cold\" (e=0.01). For all cases, we derive $s_{surf}$ maps as a function of\ntarget and projectile sizes, $s_t$ and $s_p$, and compare them to equivalent\nmaps for the dust-production rate. We then compute disc-integrated PSDs and\nestimate the imprint of the surface energy constraint. We find that the\n($s_p$,$s_t$) regions of high $s_{surf}$ values do not coincide with those of\nhigh dust production rate. As a consequence, the surface energy constraint has\ngenerally a weak effect on the system's PSD. The maximum $s_{surf}$-induced\ndepletion of $\\mu$m-sized grains is $\\sim 30$% and is obtained for a sun-like\nstar and a dynamically hot case. For the e=0.01 cases, the surface energy\neffect is negligible compared to the massive small grain depletion induced by\nanother mechanism: the natural imbalance between dust production and\ndestruction rates in low-stirring discs identified by Thebault&Wu(2008).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 17:08:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 13:13:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 14:08:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 12:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

More recently, a theoretical framework for neural sampling has been\nproposed, which explains how sample-based inference can be performed by\nnetworks of spiking neurons. One particular requirement of this approach is\nthat the neural response function closely follows a logistic curve.\n  Analytical approaches to calculating neural response functions have been the\nsubject of many theoretical studies. In order to make the problem tractable,\nparticular assumptions regarding the neural or synaptic parameters are usually\nmade. However, biologically significant activity regimes exist which are not\ncovered by these approaches: Under strong synaptic bombardment, as is often the\ncase in cortex, the neuron is shifted into a high-conductance state (HCS)\ncharacterized by a small membrane time constant. In this regime, synaptic time\nconstants and refractory periods dominate membrane dynamics.\n  The core idea of our approach is to separately consider two different \"modes\"\nof spiking dynamics: burst spiking and transient quiescence, in which the\nneuron does not spike for longer periods. We treat the former by propagating\nthe PDF of the effective membrane potential from spike to spike within a burst,\nwhile using a diffusion approximation for the latter. We find that our\nprediction of the neural response function closely matches simulation data.\nMoreover, in the HCS scenario, we show that the neural response function\nbecomes symmetric and can be well approximated by a logistic function, thereby\nproviding the correct dynamics in order to perform neural sampling.

Military mission\nsuccess is highly dependent on the communications and information systems\n(CISs) that support the mission and their use in the cyber battlespace. The\ninexorably growing dependency on computational information processing for\nweapons, intelligence, communication, and logistics systems continues to\nincrease the vulnerability of missions to various cyber threats. Attacks on\nCISs or other cyber incidents degrade or disrupt the usage of CISs, and the\nresulting mission capability, performance, and completion. These incidents are\nexpected to increase in frequency and sophistication. The workshop participants\nconcluded that the key to solving the mission impact assessment problem was in\nadopting and developing a new model-driven paradigm that creates and validates\nmechanisms of modeling the mission organization, the mission(s), and the\ncyber-vulnerable systems that support the mission(s). Such models then simulate\nor portray the impacts of the cyber-attacks. In addition, such model-based\nanalysis could explore multiple alternative mitigation and work-around\nstrategies - an essential part of coping with mission impact - and select the\noptimal course of mitigating actions. Only such a paradigm can be expected to\nprovide meaningful, actionable information about mission impacts that have not\nbeen seen before or do not match prior experiences and patterns.

The model provides a simplified description of transport in marginally\nstable systems including vorticity mixing in strong shear flows and electron\ndynamics in plasmas. Self-consistency is incorporated through a mean-field that\ncouples all the degrees-of-freedom. The model is formulated as a large set of\n$N$ coupled standard-like area-preserving twist maps in which the amplitude and\nphase of the perturbation, rather than being constant like in the standard map,\nare dynamical variables. Of particular interest is the study of the impact of\nperiodic orbits on the chaotic transport and coherent structures. Numerical\nsimulations show that self-consistency leads to the formation of a coherent\nmacro-particle trapped around the elliptic fixed point of the system that\nappears together with an asymptotic periodic behavior of the mean field. To\nmodel this asymptotic state, we introduced a non-autonomous map that allows a\ndetailed study of the onset of global transport. A turnstile-type transport\nmechanism that allows transport across instantaneous KAM invariant circles in\nnon-autonomous systems is discussed. As a first step to understand transport,\nwe study a special type of orbits referred to as sequential periodic orbits.\nUsing symmetry properties we show that, through replication, high-dimensional\nsequential periodic orbits can be generated starting from low-dimensional\nperiodic orbits. We show that sequential periodic orbits in the self-consistent\nmap can be continued from trivial (uncoupled) periodic orbits of standard-like\nmaps using numerical and asymptotic methods. Normal forms are used to describe\nthese orbits and to find the values of the map parameters that guarantee their\nexistence. Numerical simulations are used to verify the prediction from the\nasymptotic methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 19:27:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-11"}

We consider\nthe case where the toroidal field is unperturbed and the toroidal symmetry of\nthe system is preserved. The balance between the change in canonical angular\nmomentum and the input of mechanical angular momentum in such system requires\nrunaways to drift horizontally in configuration space for any given change in\nmomentum space. The dynamic of this drift can be obtained by taking the\nvariation of canonical angular momentum. It is then found that runaway\nelectrons will always drift inward as long as they are decelerating. This drift\nmotion is essentially non-linear, since the current is carried by runaways\nthemselves, and any runaway drift relative to the magnetic axis will cause\nfurther displacement of the axis itself. A simplified analytical model is\nconstructed to describe such inward drift both in ideal wall case and no wall\ncase, and the runaway current center displacement as a function of parallel\nmomentum variation is obtained. The time scale of such displacement is\nestimated by considering effective radiation drag, which shows reasonable\nagreement with observed displacement time scale. This indicates that the phase\nspace dynamic studied here plays a major role in the horizontal displacement of\nrunaway electrons during plateau regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 19:48:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2016 04:08:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 04:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-26"}

This problem arises\nprimarily from the assumptions of a constant magnetic field with $n$=3, and an\ninitial spin period that is much smaller than the observed current period. It\nhas been suggested that a solution to this problem involves magnetic field\nevolution, with some NSs having magnetic fields buried within the crust by\naccretion of fall-back supernova material following their birth. In this work\nwe explore a parametric phenomenological model for magnetic field growth that\ngeneralizes previous suggested field evolution functions, and apply it to a\nvariety of NSs with both secure SNR associations and known ages.

Methods: We have developed HopkinsPD, a novel smartphone-based\nmonitoring platform, which measures symptoms actively (i.e. data are collected\nwhen a suite of tests is initiated by the individual at specific times during\nthe day), and passively (i.e. data are collected continuously in the\nbackground). After data collection, we extract features to assess measures of\nfive key behaviors related to PD symptoms -- voice, balance, gait, dexterity,\nand reaction time. A random forest classifier is used to discriminate\nmeasurements taken after a dose of medication (treatment) versus before the\nmedication dose (baseline). Results: A worldwide study for remote PD monitoring\nwas established using HopkinsPD in July, 2014. This study used entirely remote,\nonline recruitment and installation, demonstrating highly cost-effective\nscalability. In six months, 226 individuals (121 PD and 105 controls)\ncontributed over 46,000 hours of passive monitoring data and approximately\n8,000 instances of structured tests of voice, balance, gait, reaction, and\ndexterity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to have\ncollected data at such a scale for remote PD monitoring. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate the initial ability to discriminate treatment from baseline with\n71.0(+-0.4)% accuracy, which suggests medication response can be monitored\nremotely via smartphone-based measures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 20:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-06"}

It is believed that carbon and $s$-elements were accreted from the\nwind of an AGB primary star, a scenario that is generally accepted to explain\nthe formation of CEMP stars that are only enhanced in $s$-elements (CEMP-$s$\nstars). The origin of $r$-element-enrichment in CEMP-$r/s$ stars is debated and\nmany formation scenarios have been put forward. We aim to determine the\nlikelihood of the scenarios proposed to explain the formation of CEMP-$r/s$\nstars. We calculate the frequency of CEMP-$r/s$ stars among CEMP-$s$ stars for\na variety of scenarios, and we compare it with that determined from an observed\nsample of CEMP-$r/s$ stars collected from the literature. The theoretical\nfrequency of CEMP-$r/s$ stars predicted in most scenarios underestimates the\nobserved ratio by at least a factor of 5. If the enrichments in $s$- and\n$r$-elements are independent, the model ratio of CEMP-$r/s$ to CEMP-$s$ stars\nis about 22%, that is approximately consistent with the lowest estimate of the\nobserved ratio. However, this model predicts that about one third of all\ncarbon-normal stars have [Ba/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] higher than 1, and that 40% of all\nCEMP stars have [Ba/Eu]$\\le0$. Stars with these properties are at least ten\ntimes rarer in our observed sample. The $intermediate$ or $i$-process, which is\nsupposedly active in some circumstances during the AGB phase, could provide an\nexplanation of the origin of CEMP-$r/s$ stars, similar to that of CEMP-$s$\nstars, in the context of wind mass accretion in binary systems. Further\ncalculations of the nucleosynthesis of the $i$-process and of the detailed\nevolution of late AGB stars are needed to investigate if this scenario predicts\na CEMP-$r/s$ star frequency consistent with the observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 21:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive strategy, based on the\ngeometric arrangement of commuting projectors in the toric code, to generate\nand characterize coupled-wire realizations of strongly-interacting\nthree-dimensional topological phases. We show how this method can be used to\nconstruct pointlike and linelike excitations, and to determine the topological\ndegeneracy.

Remarkably we can also celebrate the\nbirthday of the model, as it has been introduced about 30 years ago as the\nfirst solution of the star-triangle equations parametrized in terms of higher\ngenus functions. After introducing the most general checkerboard Yang--Baxter\nequation, we specialize to the star-triangle equation, also discussing its\nrelation with knot theory. Then we show how the integrable chiral Potts model\nleads to special identities for basic hypergeometric series in the $q$ a\nroot-of-unity limit. Many of the well-known summation formulae for basic\nhypergeometric series do not work in this case. However, if we require the\nsummand to be periodic, then there are many summable series.

To further investigate the observed feature of spectral\nsoftening, we now systematically search the X-ray afterglows detected by X-Ray\nTelescope (XRT) of Swift and collect twelve GRBs with significant late-time\nspectral softening. We find that dust scattering could be the dominant\nradiative mechanism for these X-ray afterglows regarding their temporal and\nspectral features. For some well observed bursts with high-quality data, their\ntime-resolved spectra could be well produced within the scattering scenario by\ntaking into account the X-ray absorption from circum-burst medium.

ASASSN-15lh was even claimed as the most\nluminous SN ever discovered, challenging the scenarios so far proposed for\nstellar explosions. Here we use our radiation hydrodynamics code in order to\nsimulate magnetar powered SNe. To avoid explicitly assuming neutron star\nproperties we adopt the magnetar luminosity and spin-down timescale as free\nparameters of the model. We find that the light curve (LC) of SN 2011kl is\nconsistent with a magnetar power source, as previously proposed, but we note\nthat some amount of 56^Ni (> 0.08 M_sun) is necessary to explain the low\ncontrast between the LC peak and tail. For the case of ASASSN-15lh we find\nphysically plausible magnetar parameters that reproduce the overall shape of\nthe LC provided the progenitor mass is relatively large (a mass of the ejecta\napprox 6 M_sun). The ejecta hydrodynamics of this event is dominated by the\nmagnetar input, while the effect is more moderate for SN 2011kl. We conclude\nthat a magnetar model may be used for the interpretation of these events and\nthat the hydrodynamic modeling is necessary to derive the properties of\npowerful magnetars and their progenitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2016 00:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

This 'galaxy\nformation efficiency' correlates strongly and with little scatter with halo\nmass, dropping steadily towards dwarf galaxies. The baryonic mass of a galaxy\nmay thus be used to place a lower limit on total halo mass and, consequently,\non its asymptotic maximum circular velocity. A number of observed dwarfs seem\nto violate this constraint, having baryonic masses up to ten times higher than\nexpected from their rotation speeds, or, alternatively, rotating at only half\nthe speed expected for their mass. Taking the data at face value, either these\nsystems have formed galaxies with extraordinary efficiency - highly unlikely\ngiven their shallow potential wells - or their dark matter content is much\nlower than expected from {\\Lambda}CDM haloes. This 'missing dark matter' is\nreminiscent of the inner mass deficit of galaxies with slowly-rising rotation\ncurves, but cannot be explained away by star formation-induced 'cores' in the\ndark mass profile, since the anomalous deficit applies to regions larger than\nthe luminous galaxies themselves.

Sometimes the system needs to be modeled as a random\nwalker in high dimensions (like in protein folding/unfolding) where dimensions\ncould be the distances between different amino acid residues (as in unfolding\nof HP-36).

We address\nthe question of whether a complex network of nonlinear oscillators can maintain\nits synchronization stability as it expands or grows. A network in the real\nworld can never be completely synchronized due to noise and/or external\ndisturbances. This is especially the case when, mathematically, the transient\nsynchronous state during the growth process becomes marginally stable, as a\nlocal perturbation can trigger a rapid deviation of the system from the\nvicinity of the synchronous state. In terms of the nodal dynamics, a large\nscale avalanche over the entire network can be triggered in the sense that the\nindividual nodal dynamics diverge from the synchronous state in a cascading\nmanner within a short time period. Because of the high dimensionality of the\nnetworked system, the transient process for the system to recover to the\nsynchronous state can be extremely long. Introducing a tolerance threshold to\nidentify the desynchronized nodes, we find that, after an initial stage of\nlinear growth, the network typically evolves into a critical state where the\naddition of a single new node can cause a group of nodes to lose\nsynchronization, leading to synchronization collapse for the entire network. A\nstatistical analysis indicates that, the distribution of the size of the\ncollapse is approximately algebraic (power law), regardless of the fluctuations\nin the system parameters. This is indication of the emergence of self-organized\ncriticality. We demonstrate the generality of the phenomenon of synchronization\ncollapse using a variety of complex network models, and uncover the underlying\ndynamical mechanism through an eigenvector analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2016 02:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-07"}

As the road networks under study become larger and more complex\n--- nowadays often including arterial networks --- the node model becomes more\nimportant. This paper focuses on the first order node model and has two main\ncontributions. First, we formalize the multi-commodity flow distribution at a\njunction as an optimization problem with all the necessary constraints. Most\ninteresting here is the formalization of input flow priorities. Then, we\ndiscuss a very common \"conservation of turning fractions\" or\n\"first-in-first-out\" (FIFO) constraint, and how it often produces unrealistic\nspillback. This spillback occurs when, at a diverge, a queue develops for a\nmovement that only a few lanes service, but FIFO requires that all lanes\nexperience spillback from this queue. As we show, avoiding this unrealistic\nspillback while retaining FIFO in the node model requires complicated network\ntopologies. Our second contribution is a \"partial FIFO\" mechanism that avoids\nthis unrealistic spillback, and a node model and solution algorithm that\nincorporates this mechanism. The partial FIFO mechanism is parameterized\nthrough intervals that describe how individual movements influence each other,\ncan be intuitively described from physical lane geometry and turning movement\nrules, and allows tuning to describe a link as having anything between full\nFIFO and no FIFO. Excepting the FIFO constraint, the present node model also\nfits within the well-established \"general class of first-order node models\" for\nmulti-commodity flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2016 02:33:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 18:10:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Sep 2017 00:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-22"}

To make LRMF capable of adapting more complex noise, this paper\nproposes a new LRMF model by assuming noise as Mixture of Exponential Power\n(MoEP) distributions and proposes a penalized MoEP (PMoEP) model by combining\nthe penalized likelihood method with MoEP distributions. Such setting\nfacilitates the learned LRMF model capable of automatically fitting the real\nnoise through MoEP distributions. Each component in this mixture is adapted\nfrom a series of preliminary super- or sub-Gaussian candidates.

Next, we introduces\nseveral features of SMN relevant to the design choice of the MAC protocols,\nincluding the SMN architecture and candidate communication technologies. After\nthat, we propose some performance evaluation metrics, such as scalability\nissue, traffic types, delay and etc, and give a survey of the associated\nresearch issues for the SMN MAC protocols design. In addition, we also note\nprogress within the new IEEE standardization task group (IEEE 802.11ah TG)\ncurrently working to create SMN standards, especially in the MAC protocols\naspect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2016 03:38:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-07"}

In the data-sharing strategy, the backhaul links connecting the\ncentral processor (CP) and the base-stations (BSs) are used to carry user\nmessages -- each user's messages are sent to multiple BSs; the BSs locally form\nthe beamforming vectors then cooperatively transmit the messages to the user.\nIn the compression strategy, the user messages are precoded centrally at the\nCP, which forwards a compressed version of the analog beamformed signals to the\nBSs for cooperative transmission. This paper compares the energy efficiencies\nof the two strategies by formulating an optimization problem of minimizing the\ntotal network power consumption subject to user target rate constraints, where\nthe total network power includes the BS transmission power, BS activation\npower, and load-dependent backhaul power. To tackle the discrete and nonconvex\nnature of the optimization problems, we utilize the techniques of reweighted\n$\\ell_1$ minimization and successive convex approximation to devise provably\nconvergent algorithms. Our main finding is that both the optimized data-sharing\nand compression strategies in C-RAN achieve much higher energy efficiency as\ncompared to the non-optimized coordinated multi-point transmission, but their\ncomparative effectiveness in energy saving depends on the user target rate. At\nlow user target rate, data-sharing consumes less total power than compression,\nhowever, as the user target rate increases, the backhaul power consumption for\ndata-sharing increases significantly leading to better energy efficiency of\ncompression at the high user rate regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2016 03:38:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2016 12:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-08"}

In\nthis paper, inter-tier interference suppression techniques are considered in\nthe contexts of collaborative processing and cooperative radio resource\nallocation (CRRA).

Impressively, the brightness drop is only about $15\\sim20\\%$.\nFurthermore, our device shows reliability over 1000 hours with only PET\n(polyethylene-terephthalate) films as the barrier, indicating that this\nauxiliary red-emission film can be easily applied to improve the color\nrendition of most commercial LED flat lamps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2016 06:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

In some\napplications, such as cognitive radio and device-to-device networks, this\ninteraction may result in the formation of holes in an otherwise homogeneous\ninterference field.

We improve the widely used friends-of-friends (FoF) group finding\nalgorithm with membership refinement procedures and apply the method to a\ncombined dataset of galaxies in the local Universe. A major aim of the\nrefinement is to detect subgroups within the FoF groups, enabling a more\nreliable suppression of the fingers-of-God effect.\n  Methods. The FoF algorithm is often suspected of leaving subsystems of groups\nand clusters undetected. We used a galaxy sample built of the 2MRS, CF2, and\n2M++ survey data comprising nearly 80000 galaxies within the local volume of\n430 Mpc radius to detect FoF groups. We conducted a multimodality check on the\ndetected groups in search for subgroups.

The analysis results in a catalogue of 6282 galaxy groups in the\n2MRS sample with two or more members, together with their mass estimates.

Then we\nexamine the p-value in detail, and discuss several important misconceptions\nabout what a p-value does and does not tell us. This leads to a discussion of\nType I, II error and power, and Type S and M error. An important conclusion\nfrom this discussion is that one should aim to carry out appropriately powered\nstudies. Next, we discuss two common issues we have encountered in\npsycholinguistics and linguistics: running experiments until significance is\nreached, and the \"garden-of-forking-paths\" problem discussed by Gelman and\nothers, whereby the researcher attempts to find statistical significance by\nanalyzing the data in different ways. The best way to use frequentist methods\nis to run appropriately powered studies, check model assumptions, clearly\nseparate exploratory data analysis from confirmatory hypothesis testing, and\nalways attempt to replicate results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2016 10:27:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2016 13:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

Models consistently project that the intensity of\nindividual precipitation events increases by approximately 6-7%/K, following\nthe increase in atmospheric water content, but that total precipitation\nincreases by a lesser amount (1-2 %/K in the global average in transient runs).\nSome other aspect of precipitation events must then change to compensate for\nthis difference. We develop here a new methodology for identifying individual\nrainstorms and studying their physical characteristics - including starting\nlocation, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and trajectory - that allows\nidentifying that compensating mechanism. We apply this technique to\nprecipitation over the contiguous U.S. from both radar-based data products and\nhigh-resolution model runs simulating 80 years of business-as-usual warming. In\nmodel studies, we find that the dominant compensating mechanism is a reduction\nof storm size. In summer, rainstorms become more intense but smaller, in\nwinter, rainstorm shrinkage still dominates, but storms also become less\nnumerous and shorter duration. These results imply that flood impacts from\nclimate change will be less severe than would be expected from changes in\nprecipitation intensity alone. We show also that projected changes are smaller\nthan model-observation biases, implying that the best means of incorporating\nthem into impact assessments is via \"data-driven simulations\" that apply\nmodel-projected changes to observational data. We therefore develop a\nsimulation algorithm that statistically describes model changes in\nprecipitation characteristics and adjusts data accordingly, and show that,\nespecially for summertime precipitation, it outperforms simulation approaches\nthat do not include spatial information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2016 11:35:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 03:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

A variety of model formulations for the latent\nlevel have been proposed but all come with inherent issues. In the classical\nBYM model, the spatially structured component cannot be seen independently from\nthe unstructured component. This makes prior definitions for the\nhyperparameters of the two random effects challenging. There are alternative\nmodel formulations that address this confounding, however, the issue on how to\nchoose interpretable hyperpriors is still unsolved. Here, we discuss a recently\nproposed parameterisation of the BYM model that leads to improved parameter\ncontrol as the hyperparameters can be seen independently from each other.\nFurthermore, the need for a scaled spatial component is addressed, which\nfacilitates assignment of interpretable hyperpriors and make these transferable\nbetween spatial applications with different graph structures. We provide\nimplementation details for the new model formulation which preserve sparsity\nproperties, and we investigate systematically the model performance and compare\nit to existing parameterisations. Through a simulation study, we show that the\nnew model performs well, both showing good learning abilities and good\nshrinkage behaviour. In terms of model choice criteria, the proposed model\nperforms at least equally well as existing parameterisations, but only the new\nformulation offers parameters that are interpretable and hyperpriors that have\na clear meaning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2016 14:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-07"}

Recent results provide physically\nmeaningful enhancements of these limiting statements, determining how well one\ncan attempt to reverse an irreversible process. In this paper, we apply and\nextend these results to give strong enhancements to several entropy\ninequalities, having to do with entropy gain, information gain, entropic\ndisturbance, and complete positivity of open quantum systems dynamics. Our\nfirst result is a remainder term for the entropy gain of a quantum channel.\nThis result implies that a small increase in entropy under the action of a\nsubunital channel is a witness to the fact that the channel's adjoint can be\nused as a recovery map to undo the action of the original channel. Our second\nresult regards the information gain of a quantum measurement, both without and\nwith quantum side information. We find here that a small information gain\nimplies that it is possible to undo the action of the original measurement if\nit is efficient. The result also has operational ramifications for the\ninformation-theoretic tasks known as measurement compression without and with\nquantum side information. Our third result shows that the loss of Holevo\ninformation caused by the action of a noisy channel on an input ensemble of\nquantum states is small if and only if the noise can be approximately corrected\non average.

The first category is concerned\nwith local and transient features of the entanglement between a macroscopic\nmeasuring system and a measured one. These properties result directly from the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. They cannot be formulated in terms of observables, do\nnot affect the wave functions themselves but express their history in an\nirreversible way. They carry a specific new kind of local probabilities, which\nevolve with a finite velocity under nonlinear wave equations. The second\ncategory of results extends these local properties to the case of a macroscopic\nsystem and its environment. Fluctuations in their interaction are predicted\nthen and generate a specific incoherence in the quantum state of the system.\nThese two kinds of effects act together when a macroscopic measuring system\ninteracts with a measured system and with an environment. Their combination\nyields then an explicit and effective mechanism of collapse, with a random\nbehavior resulting from random incoherence. Born's basic probability rule for\nthe results of measurements turns out then simply a consequence of quantum\ndynamics. Some conjectures still enter into the derivation of these effects,\nwhich one may recognize to look hardly credible at first sight.

The motor is composed\nby a rotor and two electronic reservoirs. Electronic islands on the rotor can\nexchange electrons with the reservoirs. An electrostatic field exerts a force\non the occupied islands. The charge dynamics and the electrostatic field drive\nrotations of the rotor. Coupling to an environment lead to damping on the\nrotational degree of freedom. We use two different approaches to the charge\ndynamics in the electronic islands: hopping process and mean-field. The hopping\nprocess approach takes into account charge fluctuations, which can appear along\nCoulomb blockade effects in nanoscale systems. The mean-field approach neglects\nthe charge fluctuations on the islands, which is typically suitable for larger\nsystems. We show that for a system described by the mean-field equations one\ncan in principle prepare initial conditions to obtain a desired rotational\ndirection. In contrast, this is not possible in the stochastic description.\nHowever, for both cases one can achieve rotational directionality by changing\nthe geometry of the rotor. By scanning the space formed by the relevant\ngeometric parameters we find optimal geometries, while fixing the dissipation\nand driving parameters. Remarkably, in the hopping process approach perfect\nrotational directionality is possible for a large range of geometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 19:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
