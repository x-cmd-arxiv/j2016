In this work, we show that such\nstructure is helicity independent and emerges from analytic properties of\nmatrix elements of Wilson line operators, where the slope of the straight gauge\npath is shifted in a certain complex direction. This is similar to the\nprocedure leading to the Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten (BCFW) recursion, however\nwe apply a complex shift to the Wilson line slope instead of the external\nmomenta. While in the original BCFW procedure the boundary integrals over the\ncomplex shift vanish for certain deformations, here they are non-zero and are\nequal to the off-shell amplitudes. The main result can thus be summarized as\nfollows: we derive a decomposition of a helicity-fixed off-shell current into\ngauge invariant component given by a matrix element of a straight Wilson line\nplus a reminder given by a sum of products of gauge invariant and gauge\ndependent quantities. We give several examples realizing this relation,\nincluding the five-point next-to-MHV helicity configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 16:48:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 19:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

The process of memory recall has been studied using\nauto-associative networks such as the Hopfield model. This kind of model\nreliably converges to stored patterns which contain the memory. However, it is\nunclear how the behavior is controlled by the brain so that after convergence\nto one configuration, it can proceed with recognition of another one. In the\nHopfield model this happens only through unrealistic changes of an effective\nglobal temperature that destabilizes all stored configurations. Here we show\nthat spike frequency adaptation (SFA), a common mechanism affecting neuron\nactivation in the brain, can provide state dependent control of pattern\nretrieval. We demonstrate this in a Hopfield network modified to include SFA,\nand also in a model network of biophysical neurons. In both cases SFA allows\nfor selective stabilization of attractors with different basins of attraction,\nand also for temporal dynamics of attractor switching that is not possible in\nstandard auto-associative schemes. The dynamics of our models give a plausible\naccount of different sorts of memory retrieval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 17:40:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 17:10:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-18"}

We average\nnightside spectra from 2006 over latitude circles and model the spectral limb\ndarkening using the NEMESIS radiative transfer and retrieval tool. We present\nour best-fit deep cloud model for latitudes between -40 and 50 degrees, along\nwith retrieved abundances for NH3, PH3 and AsH3. We find an increase in NH3\nabundance at the equator, a cloud base at ~2.3 bar and no evidence for cloud\nparticles with strong absorption features in the 4.6-5.2 micron wavelength\nrange, all of which are consistent with previous work. Non-scattering cloud\nmodels assuming a composition of either NH3 or NH4SH, with a scattering haze\noverlying, fit limb darkening curves and spectra at all latitudes well; the\nretrieved optical depth for the tropospheric haze is decreased in the northern\n(winter) hemisphere, implying that the haze has a photochemical origin.

Although they\nhave not yielded any detections, they have been successful in establishing\nupper limits on the flux of these particles. I present a review of these\nexperiments in which I re-evaluate their sensitivity to radio pulses,\naccounting for effects which were neglected in the original reports, and\ncompare them with prospective near-future experiments. In several cases, I find\nthat past experiments were substantially less sensitive than previously\nbelieved. I apply existing analytic models to determine the resulting limits on\nthe fluxes of ultra-high-energy neutrinos and cosmic rays. In the latter case,\nI amend the model to accurately reflect the fraction of the primary particle\nenergy which manifests in the resulting particle cascade, resulting in a\nsubstantial improvement in the estimated sensitivity to cosmic rays. Although\nthese models are in need of further refinement, in particular to incorporate\nthe effects of small-scale lunar surface roughness, their application here\nindicates that a proposed experiment with the LOFAR telescope would test\npredictions of the neutrino flux from exotic-physics models, and an experiment\nwith a phased-array feed on a large single-dish telescope such as the Parkes\nradio telescope would allow the first detection of cosmic rays with this\ntechnique, with an expected rate of one detection per 140 hours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 17:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-13"}

Towards this goal, we first note the structure of\nthe optimal beamformer with per-antenna gain and phase control and the\nstructure of good beamformers with per-antenna phase-only control. Learning\nthese beamforming structures in mmW systems is fraught with considerable\ncomplexities such as the need for a non-broadcast system design, the\nsensitivity of the beamformer approximants to small path length changes, etc.\nTo overcome these issues, we establish a physical interpretation between these\nbeamformer structures and the angles of departure/arrival of the dominant\npath(s). This physical interpretation provides a theoretical underpinning to\nthe emerging interest on directional beamforming approaches that are less\nsensitive to small path length changes. While classical approaches for\ndirection learning such as MUSIC have been well-understood, they suffer from\nmany practical difficulties in a mmW context such as a non-broadcast system\ndesign and high computational complexity. A simpler broadcast solution for mmW\nsystems is the adaptation of directional codebooks for beamforming at the two\nends. We establish fundamental limits for the best beam broadening codebooks\nand propose a construction motivated by a virtual subarray architecture that is\nwithin a couple of dB of the best tradeoff curve at all useful beam broadening\nfactors.

A precise control over the He+ and Ga+\nirradiation offered by focused ion beam techniques enables to investigate the\ninteraction of the energetic particles and graphene suspended with no support\nand allows determining sputter yields of the 2D lattice. We find strong\ndependency of the 2D sputter yield on the species and kinetic energy of the\nincident ion beams. Freestanding graphene shows material semi-transparency to\nHe+ at high energies (10-30 keV) allowing the passage of >97% He+ particles\nwithout creating destructive lattice vacancy. Large Ga+ ions (5-30 keV), in\ncontrast, collide far more often with the graphene lattice to impart\nsignificantly higher sputter yield of ~50%. Binary collision theory applied to\nmonolayer and few-layer graphene can successfully elucidate this collision\nmechanism, in great agreement with experiments. Raman spectroscopy analysis\ncorroborates the passage of a large fraction of He+ ions across graphene\nwithout much damaging the lattice whereas several colliding ions create single\nvacancy defects. Physical understanding of the interaction between energetic\nparticles and suspended graphene can practically lead to reproducible and\nefficient pattern generation of unprecedentedly small features on 2D materials\nby design, manifested by our perforation of sub-5-nm pore arrays. This\ncapability of nanometer scale precision patterning of freestanding 2D lattices\nshows practical applicability of the focused ion beam technology to 2D material\nprocessing for device fabrication and integration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 19:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

During mitigation a change of the spatial structure of\nELM loads on divertor was observed on DIII-D and MAST: the power is deposited\npredominantly in the footprint structures formed by the magnetic perturbation.\nIn the present contribution we develop a theory explaining this effect, based\non the idea that part of the ELM loss is caused by parallel transport in the\nhomoclinic tangle formed by the magnetic perturbation of the ELM. The modified\ntangle resulting from the combination of the ELM perturbation and the applied\nRMP has the expected property of bringing open field lines in the same areas as\nthe tangle from the RMP alone. We show that this explanation is consistent with\nfeatures of the mitigated ELMs on MAST.\n  We in addition validated our theory by an analysis of simulations of\nmitigated ELMs using the code JOREK.

We derive\nanalytical expressions for the direct (irreversible) heating, angular momentum\ntransport, and mass accretion rate induced by the disk shocks of arbitrary\nstrength. We find these processes to be very sensitive to the shock amplitude.\nFocusing on the waves of moderate strength (density jump at the shock\n$\\Delta\\Sigma/\\Sigma\\sim 1$) we show the associated disk heating to be\nnegligible (contributing at $\\sim 1\\%$ level to the energy budget) in passive,\nirradiated protoplanetary disks on $\\sim 100$ AU scales, but becoming important\nwithin several AU from the star.

This circumstance requires clinical\nintervention and becomes challenging when verbal communication is difficult. In\nthis work, we propose a brain computer interface (BCI) to automatically and\nnon-invasively detect patient-ventilator disharmony from\nelectroencephalographic (EEG) signals: a brain-ventilator interface (BVI). Our\nframework exploits the cortical activation provoked by the inspiratory\ncompensation when the subject and the ventilator are desynchronized. Use of a\none-class approach and Riemannian geometry of EEG covariance matrices allows\neffective classification of respiratory states. The BVI is validated on nine\nhealthy subjects that performed different respiratory tasks that mimic a\npatient-ventilator disharmony. Classification performances, in terms of areas\nunder ROC curves, are significantly improved using EEG signals compared to\ndetection based on air flow. Reduction in the number of electrodes that can\nachieve discrimination can often be desirable (e.g. for portable BCI systems).\nBy using an iterative channel selection technique, the Common Highest Order\nRanking (CHOrRa), we find that a reduced set of electrodes (n=6) can slightly\nimprove for an intra-subject configuration, and it still provides fairly good\nperformances for a general inter-subject setting. Results support the\ndiscriminant capacity of our approach to identify anomalous respiratory states,\nby learning from a training set containing only normal respiratory epochs. The\nproposed framework opens the door to brain-ventilator interfaces for monitoring\npatient's breathing comfort and adapting ventilator parameters to patient\nrespiratory needs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 20:32:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 14:09:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

In addition to simulating quantum systems, SQA has also been\nproposed as another physics-inspired classical algorithm for combinatorial\noptimization, alongside classical simulated annealing. However, in many cases\nit remains an open challenge to determine the performance of both QA and SQA.\nOne piece of evidence for the strength of QA over classical simulated annealing\ncomes from an example by Farhi, Goldstone and Gutmann . There a bit-symmetric\ncost function with a thin, high energy barrier was designed to show an\nexponential seperation between classical simulated annealing, for which thermal\nfluctuations take exponential time to climb the barrier, and quantum annealing\nwhich passes through the barrier and reaches the global minimum in poly time,\narguably by taking advantage of quantum tunneling. In this work we apply a\ncomparison method to rigorously show that the Markov chain underlying SQA\nefficiently samples the target distribution and finds the global minimum of\nthis spike cost function in polynomial time. Our work provides evidence for the\ngrowing consensus that SQA inherits at least some of the advantages of\ntunneling in QA, and so QA is unlikely to achieve exponential speedups over\nclassical computing solely by the use of quantum tunneling. Since we analyze\nonly a particular model this evidence is not decisive. However, techniques\napplied here---including warm starts from the adiabatic path and the use of the\nquantum ground state probability distribution to understand the stationary\ndistribution of SQA---may be valuable for future studies of the performance of\nSQA on cost functions for which QA is efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 20:48:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2016 18:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-05"}

We show here the first evidence that the\nMilky Way experienced a generalised quenching of its star formation at the end\nof its thick disk formation $\\sim$9 Gyr ago. Elemental abundances of stars\nstudied as part of the APOGEE survey reveal indeed that in less than $\\sim$2\nGyr the star formation rate in our Galaxy dropped by an order-of-magnitude.\nBecause of the tight correlation between age and alpha abundance, this event\nreflects in the dearth of stars along the inner disk sequence in the\n[Fe/H]-[$\\alpha$/Fe] plane. Before this phase, which lasted about 1.5 Gyr, the\nMilky Way was actively forming stars. Afterwards, the star formation resumed at\na much lower level to form the thin disk. These events are very well matched by\nthe latest observation of MW-type progenitors at high redshifts. In late type\ngalaxies, quenching is believed to be related to a long and secular exhaustion\nof gas. In our Galaxy, it occurred on a much shorter time scale, while the\nchemical continuity before and after the quenching indicates that it was not\ndue to the exhaustion of the gas. While quenching is generally associated with\nspheroids, our results show that it also occurs in galaxies like the Milky Way,\npossibly when they are undergoing a morphological transition from thick to thin\ndisks. Given the demographics of late type galaxies in the local universe, in\nwhich classical bulges are rare, we suggest further that this may hold true\ngenerally in galaxies with mass lower than or approximately $M^*$, where\nquenching could be directly a consequence of thick disk formation. We emphasize\nthat the quenching phase in the Milky Way could be contemporaneous with, and\nrelated to, the formation of the bar.

We collect star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) with accurate spectroscopic redshifts, for which Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) coverage and multi-wavelength photometry are available. Method:\nWe selected a sample of about 200 sources at z~3. Taking advantage of HST\nresolution, we applied a careful cleaning procedure and rejected sources\nshowing nearby clumps with different colours, which could be lower-z\ninterlopers. Our clean sample consisted of 86 SFGs (including 19 narrow-band\nselected Lya emitters) and 8 AGN (including 6 detected in X-rays). We measured\nthe LyC flux from aperture photometry in four narrow-band filters covering\nwavelengths below a 912 A rest frame (3.11<z<3.53). We estimated the ratio\nbetween ionizing (LyC flux) and 1400 A non-ionizing emissions for AGN and\ngalaxies. Results: By running population synthesis models, we assume an average\nintrinsic L(1400 A)/L(900 A) ratio of 5 as the representative value for our\nsample. With this value and an average treatment of the lines of sight of the\ninter-galactic medium, we estimate the LyC escape fraction relative to the\nintrinsic value (fesc_rel(LyC)). We do not directly detect ionizing radiation\nfrom any individual SFG, but we are able to set a 1(2)sigma upper limit of\nfesc_rel(LyC)<12(24)%.

The observations\nare from the APOGEE survey. The chemical abundances were derived automatically\nby the ASPCAP pipeline and these are part of the SDSS III Data Release 12. The\ngradients, obtained from least squares fits to the data, are relatively flat,\nwith slopes ranging from -0.026 to -0.033 dex/kpc for the alpha-elements [O/H],\n[Ca/H], [Si/H] and [Mg/H] and -0.035 dex/kpc and -0.040 dex/kpc for [Fe/H] and\n[Ni/H], respectively. Our results are not at odds with the possibility that\nmetallicity ([Fe/H]) gradients are steeper in the inner disk (R_GC ~7 - 12 kpc)\nand flatter towards the outer disk. The open cluster sample studied spans a\nsignificant range in age. When breaking the sample into age bins, there is some\nindication that the younger open cluster population in our sample (log age <\n8.7) has a flatter metallicity gradient when compared with the gradients\nobtained from older open clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 23:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

The method has the potential in\napplications demanding for very stable slow extraction from synchrotrons. Our\nstudies show that the slow extraction at the half-integer resonance by using\nanti-symmetric sextupole field has some advantages compared to the normal\nsextupole field, and the latter is widely used in the slow extraction method.\nOne of them is that it can work at a more distant tune from the resonance, so\nthat it can reduce significantly the intensity variation of the extracted beam\nwhich is mainly caused by the ripples of magnet power supplies. The studies by\nboth the Hamiltonian theory and numerical simulations show that the stable\nregion at the proximity of the half-integer resonance by anti-symmetric\nsextupole field is much smaller and flatter than the one by standard sextupole\nfield at the third-order resonance. By gradually increasing the field strength,\nthe beam can be extracted with intensity more homogeneous than by the usual\nthird-order resonant method, in the means of both smaller intensity variation\nand spike in the beginning spill. Similar to the case with a normal sextupole,\nwe derive an empirical formula for the area of the stable region with an\nanti-symmetric sextupole. One can find that with the same field strength and\nthe same tune distance to the resonance, the area of stable region or the\nchange of the area due to the working point variation in the case of\nanti-symmetric sextupole is about 1/14 of the one in the case of standard\nsextupole.

To model the empirical noise of an image, our method introduces the\nmixture of Gaussian distribution, which is flexible enough to approximate\ndifferent continuous distributions. The problem of blind image denoising is\nreformulated as a learning problem. The procedure is to first build a two-layer\nstructural model for noisy patches and consider the clean ones as latent\nvariable. To control the complexity of the noisy patch model, this work\nproposes a novel Bayesian nonparametric prior called \"Dependent Dirichlet\nProcess Tree\" to build the model.

Solving the well-known longitudinal\nWard-Green-Takahashi identities (WGTIs) and the less-known transverse\ncounterparts together, one obtains a nontrivial solution which can shed light\non the structure of the quark-gluon vertex. It is highlighted that the\nphenomenologically proposed anomalous chromomagnetic moment (ACM) vertex\noriginates from the QCD Lagrangian symmetries and its strength is proportional\nto the magnitude of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB). The\ncolor-singlet vector and axial-vector WGTIs can relate the BS kernel and the\ndressed quark-gluon vertex to each other. Using the relation, one can truncate\nthe gap equation and the BS equation, systematically, without violating crucial\nsymmetries, e.g., gauge symmetry and chiral symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 06:17:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

FDPS\nis an application-development framework which helps the researchers to develop\nparticle-based simulation programs for large-scale distributed-memory parallel\nsupercomputers. A particle-based simulation program for distributed-memory\nparallel computers needs to perform domain decomposition, redistribution of\nparticles, and gathering of particle information for interaction calculation.\nAlso, even if distributed-memory parallel computers are not used, in order to\nreduce the amount of computation, algorithms such as Barnes-Hut tree method\nshould be used for long-range interactions. For short-range interactions, some\nmethods to limit the calculation to neighbor particles are necessary. FDPS\nprovides all of these necessary functions for efficient parallel execution of\nparticle-based simulations as \"templates\", which are independent of the actual\ndata structure of particles and the functional form of the interaction. By\nusing FDPS, researchers can write their programs with the amount of work\nnecessary to write a simple, sequential and unoptimized program of O(N^2)\ncalculation cost, and yet the program, once compiled with FDPS, will run\nefficiently on large-scale parallel supercomputers. A simple gravitational\nN-body program can be written in around 120 lines. We report the actual\nperformance of these programs and the performance model. The weak scaling\nperformance is very good, and almost linear speedup was obtained for up to the\nfull system of K computer. The minimum calculation time per timestep is in the\nrange of 30 ms (N=10^7) to 300 ms (N=10^9).

In some jets there may\nbe interactions between the two kinds of shocks.

The ability to identify blue text in foveal and parafoveal vision was\nidentified as potentially constrained by the low number of foveally centered\nblue light sensitive retinal cells. The present study investigates if foveal\nand parafoveal perceptibility of hypertext is reduced during reading. A\nsilent-sentence reading study with simultaneous eye movement recordings and the\ninvisible boundary paradigm, which allows the investigation of foveal and\nparafoveal perceptibility, separately, was realized. Target words in sentences\nwere presented in either black or blue and either underlined or normal. No\neffect of color and underlining, but a preview benefit could be detected for\nfirst pass reading measures (comparing fixation times after degraded vs. un-\ndegraded parafoveal previews). Fixation time measures that included re-reading\n(i.e., total viewing times) showed, in addition to a preview effect, a reduced\nfixation time for not highlighted (black not underlined) in contrast to\nhighlighted target words (either blue or underlined or both). Thus, the present\npattern reflects no detectable perceptual disadvantage of hyperlink stimuli but\nincreased attraction of attention resources, after first pass reading, through\nhighlighting. Blue or underlined text allows readers to easily perceive\nhypertext and at the same time readers re-visited hypertext longer as a\nconsequence of highlighting. On the basis of the present evidence blue\nhypertext can be safely recommended to web designers for future use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 10:27:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-14"}

While the survey is still ongoing, and is matter\nof a forthcoming publication, a new luminous water maser has been detected in\nthe lenticular (field) S0 galaxy IRAS15480-0344, whose origin, associated with\nan accretion disc or a nuclear outflow/jet, needs to be assessed. Multi-epoch\nsingle-dish observations and VLBI measurements were performed to investigate\nthe distribution, spatial extension, and variability of the maser emission in\norder to infer the main characteristics of the water megamaser. The new\ndetection in IRAS15480-0344 is reported: a megamaser with a total single-dish\nisotropic luminosity of ~200 Lsun and a profile composed of two main features,\na broad line with a full width to half maximum (FWHM) linewidth of ~90 km/s and\na narrow (FWHM<1 km/s) one. We performed a follow-up to the detection with the\nVery Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and confidently detected only the narrow\ncomponent, which is coincident with the nuclear radio continuum emission\ndetected with the Very Large Array at 8.4 GHz. A weak narrow feature has also\nbeen detected in the velocity range of the broad feature and is located 15 pc\nto the north-west with respect to the stronger component. Neither maser spot is\nassociated with the compact radio continuum sources derived from the same VLBA\ndataset.

We provide\nstatistical evidence suggesting that this is not the case, as the proportion of\ndependency crossings of sentences from a wide range of languages can be\naccurately estimated by a simple predictor based on a null hypothesis on the\nlocal probability that two dependencies cross given their lengths. The relative\nerror of this predictor never exceeds 5% on average, whereas the error of a\nbaseline predictor assuming a random ordering of the words of a sentence is at\nleast 6 times greater. Our results suggest that the low frequency of crossings\nin natural languages is neither originated by hidden knowledge of language nor\nby the undesirability of crossings per se, but as a mere side effect of the\nprinciple of dependency length minimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 11:48:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 14:49:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 16:09:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

Previously, low\nthreshold Risken-Nummedal-Graham-Haken (RNGH) instabilities were reported in\nseveral experimental studies of QCLs. They were attributed so far to the\ncombined effect of the induced grating of carrier population and of a built-in\nsaturable absorption feature that may be present in the monolithic\nsingle-section cavity of these Fabry-P\\'erot lasers. Here we show that\nlow-threshold RNGH instabilities in QCLs occur due to a carrier coherence\ngrating induced in the gain medium and not due to intracavity saturable\nabsorption. We find that QCLs with a few mm long cavity exhibit intermittent\nRNGH self-pulsations while regular self-pulsations are possible in short-cavity\nQCLs, with the cavity length of 100 um or smaller. We examine a transient\nbehavior to RNGH self-pulsations in short-cavity QCLs and find features that\nresemble cooperative superradiance. Our findings open a practical way of\nachieving ultra-short pulse production regimes in the mid-infrared spectral\nrange. Applying same approach to semiconductor laser diodes (LDs) we explain\nthe absence of RNGH self-pulsation in LDs based on a quantum well gain media,\nwhile practically established method for reaching the ultrafast coherent\nemission regimes in LDs is to incorporate a separately contacted saturable\nabsorber section in the LD cavity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 12:03:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 12:44:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-08"}

This emission depends on the activity level of the\nstar, which is primarily determined by its age. We focus upon EGPs orbiting K-\nand M-dwarf stars of different ages. XUV spectra for these stars are\nconstructed using a coronal model. These spectra are used to drive both a\nthermospheric model and an ionospheric model, providing densities of neutral\nand ion species. Ionisation is included through photo-ionisation and\nelectron-impact processes. We find that EGP ionospheres at all orbital\ndistances considered and around all stars selected are dominated by the\nlong-lived H$^+$ ion. In addition, planets with upper atmospheres where H$_2$\nis not substantially dissociated have a layer in which H$_3^+$ is the major ion\nat the base of the ionosphere. For fast-rotating planets, densities of\nshort-lived H$_3^+$ undergo significant diurnal variations, with the maximum\nvalue being driven by the stellar X-ray flux. In contrast, densities of\nlonger-lived H$^+$ show very little day/night variability and the magnitude is\ndriven by the level of stellar EUV flux. The H$_3^+$ peak in EGPs with upper\natmospheres where H$_2$ is dissociated under strong stellar illumination is\npushed to altitudes below the homopause, where this ion is likely to be\ndestroyed through reactions with heavy species. The inclusion of secondary\nionisation processes produces significantly enhanced ion and electron densities\nat altitudes below the main EUV ionisation peak, as compared to models that do\nnot include electron-impact ionisation. We estimate infrared emissions from\nH$_3^+$, and while, in an H/H$_2$/He atmosphere, these are larger from planets\norbiting close to more active stars, they still appear too low to be detected\nwith current observatories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 12:35:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2016 11:36:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

Existing solutions for the problem mostly adopt a\nhierarchical decomposition approach, which recursively splits Omega into\nsub-domains and computes a noisy tuple count for each sub-domain, until all\nnoisy counts are below a certain threshold. This approach, however, requires\nthat we (i) impose a limit h on the recursion depth in the splitting of Omega\nand (ii) set the noise in each count to be proportional to h. This leads to\ninferior data utility due to the following dilemma: if we use a small h, then\nthe resulting histogram would be too coarse-grained to provide an accurate\napproximation of data distribution; meanwhile, a large h would yield a\nfine-grained histogram, but its quality would be severely degraded by the\nincreased amount of noise in the tuple counts.\n  To remedy the deficiency of existing solutions, we present PrivTree, a\nhistogram construction algorithm that also applies hierarchical decomposition\nbut features a crucial (and somewhat surprising) improvement: when deciding\nwhether or not to split a sub-domain, the amount of noise required in the\ncorresponding tuple count is independent of the recursive depth. This enables\nPrivTree to adaptively generate high-quality histograms without even asking for\na pre-defined threshold on the depth of sub-domain splitting. As concrete\nexamples, we demonstrate an application of PrivTree in modelling spatial data,\nand show that it can also be extended to handle sequence data (where the\ndecision in sub-domain splitting is not based on tuple counts but a more\nsophisticated measure). Our experiments on a variety of real datasets show that\nPrivTree significantly outperforms the states of the art in terms of data\nutility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 13:17:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2016 02:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-18"}

This equation was originally introduced to model phase separation in\nbinary alloys, where phase stands for concentration of different components in\nalloy. When the binary alloy under preparation is subjected to a rapid\nreduction in temperature below a critical temperature, it has been\nexperimentally observed that the concentration changes from a mixed state to a\nvisibly distinct spatially separated two phase for binary alloy. This rapid\nreduction in the temperature, the so-called \"deep quench limit\", is modeled\neffectively by obstacle potential. The discretization of Cahn-Hilliard equation\nwith obstacle potential leads to a block $2 \\times 2$ {\\em non-linear} system,\nwhere the $(1,1)$ block has a non-linear and non-smooth term.

The former governs the average fluid\nvelocity $\\mathbf{u}$, while the latter rules evolution of $\\varphi$, the\ndifference of the (relative) concentrations of the two phases. The two\nequations are known as the Cahn-Hilliard-Brinkman (CHB) system. In particular,\nthe Brinkman equation is a Stokes-like equation with a forcing term (Korteweg\nforce) which is proportional to $\\mu\\nabla\\varphi$, where $\\mu$ is the chemical\npotential. When the viscosity vanishes, then the system becomes the\nCahn-Hilliard-Hele-Shaw (CHHS) system. Both systems have been studied from the\ntheoretical and the numerical viewpoints. However, theoretical results on the\nCHHS system are still rather incomplete. For instance, uniqueness of weak\nsolutions is unknown even in 2D. Here we replace the usual CH equation with its\nphysically more relevant nonlocal version. This choice allows us to prove more\nabout the corresponding nonlocal CHHS system. More precisely, we first study\nwell-posedness for the CHB system, endowed with no-slip and no-flux boundary\nconditions. Then, existence of a weak solution to the CHHS system is obtained\nas a limit of solutions to the CHB system. Stronger assumptions on the initial\ndatum allow us to prove uniqueness for the CHHS system. Further regularity\nproperties are obtained by assuming additional, though reasonable, assumptions\non the interaction kernel. By exploiting these properties, we provide an\nestimate for the difference between the solution to the CHB system and the one\nto the CHHS system with respect to viscosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2016 14:54:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-14"}
