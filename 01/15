A fundamental open question concerns the\n\"robustness\" of these states when the system is not isolated. In this paper we\nexplore, using both analytical and numerical approaches to a paradigmatic one\ndimensional model, the effect of a simple class of perturbations. We call them\n\"internal local perturbations\" in that the particle energies are perturbed at\ncollisions in a way which depends only on the local properties. Our central\nfinding is that the effect of the perturbations is to drive all the very\ndifferent QSS we consider towards a unique QSS. The latter is thus independent\nof the initial conditions of the system, but determined instead by both the\nlong-range forces and the details of the perturbations applied. Thus in the\npresence of such a perturbation the long-range system evolves to a unique\nnon-equilibrium stationary state, completely different to its state in absence\nof the perturbation, and it remains in this state when the perturbation is\nremoved. We argue that this result may be generic for long-range interacting\nsystems subject to perturbations which are dependent on the local properties\n(e.g. spatial density or velocity distribution) of the system itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2016 16:13:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

However, in practice,\nfunctional gradient algorithms typically commit to a fixed, finite\nparameterization of trajectories, often as a list of waypoints. Such a\nparameterization can lose much of the benefit of reasoning in a continuous\ntrajectory space: e.g., it can require taking an inconveniently small step size\nand large number of iterations to maintain smoothness. Our work generalizes\nfunctional gradient trajectory optimization by formulating it as minimization\nof a cost functional in an RKHS. This generalization lets us represent\ntrajectories as linear combinations of kernel functions, without any need for\nwaypoints. As a result, we are able to take larger steps and achieve a locally\noptimal trajectory in just a few iterations. Depending on the selection of\nkernel, we can directly optimize in spaces of trajectories that are inherently\nsmooth in velocity, jerk, curvature, etc., and that have a low-dimensional,\nadaptively chosen parameterization.

SS is established by showing that the mutual information\nbetween the message and the eavesdropper's observations is negligible even when\nmaximized over all message distributions, choices of state sequences and\nrealizations of the CR-code. Both the achievability and the converse proofs of\nthe type constrained coding theorem rely on stronger claims than actually\nrequired. The direct part establishes a novel single-letter lower bound on the\nCR-assisted SS-capacity of an AVWTC with state sequences constrained by any\nconvex and closed set of state probability mass functions. This bound achieves\nthe best known single-letter secrecy rates for a corresponding compound wiretap\nchannel over the same constraint set. In contrast to other single-letter\nresults in the AVWTC literature, this work does not assume the existence of a\nbest channel to the eavesdropper.

Optimality is a consequence of an max-inf upper bound on\nthe CR-assisted SS-capacity of an AVWTC with state sequences constrained to any\ncollection of type-classes. When adjusted to the aforementioned compound WTC,\nthe upper bound simplifies to a max-min structure, thus strengthening the\npreviously best known single-letter upper bound by Liang et al. that has a\nmin-max form.

Ablation may be performed from afar by illuminating an\nEarth-targeting asteroid or comet with a stand-off \"DE- STAR\" system consisting\nof a large phased-array laser in Earth orbit. Alternatively, a much smaller\nstand-on \"DE-STARLITE\" system may travel alongside the target, slowly\ndeflecting it from nearby over a long period. This paper presents orbital\nsimulations comparing the effectiveness of both systems across a range of laser\nand NEO parameters. Simulated parameters include magnitude, duration and, for\nthe stand-on system, direction of the thrust, as well as the type, size and\norbital characteristics of the target NEO. These simulations indicate that\ndeflection distance is approximately proportional to the magnitude of thrust\nand to the square of the duration of ablation, and is inversely proportional to\nthe mass. Furthermore, deflection distance shows strong dependence on thrust\ndirection with the optimal direction of thrust varying with the duration of\nlaser activity. As one example, consider a typical 325 m asteroid: beginning 15\nyr in advance, just 2 N of thrust from a ~20 kW stand-on DE-STARLITE system is\nsufficient to deflect the asteroid by 2 R_e. Numerous scenarios are discussed\nas is a practical implementation of such a system consistent with current\nlaunch vehicle capabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2016 18:40:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-15"}

This problem, however, is ill-posed\nsince both the parameters associated with the complex exponentials and the\nmodulating waveforms are unknown.

Evolutionary scenarios towards mergers of double compact\nobjects generally invoke common-envelope evolution which is poorly understood,\nleading to large uncertainties in merger rates. We explore the alternative\nscenario of massive overcontact binary (MOB) evolution, which involves two very\nmassive stars in a very tight binary which remain fully mixed due to their\ntidally induced high spin. We use the public stellar-evolution code MESA to\nsystematically study this channel by means of detailed simulations. We find\nthat, at low metallicity, MOBs produce double-black-hole (BH+BH) systems that\nwill merge within a Hubble time with mass ratios close to one, in two mass\nranges, ~25...60msun and >~ 130msun, with pair instability supernovae (PISNe)\nbeing produced in-between. Our models are also able to reproduce counterparts\nof various stages in the MOB scenario in the local Universe, providing direct\nsupport for it. We map the initial parameter space that produces BH+BH mergers,\ndetermine the expected chirp mass distribution, merger times, Kerr parameters\nand predict event rates. We typically find that for Z~<Z_sun/10, there is one\nBH+BH merger for ~1000 core-collapse supernovae. The advanced LIGO (aLIGO)\ndetection rate is more uncertain and depends on the metallicity evolution.\nDeriving upper and lower limits from a local and a global approximation for the\nmetallicity distribution of massive stars, we estimate aLIGO detection rates\n(at design limit) of ~19-550 yr^(-1) for BH+BH mergers below the PISN gap and\nof ~2.1-370 yr^(-1) above the PISN gap. Even with conservative assumptions, we\nfind that aLIGO should soon detect BH+BH mergers from the MOB scenario and that\nthese could be the dominant source for aLIGO detections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2016 20:24:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 15:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

Many of the\nresults appeared previously and are being collected and described here as\nillustrations of the general method; however, some details (particularly in the\nWigner and Wishart cases) are new.\n  Our approach makes use of techniques from probability in Banach spaces, in\nparticular concentration of measure and bounds for suprema of stochastic\nprocesses, in combination with more classical tools from matrix analysis,\napproximation theory, and Fourier analysis. It is highly flexible, as evidenced\nby the broad list of examples. It is moreover based largely on \"soft\" methods,\nand involves little hard analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2016 20:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-05"}

This is\ndue to the fact that the pulse evolution time scale is Doppler contracted,\nwhile the pulse separation is not. For off-axis viewing angles $\\theta_{\\rm\nview} \\gtrsim \\theta_{\\rm jet} + \\Gamma^{-1}$, the pulse broadening\nsignificantly smears out the light curve variability. This is largely\nindependent of geometry and emission processes. To explore a specific case, we\nset up a simple model of a single pulse under the assumption that the pulse\nrise and decay are dominated by the shell curvature effect. We show that such a\npulse observed off-axis is (i) broader, (ii) softer and (iii) displays a\ndifferent hardness-intensity correlation with respect to the same pulse seen\non-axis. For each of these effects, we provide an intuitive physical\nexplanation. We then show how a synthetic light curve made by a superposition\nof pulses changes with increasing viewing angle.

More specifically,\nunder assumptions necessary to apply a small $R = \\mathbb{T}$ theorem and an\nassumption on the local mod $p$ representation, we prove that every irreducible\ncomponent of the universal polarized deformation space contains an automorphic\npoint. When combined with work of Chenevier, this implies new results on the\nZariski density of automorphic points in polarized deformation space in\ndimension three.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2016 21:12:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 13:44:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 28 Jan 2018 04:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-30"}

The parameter used in earlier versions of this model, referred to as\nthe reflection strength, is unsatisfactory, and it has been superseded by a\nparameter that provides insight into the accretion geometry, namely the\nreflection fraction. The reflection fraction is defined as the ratio of the\ncoronal intensity illuminating the disk to the coronal intensity that reaches\nthe observer. The relxill model combines a general relativistic ray-tracing\ncode and a photoionization code to compute the component of radiation reflected\nfrom an accretion that is illuminated by an internal source. The reflection\nfraction is a particularly important parameter for relativistic models with\nwell-defined geometry, such as the lamppost model, which is a focus of this\npaper. Relativistic spectra are compared for three inclinations and for four\nvalues of the key parameter of the lamppost model, namely the height above the\nblack hole of the illuminating, on-axis point source. In all cases, the\nstrongest reflection is produced for low source heights and high spin. A\nlow-spin black hole is shown to be incapable of producing enhanced relativistic\nreflection. Results for the relxill model are compared to those obtained with\nother models and a Monte Carlo simulation. Fitting data using the relxill model\nand the recently implemented parameter the reflection fraction, one can\nconstrain the geometry of a system, under the assumption of a lamppost-like\naccretion geometry. The reflection fraction is independent of such system\nparameters as inclination and black hole spin. The reflection fraction\nparameter was implemented with the name refl_frac in all flavors of the relxill\nmodel, and the nonrelativistic reflection model xillver, in v0.4a (18 January\n2016).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2016 22:19:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2016 06:29:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 06:42:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 11:53:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-18"}

It is known that on large length scales,\n$\\lambda \\gtrsim 1/(\\alpha \\mu_5)$, the chiral anomaly opens an instability\ntoward the erasure of chiral charge and growth of magnetic helicity. Here the\nchemical potential $\\mu_{5}$ parametrizes the chiral asymmetry and $\\alpha$ is\nthe fine-structure constant. We study the process of chiral charge erasure\nthrough the thermal fluctuations of magnetic helicity and contrast with the\nwell-studied phenomenon of Chern-Simons number diffusion. Through the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem we estimate the amplitude and time scale of\nhelicity fluctuations on the length scale $\\lambda$, finding $\\delta\n\\mathcal{H} \\sim \\lambda T$ and $\\tau \\sim \\alpha \\lambda^3 T^2$ for a\nrelativistic plasma at temperature $T$. We argue that the presence of a chiral\nasymmetry allows the helicity to grow diffusively for a time $t \\sim\nT^3/(\\alpha^5 \\mu_5^4)$ until it reaches an equilibrium value $\\mathcal{H} \\sim\n\\mu_{5} T^2 / \\alpha$, and the chiral asymmetry is partially erased. If the\nchiral asymmetry is small, $\\mu_5 < T/\\alpha$, this avenue for chiral charge\nerasure is found to be slower than the chiral magnetic effect for which $t \\sim\nT / (\\alpha^3 \\mu_{5}^2)$.

Identifying dirty data is\noften a manual and iterative process, and can be challenging on large datasets.\nHowever, many data cleaning workflows can introduce subtle biases into the\ntraining processes due to violation of independence assumptions.

DQ Tau is the third nearly equal-mass double-lined spectroscopic\nbinary with a circumbinary disk that has been dynamically \"weighed\" with these\ntwo independent techniques: all show consistent results, validating the overall\naccuracy of the disk-based approach and demonstrating that it can be robustly\napplied to large samples of young, single stars as ALMA ramps up to operations\nat full capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2016 03:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

A codeword for bag-of-words models is generated by packaging\nthe learned descriptor and mask, with a masked Hamming distance defined to\nmeasure the distance between two codewords. The geometric properties of the\nlearned codewords are then mathematically justified. In addition, hypothesis\nconstraints are imposed through temporal consistency in matched codewords,\nwhich improves precision. The approach, integrated in an incremental\nbag-of-words system, is validated on multiple benchmark data sets and compared\nto state-of-the-art methods.

The higher-spin nucleon (3/2 and 5/2) and hyperon (3/2)\nresonances were included in the model utilizing the consistent formalism by\nPascalutsa and they were found to play an important role in data description.\nThe spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 hyperon resonances in combination with the Born terms\ncontribute significantly to the background part of the amplitude. Various forms\nof the hadron form factor were considered in the construction and the dipole\nand multidipole forms were selected as those most suitable for the data\ndescription. Model parameters were fitted to new experimental data from CLAS,\nLEPS, and GRAAL collaborations and two versions of the model, BS1 and BS2, were\nchosen. Both models provide a good overall description of the data for the c.m.\nenergies from the threshold up to 2.4 GeV. Predicted cross sections of the\nmodels at very small kaon angles being consistent with results of the\nSaclay-Lyon model indicate that the models could be also successful in\npredicting the hypernucleus production cross sections. Although kaon\nphotoproduction takes place in the third-resonance region with many resonant\nstates, the total number of included resonances, 15 and 16, is quite moderate\nand it is comparable with numbers of resonances in other models. The set of\nchosen nucleon resonances overlaps well with the set of the most probable\ncontributing states determined in the Bayesian analysis with the\nRegge-plus-resonance model. Particularly, we confirm that the missing\nresonances $P_{13}(1900)$ and $D_{13}(1875)$ do play important role in the\ndescription of data. However, the spin-1/2 state $P_{11}(1880)$ included in the\nBayesian analysis was replaced in our analysis with the near-mass spin-5/2\nstate $N^*(1860)$, recently considered by the Particle Data Group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2016 08:46:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 16:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-23"}

It is\nobserved that the first mode can generate ranks with over 90% and 86% accuracy\nfor sequential and parallel execution of an application.

It is shown\nwithin a quasilinear analytic theory of driven turbulence and by nonlinear\nsimulations of magnetoconvection that the resulting small-scale current\nhelicity has the same sign as the large-scale current helicity while the ratio\nof both pseudo-scalars is of the order of the magnetic Reynolds number of the\nconvection.

In particular, we show that this two-port acoustic system can\nperfectly absorb two high amplitude symmetric incident waves when the additive\nnonlinear losses in the HR, induced by the jet flow separation, together with\nthe weak linear viscothermal losses of the HR balance the radiation losses to\nthe waveguide. For the case of the one-sided incidence configuration, this\ncondition leads to an absorption equal to 0.5. This result, which is verified\nexperimentally, is in a good agreement with an analytical nonlinear model of\nthe impedance of the HR. The nonlinear control of perfect absorption using\nresonators will open new possibilities in the design of high amplitude sound\nattenuators for aero-engine applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2016 13:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

A\nsupervised extension to SFA for classification and regression is graph-based\nSFA (GSFA).

It has been shown that\nhierarchical GSFA (HGSFA) allows learning from images and other\nhigh-dimensional data. The feature space spanned by HGSFA is complex due to the\ncomposition of the nonlinearities of the nodes in the network.

As social media data sets are very large, most approaches make use of\ndistributed computing systems for this purpose. Distributing graph processing\nrequires solving many difficult engineering problems, which has lead some\nresearchers to look at single-machine solutions that are faster and easier to\nmaintain.

Recently, driven by applications in engineering, biology,\nmedicine and other areas of science new challenging problems have appeared. The\ncommon feature of these problems is high dimensions. We present here a survey\non classical methods developed in multivariate approximation theory, which are\nknown to work very well for moderate dimensions and which have potential for\napplications in really high dimensions. The theory of hyperbolic cross\napproximation and related theory of functions with mixed smoothness are under\ndetailed study for more than 50 years. It is now well understood that this\ntheory is important both for theoretical study and for practical applications.\nIt is also understood that both theoretical analysis and construction of\npractical algorithms are very difficult problems. This explains why many\nfundamental problems in this area are still unsolved. Only a few survey papers\nand monographs on the topic are published. This and recently discovered deep\nconnections between the hyperbolic cross approximation (and related sparse\ngrids) and other areas of mathematics such as probability, discrepancy, and\nnumerical integration motivated us to write this survey. We try to put emphases\non the development of ideas and methods rather than list all the known results\nin the area. We formulate many problems, which, to our knowledge, are open\nproblems.

In this model each actor\nholds a position on some issue, actors and their opinions being associated to\nvertices of the graph, and, additionally, the actors hold opinions of one\nanother, with these opinions being associated to edges in the graph. These\nquantities are allowed to evolve according to the gradient flow of a natural\nfree energy. We show that for a small spread in opinions the model converges to\na consensus state, where all actors hold the same position. For a larger spread\nin opinion there is a phase transition marked by the birth of a second stable\nstate: in addition to the consensus state there is a second polarized or\npartisan state. This state, when it exists, is conjectured to be global energy\nminimizer, with the consensus state being a local energy minimizer. We derive\nan energy inequality which supports this. Interestingly, all of the steady\nstates we find, with the exception of the consensus state, are either balanced\n(in the sense of Heider) or are completely unbalanced states where all\ntriangles are unbalanced.

For the\nmemoryless case, it has been exactly solved for a paradigmatic class of two\nqubit states in high and zero temperature thermal environment. For the\nnon-Markovian model, it has been solved for zero temperature bath. The\nevolution of quantum coherence and entanglement has been observed in presence\nof the above mentioned interactions. We show that the global part of the\nsystem-bath interaction compensates for the decoherence, resulting in slow down\nof coherence and entanglement decay. For an appropriately defined limiting\ncase, both coherence and entanglement show freezing behaviour for the high\ntemperature bath. In case of zero temperature bath, the mentioned interaction\nnot only stabilizes the non-classical correlations, but also enhances them for\na finite period. For the memory dependent case, we have seen that the global\ninteraction enhances the back-flow of information from environment to the\nsystem, as it enhances the regeneration of coherence and entanglement. Also we\nhave studied the generation of Quantum Fisher information by the mentioned\nprocess. An intuitive measure of non-classicality based on non-commutativity of\nquantum states has been considered. Bounds on generated quantum Fisher\ninformation has been found in terms of quantumness and coherence.
