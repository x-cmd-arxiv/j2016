Our algorithms achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance in a simple and novel way.\n  Our algorithm for maximal independent set selection operates on a network of\nidentical anonymous processors. The processor at each node has no prior\ninformation about the network. At each time step, each node can only broadcast\na single bit to all its neighbours, or remain silent. Each node can detect\nwhether one or more neighbours have broadcast, but cannot tell how many of its\nneighbours have broadcast, or which ones. We build on recent work of Afek et\nal. which was inspired by studying the development of a network of cells in the\nfruit fly~\\cite{Afek2011a}. However we incorporate for the first time another\nimportant feature of the biological system: varying the probability value used\nat each node based on local feedback from neighbouring nodes. Given any\n$n$-node network, our algorithm achieves the optimal expected time complexity\nof $O(\\log n)$ rounds and the optimal expected message complexity of $O(1)$\nsingle-bit messages broadcast by each node.We also show that the previous\napproach, without feedback, cannot achieve better than $\\Omega(\\log^2 n)$\nexpected time complexity, whatever global scheme is used to choose the\nprobabilities.\n  Our algorithm for distributed greedy colouring works under similar harsh\nconditions: each identical node has no prior information about the network, can\nonly broadcast a single message to all neighbours at each time step\nrepresenting a desired colour, and can only detect whether at least one\nneighbour has broadcast each colour value. We show that our algorithm has an\nexpected time complexity of $O(\\Delta+\\log n)$, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum\ndegree of the network, and expected message complexity of $O(1)$ messages\nbroadcast by each node.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2016 16:19:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-19"}

Many approaches have been proposed for mitigating the\ntypically inefficient operating points. However, in a growing number of\nnetworking scenarios selfish agents are able to communicate and reach an\nagreement. Hence, the degradation of performance should be considered at an\noperating point of a cooperative game. Accordingly, our goal is to lay\nfoundations for the application of cooperative game theory to fundamental\nproblems in networking. We explain our choice of the Nash Bargaining Scheme\n(NBS) as the solution concept, and introduce the Price of Selfishness (PoS),\nwhich considers the degradation of performance at the worst NBS. We focus on\nthe fundamental load balancing game of routing over parallel links. First, we\nconsider agents with identical performance objectives. We show that, while the\nPoA here can be large, through bargaining, all agents, and the system, strictly\nimprove their performance. Interestingly, in a two-agent system or when all\nagents have identical demands, we establish that they reach social optimality.\nWe then consider agents with different performance objectives and demonstrate\nthat the PoS and PoA can be unbounded, yet we explain why both measures are\nunsuitable. Accordingly, we introduce the Price of Heterogeneity (PoH), as an\nextension of the PoA. We establish an upper-bound on the PoH and indicate its\nfurther motivation for bargaining.

Most\nknowledge about these transitions comes from systems exhibiting the\nmultistability of spatially uniform states. In spatially extended and,\nparticularly, in pattern-forming systems, there are many possible scenarios for\ntransitions between alternative states. Quenched disorder may affect the\ndynamics, bifurcation diagrams and critical transitions in nonlinear systems.\nHowever, only a few studies have explored the effects of quenched disorder on\npattern-forming systems, either experimentally or by using theoretical models.\nHere, we use a fundamental model describing pattern formation, the\nSwift-Hohenberg model and a well-explored mathematical model describing the\ndynamics of vegetation in drylands to study the effects of quenched disorder on\ncritical transitions in pattern-forming systems. We find that the disorder\naffects the patterns formed by introducing an interplay between the imposed\npattern and the self-organized one. We show that, in both systems considered\nhere, the disorder significantly increases the durability of the patterned\nstate and makes the transition between the patterned state and the uniform\nstate more gradual. In addition, the disorder induces hysteresis in the\nresponse of the system to changes in the bifurcation parameter well before the\ncritical transition occurs. We also show that the cross-correlation between the\ndisordered parameter and the dynamical variable can serve as an early indicator\nfor an imminent critical transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2016 19:37:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

While the microstructure\nreconstruction searches for a microstructure with prescribed statistical\nproperties, the microstructure compression focuses on efficient representation\nof material morphology for a purpose of multiscale modelling. Successful\napplication of those techniques, nevertheless, requires proper understanding of\nunderlying statistical descriptors quantifying material morphology. In this\npaper we focus on the lineal path function designed to capture namely\nshort-range effects and phase connectedness, which can be hardly handled by the\ncommonly used two-point probability function. The usage of the lineal path\nfunction is, however, significantly limited by huge computational requirements.\nSo as to examine the properties of the lineal path function within the\ncomputationally exhaustive compression and reconstruction processes, we start\nwith the acceleration of the lineal path evaluation, namely by porting part of\nits code to the graphics processing unit using the CUDA (Compute Unified Device\nArchitecture) programming environment. This allows us to present a unique\ncomparison of the entire lineal path function with the commonly used rough\napproximation based on the Monte Carlo and/or sampling template. Moreover, the\naccelerated version of the lineal path function is then compared with the\ntwo-point probability function within the compression and reconstruction of\ntwo-phase morphologies. Their significant features are thoroughly discussed and\nillustrated on a set of artificial periodic as well as real-world random\nmicrostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2016 22:02:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-19"}

We propose an\nalgebraic Bethe ansatz construction of the off-shell Bethe states, and we\nconjecture that the on-shell Bethe states are highest-weight states of the\nquantum group. We also propose a determinant formula for the scalar product\nbetween an off-shell Bethe state and its on-shell dual, as well as for the\nsquare of the norm. We find that all of these results, except for the\ndegeneracies and a constant factor in the scalar product, are universal in the\nsense that they do not depend on the value of the spin. In an appendix, we\nbriefly consider the closed TL spin chain with periodic boundary conditions,\nand show how a previously-proposed solution can be improved so as to obtain the\ncomplete (albeit non-universal) spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 01:08:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2016 11:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

Despite the simplicity of the interaction, because of the\npresence of multi-body correlations predicting the thermodynamics of such\nsystems remains a challenge. Earlier Marshall and Chapman developed a\nmulti-body formulation for such systems wherein the cluster partition function\nfor the hard-sphere solvent molecules in a defined inner-shell (or coordination\nvolume) of the hard-sphere solute is used as the reference within the\nstatistical association fluid theory formalism. The multi-body contribution to\nthese partition functions are obtained by ignoring the bulk solvent, thus\nlimiting the applicability of the theory to low system densities. Deriving\ninspiration from the quasichemical theory of solutions where these partition\nfunctions occur in the guise of equilibrium constants for cluster formation, we\ndevelop a way to account for the multi-body correlations including the effect\nof the bulk solvent. We obtain the free energy to evacuate the inner-shell, the\nchemistry contribution within quasichemical theory, from simulations of the\nhard-sphere reference. This chemistry contribution reflects association in the\nreference in the presence of the bulk medium. The gas-phase partition functions\nare then augmented by a mean activity factor that is adjusted to reproduce the\nchemistry contribution. We show that the updated partition function provides a\nrevised reference that better captures the distribution of solvent around the\nsolute up to high system densities. Using this updated reference, we find that\ntheory better describes both the bonding state and the excess chemical\npotential of the colloid in the physical system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 01:42:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-19"}

They originated from the same primary CBP (BP1) and propagated in the\nnortheast direction along large-scale, closed coronal loops. Two of the jets\n(J3 and J6) produced sympathetic CBPs (BP2 and BP3) after reaching the remote\nfootpoints of the loops.

The sizes and apparent\nvelocities of the blobs are 4.5$-$9 Mm and 140$-$380 km/s, respectively. The\narrival times of the multiple blobs in the jets at the far-end of the loops\nindicate that the sympathetic CBPs are caused by jet flows rather than thermal\nconduction fronts.

Based on the Eulerian velocity field\nfrom the DNS, a backward-particle-tracking method is applied to solve the\ntransport equation of the Lagrangian scalar field, and then the iso-surfaces of\nthe Lagrangian field can be extracted as material surfaces in the evolution.\nThree critical issues for Lagrangian investigations on the evolution of\ncoherent structures using material surfaces are addressed. First, the initial\nscalar field is uniquely determined based on proposed criteria, so that the\ninitial material surfaces can be approximated as vortex surfaces, and keep\ninvariant in the initial laminar state. Second, the evolution of typical\nmaterial surfaces initially from different wall distances is presented, and\nthen the influential material surface with the maximum deformation is\nidentified. Large vorticity variations with the maximum curvature growth of\nvortex lines are also observed on this surface. Moreover, crucial events in the\ntransition can be characterized in a Lagrangian approach by conditional\nstatistics on the material surfaces. Finally, the influential material surface,\nwhich is initially a vortex surface, is demonstrated as a surrogate of the\nvortex surface before significant topological changes of vortical structures.\nTherefore, this material surface can be used to elucidate the continuous\nevolution of vortical structures in transitional wall-bounded flows in a\nLagrangian perspective. The evolution of the influential material surface is\ndivided into three stages: the formation of a triangular bulge from an\ninitially disturbed streamwise-spanwise sheet, rolling up of the vortex sheet\nnear the bulge ridges with the vorticity intensification, and the generation\nand evolution of signature hairpin-like structures with self-induced dynamics\nof vortex filaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 03:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

In this paper, we show that this list secrecy problem is\nequivalent to the one with secrecy measured by a new quantity\n\\emph{lossy-equivocation}, which is proven to be the minimum optimistic\n1-achievable source coding rate (the minimum coding rate needed to reconstruct\nthe source within target distortion with positive probability for\n\\emph{infinitely many blocklengths}) of the source with the wiretapped signal\nas two-sided information, and also can be seen as a lossy extension of\nconventional equivocation. Upon this (or list) secrecy measure, we study\nsource-channel secrecy problem in the discrete memoryless Shannon cipher system\nwith \\emph{noisy} wiretap channel. Two inner bounds and an outer bound on the\nachievable region of secret key rate, list rate, wiretapper distortion, and\ndistortion of legitimate user are given. The inner bounds are derived by using\nuncoded scheme and (operationally) separate scheme, respectively. Thanks to the\nequivalence between lossy-equivocation secrecy and list secrecy, information\nspectrum method is leveraged to prove the outer bound.

Our method is based on a decomposition\nrelating the compositional covariance to the basis covariance, which is\napproximately identifiable as the dimensionality tends to infinity.

Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) data are extremely\nsensitive to the phase stability of the VLBI array. This is especially\nimportant when we reach {\\mu}Jy r.m.s. sensitivities. Calibration using\nstandard phase referencing techniques is often used to improve the phase\nstability of VLBI data but the results are often not optimal. This is evident\nin blank fields that do not have in-beam calibrators. Aims. We present a\ncalibration algorithm termed Multi-Source Self-Calibration (MSSC) which can be\nused after standard phase referencing on wide-field VLBI observations. This is\ntested on a 1.6 GHz wide-field VLBI data set of the Hubble Deep Field-North and\nthe Hubble Flanking Fields. Methods. MSSC uses multiple target sources detected\nin the field via standard phase referencing techniques and modifies the\nvisibili- ties so that each data set approximates to a point source. These are\ncombined to increase the signal to noise and permit self-calibration. In\nprinciple, this should allow residual phase changes caused by the troposphere\nand ionosphere to be corrected. By means of faceting, the technique can also be\nused for direction dependent calibration. Results. Phase corrections, derived\nusing MSSC, were applied to a wide-field VLBI data set of the HDF-N comprising\nof 699 phase centres. MSSC was found to perform considerably better than\nstandard phase referencing and single source self-calibration. All detected\nsources exhibited dramatic improvements in dynamic range. Using MSSC, one\nsource reached the detection threshold taking the total detected sources to\ntwenty. 60% of these sources can now be imaged with uniform weighting compared\nto just 45% with standard phase referencing. The Parseltongue code which\nimplements MSSC has been released and made publicly available to the\nastronomical community (https://github.com/jradcliffe5/multi_self_cal).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 10:13:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 17:13:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 10:30:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-24"}

As most commonly only some of the kinetic parameters are measurable or\nprecisely known, parameter estimation techniques are applied to parametrize the\nmodel to experimental data. A main challenge for the parameter estimation is\nthe complexity of the parameter space, especially its high dimensionality and\nlocal minima.\n  Parameter estimation techniques consist of an objective function, measuring\nhow well a certain parameter set describes the experimental data, and an\noptimization algorithm that optimizes this objective function. A lot of effort\nhas been spent on developing highly sophisticated optimization algorithms to\ncope with the complexity in the parameter space, but surprisingly few articles\naddress the influence of the objective function on the computational complexity\nin finding global optima. We extend a recently developed multiple shooting for\nstochastic systems (MSS) objective function for parameter estimation of\nstochastic models and apply it to parameter estimation of ODE models. This MSS\nobjective function treats the intervals between measurement points separately.\nThis separate treatment allows the ODE trajectory to stay closer to the data\nand we show that it reduces the complexity of the parameter space.\n  We use examples from Systems Biology, namely a Lotka-Volterra model, a\nFitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator and a Calcium oscillation model, to demonstrate the\npower of the MSS approach for reducing the complexity and the number of local\nminima in the parameter space. The approach is fully implemented in the COPASI\nsoftware package and, therefore, easily accessible for a wide community of\nresearchers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 10:38:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-19"}

We impose three zeros in the down-quark mass matrix with\ntaking the diagonal up-quark mass matrix to reduce the number of free\nparameters. The three zeros are maximal zeros in order to have a CP violating\nphase in the quark mass matrix. Then, there remain six real parameters and one\nCP violating phase, which is the minimal number to reproduce the observed data\nof the down-quark masses and the CKM parameters. The twenty textures with three\nzeros are examined. Among them, the thirteen textures are viable for the\ndown-quark mass matrix. As a representative of these textures, we discuss a\ntexture $M_d^{(1)}$ in details. By using the experimental data on $\\sin\n2\\beta$, $\\theta_{13}$ and $\\theta_{23}$ together with the observed quark\nmasses, the Cabibbo angle is predicted to be close to the experimental data.

In this work we have addressed these issues through fully\natomistic reactive molecular dynamics simulations. We investigated the\nstructural and dynamical aspects of the hydrogenation of graphene membranes\n(one-side hydrogenation, the so called graphone structure) on different\nsubstrates (graphene, few-layers graphene, graphite and platinum). Our results\nalso show that the observed hydrogenation rates are very sensitive to the\nsubstrate type. For all investigated cases, the largest fraction of\nhydrogenated carbon atoms was for platinum substrates. Our results also show\nthat a significant number of randomly distributed H clusters are formed during\nthe early stages of the hydrogenation process, regardless of the type of\nsubstrate and temperature. These results suggest that, similarly to graphane\nformation, large perfect graphone-like domains are unlikely to be formed. These\nfindings are especially important since experiments have showed that cluster\nformation influences the electronic transport properties in hydrogenated\ngraphene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 12:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-19"}

In zebrafish, the breaking of\nleft-right symmetry is organised by Kupffer's Vesicle (KV): an approximately\nspherical, fluid-filled structure that begins to form in the embryo 10 hours\npost fertilisation. A crucial component of zebrafish symmetry breaking is the\nestablishment of a cilia-driven fluid flow within KV. However, it is still\nunclear (a) how dorsal, ventral and equatorial cilia contribute to the global\nvortical flow, and (b) if this flow breaks left-right symmetry through\nmechanical transduction or morphogen transport. Fully answering these questions\nrequires knowledge of the three-dimensional flow patterns within KV, which have\nnot been quantified in previous work. In this study, we calculate and analyse\nthe three-dimensional flow in KV. We consider flow from both individual and\ngroups of cilia, and (a) find anticlockwise flow can arise purely from excess\nof cilia on the dorsal roof over the ventral floor, showing how this vortical\nflow is stabilised by dorsal tilt of equatorial cilia, and (b) show that\nanterior clustering of dorsal cilia leads to around 40% faster flow in the\nanterior over the posterior corner. We argue that these flow features are\nsupportive of symmetry breaking through mechano-sensory cilia, and suggest a\nnovel experiment to test this hypothesis. From our new understanding of the\nflow, we propose a further experiment to reverse the flow within KV to\npotentially induce situs inversus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 12:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-19"}

Arrested\ninstability and droplet formation are novel general features directly linked to\nthe nature of the dipole-dipole interactions, and should hence play an\nimportant role in all future experiments with strongly dipolar gases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 13:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

In order to combat this\neavesdropping attack, secure network coding is introduced to prevent\ninformation from being leaked to adversaries. For any construction of secure\nlinear network codes (SLNCs) over a wiretap network, the based field size is a\nvery important index, because it largely determines the computational and space\ncomplexities, and further the efficiency of network transmission. Further, it\nis also very important for the process of secure network coding from\ntheoretical research to practical applications. In the present paper, we\nproposed new lower bounds on the field size for constructing SLNCs, which shows\nthat the field size can be reduced considerably without giving up any security\nand capacity. In addition, since the obtained lower bounds depend on network\ntopology, how to efficiently determine them is another very important and\nattractive problem for explicit constructions of SLNCs. Motivated by a desire\nto develop methods with low complexity and empirical behavior to solve this\nproblem, we propose efficient approaches and present a series of algorithms for\nimplementation.

An example of a quadratic\nvaluation is the Wu characteristic w(G) which sums (-1)^(dim(x)+dim(y)) over\nall intersecting pairs of complete subgraphs x,y of a G. More generally, an\nintersection number w(A,B) sums (-1)^(dim(x)+dim(y)) over pairs x,y, where x is\nin A and y is in B and x,y intersect. w(G) is a quadratic Euler characteristic\nX(G), where X sums (-1)^dim(x) over all complete subgraphs x of G.

In order\nto investigate these possibilities, we perform first a theoretical analysis of\nthe non-equilibrium response function in this context, aided by one simple\nnumerical model of the Hydrogen atom. Then, we proceed to investigate the\nfeasibility of using time-dependent density-functional theory as a means to\nimplement, theoretically, this absorption-optimization idea, for more complex\natoms or molecules. We conclude that the proposed idea could in principle be\nbrought to the laboratory: tailored pump pulses can excite systems into\nlight-absorbing states. However, we also highlight the severe numerical and\ntheoretical difficulties posed by the problem: large-scale non-equilibrium\nquantum dynamics are cumbersome, even with TDDFT, and the shortcomings of\nstate-of-the-art TDDFT functionals may still be serious for these\nout-of-equilibrium situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 14:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

We\nshow that renormalization in general, of the multiple zeta functions in\nparticular, is more than mere convention. We show that simple calculus methods\nallow us to compute the renormalized values of multiple zeta functions in any\ndimension for arguments of the form (1,...,1), where the series do not\nconverge. These values happen to be the coefficients of the asymptotic\nexpansion of the inverse Gamma function. We focus on the geometric\ninterpretation of these values, and on the combinatorics their closed form\nencodes, which happen to match the combinatorics of the generalized Euler\nreflection formula discovered by Michael E. Hoffman, which in turn is a kind of\nanalogue of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem for matrices. By means of one single\nlimit formula, we define a function on the positive open half-line which takes\nexactly the values of the Riemann zeta function, with the additional advantage\nthat it equals the Euler constant when the argument is 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Jan 2016 15:15:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 15:03:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2017 15:14:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-03"}

In fact, our study shows that some types of dark energy\ncandidate may admit this proposal. Some general properties of required dark\nenergy are also addressed. Moreover, our investigation shows that this new\nproposal for entropy, while combined with the second law of thermodynamics (as\nthe backbone of Verlinde's proposal), helps us in providing a thermodynamic\ninterpretation for the difference between the surface and bulk degrees of\nfreedom which, according to Padmanabhan's proposal, leads to the emergence of\nspacetime and thus the universe expansion.
