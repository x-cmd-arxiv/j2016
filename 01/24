The theory of\ndynamical systems predicts a slowing down when a system destabilises towards a\ntipping point. In simple stochastic systems this can result in increasing\nvariance and autocorrelation, potentially yielding an early warning of an\nabrupt change. Here we aim to establish whether the loss of Arctic sea ice\nwould follow these conceptual predictions, and which trends in sea ice\nvariability can be expected from pre-industrial conditions toward an Arctic\nthat is ice-free during the whole year. To this end, we apply a model hierarchy\nconsisting of two box models and one comprehensive Earth system model. We find\na consistent and robust decrease of the ice volume's annual relaxation time\nbefore summer ice is lost because thinner ice can adjust more quickly to\nperturbations. Thereafter, the relaxation time increases, mainly because the\nsystem becomes dominated by the ocean water's large heat capacity when the\nice-free season becomes longer. Both trends carry over to the autocorrelation\nof sea ice thickness in time series. These changes are robust to the nature and\norigin of climate variability in the models and hardly depend on the balance of\nfeedbacks. Therefore, characteristic trends can be expected in the future. As\nthese trends are not specific to the existence of abrupt ice loss, the\nprospects for early warnings seem very limited. This result also has\nimplications for statistical indicators in other systems whose effective mass\nchanges over time, affecting the trend of their relaxation time. However, the\nrobust relation between state and variability would allow an estimate of\nsea-ice variability from only short observations. This could help one to\nestimate the likelihood and persistence of extreme events in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2016 16:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-26"}

We introduce in this\npaper a special class of cluster consensus dynamics, termed the $G$-clustering\ndynamics for $G$ a point group, whereby the autonomous agents can form as many\nas $|G|$ clusters, and moreover, the associated $|G|$ clustering points exhibit\na geometric symmetry induced by the point group. The definition of a\n$G$-clustering dynamics relies on the use of the so-called voltage graph. We\nrecall that a $G$-voltage graph is comprised of two elements---one is a\ndirected graph (digraph), and the other is a map assigning elements of a\ngroup~$G$ to the edges of the digraph. For example, in the case when $G = \\{1,\n-1\\}$, i.e., a cyclic group of order~$2$, a voltage graph is nothing but a\nsigned graph. A $G$-clustering dynamics can then be viewed as a generalization\nof the so-called Altafini's model, which was originally defined over a signed\ngraph, by defining the dynamics over a voltage graph. One of the main\ncontributions of this paper is to identify a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor the exponential convergence of a $G$-clustering dynamics. Various\nproperties of voltage graphs that are necessary for establishing the\nconvergence result are also investigated, some of which might be of independent\ninterest in topological graph theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2016 05:06:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-26"}

By\nconsidering an inhomogeneous mean flow effect on turbulence, it is shown that\nturbulent cross helicity (velocity--magnetic-field correlation) should enter\nthe expression of turbulent electromotive force as the coupling coefficient for\nthe mean absolute vorticity. The inclusion of the cross-helicity effect makes\nthe present model different from the current $\\alpha$--$\\Omega$-type models\nmainly in two points. First, in addition to the usual $\\alpha$ (helicity\neffect) and $\\beta$ (turbulent magnetic diffusivity), we consider the $\\gamma$\ncoefficient (cross-helicity effect) as a key ingredient of the dynamo process.\nSecond, unlike the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ coefficients, which are often treated\nas an adjustable parameter in the current studies, the spatiotemporal evolution\nof $\\gamma$ coefficient is solved simultaneously with the mean magnetic-field\nequations. The basic scenario is as follows: In the presence of turbulent cross\nhelicity, the toroidal field is induced by the toroidal rotation in mediation\nby the turbulent cross helicity. The $\\alpha$ effect generates the poloidal\nfield from the toroidal one. This poloidal field produces a turbulent cross\nhelicity whose sign is opposite to the original one. Then a cycle of reversal\ncompletes. Eigenvalue analyses of the simplest possible present model give a\nbutterfly diagram, which confirms the above scenario as well as the\nequator-ward migrations, the phase relationship between the cross helicity and\nmagnetic fields, etc. These results suggest that the oscillation of the\nturbulent cross helicity is a key for the activity cycle. The reversal of the\nturbulent cross helicity is not the result of the magnetic-field reversal, but\nthe cause of the latter. This new model is expected to open up the possibility\nof the mean-field or turbulence closure dynamo approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2016 06:15:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 05:31:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

Commodity DDR DRAM refreshes cells at the rank level. This degrades\nperformance significantly because it prevents an entire rank from serving\nmemory requests while being refreshed. DRAM designed for mobile platforms,\nLPDDR DRAM, supports an enhanced mode, called per-bank refresh, that refreshes\ncells at the bank level. This enables a bank to be accessed while another in\nthe same rank is being refreshed, alleviating part of the negative performance\nimpact of refreshes. However, there are two shortcomings of per-bank refresh.\nFirst, the per-bank refresh scheduling scheme does not exploit the full\npotential of overlapping refreshes with accesses across banks because it\nrestricts the banks to be refreshed in a sequential round-robin order. Second,\naccesses to a bank that is being refreshed have to wait.\n  To mitigate the negative performance impact of DRAM refresh, we propose two\ncomplementary mechanisms, DARP (Dynamic Access Refresh Parallelization) and\nSARP (Subarray Access Refresh Parallelization). The goal is to address the\ndrawbacks of per-bank refresh by building more efficient techniques to\nparallelize refreshes and accesses within DRAM. First, instead of issuing\nper-bank refreshes in a round-robin order, DARP issues per-bank refreshes to\nidle banks in an out-of-order manner. Furthermore, DARP schedules refreshes\nduring intervals when a batch of writes are draining to DRAM. Second, SARP\nexploits the existence of mostly-independent subarrays within a bank. With\nminor modifications to DRAM organization, it allows a bank to serve memory\naccesses to an idle subarray while another subarray is being refreshed.\nExtensive evaluations show that our mechanisms improve system performance and\nenergy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art refresh policies and the benefit\nincreases as DRAM density increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2016 07:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-26"}

The speed reaches a maximal value on the core wall and further it\ndecreases monotonically. The vortex trembles around some average value and\npossesses by infinite life time. The vortex ball resulting from topological\ntransformation of the vortex ring is considered as a model of a particle with\nspin. Anomalous magnetic moment of electron is computed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2016 09:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-13"}

Field oriented control (FOC) and direct torque control (DTC) are\ncommonly used methods in high performance vector control for asynchronous\nmotors. Therefore, it is very important to identify clearly advantages and\ndisadvantages of both systems in the selection of appropriate control methods\nfor many industrial applications. This paper aims to present a new and\ndifferent perspective regarding the comparison of the switching behaviours on\nthe FOC and the DTC drivers. For this purpose, the experimental studies have\nbeen carried out to compare the inverter switching frequencies and torque\nresponses of the asynchronous motor in the FOC and the DTC systems under\ndifferent working conditions. The dSPACE 1103 controller board was programmed\nwith Matlab/Simulink software. As expected, the experimental studies showed\nthat the FOC controlled motors has a lessened torque ripple. On the other hand,\nthe FOC controlled motor switching frequency has about 65-75% more than the DTC\ncontrolled under both loaded and unloaded working conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2016 10:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}
