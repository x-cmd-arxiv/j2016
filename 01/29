Methods: This new approach for\nsource analysis does not use a geometry conforming volume triangulation, but\ninstead uses a structured mesh that does not resolve the geometry. The geometry\nis described using level set functions and is incorporated implicitly in its\nmathematical formulation. As no triangulation is necessary, the complexity of a\nsimulation pipeline and the need for manual interaction for patient specific\nsimulations can be reduced and is comparable with that of the FEM for\nhexahedral meshes. In addition, it maintains conservation laws on a discrete\nlevel. Here, we present the theory for UDG-FEM forward modeling, its\nverification using quasi-analytical solutions in multi-layer sphere models and\nan evaluation in a comparison with a discontinuous Galerkin (DG-FEM) method on\nhexahedral and on conforming tetrahedral meshes. We furthermore apply the\nUDG-FEM forward approach in a realistic head model simulation study. Results:\nThe given results show convergence and indicate a good overall accuracy of the\nUDG-FEM approach. UDG-FEM performs comparable or even better than DG-FEM on a\nconforming tetrahedral mesh while providing a less complex simulation pipeline.\nWhen compared to DG-FEM on hexahedral meshes, an overall better accuracy is\nachieved. Conclusion: The UDG-FEM approach is an accurate, flexible and\npromising method to solve the EEG forward problem. Significance: This study\nshows the first application of the UDG-FEM approach to the EEG forward problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 16:02:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 08:27:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-03"}

It is shown that in the\nevolution equations of the dislocation densities diffusion like terms neglected\nin earlier considerations play a crucial role in the length scale selection of\nthe dislocation density fluctuations. It is also shown that the formulated\ncontinuum theory can be derived from an averaged energy functional using the\nframework of phase field theories. However, in order to account for the flow\nstress one has in that case to introduce a nontrivial dislocation mobility\nfunction, which proves to be crucial for the instability leading to patterning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 17:05:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2016 07:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

This\ncancer can strike at any age; it is one of the leading causes of loss of life\nin young persons. Since this cancer is visible on the skin, it is potentially\ndetectable at a very early stage when it is curable. New developments have\nconverged to make fully automatic early melanoma detection a real possibility.\nFirst, the advent of dermoscopy has enabled a dramatic boost in clinical\ndiagnostic ability to the point that melanoma can be detected in the clinic at\nthe very earliest stages. The global adoption of this technology has allowed\naccumulation of large collections of dermoscopy images of melanomas and benign\nlesions validated by histopathology. The development of advanced technologies\nin the areas of image processing and machine learning have given us the ability\nto allow distinction of malignant melanoma from the many benign mimics that\nrequire no biopsy. These new technologies should allow not only earlier\ndetection of melanoma, but also reduction of the large number of needless and\ncostly biopsy procedures. Although some of the new systems reported for these\ntechnologies have shown promise in preliminary trials, widespread\nimplementation must await further technical progress in accuracy and\nreproducibility. In this paper, we provide an overview of computerized\ndetection of melanoma in dermoscopy images. First, we discuss the various\naspects of lesion segmentation. Then, we provide a brief overview of clinical\nfeature segmentation. Finally, we discuss the classification stage where\nmachine learning algorithms are applied to the attributes generated from the\nsegmented features to predict the existence of melanoma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 17:33:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-29"}

A recent study of the\nneutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1608-52 has also shown significant lags,\nwhose properties hint at a reverberation origin. Here, we adapt general\nrelativistic ray tracing impulse response functions used to model X-ray\nreverberation in AGN for neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries. Assuming\nrelativistic reflection forms the broad iron line and associated reflection\ncontinuum, we use reflection fits to the energy spectrum along with the impulse\nresponse functions to calculate the expected lags as a function of energy over\nthe range of observed kHz QPO frequencies in 4U 1608-52. We find that the lag\nenergy spectrum is expected to increase with increasing energy above 8 keV,\nwhile the observed lags in 4U 1608-52 show the opposite behavior. This\ndemonstrates that the lags in the lower kHz QPO of 4U 1608-52 are not solely\ndue to reverberation. We do note, however, that the models appear to be more\nconsistent with the much flatter lag energy spectrum observed in the upper kHz\nQPO of several neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries, suggesting that lower and\nupper kHz QPOs may have different origins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 17:59:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 00:41:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

We provide high\naccuracy spectral datafor lowest eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this\ninfinite spherical well problem. Our focus is on radial and orbital shapes of\neigenfunctions. The spectrum consists of an ordered set of strictly positive\neigenvalues which naturally splits into non-overlapping, orbitally labelled\n$E_{(k,l)}$ series. For each orbital label $l=0,1,2,...$ the label $k =1,2,...$\nenumerates consecutive $l$-th series eigenvalues. Each of them is\n$2l+1$-degenerate. The $l=0$ eigenvalues series $E_{(k,0)}$ are identical with\nthe set of even labeled eigenvalues for the $d=1$ Cauchy well:\n$E_{(k,0)}(d=3)=E_{2 k}(d=1)$. Likewise, the eigenfunctions $\\psi_{(k,0\n)}(d=3)$ and $\\psi_{2k }(d=1)$ show affinity. We have identified the generic\nfunctional form of eigenfunctions of the spherical well which appear to be\ncomposed of a product of a solid harmonic and of a suitable purely radial\nfunction. The method to evaluate (approximately) the latter has been found to\nfollow the universal pattern which effectively allows to skip all, sometimes\ninvolved, intermediate calculations (those were in usage, while computing the\neigenvalues for $l \\leq 3$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 19:10:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-06"}

Using structural MRI data, we\nidentify areas in fronto-temporo-parietal cortex with reduced gray matter\ndensity in corticobasal syndrome relative to age matched controls. A support\nvector machine procedure demonstrates that gray matter density poorly\ndiscriminates between frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease\npathology subgroups with low sensitivity and specificity. In contrast, a\nstatistic of local network efficiency demonstrates excellent discriminatory\npower, with high sensitivity and specificity. Our results indicate that the\nunderlying pathological sources of corticobasal syndrome can be classified more\naccurately using graph theoretical statistics of white matter microstructure in\nassociation cortex than by regional gray matter density alone. These results\nhighlight the importance of a multimodal neuroimaging approach to diagnostic\nanalyses of corticobasal syndrome and suggest that distinct sources of\npathology mediate the circuitry of brain regions affected by corticobasal\nsyndrome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 19:12:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-29"}

By changing the\nsub-cycle character of the laser electric field it is possible to control such\nphenomena. For long pulses, sub-cycle shaping of the field can be done by\nadding a relatively weak, second harmonic of the driving field to the pulse.\nThrough constructive and destructive interference, the combination of strong\nand weak fields can be used to change the probability of a strong-field process\nbeing initiated at any given part of the cycle. In order to control sub-cycle\nphenomena with optimal accuracy, it is necessary to know the phase difference\nof the strong and the weak fields precisely. If the weaker field is an even\nharmonic of the driving field, electrons ionized by the field will be\nasymmetrically distributed between the positive and negative directions of the\ncombined fields. Information about the asymmetry can yield information about\nthe phase difference. A technique to measure asymmetry for few-cycle pulses,\ncalled Stereo-ATI (Above Threshold Ionization), has been developed by [Paulus G\nG, et al 2003 Phys. Rev. Lett. 91].

These representations are based on visual element clouds, which\nrobustly capture the connection between the query and visual evidence from\ncandidate locations. We then maximize the influence of visual elements that are\ngeo-distinctive because they do not occur in images taken at many other\nlocations.

We find an unexpected result from the point of view of\nlocalization properties: A robust topological metallic state characterized by a\nnon--quantized Hall conductivity arises from strong disorder in class A (time\nreversal symmetry broken) insulators. The key issue is the nature of the\ndisorder realization: selective disorder in only one sublattice in systems\nbased on bipartite lattices. The generality of the result is based on the\npartite nature of most recent 2D materials as graphene or transition metal\ndichalcogenides, and the possibility of the physical realization of the\nparticular disorder demonstrated in ref. 1. An anomalous Hall metal arises also\nwhen the original clean insulator is topologically trivial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 21:00:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-29"}

If it starts from black hole (BH)\nremnants of Population III stars (light seeds with mass ~ 100 Msun) it requires\nsuper-Eddington accretion. An alternative route is to start from heavy seeds\nformed by the direct collapse of gas onto a ~ 10^5 Msun BH. Here we investigate\nthe relative role of light and heavy seeds as BH progenitors of the first\nSMBHs. We use the cosmological, data constrained semi-analytic model\nGAMETE/QSOdust to simulate several independent merger histories of z > 6\nquasars. Using physically motivated prescriptions to form light and heavy seeds\nin the progenitor galaxies, we find that the formation of a few heavy seeds\n(between 3 and 30 in our reference model) enables the Eddington-limited growth\nof SMBHs at z > 6. This conclusion depends sensitively on the interplay between\nchemical, radiative and mechanical feedback effects, which easily erase the\nconditions that allow the suppression of gas cooling in the low metallicity gas\n(Z < Zcr and JLW > Jcr). We find that heavy seeds can not form if dust cooling\ntriggers gas fragmentation above a critical dust-to-gas mass ratio (D > Dcr).\nIn addition, the relative importance of light and heavy seeds depends on the\nadopted mass range for light seeds, as this dramatically affects the history of\ncold gas along the merger tree, by both SN and AGN-driven winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 21:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-10"}

Selecting parameters in the\nattenuation functions is non-trivial. In this work, an optimisation procedure\nfor automatically calibrating matched layers is presented. The procedure is\nbased on solving optimisation problems constrained by partial differential\nequations with polynomial and piecewise-constant attenuation functions.

In this work, we map general relativistic models of black\nhole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers into a Newtonian smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) code and follow the evolution of the thermodynamics and\nmorphology of the ejecta until the outflows become homologous. We investigate\nhow the subsequent evolution depends on our mapping procedure and find that the\nresults are robust.

Evidence-based dynamic analysis allows execution\nto proceed at nearly full speed until the end of an epoch (e.g., a heavyweight\nsystem call).

Our evaluation shows that DoubleTake\nis efficient, imposing just 4% overhead on average, making it the fastest such\nsystem to date.

When individuals meet repeatedly, they can use\nconditional strategies to enforce cooperative outcomes that would not be\nfeasible in one-shot social dilemmas. Direct reciprocity requires that\nindividuals keep track of their past interactions and find the right response.\nHowever, there are natural bounds on strategic complexity: Humans find it\ndifficult to remember past interactions accurately, especially over long\ntimespans. Given these limitations, it is natural to ask how complex strategies\nneed to be for cooperation to evolve. Here, we study stochastic evolutionary\ngame dynamics in finite populations to systematically compare the evolutionary\nperformance of reactive strategies, which only respond to the co-player's\nprevious move, and memory-one strategies, which take into account the own and\nthe co-player's previous move. In both cases, we compare deterministic strategy\nand stochastic strategy spaces. For reactive strategies and small costs, we\nfind that stochasticity benefits cooperation, because it allows for\ngenerous-tit-for-tat. For memory one strategies and small costs, we find that\nstochasticity does not increase the propensity for cooperation, because the\ndeterministic rule of win-stay, lose-shift works best. For memory one\nstrategies and large costs, however, stochasticity can augment cooperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2016 02:57:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2016 05:17:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 05:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

This paper investigates the optimal consensus problem for\ngeneral linear MASs subject to control input constraints. Two classes of MASs\nincluding subsystems with semi-stable and unstable dynamics are considered. For\nboth classes of MASs without input constraints, the results on designing\noptimal consensus protocols are first developed by inverse optimality approach.\nUtilizing the optimal consensus protocols, the receding horizon control\n(RHC)-based consensus strategies are designed for these two classes of MASs\nwith input constraints. The conditions for assigning the cost functions\ndistributively are derived, based on which the distributed RHC-based consensus\nframeworks are formulated. Next, the feasibility and consensus properties of\nthe closed-loop systems are analyzed. It is shown that 1) the optimal\nperformance indices under the inverse optimal consensus protocols are coupled\nwith the network topologies and the system matrices of subsystems, but they are\ndifferent for MASs with semi-stable and unstable subsystems; 2) the unstable\nmodes of subsystems impose more stringent requirements for the parameter\ndesign; 3) the designed RHC-based consensus strategies can make the control\ninput constraints fulfilled and ensure consensus for the closed-loop systems in\nboth cases.

Learned from a large-scale training dataset,\nCNN features are much more discriminative and accurate than the hand-crafted\nfeatures. Moreover, CNN features are also transferable among different domains.\nOn the other hand, traditional dictionarybased features (such as BoW and SPM)\ncontain much more local discriminative and structural information, which is\nimplicitly embedded in the images. To further improve the performance, in this\npaper, we propose to combine CNN with dictionarybased models for scene\nrecognition and visual domain adaptation. Specifically, based on the well-tuned\nCNN models (e.g., AlexNet and VGG Net), two dictionary-based representations\nare further constructed, namely mid-level local representation (MLR) and\nconvolutional Fisher vector representation (CFV). In MLR, an efficient\ntwo-stage clustering method, i.e., weighted spatial and feature space spectral\nclustering on the parts of a single image followed by clustering all\nrepresentative parts of all images, is used to generate a class-mixture or a\nclassspecific part dictionary. After that, the part dictionary is used to\noperate with the multi-scale image inputs for generating midlevel\nrepresentation. In CFV, a multi-scale and scale-proportional GMM training\nstrategy is utilized to generate Fisher vectors based on the last convolutional\nlayer of CNN. By integrating the complementary information of MLR, CFV and the\nCNN features of the fully connected layer, the state-of-the-art performance can\nbe achieved on scene recognition and domain adaptation problems. An interested\nfinding is that our proposed hybrid representation (from VGG net trained on\nImageNet) is also complementary with GoogLeNet and/or VGG-11 (trained on\nPlace205) greatly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2016 05:32:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-01"}

We evaluate\nthis H2 norm under the assumption of a dominantly inductive network with\nidentical inverters. The results indicate that while phase synchronization, in\naccordance with previous findings, produces losses that scale with a network's\nsize but only weakly depend on its connectivity, the losses associated with the\nvoltage control will be larger in a highly connected network than in a loosely\nconnected one. The typically higher rate of convergence in a highly\ninterconnected network thus comes at a cost of higher losses associated with\nthe power flows used to reach the steady state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2016 10:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-01"}

One\nmechanism for the stabilization of such structures was proposed by Pan, Vekilov\nand Lubchenko and was investigated using a DDFT model which confirmed the\nviability of the model. Here, we revisit that model and incorporate additional\nphysics in the form of state-dependent reaction rates.

The individual assessment comprises of an interview\nwith the researcher under evaluation, the elaboration of a bibliometric report\nof the researcher's publication output, the discussion and validation of the\nobtained results with the researcher under evaluation as well as further\noptional analyses. The produced bibliometric reports are provided to the\nresearchers themselves and inform them about the quantitative aspects of their\nresearch output. They also serve as a basis for further discussion concerning\ntheir publication strategies. These reports are eventually intended for\ninformed peer review practices, and are therefore forwarded to the quality\nassurance and the rector's office and finally sent to the peers.

The\nspeed of advance varies by a small factor for jet densities between 0.1 and\n0.0001 of the ambient density while the cocoon and cavity evolution change from\nnarrow pressure balanced to wide over-pressure as the ratio falls.

Recent work has shown that when the inputs are d-dimensional vectors\nof reals, n>=max(3f+1,(d+1)f+1) is tight to achieve exact Byzantine consensus\nin synchronous systems, and n>= (d+2)f+1 for approximate Byzantine consensus in\nasynchronous systems.\n  Due to the dependence of the lower bound on vector dimension d, the number of\nprocesses necessary becomes large when the vector dimension is large.

ATPase is\ncomposed of two rotary motors, F0 and F1, which generate the opposing rotation\nand compete for control of their shared central gamma-shaft. Here we present a\nself-consistent physical model of the F1 motor as a simplified two-state\nBrownian ratchet based on the asymmetry of torsional elastic energy of the\ncoiled-coil gamma-shaft. This stochastic model unifies the physical description\nof linear and rotary motors and explains the stepped unidirectional rotation of\nthe $\\gamma$-shaft, in agreement with the `binding-change' ideas of Boyer.\nSubstituting the model parameters, all independently known from recent\nexperiments, our model quantitatively reproduces the ATPase operation, e.g. the\n`no-load' angular velocity is ca. 400~rad/s anticlockwise at 4 mM ATP, in close\nagreement with experiment. Increasing the pmf torque exerted by F0 can slow,\nstop and overcome the torque generated by F1, switching from ATP hydrolysis to\nsynthesis at a very low value of `stall torque'. We discuss the matters of the\nmotor efficiency, which is very low if calculated from the useful mechanical\nwork it produces - but is quite high when the `useful outcome' is measured in\nthe number of H+ pushed against the chemical gradient in the F1 ATP-driven\noperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2016 12:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

Numerical models have\ncontributed significantly towards this understanding, and more recently,\nadjoint-based modelling has been employed to optimise the positioning of the\nturbines in an array in an automated way and improve on simple, regular\nman-made configurations. Adjoint-based optimisation of high-resolution and\nideally 3D transient models is generally a very computationally expensive\nproblem. As a result, existing work on the adjoint optimisation of tidal\nturbine placement has been mostly limited to steady-state simulations in which\nvery high, non-physical values of the background viscosity are required to\nensure that a steady-state solution exists. However, such compromises may\naffect the reliability of the modelled turbines, their wakes and interactions,\nand thus bring into question the validity of the computed optimal turbine\npositions. This work considers a suite of idealised simulations of flow past\ntidal turbine arrays in a 2D channel. It compares four regular array\nconfigurations, detailed by Divett et al. (2013), with the configuration found\nthrough adjoint optimisation in a steady-state, high-viscosity setup. The\noptimised configuration produces considerably more power. The same\nconfigurations are then used to produce a suite of transient simulations that\ndo not use constant high-viscosity, and instead use large eddy simulation (LES)\nto parameterise the resulting turbulent structures. It is shown that the LES\nsimulations produce less power than that predicted by the constant\nhigh-viscosity runs. Nevertheless, they still follow the same trends in the\npower curve throughout time, with optimised layouts continuing to perform\nsignificantly better than simplified configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2016 13:15:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-01"}

Due to amplification, filtering,\nquantization and internal noise sources physical measurement equipment in\ngeneral exhibits a nonlinear and random input-to-output behaviour. This usually\nmakes it impossible to accurately describe the underlying statistical system\nmodel. When the individual operations are all known and deterministic, one can\nresort to approximations of the input-to-output function. The problem becomes\nchallenging when the processing chain is not exactly known or contains\nnonlinear random effects. Then one has to approximate the output distribution\nin an empirical way. Here we show that by measuring the first two sample\nmoments of an arbitrary set of output transformations in a calibrated setup,\nthe output distribution of the actual system can be approximated by an\nequivalent exponential family distribution. This method has the property that\nthe resulting approximation of the statistical system model is guaranteed to be\npessimistic in an estimation theoretic sense. We show this by proving that an\nequivalent exponential family distribution in general exhibits a lower Fisher\ninformation measure than the original system model. With various examples and a\nmodel matching step we demonstrate how this estimation theoretic aspect can be\nexploited in practice in order to obtain a conservative measurement-driven\nquality assessment method for nonlinear measurement systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2016 14:17:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

This method is the first case of a\nsingle-stage, single-step method that is simultaneously high-order,\npositivity-preserving, and operates on unstructured meshes. Time-stepping is\naccomplished via the Lax-Wendroff approach, which is also sometimes called the\nCauchy-Kovalevskaya procedure, where temporal derivatives in a Taylor series in\ntime are exchanged for spatial derivatives. The Lax-Wendroff discontinuous\nGalerkin (LxW-DG) method developed in this work is formulated so that it looks\nlike a forward Euler update but with a high-order time-extrapolated flux. In\nparticular, the numerical flux used in this work is a linear combination of a\nlow-order positivity-preserving contribution and a high-order component that\ncan be damped to enforce positivity of the cell averages for the density and\npressure for each time step. In addition to this flux limiter, a moment limiter\nis applied that forces positivity of the solution at finitely many quadrature\npoints within each cell. The combination of the flux limiter and the moment\nlimiter guarantees positivity of the cell averages from one time-step to the\nnext. Finally, a simple shock capturing limiter that uses the same basic\ntechnology as the moment limiter is introduced in order to obtain\nnon-oscillatory results. The resulting scheme can be extended to arbitrary\norder without increasing the size of the effective stencil.

This paper contributes to the understanding of such complex and highly\ndynamic systems by proposing an open-source tool-chain to implement\nmulti-agent-based solutions in traffic and transportation. The proposed\napproach relies on two very popular tools in both domains, with focus on\ntraffic light control.

TraSMAPI (Traffic Simulation Manager Application Programming\nInterface) is used to combine JADE and SUMO allowing communication between\nthem. A demonstration of the concept is presented to illustrate the main\nfeatures of this tool-chain, using Q-Learning as the reinforcement learning\nmethod for each traffic light agent in a simulated network.

Topological insulators have bulk\nenergy gap and topologically protected gapless edge states. The edge states in\nelectronic systems have been detected by observing the transport properties the\nHgte quantum wells. The electromagnetic analogues of such electronic edge\nstates have been predicted and observed in photonic crystals, coupled\nresonators and linear circuits. However, the edge state spectrums of the two\ndimensional insulators and their electromagnetic analogues haven't been\ndirectly measured and thus the gaplessness of the edge states hasn't been\nexperimentally confirmed. Here I show the classical strings are more convenient\nchoice to study the topological phases than the electromagnetic waves. I found\nthat classical strings with periodic densities can simulate a variety of\ntopological phases in condensed matter physics including two dimensional\ntopological insulators, three dimensional topological semimetals and weak\ntopological insulators. Because the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the\nstrings can be easily measured, not only the gapless edge state spectrum but\nalso the bulk topological invariant can now be directly observed. Further more\nI show the topological phase transitions can be simulated by the strings. My\nresults show the richness of topological phases of mechanical waves. I\nanticipate my work to be a starting point to study the topological properties\nof mechanical waves. Even richer topological phases other than those have been\nfound in electronics systems can be explored when we use more general\nmechanical waves e.g. waves in membranes with periodic densities. These phases\nmay provide guides to hunt novel topological properties in other branches of\nscience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2016 13:38:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 02:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-03"}
