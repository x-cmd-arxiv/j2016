Although its behavior seems deceivingly simple, recent\nstudies showing passive superdiffusive transport suggest diffusion on surfaces\nmay hide rich complexities. In particular, bulk-mediated diffusion occurs when\nmolecules are transiently released from the surface to perform\nthree-dimensional excursions into the liquid bulk. This phenomenon bears the\ndichotomy where a molecule always return to the surface but the mean jump\nlength is infinite. Such behavior is associated with a breakdown of the central\nlimit theorem and weak ergodicity breaking. Here, we use single-particle\ntracking to study the statistics of bulk-mediated diffusion on a supported\nlipid bilayer. We find that the time-averaged mean square displacement (MSD) of\nindividual trajectories, the archetypal measure in diffusion processes, does\nnot converge to the ensemble MSD but it remains a random variable, even in the\nlong observation-time limit. The distribution of time averages is shown to\nagree with a L\\'{e}vy flight model. Our results also unravel intriguing\nanomalies in the statistics of displacements.

A wildcard $*$ is an\nunspecified bit in $q$ for which the query asks the membership for both cases\n$*=0$ and $*=1$. It is common that such partial-match queries with wildcards\nare issued in tries. With uniformly random occurrences of $w$ wildcards in $q$\nassumed, the obvious upper bound on the average number of traversal steps in\n$T$ is $2^w m$. We show that the average does not exceed \\[ \\frac{m+1}{w+1}\n\\left( 2^{w+2} - 2 w - 4 \\right) + m = O \\left( \\frac{2^w m}{w} \\right), \\] and\nequals the value exactly when $T$ includes all the $m$-bit keys as the worst\ncase. Here the query $q$ performs with the naive backtracking algorithm in $T$.\nIt is similarly shown that the average is $O \\left( \\frac{k^w m}{w} \\right)$ in\na general trie of maximum out-degree $k$. Our analysis for tries is extended to\na distributed hash table (DHT), which is among the most frequently used\ndecentralized data structures in networking. We show, under a natural\nprobabilistic assumption for the largest class of DHTs, that the average number\nof hops required by an $m$-bit query $q$ to a DHT $D$ with random $w$ wildcards\nmeets the same asymptotic bound. As a result, $q$ is answered with average $O\n\\left( \\frac{2^w m}{w} \\right)$ hops rather than $\\Theta \\left( 2^w m \\right)$\nin the four major DHTs Chord, Pastry, Tapestry and Kademlia. In addition, with\na uniform key distribution for sufficiently many entries, we prove that a\nlookup request to the DHT Chord is answered correctly with $O(m)$ hops and\nprobability $1 - 2^{-\\Omega (m)}$. To the author's knowledge, the probability\n$1 - 2^{-\\Omega (m)}$ of correct lookup in Chord has not been identified so\nfar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2016 21:35:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 22:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

We use the CANDELS\nnear-IR imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope to perform the bulge-to-disk\ndecomposition of distant galaxies and measure for the first time the slope of\nthe SFR-Mdisk relation at z=1. We find that this relation follows very closely\nthe shape of the SFR-M* correlation, still with a pronounced flattening at the\nhigh-mass end. This is clearly excluding, at least at z=1, the secular growth\nof quiescent bulges in star-forming galaxies as the main driver for the change\nof slope of the Main Sequence. Then, by stacking the Herschel data available in\nthe CANDELS field, we estimate the total gas mass and the star formation\nefficiency at different positions on the SFR-M* relation. We find that the\nrelatively low SFRs observed in massive galaxies (M* > 5e10 Msun) are caused by\na decreased star formation efficiency, by up to a factor of 3 as compared to\nlower stellar mass galaxies, and not by a reduced gas content. The trend at the\nlowest masses is likely linked to the dominance of atomic over molecular gas.\nWe argue that this stellar-mass-dependent SFE can explain the varying slope of\nthe Main Sequence since z=1.5, hence over 70% of the Hubble time. The drop of\nSFE occurs at lower masses in the local Universe (M* > 2e10 Msun) and is not\npresent at z=2. Altogether this provides evidence for a slow downfall of the\nstar formation efficiency in massive Main Sequence galaxies.

In this paper, we propose to deploy extra EH nodes as\nrelays over an existing non-EH network. Specifically, the considered non-EH\nnetwork consists of multiple source-destination (S-D) pairs. The deployed EH\nrelays will take turns to assist each S-D pair, and energy diversity can be\nachieved to combat the low EH rate of each EH relay.

First, they can\nbe used to constrain the history of cosmic acceleration and the evolution of\ndark energy in a redshift range hardly achievable by other cosmological probes.\nSecond, long GRBs are believed to be formed by collapse of massive stars.

What factors potentially affect the\nprobability of wining a game in NFL? How can a team come back from a\ndemoralizing interception? In this study we begin by examining the hypothesis\nof rational coaching, that is, coaching decisions are always rational with\nrespect to the maximization of the expected points scored. We reject this\nhypothesis by analyzing the decisions made in the past 7 NFL seasons for two\nparticular plays; (i) the Point(s) After Touchdown (PAT) and (ii) the fourth\ndown decisions. Having rejected the rational coaching hypothesis we move on to\nexamine how the detailed game data collected can potentially inform game-day\ndecisions. While NFL teams personnel definitely have an intuition on which\nfactors are crucial for winning a game, in this work we take a data-driven\napproach and provide quantifiable evidence using a large dataset of NFL games\nfor the 7-year period between 2009 and 2015. In particular, we use a logistic\nregression model to identify the impact and the corresponding statistical\nsignificance of factors such as possession time, number of penalty yards,\nbalance between passing and rushing offense etc. Our results clearly imply that\navoiding turnovers is the best strategy for winning a game but turnovers can be\novercome with letting the offense on the field for more time. Finally we\ncombine our descriptive model with statistical bootstrap in order to provide a\nprediction engine for upcoming NFL games.
