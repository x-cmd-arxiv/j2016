However,\nthese techniques are currently limited by low temporal resolution and long\nacquisition times. Super-resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI) is a\nfluorescence microscopy technique enabling sub-diffraction limit imaging with\nhigh temporal resolution by calculating high order statistics of the\nfluctuating optical signal. The aim of this work is to achieve fast acoustic\nimaging with enhanced resolution by applying the tools used in SOFI to\ncontrast-enhance ultrasound (CEUS) plane-wave scans. The proposed method was\ntested using numerical simulations and evaluated using two in-vivo rabbit\nmodels: scans of healthy kidneys and VX-2 tumor xenografts. Improved spatial\nresolution was observed with a reduction of up to 50% in the full width half\nmax of the point spread function. In addition, substantial reduction in the\nbackground level was achieved compared to standard mean amplitude persistence\nimages, revealing small vascular structures within tumors. The scan duration of\nthe proposed method is less than a second while current superlocalization\ntechniques require acquisition duration of several minutes. As a result, the\nproposed technique may be used to obtain scans with enhanced spatial resolution\nand high temporal resolution, facilitating flow-dynamics monitoring.

Similarly, a direct\ncross-correlation of the CFHTLenS data with Planck CMB lensing data yielded an\nanomalously low amplitude compared to expectations based on Planck or\nWMAP-derived cosmological parameters (Liu & Hill 2015). One potential\nexplanation for these results is a multiplicative bias afflicting the CFHTLenS\ngalaxy shape measurements, from which shears are inferred. Simulations are used\nin the CFHTLenS pipeline to calibrate such biases, but no data-driven\nconstraints have been presented to date. In this paper, we cross-correlate\nCFHTLenS galaxy density maps with CFHTLenS shear maps and Planck CMB lensing\nmaps to calibrate an additional multiplicative shear bias (m) in CFHTLenS\n(beyond the multiplicative correction that has already been applied to the\nCFHTLenS galaxy shears), following methods suggested by Vallinotto (2012) and\nDas et al.

This matches the expectation that the shapes of\nfaint galaxies are the most prone to measurement biases. Our results for m are\nessentially independent of the assumed cosmology, and only weakly sensitive to\nassumptions about the galaxy bias. We consider three galaxy bias models,\nfinding in all cases that the best-fit multiplicative shear bias is less than\nunity.

In this work, we present a\nnew scalable sparse direct solver called Basker. Basker introduces a new\nalgorithm to parallelize the Gilbert-Peierls algorithm for sparse LU\nfactorization. As architectures evolve, there exists a need for algorithms that\nare hierarchical in nature to match the hierarchy in thread teams, individual\nthreads, and vector level parallelism. Basker is designed to map well to this\nhierarchy in architectures. There is also a need for data layouts to match\nmultiple levels of hierarchy in memory. Basker uses a two-dimensional\nhierarchical structure of sparse matrices that maps to the hierarchy in the\nmemory architectures and to the hierarchy in parallelism. We present\nperformance evaluations of Basker on the Intel SandyBridge and Xeon Phi\nplatforms using circuit and power grid matrices taken from the University of\nFlorida sparse matrix collection and from Xyce circuit simulations. Basker\nachieves a geometric mean speedup of 5.91x on CPU (16 cores) and 7.4x on Xeon\nPhi (32 cores) relative to KLU. Basker outperforms Intel MKL Pardiso (PMKL) by\nas much as 53x on CPU (16 cores) and 13.3x on Xeon Phi (32 cores) for low\nfill-in circuit matrices.

The gravitational collapse of pebble clouds that formed\nthrough the streaming instability may provide a suitable mechanism for comet\nformation.\n  We study the collisional compression of cm-sized porous ice/dust-mixed\npebbles in collapsing pebble clouds. For this, we developed a collision model\nfor pebbles consisting of a mixture of ice and dust, characterised by their\ndust-to-ice mass ratio.

However the larger the\nseparation, the more difficult it is to produce a given magnetic field in the\nplasma region, so plasma configurations should be chosen that can be supported\nas efficiently as possible by distant coils. The efficiency of an\nexternally-generated magnetic field is a measure of the field's shaping\ncomponent magnitude at the plasma compared to the magnitude near the coils; the\nefficiency of a plasma equilibrium can be measured using the efficiency of the\nrequired external shaping field. Counterintuitively, plasma shapes with low\ncurvature and spectral width may have low efficiency, whereas plasma shapes\nwith sharp edges may have high efficiency. Two precise measures of magnetic\nfield efficiency, which correctly identify such differences in difficulty, will\nbe examined. These measures, which can be expressed as matrices, relate the\nexternally-produced normal magnetic field on the plasma surface to the either\nthe normal field or current on a distant control surface.

In future applications, they could be efficiently confined,\nenhanced and manipulated - well below the classical diffraction limit - through\nthe excitation of graphene plasmons (GPs). These possibilities emerge from the\nstrongly reduced GP wavelength, lp, compared to the photon wavelength, l0,\nwhich can be controlled by modulating the carrier density of graphene via\nelectrical gating. Recently, GPs in a graphene-insulator-metal configuration\nhave been predicted to exhibit a linear dispersion (thus called acoustic\nplasmons) and a further reduced wavelength, implying an improved field\nconfinement, analogous to plasmons in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs)\nnear conductive substrates. While infrared GPs have been visualised by\nscattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM), the real-space\nimaging of strongly confined THz plasmons in graphene and 2DEGs has been\nelusive so far - only GPs with nearly free-space wavelength have been observed.\nHere we demonstrate real-space imaging of acoustic THz plasmons in a graphene\nphotodetector with split-gate architecture. To that end, we introduce\nnanoscale-resolved THz photocurrent near-field microscopy, where near-field\nexcited GPs are detected thermoelectrically rather than optically. The on-chip\nGP detection simplifies GP imaging, as sophisticated s-SNOM detection schemes\ncan be avoided. The photocurrent images reveal strongly reduced GP wavelengths\n(lp = l0/66), a linear dispersion resulting from the coupling of GPs with the\nmetal gate below the graphene, and that plasmon damping at positive carrier\ndensities is dominated by Coulomb impurity scattering. Acoustic GPs could thus\nstrongly benefit the development of deep subwavelength-scale THz devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2016 19:01:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2016 11:45:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 11:17:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 11:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-16"}

The method is based on the theory of\nmargins for boosting. Our method performs comparably to or outperforms previous\nalgorithms in the fairness literature in terms of accuracy and low\ndiscrimination, while simultaneously allowing for a fast and transparent\nquantification of the trade-off between bias and error.\n  Our second contribution addresses the shortcomings of the bias-error\ntrade-off studied in most of the algorithmic fairness literature. We\ndemonstrate that even hopelessly naive modifications of a biased algorithm,\nwhich cannot be reasonably said to be fair, can still achieve low bias and high\naccuracy. To help to distinguish between these naive algorithms and more\nsensible algorithms we propose a new measure of fairness, called resilience to\nrandom bias (RRB). We demonstrate that RRB distinguishes well between our naive\nand sensible fairness algorithms.

Including such correlations\ndrastically reduces the size of the training set needed, accounts for\ntime-lagged relationships, and enables downscaling even in the presence of\nshort gaps in the auxiliary data. The algorithm is based upon bagged regression\ntrees (BRT) and uses correlations between high-resolution remote sensing\nproducts and SM observations. The algorithm trains multiple regression trees\nand automatically chooses the trees that generate the best downscaled\nestimates. The algorithm was evaluated using a multi-scale synthetic dataset in\nnorth central Florida for two years, including two growing seasons of corn and\none growing season of cotton per year. The time-averaged error across the\nregion was found to be 0.01 $\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{m}^3$, with a standard\ndeviation of 0.012 $\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{m}^3$ when 0.02% of the data were used\nfor training in addition to temporal correlations from the past seven days, and\nall available data from the past year.

We believe\nthat our MTR unifying principle could shed new light on sign-problem-free QMC\nsimulation on strongly correlated systems and interacting topological matters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2016 20:50:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 13:16:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2016 11:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-26"}

In this talk we will present new tests of NRQCD\ninvolving the distribution of quarkonia within jets. The distribution of\nhadrons within jets is determined by nonperturbative functions called\nfragmenting jet functions (FJFs). FJFs are convolutions of fragmentation\nfunctions, evolved to the jet energy scale, with perturbatively calculable\nmatching coefficients.

We use mock data from isolated dwarf galaxy simulations to show that\nthis owes to three main effects. Firstly, stellar feedback heats dark matter,\nleading to a 'coreNFW' dark matter density profile with a slowly rising\nrotation curve. Secondly, if close to a recent starburst, large HI bubbles push\nthe rotation curve out of equilibrium, deforming the rotation curve shape.\nThirdly, when galaxies are viewed near face-on, their best fit inclination is\nbiased high. This can lead to a very shallow rotation curve that falsely\nimplies a large dark matter core. All three problems can be avoided, however,\nby a combination of improved mass models and a careful selection of target\ngalaxies. Fitting our coreNFW model to mock rotation curve data, we show that\nwe can recover the rotation curve shape, dark matter halo mass $M_{200}$ and\nconcentration parameter $c$ within our quoted uncertainties.\n  We fit our coreNFW model to real data for four isolated dwarf irregulars,\nchosen to span a wide range of rotation curve shapes. We obtain an excellent\nfit for NGC 6822 and WLM, with tight constraints on $M_{200}$, and $c$\nconsistent with $\\Lambda$CDM. However, IC 1613 and DDO 101 give a poor fit. For\nIC 1613, we show that this owes to disequilibria and its uncertain inclination\n$i$; for DDO 101, it owes to its uncertain distance $D$.

We verify the full\nbandwidth continuum imaging performance and stability of the system via\nself-consistency checks and comparisons to existing radio data. The combined\nthree epoch image has arcminute resolution and a 1-sigma thermal noise level of\n375 micro-Jy per beam, although the effective noise is a factor 3 higher due to\nresidual sidelobe confusion.

However, the computation of a good\npreconditioner can be expensive. So, while solving a sequence of many linear\nsystems, it is advantageous to recycle preconditioners, that is, update a\nprevious preconditioner and reuse the updated version. In this paper, we\nintroduce a simple and effective method for doing this. Although our approach\ncan be used for matrices changing slowly in any way, we focus on the important\ncase of sequences of the type $(s_k\\textbf{E}(\\textbf{p}) +\n\\textbf{A}(\\textbf{p}))\\textbf{x}_k = \\textbf{b}_k$, where the right hand side\nmay or may not change. More general changes in matrices will be discussed in a\nfuture paper. We update preconditioners by defining a map from a new matrix to\na previous matrix, for example the first matrix in the sequence, and combine\nthe preconditioner for this previous matrix with the map to define the new\npreconditioner. This approach has several advantages. The update is entirely\nindependent from the original preconditioner, so it can be applied to any\npreconditioner. The possibly high cost of an initial preconditioner can be\namortized over many linear solves. The cost of updating the preconditioner is\nmore or less constant and independent of the original preconditioner. There is\nflexibility in balancing the quality of the map with the computational cost. In\nthe numerical experiments section we demonstrate good results for several\napplications, in particular when using an algebraic multigrid preconditioner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2016 06:05:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 15:07:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 02:12:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 16:31:09 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 05:32:32 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 23:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-21"}

In this setting we show that while global strategies with\nmulti-mode entanglement can lead to high precision gains, the same precision\nenhancements can be obtained with mode-separable states and local measurements.\nThe crucial resource for quantum enhancement is shown to be a large number\nvariance in the probe state, which can be obtained without any entanglement\nbetween the modes. This has important practical implications because local\nstrategies using separable states have many advantages over global schemes\nusing multi-mode-entangled states. Such advantages include a robustness to\nlocal estimation failure, more flexibility in the distribution of resources,\nand comparatively easier state preparation. We obtain our results by analyzing\ntwo different schemes: the first uses a set of interferometers, which can be\nused as a model for a network of quantum sensors, and the second looks at\nmeasuring a number of phases relative to a reference, which is concerned\nprimarily with quantum imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2016 09:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

It is likely that\nsuch distributions, were we indeed able to calculate them unambiguously, will\nassign low probabilities to any such experimental measurements. An alternative\nto thereby rejecting these theories, is to conditionalize the distributions\ninvolved by restricting attention to domains of the multiverse in which we\nmight arise. In order to elicit a crisp prediction, however, one needs to make\na further assumption about how typical we are of the chosen domains. In this\npaper, we investigate interactions between the spectra of available assumptions\nregarding both conditionalization and typicality, and draw out the effects of\nthese interactions in a concrete setting; namely, on predictions of the total\nnumber of species that contribute significantly to dark matter. In particular,\nfor each conditionalization scheme studied, we analyze how correlations between\ndensities of different dark matter species affect the prediction, and explicate\nthe effects of assumptions regarding typicality. We find that the effects of\ncorrelations can depend on the conditionalization scheme, and that in each case\natypicality can significantly change the prediction. In doing so, we\ndemonstrate the existence of overlaps in the predictions of different\n\"frameworks\" consisting of conjunctions of theory, conditionalization scheme\nand typicality assumption. This conclusion highlights the acute challenges\ninvolved in using such tests to identify a preferred framework that aims to\ndescribe our observational situation in a multiverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2016 10:10:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-08"}

We present new spectra of SN 2014dt, resulting in the most complete\npublished late-time spectral sequence of a SN Iax. At late times, SNe Iax have\ngenerally similar spectra, all with a similar continuum shape and strong\nforbidden-line emission. However, there is also significant diversity where\nsome late-time SN Iax spectra display narrow P-Cygni features and a continuum\nindicative of a photosphere in addition to strong narrow forbidden lines, while\nothers have no obvious P-Cygni features, strong broad forbidden lines, and weak\nnarrow forbidden lines. Finally, some SNe Iax have spectra intermediate to\nthese two varieties with weak P-Cygni features and broad/narrow forbidden lines\nof similar strength. We find that SNe Iax with strong broad forbidden lines\nalso tend to be more luminous and have higher-velocity ejecta at peak\nbrightness. We estimate blackbody and kinematic radii of the late-time\nphotosphere, finding the latter an order of magnitude larger than the former.\nWe propose a two-component model that solves this discrepancy and explains the\ndiversity of the late-time spectra of SNe Iax.

The work presented here also corroborates that\nfor tip_sample separation lower than 200 nm, the parallel plate_capacitor\napproximation is not very appropriate to describe the tip_substrate capacitive\ninteraction, but an intermediate approximation between a sphere_plane and a\ncone_plane geometry seems to be more appropriate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2016 12:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-25"}

Introduced as an alternative to the\nFinite Element (FE) method, they are based on fixed-point solutions of the\nLippmann-Schwinger type integral equation. Their computational efficiency\nresults from handling the kernel of this equation by the Fast Fourier Transform\n(FFT). However, the kernel is derived from an auxiliary homogeneous linear\nproblem, which renders the extension of FFT-based schemes to non-linear\nproblems conceptually difficult. This paper aims to establish a link between\nFE- and FFT-based methods, in order to develop a solver applicable to general\nhistory- and time-dependent material models. For this purpose, we follow the\nstandard steps of the FE method, starting from the weak form, proceeding to the\nGalerkin discretization and the numerical quadrature, up to the solution of\nnon-linear equilibrium equations by an iterative Newton-Krylov solver. No\nauxiliary linear problem is thus needed. By analyzing a two-phase laminate with\nnon-linear elastic, elasto-plastic, and visco-plastic phases, and by\nelasto-plastic simulations of a dual-phase steel microstructure, we demonstrate\nthat the solver exhibits robust convergence. These results are achieved by\nre-using the non-linear FE technology, with the potential of further extensions\nbeyond small-strain inelasticity considered in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2016 12:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-01"}

AGN selection in these energy ranges often suffers from\nidentification and redshift incompleteness and, at the same time, photoelectric\nabsorption can obscure a significant amount of the X-ray radiation.

The as-cast structures do not contain any\nlocal chemical order, but the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy\n(HRTEM) studies reveal their locally distorted lattice. The local lattice\ndistortion of the average structure in their as-cast and annealed state is\nquantified by refining atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) from\nsingle-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) and powder neutron diffraction (ND)\nstudies. The static component of the ADPs appears to dominate over the thermal\nADP, suggesting a high degree of local lattice distortion in the HEAs. The\nlattice distortions cause solid-solution like strengthening, which increases\nthe hardness of the HEAs by a factor of 2-3 compared to the rule of mixture.\nThe SRCs that form in the annealed HEAs have a planar profile perpendicular to\nthe <1 0 0> directions.

The presence\nof SRCs locally reduces the lattice potential energy of the structure and puts\nadditional energy barrier to the movement of dislocations.

Remarkably, the proof does not\nrely on specific properties of RM codes, apart from their symmetry. Indeed, the\nmain technical result consists in showing that any sequence of linear codes,\nwith doubly-transitive permutation groups, achieves capacity on the memoryless\nerasure channel under bit-MAP decoding. Thus, a natural question is what\nhappens under block-MAP decoding. In [1], [2], by exploiting further symmetries\nof the code, the bit-MAP threshold was shown to be sharp enough so that the\nblock erasure probability also converges to 0. However, this technique relies\nheavily on the fact that the transmission is over an erasure channel.\n  We present an alternative approach to strengthen results regarding the\nbit-MAP threshold to block-MAP thresholds. This approach is based on a careful\nanalysis of the weight distribution of RM codes. In particular, the flavor of\nthe main result is the following: assume that the bit-MAP error probability\ndecays as $N^{-\\delta}$, for some $\\delta>0$.

Estimates of R_0 were then used to project\nthe likelihood for large outbreak sizes, e.g., exceeding hundreds of thousands\nof cases. Yet fitting deterministic models can lead to over-confidence in the\nconfidence intervals of the fitted R_0, and, in turn, the type and scope of\nnecessary interventions. In this manuscript we propose a hybrid\nstochastic-deterministic method to estimate R_0 and associated confidence\nintervals (CIs). The core idea is that stochastic realizations of an underlying\ndeterministic model can be used to evaluate the compatibility of candidate\nvalues of R_0 with observed epidemic curves. The compatibility is based on\ncomparing the distribution of expected epidemic growth rates with the observed\nepidemic growth rate given \"process noise\", i.e., arising due to stochastic\ntransmission, recovery and death events. By applying our method to reported EVD\ncase counts from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, we show that prior estimates\nof R_0 based on deterministic fits appear to be more confident than analysis of\nstochastic trajectories suggests should be possible. Moving forward, we\nrecommend including a hybrid stochastic-deterministic fitting procedure when\nquantifying the full R_0 CI at the onset of an epidemic due to multiple sources\nof noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2016 21:04:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

The organic materials in primitive\nsolar system bodies have generally higher D/H ratios and show greater D/H\nvariation when compared to D/H in solar system water. We propose this\ndifference arises at least in part due to 1) the availability of additional\nchemical fractionation pathways for organics beyond that for water, and 2) the\nhigher volatility of key carbon reservoirs compared to oxygen. We test this\nhypothesis using detailed disk models, including a sophisticated, new disk\nionization treatment with a low cosmic ray ionization rate, and find that disk\nchemistry leads to higher deuterium enrichment in organics compared to water,\nhelped especially by fractionation via the precursors CH$_2$D$^+$/CH$_3^+$. We\nalso find that the D/H ratio in individual species varies significantly\ndepending on their particular formation pathways. For example, from $\\sim20-40$\nAU, CH$_4$ can reach $\\rm{D/H\\sim2\\times10^{-3}}$, while D/H in CH$_3$OH\nremains locally unaltered. Finally, while the global organic D/H in our models\ncan reproduce intermediately elevated D/H in the bulk hydrocarbon reservoir,\nour models are unable to reproduce the most deuterium-enriched organic\nmaterials in the solar system, and thus our model requires some inheritance\nfrom the cold interstellar medium from which the Sun formed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2016 21:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

A new sampling algorithm is proposed for\noutputs which does not lead to accumulation of sampling times and results in\nasymptotic stabilization of the system. The approach for output sampling is\nbased on defining an event function that compares the difference between the\ncurrent output and the most recently transmitted output sample not only with\nthe current value of the output, but also takes into account a certain number\nof previously transmitted output samples. This allows us to reconstruct the\nstate using an observer with sample-and-hold measurements. The estimated states\nare used to generate a control input, which is subjected to a different\nevent-triggered sampling routine; hence the sampling times of inputs and\noutputs are asynchronous. Using Lyapunov-based approach, we prove the\nasymptotic stabilization of the closed-loop system and show that there exists a\nminimum inter-sampling time for control inputs and for outputs. To show that\nthese sampling routines are robust with respect to transmission errors, only\nthe quantized (in space) values of outputs and inputs are transmitted to the\ncontroller and the plant, respectively.
