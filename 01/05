Two metrics,\nbroadcast score and receive score, were introduced to measure the centrality of\na node with respect to a model of contagion based on time-respecting walks.\nThis article examines the temporal and structural factors influencing these\nmetrics by considering a versatile stochastic temporal network model. We\nanalytically derive formulae to accurately predict the expectation of the\nbroadcast and receive scores when one or more columns in a temporal edge-list\nare shuffled. These methods are then applied to two publicly available\ndata-sets and we quantify how much the centrality of each individual depends on\nstructural or temporal influences. From our analysis we highlight two practical\ncontributions: a way to control for temporal variation when computing dynamic\ncommunicability, and the conclusion that the broadcast and receive scores can,\nunder a range of circumstances, be replaced by the row and column sums of the\nmatrix exponential of a weighted adjacency matrix given by the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 17:00:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Jul 2016 23:24:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 04:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-29"}

The\npacket delay includes the queue waiting time and the service time.

The problem is formulated as an optimal stopping rule\nproblem where there is a tradeoff between the service time and the throughput.\nThis tradeoff results from skipping low-quality channels to seek the\npossibility of finding high-quality ones in the future at the expense of a\nhigher probability of being blocked from transmission since these future\nchannels might be busy.\n  On the other hand, the queue waiting time is studied by considering a\nmulti-user single channel system. Specifically, we study the effect of\nscheduling and power allocation on the delay performance of all SUs in the\nsystem. We propose a delay optimal algorithm that protects the PUs from harmful\ninterference and provides the required delay guarantees to users. Conventional\nscheduling algorithms do not provide such guarantees if the interference\nchannels are heterogeneous. This is because they are developed for conventional\nnon-CR wireless systems that neglect interference since channels are\northogonal.\n  Finally, we present two potential extensions to these studied problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 19:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-05"}

The advantages of this\nnew deflation is that it does not introduce new variables and the increase in\nthe number of equations is linear in each iteration instead of the quadratic\nincrease of previous methods. The second construction gives the coefficients of\nthe so-called inverse system or dual basis, which defines the multiplicity\nstructure at the singular root.

Typically, the evolution\nis assumed to proceed in isolation, even in dense stellar environments such as\nstar clusters. In this paper, we test the validity of this assumption via the\nanalysis of a large grid of binary evolution models simulated with the SeBa\ncode. For every binary, we calculate analytically the mean time until another\nsingle or binary star comes within the mean separation of the mass-transferring\nbinary, and compare this time-scale to the mean time for stable mass transfer\nto occur. We then derive the probability for each respective binary to\nexperience a direct dynamical interruption. The resulting probability\ndistribution can be integrated to give an estimate for the fraction of binaries\nundergoing mass transfer that are expected to be disrupted as a function of the\nhost cluster properties. We find that for lower-mass clusters ($\\lesssim 10^4$\nM$_{\\odot}$), on the order of a few to a few tens of percent of binaries\nundergoing mass-transfer are expected to be interrupted by an interloping\nsingle, or more often binary, star, over the course of the cluster lifetime,\nwhereas in more massive globular clusters we expect $\\ll$ 1% to be interrupted.\nFurthermore, using numerical scattering experiments performed with the FEWBODY\ncode, we show that the probability of interruption increases if perturbative\nfly-bys are considered as well, by a factor $\\sim 2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 21:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

Substantial\noutflows are generated if the one-dimensional horizontal velocity dispersion\nexceeds $\\approx 35\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}},$ as occurs in the dense disks that have\nstar formation rate densities above $\\approx 0.1\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot\\,{\\rm\nyr}^{-1}\\,{\\rm kpc}^{-2}.$ These outflows are triggered by a thermal runaway,\narising from the inefficient cooling of hot material coupled with successive\nheating from turbulent driving. Thus, even in the absence of stellar feedback,\na critical value of the star-formation rate density for outflow generation can\narise due to a turbulent heating instability. This suggests that in strongly\nself-gravitating disks, outflows may be enhanced by, but need not caused by,\nenergy input from supernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 21:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

In recent years, many cognitive\nmodels have focused on dual process theories to better describe and implement\ncomplex cognitive skills in artificial agents, but creativity has been\napproached only at a descriptive level. In previous works we have described\nvarious modules of the cognitive architecture that allows a robot to execute\ncreative paintings.

These creative acts exploit both\nthe LTM and the WM in order to make novel substitutions to a perceived image by\nproperly mixing parts of pictures coming from different domains. The paper\nhighlights the role of the interaction between S1 and S2 processes, modulated\nby the resolution level, which focuses the attention of the creative agent by\nbroadening or narrowing the exploration of novel solutions, or even drawing the\nsolution from a set of already made associations.

In a sense, QM therefore\nhas the character of a metaphysical theory. Consequently, if it is possible to\nderive QM from more basic principles, these principles should be of general,\nphilosophical nature. Here, we derive the formalism of QM from well-motivated\nepistemic principles. A key assumption is that a physical theory that relies on\nentities or distinctions that are unknowable in principle gives rise to wrong\npredictions. First, an epistemic formalism is developed, using concepts like\nknowledge and potential knowledge, identifying a physical state $S$ with the\npotential knowledge of the physical world. It is demonstrated that QM emerges\nfrom this formalism. However, Hilbert spaces, wave functions and probabilities\nare defined in certain well-defined observational contexts only. This means\nthat the epistemic formalism is broader than QM. In the fundamental layer of\ndescription, the physical state $S$ is a subset of a state space\n$\\mathcal{S}=\\{Z\\}$, such that $S$ always contains many elements $Z$. These\nelements correspond to unattainable states of complete knowledge of the world.\nThe evolution of $S$ cannot be determined in terms of the individual evolution\nof the elements $Z$, unlike the evolution of an ensemble in classical phase\nspace. The evolution of $S$ is described in terms of sequential time $n\\in\n\\mathbf{\\mathbb{N}}$, which is updated according to $n\\rightarrow n+1$ each\ntime an event occurs, each time potential knowledge changes. Sequential time\n$n$ can be separated from relational time $t$, which describes distances\nbetween events in space-time. There is an entire space-time associated with\neach $n$, in which $t$ represents the knowledge at sequential time $n$ about\nthe temporal relations between present and past events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2016 21:59:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2016 14:28:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 11:46:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-02"}

Some estimations of\nconcentration of stationary measures of the Fokker-Planck equation in the\nvicinity of the global attractor are presented. Relationship between\ndifferential entropy of stationary measures and dimension of the global\nattractor is also given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 02:12:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2016 04:05:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-13"}

To identify the practical\nlimits of causal inference under CCM, we simulated the dynamics of two pathogen\nstrains with varying interaction strengths. The original method of CCM is\nextremely sensitive to periodic fluctuations, inferring interactions between\nindependent strains that oscillate with similar frequencies. This sensitivity\nvanishes with alternative criteria for inferring causality. However, CCM\nremains sensitive to high levels of process noise and changes to the\ndeterministic attractor. This sensitivity is problematic because it remains\nchallenging to gauge noise and dynamical changes in natural systems, including\nthe quality of reconstructed attractors that underlie cross-mapping.

We derive a number of scaling laws\nthat characterize the accuracy of such dendrites in detecting activation\npatterns in a neuronal population under adverse conditions.

Using momentum theory, we propose and model the\nexistence of a horizontal force along with its associated power.

The formalism allows us to\ncalculate the spectrum when the Floquet states and quasienergies are\nanalytically or numerically solved for simple or complicated driving fields. We\ncan systematically explore the spectral features by implementing the present\nformalism. To exemplify this theory, we apply the unified formalism to\ncomprehensively study a generic model that a harmonically driven TLS is\nsimultaneously coupled to a radiative reservoir and a dephasing reservoir. We\ndemonstrate that the significant features of the fluorescence spectra, the\ndriving-induced asymmetry and the dephasing-induced asymmetry, can be\nattributed to the violation of detailed balance condition, and explained in\nterms of the driving-related transition quantities between Floquet-states and\ntheir steady populations. In addition, we find the distinguished features of\nthe fluorescence spectra under the biharmonic and multiharmonic driving fields\nin contrast with that of the harmonic driving case. In the case of the\nbiharmonic driving, we find that the spectra is significantly different from\nthe result of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) under the multiple\nresonance conditions.

In this thesis I focus on\nand propose solutions to two cases: independent data-local file system, and\nshared data-parallel file system.\n  In the independent data-local file system case, resource contention occurs\nunder certain conditions in Cassandra and HBase, two state-of-the-art NoSQL\nstores, causing performance degradation for one tenant by another. We\ninvestigate the interference and propose two approaches. The first provides a\nscheduling scheme that can approximate resource consumption, adapt to workload\ndynamics and work in a distributed fashion. The second introduces a\nworkload-aware resource reservation approach to prevent interference. The\napproach relies on a performance model obtained offline and plans the\nreservation according to different workload resource demands. Results show the\napproaches together can prevent interference and adapt to dynamic workloads\nunder multi-tenancy.\n  In the shared data-parallel file system case, it has been shown that running\na distributed NoSQL store over PFS for shared data across tenants is not cost\neffective. Overheads are introduced due to the unawareness of the NoSQL store\nof PFS. This dissertation targets the key-value store (KVS), a specific form of\nNoSQL stores, and proposes a lightweight KVS over a parallel file system to\nimprove efficiency.

We propose a coactive online learning\nframework for teaching preferences in contextually rich environments. The key\nnovelty of our approach lies in the type of feedback expected from the user:\nthe human user does not need to demonstrate optimal trajectories as training\ndata, but merely needs to iteratively provide trajectories that slightly\nimprove over the trajectory currently proposed by the system. We argue that\nthis coactive preference feedback can be more easily elicited than\ndemonstrations of optimal trajectories.

An ordered sequence of middleboxes composing a logical service is\ncalled service chain. Service Function Chaining (SFC) enables us to define\nthese service chains. Recent optimization models of SFCs assume that the\nfunctionality of a middlebox is provided by a single software appliance,\ncommonly known as Virtual Network Function (VNF). This assumption limits SFCs\nto the throughput of an individual VNF and resources of a physical machine\nhosting the VNF instance. Moreover, typical service providers offer VNFs with\nheterogeneous throughput and resource configurations. Thus, deploying a service\nchain with custom throughput can become a tedious process of stitching\nheterogeneous VNF instances. In this paper, we describe how we can overcome\nthese limitations without worrying about underlying VNF configurations and\nresource constraints. This prospect is achieved by distributed deploying\nmultiple VNF instances providing the functionality of a middlebox and modeling\nthe optimal deployment of a service chain as a mixed integer programming\nproblem. The proposed model optimizes host and bandwidth resources allocation,\nand determines the optimal placement of VNF instances, while balancing workload\nand routing traffic among these VNF instances. We show that this problem is\nNP-Hard and propose a heuristic solution called Kariz. Kariz utilizes a tuning\nparameter to control the trade-off between speed and accuracy of the solution.\nFinally, our solution is evaluated using simulations in data-center networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 07:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-03"}

In our previous works, the\neffectiveness of the proposed scheme was validated theoretically and also\nempirically by using just a spectrum analyzer to measure the received power. In\nthis paper, we develop low-energy battery-less sensor nodes whose consumed\npower and required received power for activation are respectively 142 uW and\n400 uW. In addition, we conduct indoor experiments in which the received power\nand activation of battery-less sensor node are simultaneously observed by using\nthe developed battery-less sensor node and a spectrum analyzer. The results\nshow that the coverage of single-point and multi-point wireless energy\ntransmission without carrier shift diversity are, respectively, 84.4% and\n83.7%, while the coverage of the proposed scheme is 100%. It can be concluded\nthat the effectiveness of the proposed scheme can be verified by our\nexperiments using real battery-less sensor nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 10:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-06"}

Subsequent calculations using 1D latitudinal climate models\nindicated that the combined effect of eclipses and ice-albedo feedback can\nproduce an outer edge to the circumplanetary habitable zone.

Furthermore, we discuss whether the illumination-induced\nexcitability gradient due to Lambert-Beer's law as well as a possible\ninclination of the filament plane with respect to the no-flux boundary can\ndestabilize the scroll ring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 14:54:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-06"}

The existence of a significant population of Ap stars with very long\nrotation periods (up to several hundred years) has progressively emerged over\nthe past two decades.

We determine the rotation period of the slowly rotating Ap star HD\n18078 and we derive constraints on the geometrical structure of its magnetic\nfield.\n  Methods. We combine measurements of the mean magnetic field modulus obtained\nfrom 1990 to 1997 with determinations of the mean longitudinal magnetic field\nspanning the 1999-2007 time interval to derive an unambiguous value of the\nrotation period. We show that this value is consistent with photometric\nvariations recorded in the Stroemgren uvby photometric system between 1995 and\n2004.

The exact nature of the\nprogenitors and the relative importance of these processes are still open\nquestions. One relatively unexplored method to constrain the progenitors is to\nsearch for high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXB) at SN locations in pre-explosion\nX-ray observations. In a HMXB, one star has already exploded as a core-collapse\nSN, producing a neutron star or a stellar-mass black hole. It is likely that\nthe second star in the system will also explode as a supernova, which should\ncause a detectable long-term change in the system's X-ray luminosity. In\nparticular, a pre-explosion detection of a HMXB coincident with a SN could be\ninformative about the progenitor's nature. In this paper we analyze\npre-explosion ACIS observations of 18 nearby type Ib, Ic and IIb supernovae\nfrom the Chandra X-ray observatory public archive. Two sources that could\npotentially be associated with the supernova are identified in the sample.\nAdditionally we make similar post-explosion measurements for 46 SNe. Although\nour modelling indicates that progenitor systems with compact binary companions\nare probably quite rare, studies of this type can in the future provide more\nstringent constraints as the number of discovered nearby SNe and suitable\npre-explosion X-ray data are both increasing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 15:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-03"}

In contrast with many existing works on energy-efficient power control,\nwhich ignore the possible presence of a queue at the transmitter, we consider a\nnew generalized cross-layer EE metric. This approach is relevant when the\ntransmitters have a non-zero energy cost even when the radiated power is zero\nand takes into account the presence of a finite packet buffer and packet\narrival at the transmitter. As the Nash equilibrium (NE) is an\nenergy-inefficient solution, the present work aims at overcoming this deficit\nby improving the global energy-efficiency. Indeed, as the considered system has\nmultiple agencies each with their own interest, the performance metric\nreflecting the individual interest of each decision maker is the global\nenergy-efficiency defined then as the sum over individual energy-efficiencies.\nRepeated games (RG) are investigated through the study of two dynamic games\n(finite RG and discounted RG), whose equilibrium is defined when introducing a\nnew operating point (OP), Pareto-dominating the NE and relying only on\nindividual channel state information (CSI). Accordingly, closed-form\nexpressions of the minimum number of stages of the game for finite RG (FRG) and\nthe maximum discount factor of the discounted RG (DRG) were established. The\ncross-layer model in the RG formulation leads to achieving a shorter minimum\nnumber of stages in the FRG even for higher number of users. In addition, the\nsocial welfare (sum of utilities) in the DRG decreases slightly with the\ncross-layer model when the number of users increases while it is reduced\nconsiderably with the Goodman model. Finally, we show that in real systems with\nrandom packet arrivals, the cross-layer power control algorithm outperforms the\nGoodman algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2016 15:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-06"}
