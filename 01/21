The former is typically regarded as the capacity of a community to\nreturn to an original equilibrium state after a perturbation in species\nabundances, and is usually linked to the strength of interspecific\ninteractions. The latter is the capacity to sustain positive abundances on all\nits constituent species, and is linked to both interspecific interactions and\nspecies demographic characteristics. Over the last 40 years, theoretical\nresearch in ecology has emphasized the search for conditions leading to the\ndynamical stability of ecological communities, while the conditions leading to\nfeasibility have been overlooked. However, thus far, we have no evidence of\nwhether species interactions are more conditioned by the community's need to be\nstable or feasible. Here, we introduce novel quantitative methods and use\nempirical data to investigate the consequences of species interactions on the\ndynamical stability and feasibility of mutualistic communities. First, we\ndemonstrate that the more nested the species interactions in a community are,\nthe lower the mutualistic strength that the community can tolerate without\nlosing dynamical stability. Second, we show that high feasibility in a\ncommunity can be reached either with high mutualistic strength or with highly\nnested species interactions. Third, we find that during the assembly process of\na seasonal pollinator community located at The Zackenberg Research Station (NE\nGreenland), a high feasibility is reached through the nested species\ninteractions established between newcomer and resident species. Our findings\nimply that nested mutualistic communities promote feasibility over stability,\nwhich may suggest that the former can be key for community persistence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 17:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-21"}

Reliable GW\nmodels are central to detection of such systems and subsequent parameter\nestimation. This paper performs a comprehensive analysis of the accuracy of\nrecent waveform models for binary black holes with aligned spins, utilizing a\nnew set of $84$ high-accuracy numerical relativity simulations. Our analysis\ncovers comparable mass binaries ($1\\le m_1/m_2\\le 3$), and samples\nindependently both black hole spins up to dimensionless spin-magnitude of $0.9$\nfor equal-mass binaries and $0.85$ for unequal mass binaries. Furthermore, we\nfocus on the high-mass regime (total mass $\\gtrsim 50M_\\odot$). The two most\nrecent waveform models considered (PhenomD and SEOBNRv2) both perform very well\nfor signal detection, losing less than 0.5\\% of the recoverable signal-to-noise\nratio $\\rho$, except that SEOBNRv2's efficiency drops mildly for both black\nhole spins aligned with large magnitude. For parameter estimation, modeling\ninaccuracies of SEOBNRv2 are found to be smaller than systematic uncertainties\nfor moderately strong GW events up to roughly $\\rho\\lesssim 15$. PhenomD's\nmodeling errors are found to be smaller than SEOBNRv2's, and are generally\nirrelevant for $\\rho\\lesssim 20$. Both models' accuracy deteriorates with\nincreased mass-ratio, and when at least one black hole spin is large and\naligned. The SEOBNRv2 model shows a pronounced disagreement with the numerical\nrelativity simulation in the merger phase, for unequal masses and\nsimultaneously both black hole spins very large and aligned. Two older waveform\nmodels (PhenomC and SEOBNRv1) are found to be distinctly less accurate than the\nmore recent PhenomD and SEOBNRv2 models. Finally, we quantify the bias expected\nfrom all GW models during parameter estimation for recovery of binary's masses\nand spins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 20:11:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2016 21:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

We investigate potential impacts of the new\nSunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations (SILSO) sunspot-number time\nseries on model reconstructions of TSI. In contemporary TSI records, variations\non time scales longer than about a day are dominated by the opposing effects of\nsunspot darkening and facular brightening. These two surface magnetic features,\nretrieved either from direct observations or from solar activity proxies, are\ncombined in TSI models to reproduce the current TSI observational record.\nIndices that manifest solar-surface magnetic activity, in particular the\nsunspot-number record, then enable the reconstruction of historical TSI.\nRevisions to the sunspot-number record therefore affect the magnitude and\ntemporal structure of TSI variability on centennial time scales according to\nthe model reconstruction methodologies. We estimate the effects of the new\nSILSO record on two widely used TSI reconstructions, namely the NRLTSI2 and the\nSATIRE models. We find that the SILSO record has little effect on either model\nafter 1885 but leads to greater amplitude solar-cycle fluctuations in TSI\nreconstructions prior, suggesting many 18th and 19th century cycles could be\nsimilar in amplitude to those of the current Modern Maximum.

One way to solve this\nproblem is to evaluate all possible feature subsets. However, evaluating all\npossible feature subsets is an exhaustive search and thus it has high\ncomputational complexity. Until now many heuristic algorithms have been studied\nfor solving this problem. Hyper-heuristic is a new heuristic approach which can\nsearch the solution space effectively by applying local searches appropriately.\nEach local search is a neighborhood searching algorithm.

Quantum information theory unites information\ntheoretic ideas with an accurate quantum-mechanical description of reality to\ngive a more accurate and complete theory with new and more powerful\npossibilities for information processing. The goal of both classical and\nquantum information theory is to quantify the optimal rates of interconversion\nof different resources. These rates are usually characterized in terms of\nentropies. However, nonadditivity of many entropic formulas often makes finding\nanswers to information theoretic questions intractable. In a few auspicious\ncases, such as the classical capacity of a classical channel, the capacity\nregion of a multiple access channel and the entanglement assisted capacity of a\nquantum channel, additivity allows a full characterization of optimal rates.\nHere we present a new mathematical property of entropic formulas, uniform\nadditivity, that is both easily evaluated and rich enough to capture all known\nquantum additive formulas. We give a complete characterization of uniformly\nadditive functions using the linear programming approach to entropy\ninequalities. In addition to all known quantum formulas, we find a new and\nintriguing additive quantity: the completely coherent information.

In this work we show\nthat the orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects cluster not only in argument of\nperihelion, but also in physical space.

A primary motivation of the tight integration of RE\nfunctionality with simulation codes has been performance. This is limiting at\nmultiple levels. First, advances in the RE methodology are tied to the\nmolecular simulation code. Consequently these advances remain confined to the\nmolecular simulation code for which they were developed.

We conducted an investigation in which 111 students in an\nalgebra-based introductory physics course were subjected to two different\ninterventions during recitation quizzes throughout the semester. They were\neither (1) asked to solve problems in which the diagrams were drawn for them or\n(2) explicitly told to draw a diagram. A comparison group was not given any\ninstruction regarding diagrams. We developed a rubric to score the\nproblem-solving performance of students in different intervention groups.

The\nproposed approach, effectively subsampled quadratures involves sparsely\nsubsampling an existing tensor grid using QR column pivoting. For polynomial\ninterpolation using hyperbolic or total order sets, we then solve the following\nsquare least squares problem. For polynomial approximation, we use a column\npruning heuristic that removes columns based on the highest total orders and\nthen solves the tall least squares problem. While we provide bounds on the\ncondition number of such tall submatrices, it is difficult to ascertain how\ncolumn pruning effects solution accuracy as this is problem specific.

This strategy has been shown to give better results, as\nfixing the coefficients to theoretical values can give rise to important\nsystematic errors which directly impact the physical properties of the system\nderived from such lightcurves such as the planetary radius. However, studies of\nthe effect of limb darkening assumptions on the retrieved parameters have\nmostly focused on the widely used quadratic limb-darkening law, leaving out\nother proposed laws that are either simpler or better descriptions of model\nintensity profiles.

This\nis realised by the fact that the two glasses have different melting points. The\nCO$_2$ laser power is controlled to flow the doped glass around the silica\ncylinder. In the case of a capillary, the resulting geometry is a hollow,\nmicrobottle-shaped resonator. This is a simple method for fabricating a number\nof glass WGM lasers with a wide range of sizes on a single, micron-scale\nstructure. The Er:Yb doped glass outer layer is pumped at 980 nm via a tapered\noptical fibre and whispering gallery mode (WGM) lasing is recorded around 1535\nnm. This structure facilitates a new way to thermo-optically tune the\nmicrolaser modes by passing gas through the capillary.

Here we propose experimental clues and criteria to measure how a\nmaterial in hand is close to the Kitaev's QSL state. For this purpose, we\nsystematically study thermal and spin excitations of a generalized\nKitaev-Heisenberg model studied by Chaloupka $et$ $al$. in Phys. Rev. Lett.\n110, 097204 (2013) and an effective ab initio Hamiltonian for Na$_2$IrO$_3$\nproposed by Yamaji $et$ $al$. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 107201 (2014), by\nemploying a numerical diagonalization method. We reveal that closeness to the\nKitaev's QSL is characterized by the following properties, besides trivial\ncriteria such as reduction of magnetic ordered moments and Neel temperatures:\n(1) Two peaks in the temperature dependence of specific heat at $T_{\\ell}$ and\n$T_h$ caused by the fractionalization of spin to two types of Majorana\nfermions. (2) In between the double peak, prominent plateau or shoulder pinned\nat $(R/2)\\ln 2$ in the temperature dependence of entropy, where $R$ is the gas\nconstant. (3) Failure of the linear spin wave approximation at the low-lying\nexcitations of dynamical structure factors. (4) Small ratio $T_{\\ell}/T_h$\nclose to or less than 0.03. According to the proposed criteria, Na$_2$IrO$_3$\nis categorized to a compound close to the Kitaev's QSL, and is proven to be a\npromising candidate for the realization of the QSL if the relevant material\nparameters can further be tuned by making thin film of Na$_2$IrO$_3$ on various\nsubstrates or applying axial pressure perpendicular to the honeycomb networks\nof iridium ions. Applications of these characterization to\n(Na$_{1-x}$Li$_x$)$_2$IrO$_3$ and other related materials are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2016 05:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

In\nnon-symmetric quantum dots, the two dark excitons' eigenstates are mixed with\nthe bright excitons' eigenstates which have cross-linearly polarized\nperpendicular to the growth direction dipole moments.

Here, the main focus is on the framework of loop quantum\ngravity (LQG), where we concentrate on the reduction of the quantum\nconfiguration space, and the construction of a normalized Radon measures on the\nreduced one. More precisely, we introduce a new way to symmetry reduce the\nLQG-configuration space directly on the quantum level, and then show that this\nalways leads to a (strictly) larger reduced space than quantizing the classical\nconfiguration space of invariant connections (traditional approach). We prove a\ngeneral classification theorem for such invariant connections, which we then\nuse to calculate the classical configuration space for the homogeneous and the\nspherically symmetric case. Here, the backbone of the introduced reduction\nconcept is a lifting result for group actions on sets to spectra of\n$C^*$-subalgebras of the bounded functions thereon; and as a further\napplication of this, we single out the standard kinematical Hilbert space of\nhomogeneous isotropic loop quantum cosmology by means of the same invariance\ncondition for both the standard configuration space\n$\\mathbb{R}_{\\mathrm{Bohr}}$, as well as for the Fleischhack one\n$\\mathbb{R}\\sqcup\\mathbb{R}_{\\mathrm{Bohr}}$.

We propose two new approaches that allow estimating the\nmaximum available visibility distance, involving only one vehicle and based on\ndifferent sensor technologies, namely binocular stereovision and 3D range\nsensing (LIDAR). The first approach is based on the processing of two views\ntaken by digital cameras onboard the diagnostic vehicle.

The second approach involves the use of a Terrestrial LIDAR Mobile\nMapping System. The triangulated 3D model of the road and its surroundings\nprovided by the system is used to simulate targets at different distances,\nwhich allows estimating the maximum geometric visibility distance along the\npathway.

This paper presents a first study\nfocused on changes in the vocal tract shape in recorder playing techniques.\nMeasurements carried out with recorder players allow to identify techniques\ninvolving changes of the mouth shape as well as consequences on the sound. A\nsecond experiment performed in laboratory mimics the coupling with the vocal\ntract on an artificial mouth. The phase of the transfer function between the\ninstrument and the mouth of the player is identified to be the relevant\nparameter of the coupling. It is shown to have consequences on the spectral\ncontent in terms of energy distribution among the even and odd harmonics, as\nwell as on the stability of the first two oscillating regimes. The results\ngathered from the two experiments allow to develop a simplified model of sound\nproduction including the effect of changing the vocal tract shape. It is based\non the modification of the jet instabilities due to the pulsating emerging jet.\nTwo kinds of instabilities, symmetric and anti-symmetric, with respect to the\nstream axis, are controlled by the coupling with the vocal tract and the\nacoustic oscillation within the pipe, respectively. The symmetry properties of\nthe flow are mapped on the temporal formulation of the source term, predicting\na change in the even / odd harmonics energy distribution.

Our\napproach yields optimal testers for numerous problems by using a standard\n$\\ell_2$-identity tester as a black-box. Using this recipe, we obtain simple\nestimators for a wide range of problems, encompassing most problems previously\nstudied in the TCS literature, namely: (1) identity testing to a fixed\ndistribution, (2) closeness testing between two unknown distributions (with\nequal/unequal sample sizes), (3) independence testing (in any number of\ndimensions), (4) closeness testing for collections of distributions, and (5)\ntesting histograms.

A large-velocity gradient analysis\nsuggests a two-temperature model of the molecular gas in the disk, likely\ndominated by a combination of low-velocity shocks and the disk wide PDRs. Only\nmarginal $^{12}$CO(6-5) emission is detected in the vicinity of the expanding\nshells at the eastern and western edges of the disk. While the eastern shell\ncontains gas even warmer (T$_{\\rm kin}$>300~K) than the hot gas component\n(T$_{\\rm kin}$=300K) of the disk, the western shell is surrounded by gas much\ncooler (T$_{\\rm kin}$=60K) than the eastern shell but somewhat hotter than the\ncold gas component of the disk (for similar H$_2$ and CO column densities),\nindicative of different (or differently efficient) heating mechansisms. The\ncontinuum emission at 686GHz in the disk agrees well in shape and size with\nthat at lower (sub-)millimeter frequencies, exhibiting a spectral index\nconsistent with thermal dust emission.

Prominent photoluminescence enhancement in monolayer MoS2\nwas observed with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) tuned to the\nexciton resonance. By tuning the excitation energy, the contributions from near\nfield enhancement and radiative emission rate enhancement via Purcell effect\nwere resolved.

The\nconcept of amplification of quantum states is defined specifically and the\namplification of a set of quantum states is formulated generally as the\ntransformation of quantum states. Three different kinds of important quantum\namplifications, i.e., deterministic noisy quantum amplification, probabilistic\nnoiseless quantum amplification, and deterministic noiseless quantum\namplification are identified and discussed. For deterministic quan- tum\namplification, the linearity of amplification is proven to be incompatible with\nthe noiseless amplification while it is not true for probabilistic quantum\namplification.

These systems provide a\nuser-friendly vertex-centric programming interface, where a programmer only\nneeds to specify the behavior of one generic vertex when developing a parallel\ngraph algorithm. However, most existing systems require the input graph to\nreside in memories of the machines in a cluster, and the few out-of-core\nsystems suffer from problems such as poor efficiency for sparse computation\nworkload, high demand on network bandwidth, and expensive cost incurred by\nexternal-memory join and group-by.\n  In this paper, we introduce the GraphD system for a user to process very\nlarge graphs with ordinary computing resources. GraphD fully overlaps\ncomputation with communication, by streaming edges and messages on local disks,\nwhile transmitting messages in parallel. For a broad class of Pregel algorithms\nwhere message combiner is applicable, GraphD eliminates the need of any\nexpensive external-memory join or group-by. These key techniques allow GraphD\nto achieve comparable performance to in-memory Pregel-like systems without\nkeeping edges and messages in memories. We prove that to process a graph G=(V,\nE) with n machines using GraphD, each machine only requires O(|V|/n) memory\nspace, allowing GraphD to scale to very large graphs with a small cluster.\nExtensive experiments show that GraphD beats existing out-of-core systems by\norders of magnitude, and achieves comparable performance to in-memory systems\nrunning with enough memories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2016 11:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-22"}

The\nthermal light curve of Pluto-Charon is observed in all filters, albeit more\nmarginally at 160 and especially 500 $\\mu$m.

To further improve the\nperformance of LRR and extend its applications, there are several issues to be\nresolved. The nuclear norm in LRR does not sufficiently use the prior knowledge\nof the rank which is known in many practical problems. The LRR is designed for\nvectorial data from linear spaces, thus not suitable for high dimensional data\nwith intrinsic non-linear manifold structure. This paper proposes an extended\nLRR model for manifold-valued Grassmann data which incorporates prior knowledge\nby minimizing partial sum of singular values instead of the nuclear norm,\nnamely Partial Sum minimization of Singular Values Representation (GPSSVR). The\nnew model not only enforces the global structure of data in low rank, but also\nretains important information by minimizing only smaller singular values. To\nfurther maintain the local structures among Grassmann points, we also integrate\nthe Laplacian penalty with GPSSVR. An effective algorithm is proposed to solve\nthe optimization problem based on the GPSSVR model. The proposed model and\nalgorithms are assessed on some widely used human action video datasets and a\nreal scenery dataset.

We propose the\nrepelling-attracting Metropolis (RAM) algorithm that maintains the\nsimple-to-implement nature of the Metropolis algorithm, but is more likely to\njump between modes. The RAM algorithm is a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a\nproposal that consists of a downhill move in density that aims to make local\nmodes repelling, followed by an uphill move in density that aims to make local\nmodes attracting. The downhill move is achieved via a reciprocal Metropolis\nratio so that the algorithm prefers downward movement. The uphill move does the\nopposite using the standard Metropolis ratio which prefers upward movement.\nThis down-up movement in density increases the probability of a proposed move\nto a different mode. Because the acceptance probability of the proposal\ninvolves a ratio of intractable integrals, we introduce an auxiliary variable\nwhich creates a term in the acceptance probability that cancels with the\nintractable ratio.

Deep inside the star, nuclei (mainly\niron) capture neutrons and progressively build up (through the\nslow-neutron-capture process, or s-process) heavier elements that are\nsubsequently brought to the stellar surface by convection. Two neutron sources,\nactivated at distinct temperatures, have been proposed: 13C and 22Ne, each\nreleasing one neutron per alpha-particle (4He) captured. To explain the\nmeasured stellar abundances, stellar evolution models invoking the 13C neutron\nsource (which operates at temperatures of about one hundred million kelvin) are\nfavoured. Isotopic ratios in primitive meteorites, however, reflecting\nnucleosynthesis in the previous generations of stars that contributed material\nto the Solar System, point to higher temperatures (more than three hundred\nmillion kelvin), requiring at least a late activation of 22Ne. Here we report a\ndetermination of the s-process temperature directly in evolved low-mass giant\nstars, using zirconium and niobium abundances, independently of stellar\nevolution models. The derived temperature supports 13C as the s-process neutron\nsource.

Linguistic and neurocognitive studies recognize the phonological\nclasses at segmental level as the essential and invariant representations used\nin speech temporal organization. In the context of speech processing, a deep\nneural network (DNN) is an effective computational method to infer the\nprobability of individual phonological classes from a short segment of speech\nsignal. A vector of all phonological class probabilities is referred to as\nphonological posterior.

We complement\nexisting discussion on agglomeration economies and the urban wage premium here\nby providing a sensitivity analysis of estimated coefficients to different\ndelineations of urban agglomeration as well as to different definitions of the\neconomic measure that summarises the urban premium. This quantity can consist\nof total wages measured at the place of work, or of income registered at the\nplace of residence. The chosen option influences the scaling behaviour of city\nsize as well as the spatial distribution of the phenomenon at the city level.\nSpatial discrepancies between the distribution of jobs and the distribution of\nhouseholds at different economic levels makes city definitions crucial to the\nestimation of economic relations which vary with city size. We argue this point\nby regressing measures of income and wage over about five thousands different\ndefinitions of cities in France, based on our algorithmic aggregation of\nadministrative spatial units at regular cutoffs which reflect density,\npopulation thresholds and commuting flows. We also go beyond aggregated\nobservations of wages and income by searching for evidence of larger\ninequalities and economic segregation in the largest cities. This paper\ntherefore considers the spatial and economic complexity of cities with respect\nto discussion about how we measure agglomeration economies.

We find that Pluto's\natmosphere is still expanding, with a significant pressure increase of\n5$\\pm$2\\% since 2013 and a factor of almost three since 1988. This trend rules\nout, as of today, an atmospheric collapse associated with Pluto's recession\nfrom the Sun. A central flash, a rare occurrence, was observed from several\nsites in New Zealand.

Similar to the methods used by\nRokicki et. al on Rubik's Cube, in this paper we develop a method for solving\narbitrary configurations of Rubik's Revenge in phases, using a combination of a\npowerful algorithm known as IDA* and a useful definition of distance in the\ncube space. While time-series results were not successfully gathered, it will\nbe shown that this method far outweighs current human-solving methods and can\nbe used to determine loose upper bounds for the cube space. Discussion will\nsuggest that this method can also be applied to other puzzles with the proper\ntransformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 18:27:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-23"}

Shannon's sampling theorem, which is at the heart\nof modern digital communications, is a special case of sampling in\nshift-invariant spaces. Furthermore, it is well known that the Poisson\nsummation formula is equivalent to the sampling theorem and that the Zak\ntransform is closely connected to the sampling theorem and the Poisson\nsummation formula.

We provide a short, self-contained proof of Shannon's theorem\nfor functions bandlimited in the SAFT domain and then show that sampling in the\nSAFT domain is equivalent to orthogonal projection of functions onto a subspace\nof bandlimited basis associated with the SAFT domain. This interpretation of\nsampling leads to least-squares optimal sampling theorem.

The recent trend followed by the engineers focused on\ndesigning fuel injectors for more efficient atomization is to increase the\natomization pressure while decreasing the nozzle orifice diameter. A\nconsequence of this is the development of cavitation (formation of vapor\ncavities or bubbles in the liquid) inside the injector close to the nozzle. The\nmain reason behind this is the sudden changes in the pressure inside the\ninjector and these cavities or bubbles are usually formed where the pressure is\nrelatively low.This work mainly focuses on studying the formation of cavitation\nand its effect on the velocity of the spray in the near nozzle region using\nasymmetrical transparent nozzle equipped with a needle lift sensor with nozzle\ndiameter of 0.35 mm at 300 bar of injection pressure.

On a standardized\nconceptual physics assessment, we found that asking test takers to indicate\ntheir gender right before taking the test did not deteriorate performance\ncompared to an equivalent group who did not provide gender information.\nAlthough a statistically significant gender gap was present on the standardized\ntest whether or not students indicated their gender, no gender gap was observed\non the multiple-choice final exam students took, which included both\nquantitative and conceptual questions on similar topics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2016 22:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-25"}
