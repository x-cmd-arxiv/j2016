We model the reward function using a Gaussian process whose\nevolution obeys a simple Markov model. We introduce two natural extensions of\nthe classical Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) algorithm. The\nfirst, R-GP-UCB, resets GP-UCB at regular intervals. The second, TV-GP-UCB,\ninstead forgets about old data in a smooth fashion. Our main contribution\ncomprises of novel regret bounds for these algorithms, providing an explicit\ncharacterization of the trade-off between the time horizon and the rate at\nwhich the function varies. We illustrate the performance of the algorithms on\nboth synthetic and real data, and we find the gradual forgetting of TV-GP-UCB\nto perform favorably compared to the sharp resetting of R-GP-UCB. Moreover,\nboth algorithms significantly outperform classical GP-UCB, since it treats\nstale and fresh data equally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 16:02:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-26"}

To approximate the auditory frequency resolution in the\nsignal chain, some applications rely on perceptually motivated FBs, the\ngammatone FB being a popular example. However, most perceptually motivated FBs\nonly allow partial signal reconstruction at high redundancies and/or do not\nhave good resistance to sub-channel processing. This paper introduces an\noversampled perceptually motivated FB enabling perfect reconstruction,\nefficient FB design, and adaptable redundancy. The filters are directly\nconstructed in the frequency domain and linearly distributed on a perceptual\nfrequency scale (e.g. ERB, Bark, or Mel scale). The proposed design allows for\nvarious filter shapes, uniform or non-uniform FB setting, and large\ndown-sampling factors. For redundancies $\\geq$ 3 perfect reconstruction is\nachieved by computing the canonical dual FB analytically. For lower\nredundancies perfect reconstruction is achieved using an iterative method.\nExperiments show performance improvements of the proposed approach when\ncompared to the gammatone FB in terms of reconstruction error and resistance to\nsub-channel processing, especially at low redundancies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 16:13:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-26"}

They are\nexpected to be useful to produce neutron-rich unstable nuclei. Nuclear dynamics\nleading to these processes depends sensitively on nuclear properties such as\ndeformation and shell structure. Purpose: We elucidate reaction mechanisms of\nMNT and QF processes involving heavy deformed nuclei, making detailed\ncomparisons between microscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) calculations\nand measurements for the $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction. Methods:\nThree-dimensional Skyrme-TDHF calculations are performed. Particle-number\nprojection method is used to evaluate MNT cross sections from the TDHF wave\nfunction after collision. Results: Fragment masses, total kinetic energy (TKE),\nscattering angle, contact time, and MNT cross sections are investigated for the\n$^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction. They show reasonable agreements with\nmeasurements. At small impact parameters, collision dynamics depends\nsensitively on the orientation of deformed $^{238}$U. In tip (side) collisions,\nwe find a larger (smaller) TKE and a shorter (longer) contact time. In tip\ncollisions, we find a strong influence of quantum shells around $^{208}$Pb.\nConclusions: It is confirmed that the TDHF calculations reasonably describe\nboth MNT and QF processes in the $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U reaction. Analyses of this\nsystem indicates the significance of the nuclear structure effects such as\ndeformation and quantum shells in nuclear reaction dynamics at low energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 16:18:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 08:16:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

The key role of the associated\nWeyl consistency conditions in establishing RG flow equations for the\ncoefficients of the trace anomaly in curved spacetime, and their relation to\nthe c-theorem and four-dimensional a-theorem, is explained in detail.\n  A number of different derivations of the c-theorem in two dimensions are\npresented -- using spectral functions, RG analysis of Green functions of the\nenergy-momentum tensor T_{mu nu}, and dispersion relations -- and are\ngeneralised to four dimensions.

The typical work-flow in the end-to-end quantification\nof uncertainties requires first formulating and solving stochastic inverse\nproblems (SIPs) using output data on available quantities of interest (QoI).\nThe solution to a SIP is often written in terms of a probability measure, or\ndensity, on the space of model inputs. Then, we can formulate and solve a\nstochastic forward problem (SFP) where the uncertainty on model inputs is\npropagated through the model to make quantitative predictions on either\nunobservable or future QoI data.\n  In this work, we use a measure-theoretic framework to formulate and solve\nboth SIPs and SFPs. From this perspective, we quantify the geometric\ncharacteristics of using hypothetical sets of QoI that describe both the\nprecision and accuracy in solutions to both the SIP and SFP. This leads to a\nnatural definition of the optimal experimental design, i.e., what the optimal\nconfiguration a finite set of sensors is in space-time.

To\nanswer this question, one needs a quality score that utilizes both structure\nand attributes. Popular existing measures either quantify the structure only\nand ignore the attributes (e.g., conductance), or only consider the\nconnectedness of the nodes inside the neighborhood and ignore the cross-edges\nat the boundary (e.g., density).\n  In this work we propose normality, a new quality measure for attributed\nneighborhoods. Normality utilizes structure and attributes together to quantify\nboth internal consistency and external separability. It exhibits two key\nadvantages over other measures: (1) It allows many boundary-edges as long as\nthey can be \"exonerated\"; i.e., either (i) are expected under a null model,\nand/or (ii) the boundary nodes do not exhibit the subset of attributes shared\nby the neighborhood members. Existing measures, in contrast, penalize boundary\nedges irrespectively. (2) Normality can be efficiently maximized to\nautomatically infer the shared attribute subspace (and respective weights) that\ncharacterize a neighborhood. This efficient optimization allows us to process\ngraphs with millions of attributes.\n  We capitalize on our measure to present a novel approach for Anomaly Mining\nof Entity Neighborhoods (AMEN). Experiments on real-world attributed graphs\nillustrate the effectiveness of our measure at anomaly detection, outperforming\npopular approaches including conductance, density, OddBall, and SODA. In\naddition to anomaly detection, our qualitative analysis demonstrates the\nutility of normality as a powerful tool to contrast the correlation between\nstructure and attributes across different graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 18:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-26"}

In the one dimensional\ncase, our methods require only C^3 regularity of the maps in the IFS. The key\nidea, which has been known in varying degrees of generality for many years, is\nto associate to the IFS a parametrized family of positive, linear,\nPerron-Frobenius operators L_s. The operators L_s can typically be studied in\nmany different Banach spaces. Here, unlike most of the literature, we study L_s\nin a Banach space of real-valued, C^k functions, k >= 2; and we note that L_s\nis not compact, but has a strictly positive eigenfunction v_s with positive\neigenvalue lambda_s equal to the spectral radius of L_s. Under appropriate\nassumptions on the IFS, the Hausdorff dimension of the invariant set of the IFS\nis the value s=s_* for which lambda_s =1. This eigenvalue problem is then\napproximated by a collocation method using continuous piecewise linear\nfunctions (in one dimension) or bilinear functions (in two dimensions). Using\nthe theory of positive linear operators and explicit a priori bounds on the\nderivatives of the strictly positive eigenfunction v_s, we give rigorous upper\nand lower bounds for the Hausdorff dimension s_*, and these bounds converge to\ns_* as the mesh size approaches zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 19:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-26"}

Here we describe a\nfully-integrated evanescent opto-nanomechanical transducer based on a\nhigh-stress Si$_3$N$_4$ nanobeam monolithically suspended above a SiO$_2$\nmicrodisk cavity. Employing a novel vertical integration technique based on\nplanarized sacrificial layers, we achieve beam-disk gaps as little as 25 nm\nwhile maintaining mechanical $Q\\times f>10^{12}$ Hz and intrinsic optical\n$Q\\sim10^7$. The combined low loss, small gap, and parallel-plane geometry\nresult in exceptionally efficient transduction, characterizing by\nradio-frequency flexural modes with vacuum optomechanical coupling rates of 100\nkHz, single-photon cooperativities in excess of unity, and zero-point frequency\n(displacement) noise amplitudes of 10 kHz (fm)/$\\surd$Hz. In conjunction with\nthe high power handling capacity of SiO$_2$ and low extraneous substrate noise,\nthe transducer operates particularly well as a sensor.

However, recent analyses based on visual and near-ultraviolet (UV)\nCMDs have provided conflicting results. To clarify the situation, we address\nthe optimum ranges of applicability (in terms of the $T_{eff}$ range covered by\nthe HB stars) for visual and near-UV CMDs, as far as application of this HB $Y$\ntest goes. We consider both Stromgren and Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nbandpasses. Our results indicate that the distributions of HB stars in the y vs\n(b-y) plane can be a reliable indicator of the He content in cool blue HB (BHB)\nstars, particularly when a differential comparison between blue and red HB\nstars is carried out in the range $T_{eff}<8300$K. Conversely, we demonstrate\nthat CMDs using the F336W filter have a much less straightforward\ninterpretation at the cool end of the BHB, as the distributions of HB stars in\nthe F336W vs (F336W-F555W) plane are affected by a triple degeneracy effect. In\nother words, the position of an HB star is exactly the same, for a given\nchemical composition, for multiple combinations of the parameters $Y$,\n$M_{HB}$, and age along the HB evolutionary track. Other HST UV filters do not\nappear to be as severely affected by this degeneracy effect, to which visual\nbandpasses are also immune. We do find, on the other hand, that such near-UV\nCMDs can be extremely useful for the hottest stars along the cool BHB end.\nBased on a reanalysis of the distribution of HB stars in the y vs (b-y) plane,\nwe find that the coolest among the BHB stars in M3 are likely enhanced in\nhelium by $\\Delta Y\\approx 0.01$, compared with the red HB stars in the same\ncluster.

Bitrate adaptation requires a tradeoff between\nreducing the probability that the video freezes (rebuffers) and enhancing the\nquality of the video. A bitrate that is too high leads to frequent rebuffering,\nwhile a bitrate that is too low leads to poor video quality. Video providers\nsegment videos into short segments and encode each segment at multiple\nbitrates. The video player adaptively chooses the bitrate of each segment to\ndownload, possibly choosing different bitrates for successive segments. We\nformulate bitrate adaptation as a utility-maximization problem and devise an\nonline control algorithm called BOLA that uses Lyapunov optimization to\nminimize rebuffering and maximize video quality. We prove that BOLA achieves a\ntime-average utility that is within an additive term O(1/V) of the optimal\nvalue, for a control parameter V related to the video buffer size. Further,\nunlike prior work, BOLA does not require prediction of available network\nbandwidth. We empirically validate BOLA in a simulated network environment\nusing a collection of network traces.

This is an ill-posed problem, due to the non-uniqueness of the\nsolution, and many kinds of prior information have been used to constrain it. A\ncombination of smoothness (L2 norm-based) and sparseness (L1 norm-based)\nconstraints is a flexible approach that have been pursued by important examples\nsuch as the Elastic Net (ENET) and mixed-norm (MXN) models. The former is used\nto find solutions with a small number of smooth non-zero patches, while the\nlatter imposes sparseness and smoothness simultaneously along different\ndimensions of the spatio-temporal matrix solutions. Both models have been\naddressed within the penalized regression approach, where the regularization\nparameters are selected heuristically, leading usually to non-optimal\nsolutions. The existing Bayesian formulation of ENET allows hyperparameter\nlearning, but using computationally intensive Monte Carlo/Expectation\nMaximization methods.

In\norder to establish the relative importance of these two classes of stellar\nsources of dust it is important to know what is the fraction of freshly formed\ndust in SN ejecta that is able to survive the passage of the reverse shock and\nbe injected in the interstellar medium. With this aim, we have developed a new\ncode, GRASH_Rev, that allows to follow the dynamics of dust grains in the\nshocked SN ejecta and to compute the time evolution of the mass, composition\nand size distribution of the grains. We consider four well studied SNe in the\nMilky Way and LMC: SN 1987a, Cas A, the Crab Nebula, and N49. For all the\nsimulated models, we find good agreement with observations. Our study suggests\nthat SN 1987A is too young for the reverse shock to have affected the dust\nmass. Conversely, in the other three SNe, the reverse shock has already\ndestroyed between 10 and 40% of the initial dust mass. However, the largest\ndust mass destruction is predicted to occur between 10^3 and 10^5 yr after the\nexplosions. Since the oldest SN in the sample has an estimated age of 4800 yr,\ncurrent observations can only provide an upper limit to the mass of SN dust\nthat will enrich the interstellar medium, the so-called effective dust yields.\nWe find that only between 1 and 8% of the currently observed mass will survive.\nThis is in good agreement with the values adopted in chemical evolution models\nwhich consider the effect of the SN reverse shock.

The contribution from older main\nsequence stars and sub-giants is small but not negligible. From\nMbh~10^7.5-10^8.5Msun, the balance rapidly shifts to higher mass stars and a\nlarger contribution from evolved stars, and is ultimately dominated by evolved\nstars at higher BH masses. The star formation history has little effect until\nthe rates are dominated by evolved stars. TDE rates should decline very rapidly\ntowards higher redshifts. The volumetric rate of TDEs is very high because the\nBH mass function diverges for low masses.

We employ analytic models that capture the basic\ncharacteristics of the images to understand the origin of the variability in\nthe simulated visibility amplitudes. We find that, in all simulations, the\nvisibility amplitudes for baselines oriented perpendicular to the spin axis of\nthe black hole typically decrease smoothly over baseline lengths that are\ncomparable to those of the EHT. On the other hand, the visibility amplitudes\nfor baselines oriented parallel to the spin axis show significant structure\nwith one or more minima. This suggests that fitting EHT observations with\ngeometric models will lead to reasonably accurate determination of the\norientation of the black-hole on the plane of the sky. However, in the\ndisk-dominated models, the locations and depths of the minima in the visibility\namplitudes depend primarily on the width and asymmetry of the crescent-like\nimages and are highly variable. In the jet-dominated models, the locations of\nthe minima are determined by the separation of the two image components but\ntheir depths depend primarily on the relative brightness of the two components\nand are also variable. This suggests that using time-independent models to\ninfer additional black-hole parameters, such as the shadow size or the spin\nmagnitude, will be severely affected by the variability of the accretion flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 21:03:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2016 20:07:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 23:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-15"}

These observations represent the first solid detection of a young\nextragalactic stripped-envelope SN out to high-energy X-rays. SN2014C was the\nexplosion of an H-stripped progenitor star with ordinary explosion parameters.\nHowever, over the time scale of ~1yr, SN2014C experienced a complete\nmetamorphosis and evolved from an ordinary H-poor supernova of type Ib into a\nstrongly interacting, H-rich supernova of type IIn. Signatures of the SN shock\ninteracting with a dense medium are observed across the spectrum. Coordinated\nobservations with Swift, Chandra and NuSTAR have captured the evolution in\ndetail and revealed the presence of a massive shell of ~1 Msun of hydrogen-rich\nmaterial at ~6d16 cm from the explosion site. We estimate that the shell was\nejected by the progenitor star in the decades to centuries before core\ncollapse. This result poses significant challenges to current theories of\nmassive star evolution, as it requires a physical mechanism responsible for the\nejection of the deepest hydrogen layer of H-poor SN progenitors synchronized\nwith the onset of stellar collapse. Theoretical investigations point at binary\ninteractions and/or instabilities during the last stages of nuclear burning in\nmassive stars as potential triggers of the time-dependent mass loss. We\nconstrain these scenarios utilizing the sample of 183 SNe Ib/c with public\nradio observations. Our analysis identifies SN2014C-like signatures in ~10% of\nSNe with constraining radio data. This fraction is somewhat larger but\nreasonably consistent with the expectation from the theory of recent envelope\nejection due to binary evolution IF the ejected material can survive in the\nclose environment for 1000-10000 yrs. Alternatively, nuclear burning\ninstabilities extending all the way to the core C-burning phase might also play\na critical role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 21:12:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

However, the\nconventional fully digital beamforming methods which require one radio\nfrequency (RF) chain per antenna element is not viable for large-scale antenna\narrays due to the high cost and high power consumption of RF chain components\nin high frequencies. To address the challenge of this hardware limitation, this\npaper considers a hybrid beamforming architecture in which the overall\nbeamformer consists of a low-dimensional digital beamformer followed by an RF\nbeamformer implemented using analog phase shifters. Our aim is to show that\nsuch an architecture can approach the performance of a fully digital scheme\nwith much fewer number of RF chains. Specifically, this paper establishes that\nif the number of RF chains is twice the total number of data streams, the\nhybrid beamforming structure can realize any fully digital beamformer exactly,\nregardless of the number of antenna elements. For cases with fewer number of RF\nchains, this paper further considers the hybrid beamforming design problem for\nboth the transmission scenario of a point-to-point multipleinput\nmultiple-output (MIMO) system and a downlink multiuser multiple-input\nsingle-output (MU-MISO) system. For each scenario, we propose a heuristic\nhybrid beamforming design that achieves a performance close to the performance\nof the fully digital beamforming baseline. Finally, the proposed algorithms are\nmodified for the more practical setting in which only finite resolution phase\nshifters are available.

Propagating\nthrough the convolutional layers is very slow, as each kernel in each layer\nmust sequentially calculate many dot products for a single forward and backward\npropagation which equates to $\\mathcal{O}(N^{2}n^{2})$ per kernel per layer\nwhere the inputs are $N \\times N$ arrays and the kernels are $n \\times n$\narrays. Convolution can be efficiently performed as a Hadamard product in the\nfrequency domain.

The simulations self-consistently calculate the heating due\nto MHD turbulence caused by magneto-rotational instability and radiative\ncooling by using the radiative transfer module based on a variable Eddington\ntensor in Athena. For a $5\\times 10^8$ solar mass black hole with $\\sim 3\\%$ of\nthe Eddington luminosity, a model including the iron opacity bump maintains its\nstructure for more than $10$ thermal times without showing significant signs of\nthermal runaway.

We are interested in\noptimal rates of convergence under a squared global continuous $l_2$ loss in\nthe multivariate setting $(d\\geq 2)$. One crucial fact is that the minimax\nrisks depend heavily on the shape of the support of the regression function. It\nis shown that the global minimax risk is on the order of $n^{-2/(d+1)}$ when\nthe support is sufficiently smooth, but that the rate $n^{-4/(d+4)}$ is when\nthe support is a polytope. Such differences in rates are due to difficulties in\nestimating the regression function near the boundary of smooth regions.\n  We then study the natural bounded least squares estimators (BLSE): we show\nthat the BLSE nearly attains the optimal rates of convergence in low\ndimensions, while suffering rate-inefficiency in high dimensions. We show that\nthe BLSE adapts nearly parametrically to polyhedral functions when the support\nis polyhedral in low dimensions by a local entropy method. We also show that\nthe boundedness constraint cannot be dropped when risk is assessed via\ncontinuous $l_2$ loss.\n  Given rate sub-optimality of the BLSE in higher dimensions, we further study\nrate-efficient adaptive estimation procedures. Two general model selection\nmethods are developed to provide sieved adaptive estimators (SAE) that achieve\nnearly optimal rates of convergence for particular \"regular\" classes of convex\nfunctions, while maintaining nearly parametric rate-adaptivity to polyhedral\nfunctions in arbitrary dimensions.

A change point is the time instant at which the\ndistribution of a random process changes. The objective of quickest change\ndetection is to minimize the detection delay of an unknown change point under\ncertain performance constraints, such as average run length (ARL) to false\nalarm or probability of false alarm (PFA). Most existing change detection\nprocedures assume perfect knowledge of the random process distributions before\nand after the change point. However, in many practical applications such as\nanomaly detection, the post-change distribution is often unknown and needs to\nbe estimated with a limited number of samples. In this paper, we study the case\nthat there is a mismatch between the true post-change distribution and the one\nused during detection. We analytically identify the impacts of mismatched\npost-change models on two classical detection procedures, the cumulative sum\n(CUSUM) procedure and the Shiryaev-Roberts (SR) procedure. The impacts of\nmismatched models are characterized in terms of various finite or asymptotic\nperformance bounds on ARL, PFA, and average detection delay (ADD). It is shown\nthat post-change model mismatch results in an increase in ADD, and the rate of\nperformance degradation depends on the difference between two Kullback-Leibler\n(KL) divergences, one is between the priori- and post-change distributions, and\nthe other one is between the true and mismatched post-change distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 02:29:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

Simulation results show that\nthe proposed approach yields significant gains, in terms of the sum-rate of the\n50th percentile of users, that reach up to 60% and 78%, respectively, compared\nto Q-learning and Q-learning without decoupling. The results also show that ESN\nsignificantly provides a considerable reduction of information exchange for the\nwireless network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 05:45:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2016 15:44:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 14:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

We investigate how to\nproperly carry out the classification using a novel data-driven method known as\nlatent tree analysis.\n  Method: A cross-sectional survey on VMCI was carried out in several regions\nin northern China from 2008 to 2011, which resulted in a data set that involves\n803 patients and 93 symptoms. Latent tree analysis was performed on the data to\nreveal symptom co-occurrence patterns, and the patients were partitioned into\nclusters in multiple ways based on the patterns. The patient clusters were\nmatched up with syndrome types, and population statistics of the clusters are\nused to quantify the syndrome types and to establish classification rules.\n  Results: Eight syndrome types are identified: Qi Deficiency, Qi Stagnation,\nBlood Deficiency, Blood Stasis, Phlegm-Dampness, Fire-Heat, Yang Deficiency,\nand Yin Deficiency.

In the present work,\nthe effect of uniaxial strain on the electronic transport properties through\ngraphene grain boundaries is investigated using atomistic simulations. A\nsystematic picture of the transport properties with respect to the strain and\nthe lattice symmetry of graphene domains on both sides of the boundary is\nprovided. In particular, it is shown that the strain engineering can be used to\nopen a finite transport gap in all graphene systems where two domains exhibit\ndifferent orientations. This gap value is found to depend on the strain\nmagnitude, on the strain direction and on the lattice symmetry of graphene\ndomains. By choosing appropriately the strain direction, a large transport gap\nof a few hundred meV can be achieved when applying a small strain of only a few\npercents. For a specific class of graphene grain boundary systems, the strain\nengineering can also be used to reduce the scattering on defects and hence to\nsignificantly enhance the conductance.

There are two philosophies regarding this\nquestion: according to Mach's principle it is matter that generates geometry of\nspace-time, and according to Wheeler's geometrodynamics some configurations of\nspace-time geometry are to be interpreted as its material content. Neither of\nthese philosophies has led to success. In the present paper, we show that there\nexists an algebraic generalisation of geometry that reconciles, in a sense,\nthese two seemingly opposite standpoints. The geometry is constructed with the\nhelp of a noncommutative algebra of smooth functions on a groupoid and its\nderivations. The groupoid in question has a nice physical interpretation: it\ncan be regarded as a space of Lorentz rotations. In this way, Lorentz\nsymmetries are inherent to the generalised geometry of space-time. We define\nthe action for this geometry and, by varying it, obtain generalised vacuum\nEinstein equations (for a simplified model). It turns out that these equations\ncontain additional terms (with respect to the standard vacuum Einstein\nequations) which are naturally interpreted as the components of the\nenergy-momentum tensor. Matter is thus created out of purely geometric degrees\nof freedom. We find two exact solutions (for even more simplified case). We\nargue that the creation of matter, being a global effect, makes the contrast\nbetween Mach and Wheeler philosophies ineffective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 09:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

These properties make\nscreening of the electron-hole interaction much weaker than for coupled\nelectron-hole monolayers, thus boosting the pairing strength and enhancing the\nsuperfluid properties. The pairing strength is further boosted by the\nquasi-one-dimensional quantum confinement of the carriers, as well as by the\nlarge density of states near the bottom of each subband. The latter magnifies\nthe superfluid shape resonances caused by the quantum confinement. Several\nsuperfluid partial condensates are present for finite-width nanoribbons with\nmultiple subbands.

The case of partial\nwetting is considered. The drops are in an atmosphere of nitrogen saturated\nwith water where they grow by condensation and eventually touch each other and\ncoalesce. A new convex composite drop is rapidly formed that then exponentially\nand slowly relaxes to an equilibrium hemispherical cap. The characteristic\nrelaxation time is proportional to the drop radius R * at final equilibrium.\nThis relaxation time appears to be nearly 10 7 times larger than the bulk\ncapillary relaxation time t b = R * $\\eta$/$\\sigma$, where $\\sigma$ is the\ngas--liquid surface tension and $\\eta$ is the liquid shear viscosity. In order\nto explain this extremely large relaxation time, we consider a model that\ninvolves an Arrhenius kinetic factor resulting from a liquid--vapour phase\nchange in the vicinity of the contact line. The model results in a large\nrelaxation time of order t b exp(L/RT) where L is the molar latent heat of\nvaporization, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature. We model the late\ntime relaxation for a near spherical cap and find an exponential relaxation\nwhose typical time scale agrees reasonably well with the experiment. 1.\nIntroduction Fusion or coalescence between drops is a key process in a wide\nrange of phenomena: phase transition in fluids and liquid mixtures or polymers,\nstability of foams and emulsions, and sintering in metallurgy (Eggers 1998),\nwhich is why the problem of coalescence has already received considerable\nattention. Most of the studies of this process so far have been devoted to the\ncoalescence of two spherical drops floating in a medium. The kinetics of the\nprocess before and after the drops have touched each other is governed by the\nhydrodynamics inside and outside the drops and by the van der Waals forces when\nthe drops are within mesoscopic distance from each other (Yiantsios \\& Davis\n1991). The composite drop that results from the coalescence of two drops\nrelaxes to a spherical shape within a time which is dominated by the relaxation\nof the flow inside and outside (Nikolayev, Beysens \\& Guenoun 1996; Nikolayev\n\\& Beysens 1997). There are no studies, to our knowledge, of the coalescence of\ntwo sessile drops after they touch each other. In this paper, we report a\npreliminary study of the dynamics and morphology of this process, in the case\nof hemispherical water droplets which grow slowly on a plane surface at the\nexpense of the surrounding atmosphere, forming what is called 'dew' or 'breath\nfigures' (Beysens et al. 1991; Beysens 1995).

Parametric studies are performed on the droplet\nhorizontal radius and the capillary number. For droplets with an horizontal\nradius larger than half the channel height the droplet overfills the channel\nand exhibits a pancake shape. A lubrication film is formed between the droplet\nand the wall and particular attention is paid to the effect of the lubrication\nfilm on the droplet velocity. The computed velocity of the pancake droplet is\nshown to be lower than the average inflow velocity, which is in agreement with\nexperimental measurements. The numerical results show that both the strong\nshear induced by the lubrication film and the three-dimensional flow structure\ncontribute to the low mobility of the droplet. In this low-migration-velocity\nscenario the interfacial flow in the droplet reference frame moves toward the\nrear on the top and reverses direction moving to the front from the two side\nedges. The velocity of the pancake droplet and the thickness of the lubrication\nfilm are observed to decrease with capillary number.

Basic verification problems such as loop detection are\nNP-hard and most previous work solves them with heuristics or SAT solvers. We\nfollow a different approach based on computing a representation of the header\nclasses, i.e. the sets of headers that match the same rules. This\nrepresentation consists in a collection of representative header sets, at least\none for each class, and can be computed centrally in time which is polynomial\nin the number of classes. Classical verification tasks can then be trivially\nsolved by checking each representative header set. In general, the number of\nheader classes can increase exponentially with header length, but it remains\npolynomial in the number of rules in the practical case where rules are\nconstituted with predefined fields where exact, prefix matching or range\nmatching is applied in each field (e.g., IP/MAC addresses, TCP/UDP ports). We\npropose general techniques that work in polynomial time as long as the number\nof classes of headers is polynomial and that do not make specific assumptions\nabout the structure of the sets associated to rules.

In superconducting\nsuperlattices of heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn5 and nonmagnetic metal\nYbCoIn5, superconductivity is realized even at one-unit-cell-thick layer of\nCeCoIn5. The thickness reduction of the CeCoIn5 layers drastically changes the\ntemperature and angular dependencies of the upper critical field. This result\nwould be attributed to a suppression of the Pauli pair-breaking effect through\nthe local inversion symmetry breaking (ISB) at the interfaces of CeCoIn5 block\nlayers. The importance of the ISB in this system has also been supported by\nsite-selective nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In addition, recent\nexperiment of CeCoIn5/YbCoIn5 superlattices have shown that the degree of the\nISB are controllable, which offers the prospect of achieving even more\nfascinating superconducting states. These Kondo superlattices, thus, pave the\nway for exploring unusual metallic and superconducting states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 13:05:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 09:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-10"}

The simultaneous requirements of adaptation and cooperation are\nachieved by employing diffusion algorithms with constant step-size {\\mu}. In\n[1], [2] some main features of adaptive distributed detection were revealed. By\nresorting to large deviations analysis, it was established that the Type-I and\nType-II error probabilities of all agents vanish exponentially as functions of\n1/{\\mu}, and that all agents share the same Type-I and Type-II error exponents.\nHowever, numerical evidences presented in [1], [2] showed that the theory of\nlarge deviations does not capture the fundamental impact of network\nconnectivity on performance, and that additional tools and efforts are required\nto obtain accurate predictions for the error probabilities.

The VUV photodesorption of intact methanol molecules from pure\nmethanol ices is found to be of the order of 10$^{-5}$ molecules/photon, that\nis two orders of magnitude below what is generally used in astrochemical\nmodels. This rate gets even lower ($<$ 10$^{-6}$ molecules/photon) when the\nmethanol is mixed with CO molecules in the ices. This is consistent with a\npicture in which photodissociation and recombination processes are at the\norigin of intact methanol desorption from pure CH$_3$OH ices. Such low rates\nare explained by the fact that the overall photodesorption process is dominated\nby the desorption of the photofragments CO, CH$_3$, OH, H$_2$CO and\nCH$_3$O/CH$_2$OH, whose photodesorption rates are given in this study.

We discuss\nsuch a situation, the t_2g manifold of iridates, and show that, while the\nJahn-Teller effect does indeed not affect the j_eff=1/2 antiferromagnetically\nordered ground state, it leads to distinctive signatures in the j_eff=3/2\nspin-orbit exciton. It allows for a hopping of the spin-orbit exciton between\nthe nearest neighbor sites without producing defects in the j_eff=1/2\nantiferromagnet. This arises because the lattice-driven Jahn-Teller mechanism\nonly couples to the orbital degree of freedom, but is not sensitive to the\nphase of the wave function that defines isospin j_z. This contrasts sharply\nwith purely electronic propagation, which conserves isospin, and presence of\nJahn-Teller coupling can explain some of the peculiar features of measured\nresonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra of Sr_2IrO_4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 15:40:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-08"}

Traditionally, players' names are used to set the\ninitial conditions for an instance of the game: its behaviour for an exhaustive\nset of pairings of popular UK childrens' names, and for more general initial\nconditions, is examined. Convergence to a fixed outcome (the desired result) is\nnot guaranteed, even for some plausible first name pairings. No pairs of top-50\ncommon first names exhibit non-convergence, suggesting that it is rare in the\nplayground; however, including surnames makes non-convergence more likely due\nto higher letter counts (for example, `Reese Witherspoon LOVES Calvin Harris').\nDifferent game keywords (including from different languages) are also\nconsidered. An estimate for non-convergence propensity is derived: if the sum\n$m$ of digits in a string of length $w$ obeys $m > 18/(3/2)^{w-4}$, convergence\nis less likely. Pairs of top UK names with pairs of `O's and several `L's (for\nexample, Chloe and Joseph, or Brooke and Scarlett) often attain high scores.\nWhen considering individual names playing with a range of partners, those with\nno `LOVES' letters score lowest, and names with intermediate (not simply the\nhighest) letter counts often perform best, with Connor and Evie averaging the\nhighest scores when played with other UK top names.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 17:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-12"}

The advantage of the regression approach is that it can be used to\nrender a functional relationship between the predictive rock indices and its\nUCS. The advantage of the black box techniques is in rendering more accurate\npredictions. Gene expression programming (GEP) is proposed, in this study, as a\nrobust mathematical alternative for predicting the UCS of carbonate rocks. The\ntwo parameters of total porosity and P-wave speed were selected as predictive\nindices. The proposed GEP model had the advantage of the both traditionally\nused approaches by proposing a mathematical model, similar to a regression,\nwhile keeping the prediction errors as low as the black box methods. The GEP\noutperformed both artificial neural networks and support vector machines in\nterms of yielding more accurate estimates of UCS. Both the porosity and the\nP-wave velocity were sufficient predictive indices for estimating the UCS of\nthe carbonate rocks in this study. Nearly, 95% of the observed variation in the\nUCS values was explained by these two parameters (i.e., R2 =95%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 01:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-12"}

Currently, evidence acquisition\nfor such services still follows the traditional method of collecting artifacts\non a client device. This approach requires labor-intensive reverse engineering\nefforts, and ultimately results in an acquisition that is inherently\nincomplete. Specifically, it makes the incorrect assumption that all storage\ncontent for an account is fully replicated on the client; further, there are no\nmeans to acquire historical data in the form of document revisions, nor is\nthere a way to acquire cloud-native artifacts, such as Google Docs.\n  In this work, we introduce the concept of API-based evidence acquisition for\ncloud services, which addresses these concerns by utilizing the officially\nsupported API of the service. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we\npresent a proof-of-concept acquisition tool, kumodd, which can acquire evidence\nfrom four major cloud drive providers: Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive,\nDropbox, and Box. The implementation provides both command-line and web user\ninterfaces, and can be readily incorporated into established forensic\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 06:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-22"}

Since 1970s, several TCP variants have been developed in\norder to cope with the fast increasing of network capacities especially in high\nBandwidth Delay Product (high-BDP) networks. In these TCP variants, several\napproaches have been used, some of these approaches have the ability to\nestimate available bandwidths and some react based on network loss and/or delay\nchanges. This variety of the used approaches arises many consequent problems\nwith different levels of dependability and accuracy. Indeed, a particular TCP\nvariant which is proper for wireless networks, may not fit for high-BDP wired\nnetworks and vice versa. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a comparison\nbetween the high-speed TCP variants that have a high level of importance\nespecially after the fast growth of networks bandwidths. In this paper,\nhigh-speed TCP variants, that are implemented in Linux and available for\nresearch, have been evaluated using NS2 network simulator. This performance\nevaluation presents the advantages and disadvantages of these TCP variants in\nterms of throughput, loss-ratio and fairness over high-BDP networks. The\nresults reveal that, CUBIC and YeAH overcome the other highspeed TCP variants\nin different cases of buffer size. However, they still require more improvement\nto extend their ability to fully utilize the high-speed bandwidths, especially\nwhen the applied buffer is near-zero or less than the BDP of the link.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 06:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-13"}
