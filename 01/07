Is\nlambda-calculus a reasonable machine? Is there a way to measure the\ncomputational complexity of a lambda-term? This paper presents the first\ncomplete positive answer to this long-standing problem. Moreover, our answer is\ncompletely machine-independent and based over a standard notion in the theory\nof lambda-calculus: the length of a leftmost-outermost derivation to normal\nform is an invariant cost model. Such a theorem cannot be proved by directly\nrelating lambda-calculus with Turing machines or random access machines,\nbecause of the size explosion problem: there are terms that in a linear number\nof steps produce an exponentially long output. The first step towards the\nsolution is to shift to a notion of evaluation for which the length and the\nsize of the output are linearly related. This is done by adopting the linear\nsubstitution calculus (LSC), a calculus of explicit substitutions modeled after\nlinear logic proof nets and admitting a decomposition of leftmost-outermost\nderivations with the desired property. Thus, the LSC is invariant with respect\nto, say, random access machines. The second step is to show that LSC is\ninvariant with respect to the lambda-calculus. The size explosion problem seems\nto imply that this is not possible: having the same notions of normal form,\nevaluation in the LSC is exponentially longer than in the lambda-calculus. We\nsolve such an impasse by introducing a new form of shared normal form and\nshared reduction, deemed useful. Useful evaluation avoids those steps that only\nunshare the output without contributing to beta-redexes, i.e. the steps that\ncause the blow-up in size. The main technical contribution of the paper is\nindeed the definition of useful reductions and the thorough analysis of their\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2016 16:31:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2016 13:45:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

Intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars can generate Li\nthrough the Cameron-Fowler conveyor, but the existence of Li-rich, low-mass red\ngiant branch (RGB) stars is puzzling. Globular clusters are the best sites to\nexamine this phenomenon because it is straightforward to determine membership\nin the cluster and to identify the evolutionary state of each star. In 72 hours\nof Keck/DEIMOS exposures in 25 clusters, we found four Li-rich RGB and two\nLi-rich AGB stars. There were 1696 RGB and 125 AGB stars with measurements or\nupper limits consistent with normal abundances of Li. Hence, the frequency of\nLi-richness in globular clusters is (0.2 +/- 0.1)% for the RGB, (1.6 +/- 1.1)%\nfor the AGB, and (0.3 +/- 0.1)% for all giants. Because the Li-rich RGB stars\nare on the lower RGB, Li self-generation mechanisms proposed to occur at the\nluminosity function bump or He core flash cannot explain these four lower RGB\nstars. We propose the following origin for Li enrichment: (1) All luminous\ngiants experience a brief phase of Li enrichment at the He core flash. (2) All\npost-RGB stars with binary companions on the lower RGB will engage in mass\ntransfer. This scenario predicts that 0.1% of lower RGB stars will appear\nLi-rich due to mass transfer from a recently Li-enhanced companion. This\nfrequency is at the lower end of our confidence interval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2016 21:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2016 21:33:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-10"}

We discuss several\nmotivated models that can exhibit same-flavor displaced leptons: gauge\nmediation with co-NLSP sleptons, extended gauge mediation, R-parity violation,\nand lepton-flavored dark matter that freezes in during a matter-dominated era\nof the early universe. To address this gap, we propose a straightforward\nextension of the CMS search for leptons with large impact parameters, and\nproject sensitivity to these scenarios at 13 TeV. Throughout this analysis, we\nhighlight several methods whereby LHC searches for exotic long-lived objects\ncould potentially improve their sensitivity to the displaced leptons\noriginating from gauge mediation and beyond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2016 21:03:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 17:06:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

One promising approach to constrain this feedback\nis through measurements of CMB spectral distortions due to the thermal\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect, whose magnitude is directly proportional to\nthe energy input by AGN. Here we co-add South Pole Telescope SZ (SPT-SZ) survey\ndata around a large set of massive quiescent elliptical galaxies at z >= 0.5.\nWe use data from the Blanco Cosmology Survey and VISTA Hemisphere Survey to\ncreate a large catalog of galaxies split up into two redshift bins, with 3394\ngalaxies at 0.5 <= z <= 1.0 and 924 galaxies at 1.0 <= z <= 1.5, with typical\nstellar masses of 1.5 x 10^11 M_Sun. We then co-add the emission around these\ngalaxies, resulting in a measured tSZ signal at 2.2 sigma significance for the\nlower redshift bin and a contaminating signal at 1.1 sigma for the higher\nredshift bin.

Optimized with numerical methods, our elemental gratings consist of a\npartially-etched crystalline-silicon film on a quartz substrate.

By arranging two such reflectors sequentially with orthogonal\nperiodicities, there results an unpolarized spectral band that exceeds those of\nthe individual polarized bands. In the experiments reported herein, we achieve\nzero-order reflectance exceeding 97% under unpolarized light incidence over a\n500-nm-wide wavelength band in the near-infrared domain. Moreover, the resonant\nunpolarized broadband accommodates an ultra-high-reflection band spanning ~85\nnm and exceeding 99.9% in efficiency.

The\nadversary model is simultaneous compromise of DER nodes by strategic\nmanipulation of generation set-points. The loss to the defender (DN operator)\nincludes loss of voltage regulation and cost of induced load control under\nsupply-demand mismatch caused by the attack. A 3-stage\nDefender-Attacker-Defender (DAD) game is formulated: in Stage 1, the defender\nchooses a security strategy to secure a subset of DER nodes; in Stage 2, the\nattacker compromises a set of vulnerable DERs and injects false generation\nset-points; in Stage 3, the defender responds by controlling loads and\nuncompromised DERs. Solving this trilevel optimization problem is hard due to\nnonlinear power flows and mixed-integer decision variables. To address this\nchallenge, the problem is approximated by a tractable formulation based on\nlinear power flows. The set of critical DER nodes and the set-point\nmanipulations characterizing the optimal attack strategy are computed. An\niterative greedy approach to compute attacker-defender strategies for the\noriginal nonlinear problem is proposed.

In this paper,\nwe study the delay-performance for the M2M uplink from the sensors to a\nProgrammable Logic Controller (PLC) in a industrial automation scenario. The\nuplink traffic can be broadly classified as either Periodic Update (PU) and\nEvent Driven (ED). The PU arrivals from different sensors are periodic,\nsynchronized by the PLC and need to be processed by a prespecified firm latency\ndeadline. On the other hand, the ED arrivals are random, have low-arrival rate,\nbut may need to be processed quickly depending upon the criticality of the\napplication. To accommodate these contrasting Quality-of-Service (QoS)\nrequirements, we model the utility of PU and ED packets using step function and\nsigmoidal functions of latency respectively. Our goal is to maximize the\noverall system utility while being proportionally fair to both PU and ED data.\nTo this end, we propose a novel online QoS-aware packet scheduler that gives\npriority to ED data as long as that results the latency deadline is met for PU\ndata.

Truncating the classical Shannon sampling series results\nin an unsatisfactory convergence rate due to the slow decayness of the sinc\nfunction. To overcome this drawback, a simple and highly effective method,\ncalled the Gaussian regularization of the Shannon series, was proposed in the\nengineering and has received remarkable attention. It works by multiplying the\nsinc function in the Shannon series with a regularized Gaussian function. L.\nQian (Proc. Amer. Math.

In this paper, we propose a\nuser-centric interference nulling (IN) scheme in a downlink large-scale HetNet\nto improve coverage/outage probability by improving each user's SIR. This IN\nscheme utilizes at most maximum IN degree of freedom (DoF) at each macro-BS to\navoid interference to uniformly selected macro (pico) users with\nsignal-to-individual-interference ratio (SIIR) below a macro (pico) IN\nthreshold, where the maximum IN DoF and the two IN thresholds are three design\nparameters. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we first obtain a tractable\nexpression of the coverage (equivalently outage) probability. Then, we analyze\nthe asymptotic coverage/outage probability in the low and high SIR threshold\nregimes. The analytical results indicate that the maximum IN DoF can affect the\norder gain of the outage probability in the low SIR threshold regime, but\ncannot affect the order gain of the coverage probability in the high SIR\nthreshold regime. Moreover, we characterize the optimal maximum IN DoF which\noptimizes the asymptotic coverage/outage probability. The optimization results\nreveal that the IN scheme can linearly improve the outage probability in the\nlow SIR threshold regime, but cannot improve the coverage probability in the\nhigh SIR threshold regime.

The interpretation of such models regarding neuronal\nimplementation of the human motor system is not clear. An important aspects of\noptimal control policies is the notion of cost. Optimal control seeks to\nminimize a notion of cost, while meeting certain goals. We offer a method to\ntransform current methods in the literature from their traditional form by\nchanging the norm by which cost is assessed. We show how sparsity can be\nintroduced into current optimal approaches that use continuous control signals.\nWe assess cost using the infinity norm. This results in optimal signals which\ncan be represented by a small amount of Dirac delta functions. Sparsity has\nplayed an important role in theoretical neuroscience for information processing\n(such as vision). In this work, to obtain sparse control signals, the infinity\nnorm is used as a penalty on the control signal, which is then encoded with\nDirac delta functions. We show, for a basic physical system, a point mass can\nbe moved between two points in a way that resembles human fast reaching\nmovements. Despite the sparse nature of the control signal, the movements that\nresult are continuous and smooth. These control signals are simpler than their\nnon-sparse counterparts, yet yield comparable results when applied towards\nmodeling reaching movements. In addition, such sparse control signals resemble\na sequence of spikes, giving this approach a biological interpretation. Actual\nneuronal implementations are more complex. However, this work shows, in\nprinciple, that sparsely encoded control signals are a plausible implementation\nfor the control of reaching movements. Leading techniques for modeling human\nmovements can easily be adjusted in order to introduce sparsity, with a\nbiological interpretation and the simplified information content of the control\nsignal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2016 06:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-08"}

At finite temperatures,\ninhomogeneous polymers exhibit non-trivial thermal fluctuations. In a broader\ncontext, these are relatively simple examples for fluctuations in spatially\ninhomogeneous systems, which are less understood compared to their homogeneous\ncounterparts. We develop a statistical theory of torsional, extensional and\nbending Gaussian fluctuations of inhomogeneous polymers, where the\ninhomogeneity is an inclusion of variable size and mechanical properties, using\nboth continuum and discrete approaches. First, we analytically calculate the\ncomplete eigenvalue and eigenmode spectrum of the inhomogeneous polymer within\na continuum field theory. In particular, we show that the wavenumber inside and\noutside of the inclusion is nearly linear in the eigenvalue index, with a\nnontrivial coefficient. Second, we solve the corresponding discrete problem,\nand highlight fundamental differences between the continuum and discrete\nspectra. In particular, we demonstrate that above a certain wavenumber the\ndiscrete spectrum changes qualitatively and discrete evanescent eigenmodes,\nthat do not have continuum counterparts, emerge. The statistical thermodynamic\nimplications of these differences are then explored by calculating\nfluctuation-induced forces associated with free-energy variations with either\nthe inclusion properties (e.g.~inhomogeneity formed by adsorbing molecules) or\nwith an external geometric constraint. The former, which is the\nfluctuation-induced contribution to the adsorbing molecules binding force, is\nshown to be affected by short wavelengths and thus cannot be calculated using\nthe continuum approach.

The basic requirement is to satisfy both\ncriteria concerning the regularity of the surface and aesthetic concepts. With\nregard to the aesthetic quality, it is well known that interpolatory methods\noften produce shape artifacts when the data points are unevenly spaced. In the\nunivariate setting, this problem can be overcome, or at least mitigated, by\nexploiting a proper non-uniform parametrization, that accounts for the geometry\nof the data. Moreover, recently, the same principle has been generalized and\nproven to be effective in the context of bivariate interpolatory subdivision\nschemes. In this paper, we propose a construction for parametric surfaces of\ngood aesthetic quality and high smoothness that interpolate quadrilateral\nmeshes of arbitrary topology. In the classical tensor product setting the same\nparameter interval must be shared by an entire row or column of mesh edges.\nConversely, in this paper, we assign a different parameter interval to each\nedge of the mesh. This particular structure, which we call an augmented\nparametrization, allows us to interpolate each section polyline of the mesh at\nparameters values that prevent wiggling of the resulting curve or other\ninterpolation artifacts. This yields high quality interpolatory surfaces. The\nproposed surfaces are a generalization of the local univariate spline\ninterpolants introduced in Beccari et al.(2013) and Antonelli et al.(2014),\nthat can have arbitrary continuity and arbitrary order of polynomial\nreproduction. In particular, these surfaces retain the same smoothness of the\nunderlying class of univariate splines in the regular regions of the mesh.\nMoreover, in mesh regions containing vertices of valence other than 4, we\nsuitably define G1- or G2-continuous surface patches that join the neighboring\nregular ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2016 08:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-08"}

Meteorites show that dynamics was important in\ndetermining the dust distribution in the Solar Nebula and needs to be\nconsidered if we are to understand the global chemistry in discs. 1D radial\ncondensation sequences can only simulate one disc layer at a time and cannot\ndescribe the global chemistry or the complexity of meteorites. To address these\nlimitations, we compute for the first time the two dimensional distribution of\ncondensates in the inner Solar Nebula using a thermodynamic equilibrium model,\nand derive timescales for vertical settling and radial migration of dust.\n  We find two enstatite-rich zones within 1 AU from the young Sun: a band ~0.1\nAU thick in the upper optically-thin layer of the disc interior to 0.8 AU, and\nin the optically-thick disc midplane out to ~0.4 AU. The two enstatite-rich\nzones support recent evidence that Mercury and enstatite chondrites shared a\nbulk material with similar composition. Our results are also consistent with\ninfrared observation of protoplanetary disc which show emission of\nenstatite-rich dust in the inner surface of discs.\n  The resulting chemistry and dynamics suggests that the formation of the bulk\nmaterial of enstatite chondrites occurred in the inner surface layer of the\ndisc, within 0.4~AU. We also propose a simple alternative scenario in which gas\nfractionation and vertical settling of the condensates lead to an\nenstatite-chondritic bulk material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2016 11:10:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

The cluster\ncontains multiple high-metallicity regions with sharp edges. Relative to an\nazimuthal average, the deviations of metallicity and surface brightness are\ncorrelated, and the temperature is inversely correlated, as expected if the\nlarger scale asymmetries in the cluster are dominated by sloshing motions.\nAround the western cold front are a series of ~7 kpc 'notches', suggestive of\nKelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The cold front width varies from 4 kpc down to\nclose to the electron mean free path. Inside the front are multiple metallicity\nblobs on scales of 5-10 kpc, which could have been uplifted by AGN activity,\nalso explaining the central metallicity drop and flat inner metallicity\nprofile. Close to the nucleus are multiple shocks, including a 1.9-kpc-radius\ninner shell-like structure and a weak 1.1-1.4 Mach number shock around the\ncentral cavities. Within a 10 kpc radius are 9 depressions in surface\nbrightness, several of which appear to be associated with radio emission. The\nshocks and cavities imply that the nucleus has been repeatedly active on 5-10\nMyr timescales, indicating a tight balance between heating and cooling. We\nconfirm the presence of a series of linear quasi-periodic structures. If they\nare sound waves, the ~5 kpc spacing implies a period of 6 Myr, similar to the\nages of the shocks and cavities.

The architecture of graphene\nfield-effect transistors (FET) has not significantly changed, and the\nintegration of devices at the wafer scale has generally not been sought.\nCurrently, whenever an electrolyte-gated FET (EGFET) is used, an external,\ncumbersome, out-of-plane gate electrode is required.

In this architecture, source,\ndrain, and gate are in the same plane, eliminating the need for an external\ngate electrode and the use of an additional reservoir to confine the\nelectrolyte inside the transistor active zone. This planar structure with an\nintegrated gate allows for wafer-scale fabrication of high-performance graphene\nEGFETs, with carrier mobility up to 1800 cm2 V-1 s-1. As a proof-of principle,\na chemical sensor was achieved. It is shown that the sensor can discriminate\nbetween saline solutions of different concentrations.

This allows us to derive a general\nframework for training Kronecker product kernel methods, as specific examples\nwe implement Kronecker ridge regression and support vector machine algorithms.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to accurate\nmodels, while allowing order of magnitude improvements in training and\nprediction time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2016 12:25:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 10:18:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2017 07:31:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-07"}

We confirm the results obtained from\nclassical HII region analysis. In addition to the general negative gradient, an\nouter flattening can be observed in the oxygen abundance radial profile. An\ninner drop is also found in some cases. There is a common abundance gradient\nbetween 0.5 and 2.0 r$_e$ of $\\alpha_{O/H} = -\\,0.075\\,\\rm{dex}/r_e$ with a\nscatter of $\\sigma = 0.016\\,\\rm{dex}/r_e$ when normalising the distances to the\ndisc effective radius.

Within this, the\ntheory of device-independent robust self-testing via Bell tests has reached a\nlevel of maturity now that many quantum states and measurements can be verified\nwithout direct access to the quantum systems: interaction with the devices is\nsolely classical. However, the requirements for this robust level of\nverification are daunting and require high levels of experimental accuracy. In\nthis paper we discuss the possibility of self-testing where we have direct\naccess to part of the quantum device. This motivates the study of self-testing\nvia EPR-steering, an intermediate form of entanglement verification between\nfull state tomography and a Bell test. Quantum non-locality implies\nEPR-steering so results in the former can apply in the latter, but we ask what\nadvantages may be gleaned from the latter over the former given that one can do\npartial state tomography. We show in the case of self-testing a maximally\nentangled two-qubit state, or ebit, EPR-steering allows for simpler analysis\nand better error tolerance than in the case of full device-independence. On the\nother hand, this improvement is only a constant improvement and (up to\nconstants) is the best one can hope for. Finally, we indicate that the main\nadvantage in self-testing based on EPR-steering could be in the case of\nself-testing multi-partite quantum states and measurements. For example, it may\nbe easier to establish a tensor product structure for a particular party's\nHilbert space even if we do not have access to their part of the global quantum\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2016 14:57:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 12:06:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 15:22:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-08"}

Turbulence occurs in stars\nprimarily due to nuclear burning at different mass coordinates within the star.\nThe understanding and correct treatment of turbulence and turbulent mixing at\nconvective boundaries in stellar models has been studied for decades but still\nlacks a definitive solution. This paper presents initial results of a study on\nconvective boundary mixing (CBM) in massive stars. The 'stiffness' of a\nconvective boundary can be quantified using the bulk Richardson number\n($\\textrm{Ri}_B$), the ratio of the potential energy for restoration of the\nboundary to the kinetic energy of turbulent eddies. A 'stiff' boundary\n($\\textrm{Ri}_B \\sim 10^4$) will suppress CBM, whereas in the opposite case a\n'soft' boundary ($\\textrm{Ri}_B \\sim 10$) will be more susceptible to CBM. One\nof the key results obtained so far is that lower convective boundaries (closer\nto the centre) of nuclear burning shells are 'stiffer' than the corresponding\nupper boundaries, implying limited CBM at lower shell boundaries. This is in\nagreement with 3D hydrodynamic simulations carried out by Meakin and Arnett\n[The Astrophysical Journal 667:448-475, 2007].

Under current\nfree-flight-like paradigm, wherein a UAV can travel along any route as long as\nit avoids restricted airspace and altitudes. However, this requires expensive\non-board sensing and communication as well as substantial human effort in order\nto ensure avoidance of obstacles and collisions. The increased cost serves as\nan impediment to the emergence and development of broader UAV applications. The\nmain contribution of this work is to propose the use of pre-established route\nnetwork for UAV traffic management, which allows: (i) pre- mapping of obstacles\nalong the route network to reduce the onboard sensing requirements and the\nassociated costs for avoiding such obstacles; and (ii) use of well-developed\nrouting algorithms to select UAV schedules that avoid conflicts. Available\nGPS-based navigation can be used to fly the UAV along the selected route and\ntime schedule with relatively low added cost, which therefore, reduces the\nbarrier to entry into new UAV-applications market. Finally, this article\nproposes a new decoupling scheme for conflict-free transitions between edges of\nthe route network at each node of the route network to reduce potential\nconflicts between UAVs and ensuing delays.

A wide range of bi-variable correlations both linear and\nnonlinear can be evaluated by ART efficiently and equitably even if nothing is\nknown about the specific types of those relationships. ART compensates the\ndisadvantages of Reshef's model in which no polynomial time precise algorithm\nexists and the \"local random\" phenomenon can not be identified. As a class of\nnonparametric exploration statistics, ART is applied for analyzing a dataset of\n10 American classical indexes, as a result, lots of bi-variable correlations\nare discovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2016 09:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-26"}
