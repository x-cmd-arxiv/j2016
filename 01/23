Aims: We are able to quantify both the obscured\nand unobscured star formation rates, as well as the presence of active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) as a function of the environment in which the galaxy is located.\nMethods: We targeted the clusters with unprecedented deep infrared Spitzer\nobservations (0.2 mJy @ 24 micron), near-IR Palomar imaging and optical WIYN\nspectroscopy. The extent of our observations ($\\sim$ 3 virial radii) covers the\nvast range of possible environments, from the very dense cluster centre to the\nvery rarefied cluster outskirts and accretion regions. Results: The star\nforming members of the two clusters present star formation rates comparable\nwith those measured in coeval field galaxies.

Because the fidelity of a\nprotectively measured quantum state is determined by the amount of state\ndisturbance incurred during each protective measurement, it is crucial that the\ninitial quantum state of the system is disturbed as little as possible. Here we\nshow how to systematically minimize the state disturbance in the course of a\nprotective measurement, thus enabling the maximization of the fidelity of the\nquantum-state measurement.

Such tests, however, require\nknowledge of rotating black hole solutions in modified gravity theories, a\nclass of which does not admit the Kerr metric as a solution. Several rotating\nblack hole solutions in modified theories have only been found in the\nslow-rotation approximation (i.e. assuming the spin angular momentum is much\nsmaller than the mass squared). We here investigate whether the systematic\nerror due to the approximate nature of these black hole metrics is small enough\nrelative to the observational error to allow their use in electromagnetic\nobservations to constrain deviations from General Relativity. We address this\nby considering whether electromagnetic observables constructed from a\nslow-rotation approximation to the Kerr metric can fit observables constructed\nfrom the full Kerr metric with systematic errors smaller than current\nobservational errors. We focus on black hole shadow and continuum spectrum\nobservations, as these are the least influenced by accretion disk physics, with\ncurrent observational errors of about 10%. We find that the fractional\nsystematic error introduced by using a second-order, slowly-rotating Kerr\nmetric is at most 2% for shadows created by black holes with dimensionless\nspins $\\chi\\leq0.6$. We also find that the systematic error introduced by using\nthe slowly-rotating Kerr metric as an exact metric when constructing continuum\nspectrum observables is negligible for black holes with dimensionless spins of\n$\\chi \\lesssim 0.9$.

Computation of such sequences is important to study millisecond\npulsars and other fast spinning compact stars. Our EoS models can support a\ngravitational mass (M_G) and a spin frequency at least up to approximately 3.0\nsolar mass and approximately 1250 Hz respectively, and hence are fully\nconsistent with measured M_G and spin frequency values. This paper reports the\neffects of B_eff and a_4 on measurable compact star properties, which could be\nuseful to find possible ways to constrain these fundamental quark matter\nparameters, within the ambit of our EoS models. We confirm that a lower B_eff\nallows a higher mass. Besides, for known M_G and spin frequency, measurable\nparameters, such as stellar radius, radius-to-mass ratio and moment of inertia,\nincrease with the decrease of B_eff. Our calculations also show that a_4\nsignificantly affects the stellar rest mass and the total stellar binding\nenergy. As a result, a_4 can have signatures in evolutions of both accreting\nand non-accreting compact stars, and the observed distribution of stellar mass\nand spin and other source parameters.

Locally\nrepairable codes (LRCs) are the family of codes such that every symbol has\nlocality $r$.\n  In this paper, we focus on (linear) codes whose individual symbols can be\npartitioned into disjoint subsets such that the symbols in one subset have\ndifferent locality than the symbols in other. We call such codes as \"codes with\nunequal locality\". For codes with \"unequal information locality\", we compute a\ntight upper bound on the minimum distance as a function of number of\ninformation symbols of each locality. We demonstrate that the construction of\nPyramid codes can be adapted to design codes with unequal information locality\nthat achieve the minimum distance bound. This result generalizes the classical\nresult of Gopalan et al. for codes with unequal locality. Next, we consider\ncodes with \"unequal all symbol locality\", and establish an upper bound on the\nminimum distance as a function of number of symbols of each locality. We show\nthat the construction based on rank-metric codes by Silberstein et al. can be\nadapted to obtain codes with unequal all symbol locality that achieve the\nminimum distance bound. Finally, we introduce the concept of \"locality\nrequirement\" on a code, which can be viewed as a recoverability requirement on\nsymbols. Information locality requirement on a code essentially specifies the\nminimum number of information symbols of different localities that must be\npresent in the code. We present a greedy algorithm that assigns localities to\ninformation symbols so as to maximize the minimum distance among all codes that\nsatisfy a given locality requirement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2016 20:57:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-25"}

Detailed UV radiative transfer models that take into account\nscattering and absorption can explain the morphology of the UV haloes, and they\nrequire the presence of an additional thick dust disc next the to traditional\nthin disc for half of the galaxies in their sample.

Seven percent of them, though, are radio-loud and often show a flat\nradio-spectrum (F-NLS1s). This, along to the detection of $\\gamma$-ray emission\ncoming from them, is usually interpreted as a sign of a relativistic beamed jet\noriented along the line of sight. An important aspect of these AGN that must be\nunderstood is the nature of their parent population, in other words how do they\nappear when observed under different angles. In the recent literature it has\nbeen proposed that a specific class of radio-galaxies, compact-steep sources\n(CSS) classified as high excitation radio galaxies (HERG), can represent the\nparent population of F-NLS1s. To test this hypothesis in a quantitative way,in\nthis paper we analyzed the only two statistically complete samples of CSS/HERGs\nand F-NLS1s available in the literature. We derived the black hole mass and\nEddington ratio distributions, and we built for the first time the radio\nluminosity function of F-NLS1s. Finally, we applied a relativistic beaming\nmodel to the luminosity function of CSS/HERGs, and compared the result with the\nobserved function of F-NLS1s. We found that compact steep-spectrum sources are\nvalid parent candidates and that F-NLS1s, when observed with a different\ninclination, might actually appear as CSS/HERGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2016 21:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 15:21:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 15:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

We examine two cases: (i) data aggregation (only one sink node\ncomputes) and (ii) consensus (all nodes compute the same function). By\nquantifying the accumulation of information loss in distributed computing, we\nobtain fundamental limits on network computation rate as a function of\nincremental distortions (and hence incremental loss of information) along the\nedges of the network. The above characterization, based on quantifying\ndistortion accumulation, offers an improvement over classical cut-set type\ntechniques which are based on overall distortions instead of incremental\ndistortions. This quantification of information loss qualitatively resembles\ninformation dissipation in cascaded channels [1]. Surprisingly, this\naccumulation effect of distortion happens even at infinite blocklength.\nCombining this observation with an inequality on the dominance of mean-square\nquantities over relative-entropy quantities, we obtain outer bounds on the rate\ndistortion function that are tighter than classical cut-set bounds by a\ndifference which can be arbitrarily large in both data aggregation and\nconsensus.

The simple model ${f^2}FF$ used to generate the\nPMF during the inflation era. It is based on the breaking of conformal symmetry\nof electromagnetism during inflation. It is attractive because it is stable\nunder perturbations and leads to a scale invariant PMF. However, it may suffer\nfrom two problems: Backreaction and strong coupling. In the first case, the\nelectromagnetic energy may exceed the energy of inflation, ${\\rho\n_{{\\rm{Inf}}}}$. In the second case, the effective electric charges become\nexcessively large if we want to retrieve the standard electromagnetism at the\nend of inflation. In this research, we investigate the generation of PMF under\nthree different models of inflation in order to avoid the backreaction problem.\nWe compute magnetic and electric spectra generated by the ${f^2}FF$ model in\nthe context of large field inflation (LFI), natural inflation (NI) and\n${R^2}$-inflation, for all possible values of model parameters for de Sitter\nand power law expansion of inflation. The results of the research show that the\nscale invariant PMF can be generated in these models and the problem of\nbackreaction may be avoided in some observational ranges. In $R^2$-inflation,\nwhich is preferred by the recent results of Planck 2015, we calculate the upper\nof the scale invariant PMF generated by ${f^2}FF$ and in turns we find that the\nupper limit of present magnetic field, ${B_0} < 8.058 \\times {10^{ -\n9}}{\\rm{G}}$.

These works have been quite promising in that they have developed\nlow-complexity index scheduling policies that are delay-optimal (in a large\ndeviation rate-function sense). However, these policies require that the\nchannel is ON or OFF in each time-slot with a fixed probability (i.e., there is\nno memory in the system), while the reality is that due to channel fading and\ndoppler shift, channels are often time-correlated in these cellular systems.\nThus, an important open question is whether one can find simple index\nscheduling policies that are delay-optimal even when the channels are\ntime-correlated. In this paper, we attempt to answer this question for\ntime-correlated ON/OFF channels. In particular, we show that the class of\noldest packets first (OPF) policies that give a higher priority to packets with\na large delay is delay rate-function optimal under two conditions: 1) The\nchannel is non-negatively correlated, and 2) The distribution of the OFF period\nis geometric.

The most\ncommon characterization of the semantics of a cardinality-based diagram is the\nset of flat multisets over features satisfying the constraints.

We address this problem\nby proposing another multiset theory for the cardinality-based feature diagram,\ncalled the hierarchical theory of the diagram.

However, it is still not used\nwidely to date because it requires expertise on both programming and agent\ntechnology; gaps among requirements, agent design, and agent deployment also\npose more difficulties. Goal Net methodology attempts to solve these issues\nwith a goal-oriented approach that resembles human behaviours, and an agent\ndesigner that supports agent development using this philosophy. However, there\nare limitations on existing Goal Net Designer, the design and modelling\ncomponent of the agent designer. Those limitations, including limited access,\ndifficult deployment, inflexibility in user operations, design workflows\nagainst typical Goal Net methodology workflows, and lack of data protection,\nhave inhibited widespread adoption of Goal Net methodology.\n  Motivated by this, this book focuses on improvements on Goal Net Designer. In\nthis project, Goal Net Designer is completely re-implemented using new\ntechnology with optimised software architecture and design. It allows access\nfrom all major desktop operating systems, as well as in web environment via all\nmodern browsers. Enhancements such as refined workflows, model validation tool,\naccess control, team collaboration tool, and link to compiler make Goal Net\nDesigner a fully functional and powerful Integrated Development Environment.\nUser friendliness and usability are greatly enhanced by simplifying user's\nactions to accomplish their tasks. User behaviour logging and quantitative\nfeedback channel are also included to allow Goal Net Designer to continuously\nevolve with the power of big data analytics in future. To evaluate the new Goal\nNet Designer, a teachable agent has been developed with the help of Goal Net\nDesigner and the development process is illustrated in a case study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2016 07:15:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-26"}

In such studies as developmental ones or studies\nacross generations in which days or months of vocalizations must be analyzed,\nmethods for automatic recognition would be strongly desired. Although methods\nfor automatic speech recognition for application purposes have been intensively\nstudied, blindly applying them for biological purposes may not be an optimal\nsolution. This is because, unlike human speech recognition, analysis of\nsequential vocalizations often requires accurate extraction of timing\ninformation. In the present study we propose automated systems suitable for\nrecognizing birdsong, one of the most intensively investigated sequential\nvocalizations, focusing on the three properties of the birdsong. First, a song\nis a sequence of vocal elements, called notes, which can be grouped into\ncategories. Second, temporal structure of birdsong is precisely controlled,\nmeaning that temporal information is important in song analysis. Finally, notes\nare produced according to certain probabilistic rules, which may facilitate the\naccurate song recognition. We divided the procedure of song recognition into\nthree sub-steps: local classification, boundary detection, and global\nsequencing, each of which corresponds to each of the three properties of\nbirdsong. We compared the performances of several different ways to arrange\nthese three steps. As results, we demonstrated a hybrid model of a deep neural\nnetwork and a hidden Markov model is effective in recognizing birdsong with\nvariable note sequences. We propose suitable arrangements of methods according\nto whether accurate boundary detection is needed. Also we designed the new\nmeasure to jointly evaluate the accuracy of note classification and boundary\ndetection. Our methods should be applicable, with small modification and\ntuning, to the songs in other species that hold the three properties of the\nsequential vocalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2016 07:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

Dusty gas is ejected when the central luminosity exceeds the\neffective Eddington luminosity for dust.

Dusty outflows can reach large radii with a range of\nvelocities (depending on the outflowing shell configuration and the ambient\ndensity distribution) and may account for the observed CGM gas.

On the other hand, the most powerful AGN outflow events can potentially\ndrive gas out of the local galaxy group.

The formulation proposes that the propagation of the\nfire-front is the sum of a drifting component (obtained from an existing\nwildfire simulator without turbulence and fire-spotting) and a random\nfluctuating component. The modelling of the random effects is embodied in a\nprobability density function accounting for the fluctuations around the fire\nperimeter which is given by the drifting component. In past, this formulation\nhas been applied to include these random effects into a wildfire simulator\nbased on an Eulerian moving interface method, namely the Level Set Method\n(LSM), but in this paper the same formulation is adapted for a wildfire\nsimulator based on a Lagrangian front tracking technique, namely the Discrete\nEvent System Specification (DEVS). The main highlight of the present study is\nthe comparison of the performance of a Lagrangian and an Eulerian moving\ninterface method when applied to wild-land fire propagation. Simple idealised\nnumerical experiments are used to investigate the potential applicability of\nthe proposed formulation to DEVS and to compare its behaviour with respect to\nthe LSM.

To allow for extended in-situ\nmeasurements, the spacecraft needs to be decelerated. One of the currently most\npromising technologies for deceleration is the magnetic sail which uses the\ndeflection of interstellar matter via a magnetic field to decelerate the\nspacecraft. However, while the magnetic sail is very efficient at high\nvelocities, its performance decreases with lower speeds. This leads to\ndeceleration durations of several decades depending on the spacecraft mass.\nWithin the context of Project Dragonfly, initiated by the Initiative of\nInterstellar Studies (i4is), this paper proposes a novel concept for\ndecelerating a spacecraft on an interstellar mission by combining a magnetic\nsail with an electric sail. Combining the sails compensates for each\ntechnologys shortcomings: A magnetic sail is more effective at higher\nvelocities than the electric sail and vice versa. It is demonstrated that using\nboth sails sequentially outperforms using only the magnetic or electric sail\nfor various mission scenarios and velocity ranges, at a constant total\nspacecraft mass. For example, for decelerating from 5% c, to interplanetary\nvelocities, a spacecraft with both sails needs about 29 years, whereas the\nelectric sail alone would take 35 years and the magnetic sail about 40 years\nwith a total spacecraft mass of 8250 kg. Furthermore, it is assessed how the\ncombined deceleration system affects the optimal overall mission architecture\nfor different spacecraft masses and cruising speeds. Future work would\ninvestigate how operating both systems in parallel instead of sequentially\nwould affect its performance. Moreover, uncertainties in the density of\ninterstellar matter and sail properties need to be explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2016 17:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}
