In this\narticle, we relax the axisymmetry approximation and introduce a methodology\nthat derives 3D gravitational potentials of disk-like objects and robustly\nestimates the impacts of asymmetries on circular velocities in the disk\nmidplane. Mass distribution models can then be directly fitted to asymmetric\nline-of-sight velocity fields. Applied to the grand-design spiral M99, the new\nstrategy shows that circular velocities are highly nonuniform, particularly in\nthe inner disk of the galaxy, as a natural response to the perturbed\ngravitational potential of luminous matter. A cuspy inner density profile of\ndark matter is found in M99, in the usual case where luminous and dark matter\nshare the same center. The impact of the velocity nonuniformity is to make the\ninner profile less steep, although the density remains cuspy. On another hand,\na model where the halo is core dominated and shifted by 2.2-2.5 kpc from the\nluminous mass center is more appropriate to explain most of the kinematical\nlopsidedness evidenced in the velocity field of M99. However, the gravitational\npotential of luminous baryons is not asymmetric enough to explain the\nkinematical lopsidedness of the innermost regions, irrespective of the density\nshape of dark matter. This discrepancy points out the necessity of an\nadditional dynamical process in these regions: possibly a lopsided distribution\nof dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2016 17:02:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 09:27:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

At such aim, we review and analyze a broad range of\noptically-determined dielectric functions e of these elemental materials\navailable in the literature, covering a wide photon energy range (from 0.03 to\n24 eV). It is shown that the contribution of Drude-like carriers to e1 (real\npart of e) in the near-ultraviolet visible is negligible for Bi and Sb and\nmoderate for Ga.

(ii) a frequency dependent spin Hall\nmagnetoimpedance that reduces to the spin Hall magnetoresistance in the dc\nlimit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2016 17:45:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 17:58:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 19:41:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-25"}

On the other hand, the field of\ncompressed sensing is built upon the observation that \"structured\" signals can\nbe recovered from their under-determined set of linear projections. Currently,\nthere is a large gap between the complexity of the structures studied in the\narea of compressed sensing and those employed by the state-of-the-art\ncompression codes. Recent results in the literature on deterministic signals\naim at bridging this gap through devising compressed sensing decoders that\nemploy compression codes. This paper focuses on structured stochastic processes\nand studies the application of rate-distortion codes to compressed sensing of\nsuch signals. The performance of the formerly-proposed compressible signal\npursuit (CSP) algorithm is studied in this stochastic setting. It is proved\nthat in the very low distortion regime, as the blocklength grows to infinity,\nthe CSP algorithm reliably and robustly recovers $n$ instances of a stationary\nprocess from random linear projections as long as their count is slightly more\nthan $n$ times the rate-distortion dimension (RDD) of the source.

This connection establishes the\noptimality of the CSP algorithm at least for memoryless stationary sources, for\nwhich the fundamental limits are known.

Here, we exploit the excellent sensitivity of NuSTAR up to 79 keV to\nanalyze the impact of an X-ray burst on the accretion emission of the neutron\nstar LMXB 4U 1608-52. The ~200 s long X-ray burst occurred during a hard X-ray\nspectral state, and had a peak intensity of ~30-50 per cent of the Eddington\nlimit with no signs of photospheric radius expansion. Spectral analysis\nsuggests that the accretion emission was enhanced up to a factor of ~5 during\nthe X-ray burst. We also applied a linear unsupervised decomposition method,\nnamely non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), to study this X-ray burst. We\nfind that the NMF performs well in characterizing the evolution of the burst\nemission and is a promising technique to study changes in the underlying\naccretion emission in more detail than is possible through conventional\nspectral fitting. For the burst of 4U 1608-52, the NMF suggests a possible\nsoftening of the accretion spectrum during the X-ray burst, which could\npotentially be ascribed to cooling of a corona. Finally, we report a small (~3\nper cent) but significant rise in the accretion emission ~0.5 h before the\nX-ray burst, although it is unclear whether this was related to the X-ray burst\nignition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2016 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-20"}

This pilot survey enabled the development of\nthe hardware and software for rapid data processing, as well as transient\ndetection and follow-up, necessary for the full 270 deg$^2$ survey.\nClassification of variable and transient sources relied heavily on the wealth\nof multi-wavelength data in the Stripe 82 region, supplemented by repeated\nmapping of the region by the Palomar Transient Factory. $3.9^{+0.5}_{-0.9}$% of\nthe detected point sources were found to vary by greater than 30%, consistent\nwith similar studies at 1.4 GHz and 5 GHz. Multi-wavelength photometric data\nand light curves suggest that the variability is mostly due to shock-induced\nflaring in the jets of AGN. Although this was only a pilot survey, we detected\ntwo bona fide transients, associated with an RS CVn binary and a dKe star.\nComparison with existing radio survey data revealed additional highly variable\nand transient sources on timescales between 5-20 years, largely associated with\nrenewed AGN activity. The rates of such AGN possibly imply episodes of enhanced\naccretion and jet activity occurring once every $\\sim$40,000 years in these\ngalaxies.

They have been used to construct\nexplicit toy models realizing many interesting structural features of the\nAdS/CFT correspondence, including the non-uniqueness of bulk operator\nreconstruction in the boundary theory. In this article, we explore the\nholographic properties of networks of random tensors. We find that our models\nnaturally incorporate many features that are analogous to those of the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. When the bond dimension of the tensors is large, we show that\nthe entanglement entropy of boundary regions, whether connected or not, obey\nthe Ryu-Takayanagi entropy formula, a fact closely related to known properties\nof the multipartite entanglement of assistance. Moreover, we find that each\nboundary region faithfully encodes the physics of the entire bulk entanglement\nwedge. Our method is to interpret the average over random tensors as the\npartition function of a classical ferromagnetic Ising model, so that the\nminimal surfaces of Ryu-Takayanagi appear as domain walls. Upon including the\nanalog of a bulk field, we find that our model reproduces the expected\ncorrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula: the minimal surface is displaced and\nthe entropy is augmented by the entanglement of the bulk field. Increasing the\nentanglement of the bulk field ultimately changes the minimal surface\ntopologically in a way similar to creation of a black hole. Extrapolating bulk\ncorrelation functions to the boundary permits the calculation of the scaling\ndimensions of boundary operators, which exhibit a large gap between a small\nnumber of low-dimension operators and the rest.

Grain-surface mechanisms, which were presented as a viable\nalternative, suffer from the fact that they rely on grain surface diffusion of\nheavy radicals, which is not possible thermally at very low temperatures. One\nof the simplest terrestrial complex organic molecules, methanol is believed to\nform on cold grain surfaces following from successive H atom additions on CO.\nUnlike heavier species, H atoms are very mobile on grain surfaces even at 10 K.\nIntermediate species involved in grain surface methanol formation by CO\nhydrogenation are the radicals HCO and CH3O, as well as the stable species\nformaldehyde H2CO.

To date, the most accurate measurements have been obtained with Type\nIa Supernovae and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, providing evidence for the\nexistence of a transition epoch at which the expansion rate changes from\ndecelerated to accelerated. However, these results have been obtained within\nthe framework of specific cosmological models that must be implicitly or\nexplicitly assumed in the measurement. It is therefore crucial to obtain\nmeasurements of the accelerated expansion of the Universe independently of\nassumptions on cosmological models. Here we exploit the unprecedented\nstatistics provided by the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data\nRelease 9 to provide new constraints on the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ using the\nem cosmic chronometers approach. We extract a sample of more than 130000 of the\nmost massive and passively evolving galaxies, obtaining five new\ncosmology-independent $H(z)$ measurements in the redshift range $0.3<z<0.5$,\nwith an accuracy of $\\sim$11-16\\% incorporating both statistical and systematic\nerrors.

First, we\nconsider the thermodynamics of the model beyond the mean-field approach to\ninclude pseudoscalar and scalar mesonic-like fluctuations into the\ngrand-canonical potential. This accounts for the hadronic pressure of the\nsystem below the critical temperature. On the other hand we also implement the\nback reaction of quarks into the Polyakov-loop effective potential bringing a\nreduction of the pressure above $T_c$ from the Stefan-Boltzmann limit.

Assuming the stars formed\nin the same environment/from the same material, any compositional anomalies\nbetween binary components might indicate differences in how material was\nsequestered in planets, or accreted by the star in the process of planet\nformation. We present here a study of the elemental abundance differences\nbetween WASP-94AB, a pair of stars that each host a hot Jupiter exoplanet. The\ntwo stars are very similar in spectral type (F8 and F9), and their ~2700 AU\nseparation suggests their protoplanetary disks were likely not influenced by\nstellar interactions, but WASP-94Ab's orbit -- misaligned with the host star\nspin axis and likely retrograde -- points towards a dynamically active\nformation mechanism, perhaps different than that of WASP-94Bb, which is not\nmisaligned and has nearly circular orbit. Based on our high-quality spectra and\nstrictly relative abundance analysis, we detect a depletion of volatiles\n(~-0.02 dex, on average) and enhancement of refractories (~0.01 dex) in\nWASP-94A relative to B (standard errors are ~0.005 dex). This is different than\nevery other published case of binary host star abundances, in which either no\nsignificant abundance differences are reported, or there is some degree of\nenhancement in all elements, including volatiles. Several scenarios that may\nexplain the abundance trend are discussed, but none can be definitively\naccepted or rejected. Additional high-contrast imaging observations to search\nfor companions that may be dynamically affecting the system, as well as a\nlarger sample of binary host star studies, are needed to better understand the\ncurious abundance trends we observe in WASP-94AB.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2016 00:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

It argues that the gas, through its hydrodynamic properties, plays\na key role in filament structure rather than being a passive passenger in a\npreformed dark matter potential. The dark matter of a galaxy follows the\nclassic equation of collapse of a spherically symmetric overdensity in an\nexpanding universe. In contrast, the gas usually collapses more slowly. The\nrelative rates of collapse of these two components for individual galaxies can\nexplain the varying baryon deficits of the galaxies under the assumption that\nmatter moves along a single filament passing through the galaxy centre, rather\nthan by spherical accretion.

In this paper, we propose\na novel two-stage approach by integration of $k$-nearest-neighbor (KNN) and\nsupport vector machine (SVM) methods together. In the first stage, we apply KNN\nalgorithm on photometric data and estimate their corresponding z$_{\\rm phot}$.\nBy analysis, we find two dense regions with catastrophic failure, one in the\nrange of z$_{\\rm phot}\\in[0.3,1.2]$, the other in the range of z$_{\\rm phot}\\in\n[1.2,2.1]$.

In the high\ndimensional feature space, many outlier points resulting from catastrophic\nfailure by simple Euclidean distance computation in KNN can be identified by a\nclassification hyperplane of SVM and further be corrected.

They ask administrators to directly edit the\ncorresponding entries with little guidance or assistance. However, this\nassumption no longer holds for todays administrator group which has expanded\ngreatly to include non- and semi-professional administrators. In this paper, we\nprovide an HCI view of today's configuration problems, and articulate system\nconfiguration as a new HCI problem.

Diffusion\nmodel is suitable to deal with it. The form of diffusion coefficient in a\ndiffusion model is crucial. Because the overshoot mixing is related to the\nconvective heat transport (i.e., entropy mixing), there should be a similarity\nbetween them. A recent overshoot mixing model shows consistence between\ncomposition mixing and entropy mixing in overshoot region. A prerequisite to\napply the model is to know the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy.\nThe dissipation rate can be worked out by solving turbulent convection models\n(TCMs).

Unlike previous designs, the effective gauge field\nstrength can be controlled via lattice parameters such as the inter-helix\ndistance, significantly reducing radiative losses and enabling applications\nsuch as switchable topological wave-guiding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2016 03:42:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2016 07:35:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

For technical\nreasons though these methods have not heretofore been applicable to quantum\nfield theories. In this article however we initiate a 'Euclidean signature\nsemi-classical' program to extend the scope of these analytical techniques to\nencompass the study of self-interacting scalar fields in 1 + 1, 2 + 1 and 3 + 1\ndimensions. The basic microlocal approach entails, first of all, the solution\nof a single, nonlinear equation of Hamilton-Jacobi type followed by the\nintegration (for both ground and excited states) of a sequence of linear\n'transport' equations along the 'flow' generated by the 'fundamental solution'\nto the aforementioned Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Using a combination of the\ndirect method of the calculus of variations, elliptic regularity theory and the\nBanach space version of the implicit function theorem we establish, in a\nsuitable function space setting, the existence, uniqueness and global\nregularity of this needed 'fundamental solution' to the relevant, Euclidean\nsignature Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the systems under study.

These disturbances propagate upward along the magnetic\nfield with speeds $\\sim100~\\rm{km~s}^{-1}$. This phenomenon has been\ninterpreted as evidence of the propagation of slow magnetosonic waves or argued\nto be signature of the intermittent outflows superposed on the background\nplasmas. Here we aim to present a new \"wave + flow\" model to interpret these\nobservations. In our scenario, the oscillatory motion is a slow mode wave, and\nthe flow is associated with a beam created by the wave-particle interaction\nowing to Landau resonance. With the help of a Vlasov model, we simulate the\npropagation of the slow mode wave and the generation of the beam flow. We find\nthat weak periodic beam flows can be generated owing to Landau resonance in the\nsolar corona, and the phase with strongest blueward asymmetry is ahead of that\nwith strongest blueshift by about 1/4 period. We also find that the slow wave\ndamps to the level of 1/e after the transit time of two wave periods, owing to\nLandau damping and Coulomb collisions in our simulation. This damping time\nscale is similar to that resulting from thermal-conduction in the\nmagnetohydrodynamics regime. The beam flow is weakened/attenuated with\nincreasing wave period and decreasing wave amplitude since Coulomb collision\nbecomes more and more dominant over the wave action. We suggest that this \"wave\n+ flow\" kinetic model provides an alternative explanation for the observed\nquasi-periodic propagating perturbations in various parameters in the solar\ncorona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2016 10:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

This paper\nproposes an interesting use case of this capability for IBFD self-backhauling\nheterogeneous networks (HetNet). IBFD self-backhauling in a HetNet refers to\nIBFD-enabled small cells backhauling themselves with macro cells over the\nwireless channel. Owing to their IBFD capability, the small cells\nsimultaneously communicate over the access and backhaul links, using the same\nfrequency band. The idea is doubly advantageous, as it obviates the need for\nfiber backhauling small cells every hundred meters and allows the access\nspectrum to be reused for backhauling at no extra cost. This work considers the\ncase of a two-tier cellular network with IBFD-enabled small cells, wirelessly\nbackhauling themselves with conventional macro cells. For clear exposition, the\ncase considered is that of FDD network, where within access and backhaul links,\nthe downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) are frequency duplexed ($f1$, $f2$\nrespectively), while the total frequency spectrum used at access and backhaul\n($f1+f2$) is the same. Analytical expressions for coverage and average downlink\n(DL) rate in such a network are derived using tools from the field of\nstochastic geometry. It is shown that DL rate in such networks could be close\nto double that of a conventional TDD/FDD self-backhauling network, at the\nexpense of reduced coverage due to higher interference in IBFD networks. For\nthe proposed IBFD network, the conflicting aspects of increased interference on\none side and high spectral efficiency on the other are captured into a\nmathematical model. The mathematical model introduces an end-to-end joint\nanalysis of backhaul (or fronthaul) and access links, in contrast to the\nlargely available access-centric studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2016 12:38:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 12:50:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 03:11:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

The common boundary is\nreferred to as the junction hyperplane. The parabolic equations on the\nhalf-hyperplanes are in non-divergence form, fully non-linear and possibly\ndegenerate, and they do degenerate and are quasi-convex along the junction\nhyperplane.

We find that the center of each disk is mainly composed of\nlamella-forming diblocks, while its thicker rim is mostly formed of\nmicelle-forming diblocks. However, this segregation is not perfect, and the\nconcentration of micelle formers is of the order of 10% on the flat central\nsurface of the bicelle.

Specifically, the free energy density of the disk has a minimum\nas a function of the disk radius when both micelle- and lamella-forming\ndiblocks are present, indicating that the bicelles have a preferred, finite\nradius. However, it decays monotonically when only lamella former is present,\nindicating that the bicelle structure is always unstable with respect to\nfurther aggregation in these systems.

This is most\npronounced for the hydrogen deficient Type-I SLSN hosts, although Type-II\nH-rich SLSN host galaxies remain distinct from the bulk of CCSNe, spanning a\nremarkably broad range of absolute magnitudes, with ~30% of SLSNe-II arising\nfrom galaxies fainter than Mn I R ~ -14. The detection of our faintest SLSN\nhosts increases the confidence that SLSNe-I hosts are distinct from those of\nLGRBs in star formation rate and stellar mass, and suggests that apparent\nsimilarities in metallicity may be due to the limited fraction of hosts for\nwhich emission line metallicity measurements are feasible. The broad range of\nluminosities of SLSN-II hosts is difficult to describe by metallicity cuts, and\ndoes not match the expectations of any reasonable UV-weighted luminosity\nfunction, suggesting additional environmental constraints are likely necessary\nto yield hydrogen rich SLSNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2016 13:46:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

We use a new synthetic atmosphere model\ngeneration and compare model spectra to observations. To test the model\naccuracy, we compared the models to four benchmark stars with atmospheric\nparameters for which independent information from interferometric radius\nmeasurements is available. We used $\\chi^2$ -based methods to determine\nparameters from high-resolution spectroscopic observations. Our synthetic\nspectra are based on the new PHOENIX grid that uses the ACES description for\nthe equation of state.

We find that the charge transport is dominated by hopping in the\nfirst conductive layer, but transforms to band-like in subsequent layers. Such\nabrupt phase transition is attributed to strong modulation of the molecular\npacking by interfacial vdW interactions, as corroborated by quantitative\nstructural characterization and density functional theory calculations. The\nstructural modulation becomes negligible beyond the second conductive layer,\nleading to a mobility saturation thickness of only ~3nm.

However, they have lower\nluminosities and hence lower masses. We suggest that they have evolved off the\nred giant branch (RGB) instead of the AGB as a result of binary interaction.\nAims: In this study we aim to place these objects in an evolutionary context\nand establish an evolutionary connection between RGB binaries (such as the\nsequence E variables) and our new sample of objects.

We\nshow that the time complexity of the problem depends on the amount of stability\nand connectivity of the dynamic network topology and on the adaptiveness of the\nadversary providing the dynamic topology. More formally, we model communication\nusing the standard graph-based radio network model. To model the dynamic\nnetwork, we use a generalization of the synchronous dynamic graph model\nintroduced in [Kuhn et al., STOC 2010]. For integer parameters $T\\geq 1$ and\n$k\\geq 1$, we call a dynamic graph $T$-interval $k$-connected if for every\ninterval of $T$ consecutive rounds, there exists a $k$-vertex-connected stable\nsubgraph. Further, for an integer parameter $\\tau\\geq 0$, we say that the\nadversary providing the dynamic network is $\\tau$-oblivious if for constructing\nthe graph of some round $t$, the adversary has access to all the randomness\n(and states) of the algorithm up to round $t-\\tau$.\n  As our main result, we show that for any $T\\geq 1$, any $k\\geq 1$, and any\n$\\tau\\geq 1$, for a $\\tau$-oblivious adversary, there is a distributed\nalgorithm to broadcast a single message in time\n$O\\big(\\big(1+\\frac{n}{k\\cdot\\min\\left\\{\\tau,T\\right\\}}\\big)\\cdot n\\log^3\nn\\big)$. We further show that even for large interval $k$-connectivity,\nefficient broadcast is not possible for the usual adaptive adversaries. For a\n$1$-oblivious adversary, we show that even for any $T\\leq\n(n/k)^{1-\\varepsilon}$ (for any constant $\\varepsilon>0$) and for any $k\\geq\n1$, global broadcast in $T$-interval $k$-connected networks requires at least\n$\\Omega(n^2/(k^2\\log n))$ time. Further, for a $0$ oblivious adversary,\nbroadcast cannot be solved in $T$-interval $k$-connected networks as long as\n$T<n-k$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2016 15:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-11"}

As a first step toward\nachieving that goal, we propose a model that observes in real time the\ndiversity brought by each item relatively to a short sequence of consultations,\ncorresponding to the recent user history. Our model has a complexity in\nconstant time, and is generic since it can apply to any type of items within an\nonline service (e.g. profiles, products, music tracks) and any application\ndomain (e-commerce, social network, music streaming), as long as we have\npartial item descriptions. The observation of the diversity level over time\nallows us to detect implicit changes. In the long term, we plan to characterize\nthe context, i.e. to find common features among a contiguous sub-sequence of\nitems between two changes of context determined by our model. This will allow\nus to make context-aware and privacy-preserving recommendations, to explain\nthem to users. As this is an ongoing research, the first step consists here in\nstudying the robustness of our model while detecting changes of context. In\norder to do so, we use a music corpus of 100 users and more than 210,000\nconsultations (number of songs played in the global history). We validate the\nrelevancy of our detections by finding connections between changes of context\nand events, such as ends of session. Of course, these events are a subset of\nthe possible changes of context, since there might be several contexts within a\nsession. We altered the quality of our corpus in several manners, so as to test\nthe performances of our model when confronted with sparsity and different types\nof items.

However, by treating only the mobile ionic charges in\nthe liquid, the Poisson Boltzmann equation accounts for only half of the\nelectrical double layer, with the other half, the surface charge layer, being\nbeyond its computational domain. In this work, we take a holistic approach to\nthe charge separation phenomenon at the silica/water interface by treating,\nwithin a single computational domain, the electrical double layer that\ncomprises both the mobile ions in the liquid and the surface charge density.\nThe Poisson Nernst Planck equations are used as the rigorous basis for our\nmethodology. The holistic approach has the advantage of being able to predict\nsurface charge variations that arise either from the addition of salt and acid\nto the liquid, or from the decrease of the liquid channel width to below twice\nthe Debye length. As the electrical double layer must be overall neutral, we\nuse this constraint to derive both the form of the static limit of the Poisson\nNernst Planck equations, as well as a global chemical potential that replaces\nthe classical zeta potential as the boundary value for the PB equation, which\ncan be re-derived from our formalism.
