Analytical expressions are derived for the\nband structure of the isolated wire. Quantum states and transport properties of\nthe wire coupled to two ideal leads at the edges are studied in detail. The\nwidth distribution of the quasistationary states varies as a function of the\ncoupling strength to the environment. At weak coupling, all the eigenenergies\nuniformly acquire small widths. The picture changes entirely at strong\ncoupling, a certain number of states (\"super-radiant\") are greatly broadened,\nwhile the rest remain long-lived states, a pure quantum mechanical effect as a\nconsequence of quantum interference. The transition between the two regimes\ngreatly influences the transport properties of the system. The maximum\ntransmission through the wire occurs at the super-radiance transition. We\nconsider also a realistic situation with energy-dependent coupling to the\ncontinuum due to the existence of decay threshold where super-radiance still\nplays a significant role in transport properties of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 16:03:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

There are many different\ntechnologies that generate the reads: widely-used second-generation methods\ncreate short reads with low error rates, while emerging third-generation\nmethods create long reads with high error rates. Both error rates and error\nprofiles differ among methods, so reconstruction algorithms are often tailored\nto specific shotgun sequencing technologies. As these methods change over time,\na fundamental question is whether there exist reconstruction algorithms which\nare robust, i.e., which perform well under a wide range of error distributions.\n  Here we study this question of sequence assembly from corrupted reads. We\nmake no assumption on the types of errors in the reads, but only assume a bound\non their magnitude. More precisely, for each read we assume that instead of\nreceiving the true read with no errors, we receive a corrupted read which has\nedit distance at most $\\epsilon$ times the length of the read from the true\nread. We show that if the reads are long enough and there are sufficiently many\nof them, then approximate reconstruction is possible: we construct a simple\nalgorithm such that for almost all original sequences the output of the\nalgorithm is a sequence whose edit distance from the original one is at most\n$O(\\epsilon)$ times the length of the original sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 16:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-28"}

In the absence of a\nGa\\'cs-K\\\"orner-Witsenhausen common part, the current known single-letter (S-L)\ncoding schemes are constrained to the S-L long Markov Chain (LMC)\n$X_{1}-S_{1}-S_{2}-X_{2}$.

Identifying the most influential\nnodes in the network can be useful in many applications like immunization of\nnodes in case of epidemic spreading, during intentional attacks on complex\nnetworks. A lot of research is done to devise centrality measures which could\nefficiently identify the most influential nodes in the network. There are two\nmajor approaches to the problem: On one hand, deterministic strategies that\nexploit knowledge about the overall network topology in order to find the\ninfluential nodes, while on the other end, random strategies are completely\nagnostic about the network structure. Centrality measures that can deal with a\nlimited knowledge of the network structure are required. Indeed, in practice,\ninformation about the global structure of the overall network is rarely\navailable or hard to acquire. Even if available, the structure of the network\nmight be too large that it is too much computationally expensive to calculate\nglobal centrality measures. To that end, a centrality measure is proposed that\nrequires information only at the community level to identify the influential\nnodes in the network. Indeed, most of the real-world networks exhibit a\ncommunity structure that can be exploited efficiently to discover the\ninfluential nodes. We performed a comparative evaluation of prominent global\ndeterministic strategies together with stochastic strategies with an available\nand the proposed deterministic community-based strategy. Effectiveness of the\nproposed method is evaluated by performing experiments on synthetic and\nreal-world networks with community structure in the case of immunization of\nnodes for epidemic control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 17:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-10"}

The sample is based on the 394\nHI-selected galaxies from the Parkes HI Zone of Avoidance survey (HIZOA).\nFollow-up narrow-band Parkes HI observations were obtained in 2010 and 2015 for\n290 galaxies, while for the further 104 galaxies, sufficiently high\nsignal-to-noise spectra were available from the original HIZOA data. All 394\nspectra are reduced and parameterized in the same systematic way. Five\ndifferent types of linewidth measurements were derived, and a Bayesian mixture\nmodel was used to derive conversion equations between these five widths. Of the\nselected and measure galaxies, 342 have adequate signal-to-noise (S/N $\\geq$ 5)\nfor use in TF distance estimation. The average value of the signal-to-noise\nratio of the sample is 14.7.

The Standard Model predicts a small parity-violating asymmetry\nof scattering rates between electron right and left helicity states due to the\nweak interaction. An initial result using 4% of the data was published in\nOctober 2013 with a measured parity-violating asymmetry of $-279\\pm\n35(\\text{stat})\\pm 31$ (syst) parts per billion (ppb). This asymmetry, along\nwith other data from parity-violating electron scattering experiments, provided\nthe world's first determination of the weak charge of the proton. The weak\ncharge of the proton was found to be $Q_W^p=0.064\\pm0.012$, in agreement with\nthe Standard Model prediction of $Q_W^p(SM)=0.0708\\pm0.0003$.\n  The results of the full dataset are expected to decrease the statistical\nerror from the initial publication by a factor of 4-5.

This thesis focuses on reduction of systematic error in two key\nsystematics for the Qweak experiment. First, techniques for measuring and\nremoving false asymmetries arising from helicity-correlated electron beam\nproperties at the few ppb level are discussed. Second, as a parity-violating\nexperiment, Qweak relies on accurate knowledge of electron beam polarimetry. To\nhelp address the requirement of accurate polarimetry, a Compton polarimeter\nbuilt specifically for Qweak. Compton polarimetry requires accurate knowledge\nof laser polarization inside a Fabry-Perot cavity enclosed in the electron beam\npipe. A new technique was developed for Qweak that nearly eliminates this\nsystematic error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 20:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-28"}

We study this using numerical\nsimulations with pc-scale resolution and explicit stellar feedback taken from\nstellar evolution models. The nuclear gas mass, young stellar mass, and SFR\nwithin the central ~100 pc (the short-timescale regime) never reach\nsteady-state, but instead go through dramatic, oscillatory cycles. Stars form\nuntil a critical surface density of young stars is present (such that feedback\noverwhelms gravity), at which point they begin to expel gas from the nucleus.\nSince the dynamical times are shorter than the stellar evolution times, the\nstars do not die as the gas is expelled, but continue to push, triggering a\nrunaway quenching of star formation in the nucleus. However the expelled gas is\nlargely not unbound from the galaxy, but goes into a galactic fountain which\nre-fills the nuclear region after the massive stars from the previous burst\ncycle have died off (~50 Myr timescale). On large scales (>1 kpc), the\ngalaxy-scale gas content and SFR is more stable.

We study in detail two famous\nconformal field theories in continuous dimensions, the scalar $O(N)$ model and\nthe Gross-Neveu model. For the $O(N)$ model, where the answers for the leading\nlarge $N$ corrections to $C_J$ and $C_T$ were derived long ago using analytic\nbootstrap, we show that the diagrammatic approach reproduces them correctly. We\nalso carry out a new perturbative test of these results using the $O(N)$\nsymmetric cubic scalar theory in $6-\\epsilon$ dimensions. We go on to apply the\ndiagrammatic method to the Gross-Neveu model, finding explicit formulae for the\nleading corrections to $C_J$ and $C_T$ as a function of dimension. We check\nthese large $N$ results using regular perturbation theory for the Gross-Neveu\nmodel in $2+\\epsilon$ dimensions and the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model in\n$4-\\epsilon$ dimensions. For small values of $N$, we use Pade approximants\nbased on the $4-\\epsilon$ and $2+\\epsilon$ expansions to estimate the values of\n$C_J$ and $C_T$ in $d=3$.

It aims at making GIS tools more sensitive for large\nvolumes of data stored inside GIS systems by integrating GIS with other\ncomputer sciences such as Expert system (ES) Data Warehouse (DW), Decision\nSupport System (DSS), or Knowledge Discovery Database (KDD). One of the main\nbranches of IGIS is the Geographic Knowledge Discovery (GKD) which tries to\ndiscover the implicit knowledge in the spatial databases. The main difference\nbetween traditional KDD techniques and GKD techniques is hidden in the nature\nof spatial data sets. In other words in the traditional data set the values of\neach object are supposed to be independent from other objects in the same data\nset, whereas the spatial dataset tends to be highly correlated according to the\nfirst law of geography. The spatial outlier detection is one of the most\npopular spatial data mining techniques which is used to detect spatial objects\nwhose non-spatial attributes values are extremely different from those of their\nneighboring objects. Analyzing the behavior of these objects may produce an\ninteresting knowledge, which has an effective role in the decision-making\nprocess. In this thesis, a new definition for the spatial neighborhood\nrelationship by is proposed considering the weights of the most effective\nparameters of neighboring objects in a given spatial dataset. The spatial\nparameters taken into our consideration are; distance, cost, and number of\ndirect connections between neighboring objects. A new model to detect spatial\noutliers is also presented based on the new definition of the spatial\nneighborhood relationship. This model is adapted to be applied to polygonal\nobjects. The proposed model is applied to an existing project for supporting\nliteracy in Fayoum governorate in Arab Republic of Egypt (ARE).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2016 01:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-28"}

In our experiments a microwire coplanar\nwaveguide delivered radiowaves to excite nuclear spins and microwaves to excite\nelectron spins in a 250 nm thick nitroxide-doped polystyrene sample. Both\nelectron and proton spin resonance were observed as a change in the mechanical\nresonance frequency of a nearby cantilever having a micron-scale nickel tip.\nNMR signal, not observable from Curie-law magnetization at 0.6 tesla, became\nobservable when microwave irradiation was applied to saturate the electron\nspins. The resulting NMR signal's size, buildup time, dependence on microwave\npower, and dependence on irradiation frequency was consistent with a transfer\nof magnetization from electron spins to nuclear spins. Due to the presence of\nan inhomogenous magnetic field introduced by the cantilever's magnetic tip, the\nelectron spins in the sample were saturated in a microwave-resonant slice 10's\nof nm thick. The spatial distribution of the nuclear polarization enhancement\nfactor $\\epsilon$ was mapped by varying the frequency of the applied\nradiowaves.

In\nparticular, the strategy adopts an exploration-exploitation approach to target\ndetection and utilizes the theory of low-rank matrix completion, coupled with\nunimodal regression, on decaying and approximately separable target fields. The\nassumptions on the field are fairly generic and are applicable to many decay\nprofiles since no specific knowledge of the field is necessary, besides its\nadmittance of an approximately rank-one representation.

During the tutoring process, where students take on the\nrole of the tutor to teach a computer agent tutee, learners have been observed\nto gain deeper understanding of the subject matter. Teachable agents are\ncommonly used in the areas of science and mathematics learning where learners\nare able to learn complex concepts and deep reasoning by teaching the teachable\nagent through graphic representation such as concept maps.\n  Literature review on teachable agents as well as observations during field\nstudies conducted by the researcher, have shown that many current teachable\nagents lack the interaction abilities required to keep learners engage in\nlearning tasks. The result of this is learners deviating from the teaching\nprocess, and thus the learners are unable to benefit fully from learning with\nthe teachable agent. The applications of teachable agents are restricted to the\nlearning of academic subjects such as mathematics and science.\n  In this book, we have proposed the Persuasive Teachable Agent (PTA), a\nteachable agent based on the theoretical framework of persuasion, computational\nand goal-oriented agent modelling. We argue that the PTA, an autonomous agent,\ncapable of encouraging attitude and behavioural change can offer a more\nmeaningful and engaging learning experiences for learners from different age\ngroups. Based on the findings from our research we argue that persuasive\nfeedback actions generated by the PTA provide significant influence over\nlearner's decision to participate in intergenerational learning.

However, when they suffer combined modifications, the performance\nis degraded to a certain extent because such features cannot characterize the\nvideo content completely. By contrast, the assistance and consensus among\ndifferent features can improve the performance of video fingerprinting.\nTherefore, in the present study, we mine the assistance and consensus among\ndifferent features based on tensor model, and present a new comprehensive\nfeature to fully use them in the proposed video fingerprinting framework. We\nalso analyze what the comprehensive feature really is for representing the\noriginal video. In this framework, the video is initially set as a high-order\ntensor that consists of different features, and the video tensor is decomposed\nvia the Tucker model with a solution that determines the number of components.\nSubsequently, the comprehensive feature is generated by the low-order tensor\nobtained from tensor decomposition. Finally, the video fingerprint is computed\nusing this feature. A matching strategy used for narrowing the search is also\nproposed based on the core tensor. The robust video fingerprinting framework is\nresistant not only to single-mode modifications, but also to the combination of\nthem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2016 06:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-28"}

Constitutive modelling of\ndissipative micro-stresses incorporates relaxation time parameters to account\nfor the time lags of the dissipative fluxes in attaining a steady state.\nAugmentation of the micro-force balance with constitutive relations for the\nmicro-stresses yields a non-local flow rule that reflects the effect of\nmicro-inertia on the evolution of the plastic strain. A thermodynamically\nconsistent derivation of temperature evolution is provided, thus replacing an\nempirical route. Numerical implementation of the proposal does not demand a\ncomputationally intensive return mapping algorithm. A two dimensional plane\nstrain model of impact between two 4340 steel plates is used to numerically\nassess the influence that micro-inertial and relaxation time parameters as well\nas various length scales may have on the macro-continuum response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2016 09:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-28"}

In contrast to conventional\nmultiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems, precoding in mmWave MIMO cannot\nbe performed entirely at baseband using digital precoders, as only a limited\nnumber of signal mixers and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) can be\nsupported considering their cost and power consumption. As a cost-effective\nalternative, a hybrid precoding transceiver architecture, combining a digital\nprecoder and an analog precoder, has recently received considerable attention.\nHowever, the optimal design of such hybrid precoders has not been fully\nunderstood. In this paper, treating the hybrid precoder design as a matrix\nfactorization problem, effective alternating minimization (AltMin) algorithms\nwill be proposed for two different hybrid precoding structures, i.e., the\nfully-connected and partially-connected structures. In particular, for the\nfully-connected structure, an AltMin algorithm based on manifold optimization\nis proposed to approach the performance of the fully digital precoder, which,\nhowever, has a high complexity. Thus, a low-complexity AltMin algorithm is then\nproposed, by enforcing an orthogonal constraint on the digital precoder.\nFurthermore, for the partially-connected structure, an AltMin algorithm is also\ndeveloped with the help of semidefinite relaxation. For practical\nimplementation, the proposed AltMin algorithms are further extended to the\nbroadband setting with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)\nmodulation. Simulation results will demonstrate significant performance gains\nof the proposed AltMin algorithms over existing hybrid precoding algorithms.\nMoreover, based on the proposed algorithms, simulation comparisons between the\ntwo hybrid precoding structures will provide valuable design insights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2016 12:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

Using two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we\ninvestigate particle and radiation beaming, finding a very different picture.\nInstead of having a relativistic average bulk motion with isotropic electron\nvelocity distribution in its rest frame, we find that the bulk motion of\nparticles in X-points is similar to their Lorentz factor gamma, and the\nparticles are beamed within about 5/gamma. On the way from the X-point to the\nmagnetic islands, particles turn in the magnetic field, forming a fan confined\nto the current sheet.

In this paper we introduce a new property\nfor concurrent objects, we call coverability, that aims to provide precise\nguarantees on the consistent evolution of an object. This new property is\nsuitable for a variety of distributed objects including concurrent file objects\nthat demand operations to manipulate the latest version of the object. We\npropose two levels of coverability: (i) strong coverability and (ii) weak\ncoverability. Strong coverability requires that only a single operation can\nmodify the latest version of the object, i.e. \"covers\" the latest version with\na new version, imposing a total order on object modifications. Weak\ncoverability relaxes the strong requirements of strong coverability and allows\nmultiple operations to modify the same version of an object, where each\nmodification leads to a different version. Weak coverability preserves\nconsistent evolution of the object, by demanding any subsequent operation to\nonly modify one of the newly introduced versions. Coverability combined with\natomic guarantees yield to coverable atomic read/write registers. We also show\nthat strongly coverable atomic registers are equivalent in power to consensus.\nThus, we focus on weakly coverable registers, and we demonstrate their\nimportance by showing that they cannot be implemented using similar types of\nregisters, like ranked-registers.

The idea is to investigate the dynamics of reservoir\nneurons with time-series analysis techniques taken from research on complex\nsystems. Notably, we analyze time-series of neuron activations with Recurrence\nPlots (RPs) and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA), which permit to\nvisualize and characterize high-dimensional dynamical systems. We show that\nthis approach is useful in a number of ways. First, the two-dimensional\nrepresentation offered by RPs provides a way for visualizing the\nhigh-dimensional dynamics of a reservoir. Our results suggest that, if the\nnetwork is stable, reservoir and input denote similar line patterns in the\nrespective RPs. Conversely, the more unstable the ESN, the more the RP of the\nreservoir presents instability patterns. As a second result, we show that the\n$\\mathrm{L_{max}}$ measure is highly correlated with the well-established\nmaximal local Lyapunov exponent. This suggests that complexity measures based\non RP diagonal lines distribution provide a valuable tool to quantify the\ndegree of network stability. Finally, our analysis shows that all RQA measures\nfluctuate on the proximity of the so-called edge of stability, where an ESN\ntypically achieves maximum computational capability. We verify that the\ndetermination of the edge of stability provided by such RQA measures is more\naccurate than two well-known criteria based on the Jacobian matrix of the\nreservoir. Therefore, we claim that RPs and RQA-based analyses can be used as\nvaluable tools to design an effective network given a specific problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 17:34:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2016 13:15:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-21"}

As\ntypical for space-time DG schemes, the discrete solution is represented in\nterms of space-time basis functions. This allows to achieve very high order of\naccuracy also in time, which is not easy to obtain for the incompressible\nNavier-Stokes equations. Similar to staggered finite difference schemes, in our\napproach the discrete pressure is defined on the primary tetrahedral grid,\nwhile the discrete velocity is defined on a face-based staggered dual grid. A\nvery simple and efficient Picard iteration is used in order to derive a\nspace-time pressure correction algorithm that achieves also high order of\naccuracy in time and that avoids the direct solution of global nonlinear\nsystems. Formal substitution of the discrete momentum equation on the dual grid\ninto the discrete continuity equation on the primary grid yields a very sparse\nfive-point block system for the scalar pressure, which is conveniently solved\nwith a matrix-free GMRES algorithm. From numerical experiments we find that the\nlinear system seems to be reasonably well conditioned, since all simulations\nshown in this paper could be run without the use of any preconditioner. For a\npiecewise constant polynomial approximation in time and proper boundary\nconditions, the resulting system is symmetric and positive definite. This\nallows us to use even faster iterative solvers, like the conjugate gradient\nmethod. The proposed method is verified for approximation polynomials of degree\nup to four in space and time by solving a series of typical 3D test problems\nand by comparing the obtained numerical results with available exact analytical\nsolutions, or with other numerical or experimental reference data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2016 14:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

In contrast to most existing analytic approaches,\nthe accuracy of these results does not depend on having a large number of\ninfectious individuals, meaning that in the large population limit they would\nbe asymptotically exact even for one initial infectious individual.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2016 15:41:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 15:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-23"}

After a period of intense research in the\n1960s and 1970s, however, interest in the detection technique faded almost\ncompletely. With the availability of powerful digital signal processing\ntechniques, new attempts at measuring cosmic ray air showers via their radio\nemission were started at the beginning of the new millennium. Starting with\nmodest, small-scale digital prototype setups, the field has evolved, matured\nand grown very significantly in the past decade. Today's second-generation\ndigital radio detection experiments consist of up to hundreds of radio antennas\nor cover areas of up to 17 km$^{2}$. We understand the physics of the radio\nemission in extensive air showers in detail and have developed analysis\nstrategies to accurately derive from radio signals parameters which are related\nto the astrophysics of the primary cosmic ray particles, in particular their\nenergy, arrival direction and estimators for their mass. In parallel to these\nsuccesses, limitations inherent in the physics of the radio signals have also\nbecome increasingly clear. In this article, we review the progress of the past\ndecade and the current state of the field, discuss the current paradigm of the\nradio emission physics and present the experimental evidence supporting it.\nFinally, we discuss the potential for future applications of the radio\ndetection technique to advance the field of cosmic ray physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 17:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

It\nstems from the scale relativity proposal to extend the principle of relativity\nto resolution-scale transformations, which leads to considering\nnon-differentiable dynamical paths. We first define a complex scale-covariant\ntime-differential operator and show that mechanics of non-differentiable paths\nis implemented in the same way as classical mechanics but with the replacement\nof the time derivative and velocity with the time-differential operator and\nassociated complex velocity. With this, the generalized form of Newton's\nfundamental relation of dynamics is shown to take the form of a Langevin\nequation in the case of stationary motion characterized by a null average\nclassical velocity. The numerical integration of the Langevin equation in the\ncase of a harmonic oscillator taken as an example reveals the same statistics\nas the stationary solutions of the Schrodinger equation for the same problem.\nThis motivates the rest of the paper, which shows Schrodinger's equation to be\na reformulation of Newton's fundamental relation of dynamics as generalized to\nnon-differentiable geometries and leads to an alternative interpretation of the\nother axioms of standard quantum mechanics in a coherent picture.
