We measure the proper motion of 31 knots over different time scales\n(2, 4, 6, and 10 years). The typical tangential velocity is around 50 km/s for\nthe 10 year base-line, but for shorter time-scales a maximum tangential\nvelocity up to 300 km/s is found for a few knots.

The theory allows to address some\nof the potential instability problems present in Horava-Lifshitz gravity due to\nexplicit diffeomorphism invariance breaking. The fluid is instead constructed\nfrom a scalar field constrained by a Lagrange multiplier. In fact, the Lagrange\nmultiplier construction allows for an extension of the Horava-like model to\ninclude the scalar field of mimetic gravity, an extension which we thoroughly\nexplore. By adding a potential for the scalar field, we show how one can\nreproduce a number of interesting cosmological scenarios. We then turn to the\nstudy of perturbations around a flat FLRW background, showing that the fluid in\nquestion behaves as an irrotational fluid, with zero sound speed. To address\nthis problem, we consider a modified version of the theory, adding higher\nderivative terms in a way which brings us beyond the Horndeski framework. We\ncompute the sound speed in this modified higher order mimetic Horava-like model\nand show that it is non-zero, which means that perturbations therein can be\nsensibly defined. Caveats to our analysis, as well as comparisons to\nprojectable Horava-Lifshitz gravity, are also discussed. In conclusion, we\npresent a theory of gravity which preserves diffeomorphism invariance at the\nlevel of the action but breaks it dynamically in the UV, reduces to General\nRelativity in the IR, allows the realization of a number of interesting\ncosmological scenarios, is well defined when considering perturbations around a\nflat FLRW background, and features cosmological dark matter emerging as an\nintegration constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 2016 18:23:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 18:36:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 12:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-13"}

Our numerical studies of the \"dynamical order parameter\" in\nEdwards-Anderson Ising spin glasses and random ferromagnets indicate that the\ninfluence of the initial state decays as dimension increases. Similarly, this\nsame order parameter for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick infinite-range spin glass\nindicates that this information decays as the number of spins increases. Based\non these results, we conjecture that the influence of the initial state on the\nfinal state decays to zero in finite-dimensional random-bond spin systems as\ndimension goes to infinity, regardless of the presence of frustration. We also\nstudy the rate at which spins \"freeze out\" to a final state as a function of\ndimensionality and number of spins; here the results indicate that the number\nof \"active\" spins at long times increases with dimension (for short-range\nsystems) or number of spins (for infinite-range systems).

Past surveys\nhave achieved photometric precision of 1-2% by calibrating the survey's stellar\nphotometry with repeated measurements of a large number of stars observed in\nmultiple epochs. The calibration techniques employed by these surveys only\nconsider the relative frame-by-frame photometric zeropoint offset and the focal\nplane position-dependent illumination corrections, which are independent of the\nsource color. However, variations in the wavelength dependence of the\natmospheric transmission and the instrumental throughput induce source\ncolor-dependent systematic errors. These systematic errors must also be\nconsidered to achieve the most precise photometric measurements. In this paper,\nwe examine such systematic chromatic errors using photometry from the Dark\nEnergy Survey (DES) as an example. We define a natural magnitude system for DES\nand calculate the systematic errors on stellar magnitudes, when the atmospheric\ntransmission and instrumental throughput deviate from the natural system. We\nconclude that the systematic chromatic errors caused by the change of airmass\nin each exposure, the change of the precipitable water vapor and aerosol in the\natmosphere over time, and the non-uniformity of instrumental throughput over\nthe focal plane, can be up to 2% in some bandpasses. We compare the calculated\nsystematic chromatic errors with the observed DES data. For the test sample\ndata, we correct these errors using measurements of the atmospheric\ntransmission and instrumental throughput. The residual after correction is less\nthan 0.3%. We also find that the errors for non-stellar objects are\nredshift-dependent and can be larger than those for stars at certain redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 2016 21:04:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 01:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

However, the\ndata also potentially contains signals, thus the background estimate may be\noverstated due to contributions from signals. It has been proposed to mitigate\npossible bias by removing single-detector data samples that pass a\nmulti-detector consistency test from the background estimates. We conduct a\nhigh-statistics Mock Data Challenge to evaluate the effects of removing such\nsamples, modelling a range of scenarios with plausible detector noise\ndistributions and with a range of plausible foreground astrophysical signal\nrates. We consider the two different modes: one in which coincident samples are\nremoved, and one in which all samples are retained and used. Three algorithms\nwere operated in both modes, show good consistency with each other; however,\ndiscrepancies arise between the results obtained under the \"coincidence\nremoval\" and \"all samples\" modes, for false alarm probabilities below a certain\nvalue. In most scenarios the median of the false alarm probability (FAP)\nestimator under the \"all samples\" mode is consistent with the exact FAP. On the\nother hand the \"coincidence removal\" mode is found to be unbiased for the mean\nof the estimated FAP. While the numerical values at which discrepancies become\napparent are specific to the details of our experiment, we believe that the\nqualitative differences in the behaviour of the median and mean of the FAP\nestimator have more general validity. On the basis of our study we suggest that\nthe FAP of candidates for the first detection of gravitational waves should be\nestimated without removing single-detector samples that form coincidences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2016 02:21:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2016 19:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-18"}

TYC\n2505-672-1 is now the longest-period eclipsing binary system yet discovered,\nmore than twice as long as that of the currently longest-period system,\n$\\epsilon$ Aurigae. We show from analysis of the light curve including both our\nown data and historical data spanning more than 120 yr and from modeling of the\nspectral energy distribution, both before and during eclipse, that the red\ngiant primary is orbited by a moderately hot source (T$_{eff}$~8000 K) that is\nitself surrounded by an extended, opaque circumstellar disk. From the measured\nratio of luminosities, the radius of the hot companion must be in the range\n0.1-0.5 Rsun (depending on the assumed radius of the red giant primary), which\nis an order of magnitude smaller than that for a main sequence A star and 1-2\norders of magnitude larger than that for a white dwarf.

We establish both variable selection and norm consistency of the\nproposed estimator for distributions with exponential or polynomial tails.\nFurther, to extend the applicability of the method to the settings with unknown\npopulations structure, we propose a Laplacian penalty based on hierarchical\nclustering, and discuss conditions under which this data-driven choice results\nin consistent estimation of precision matrices in heterogenous populations.\nExtensive numerical studies and applications to gene expression data from\nsubtypes of cancer with distinct clinical outcomes indicate the potential\nadvantages of the proposed method over existing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2016 06:11:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-05"}

Our method measures the linear bias factor on\nlinear scales under the assumption of no stochasticity between galaxies and\nmatter.

In cold regions, the\nhyperfine structure due to the nitrogen ($^{14}$N) nucleus is resolved. To\ndate, this splitting is the only one which is taken into account in the NH$_2$D\ncolumn density estimates. We investigate how the inclusion of the hyperfine\nsplitting caused by the deuterium (D) nucleus affects the analysis of the\nrotational lines of NH$_2$D. We present 30m IRAM observations of the above\nmentioned lines, as well as APEX o/p-NH$_2$D observations of the\n1$_{01}$-0$_{00}$ lines at 333 GHz. The hyperfine spectra are first analyzed\nwith a line list that only includes the hyperfine splitting due to the $^{14}$N\nnucleus. We find inconsistencies between the line widths of the\n1$_{01}$-0$_{00}$ and 1$_{11}$-1$_{01}$ lines, the latter being larger by a\nfactor of $\\sim$1.6$\\pm0.3$. Such a large difference is unexpected given the\ntwo sets of lines are likely to originate from the same region. We next employ\na newly computed line list for the o/p-NH$_2$D transitions, where the hyperfine\nstructure induced by both nitrogen and deuterium nuclei is included. With this\nnew line list, the analysis of the previous spectra leads to linewidths which\nare compatible. Neglecting the hyperfine structure owing to D leads to\noverestimate the linewidths of the o/p-NH$_2$D lines at 3 mm. The error for a\ncold molecular core is about 50\\%. This error propagates directly to the column\ndensity estimate. It is therefore recommended to take into account the\nhyperfine splittings caused by both the $^{14}$N and D nuclei in any analysis\nrelying on these lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2016 11:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

The parameter space after applying various sparticle mass\nbounds, Higgs mass bounds, B-physics bounds, the muon magnetic moment\nconstraint, and the Higgs coupling constraint from measurements at HL-LHC, ILC,\nand CEPC, is shown in the planes of various interesting model parameters and\nsparticle masses.

The precision of $k_b$ and\n$k_{\\tau}$ measurements at CEPC can bound $m_A$ to be above 1.2 TeV and 1.1 TeV\nrespectively. The combination of the Higgs coupling measurement and muon\nanomalous magnetic moment measurement constrain $\\tilde{e}_R$ mass to be in the\nrange from 0.6 TeV to 2 TeV.
