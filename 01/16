Due to the limited access and often\nvariable availability of such resources, researchers have their prototypes\ntested against the simulation environments, opposed to the real cloud\nenvironments. Existing cloud simulation environments such as CloudSim and\nEmuSim are executed sequentially, where a more advanced cloud simulation tool\ncould be created extending them, leveraging the latest technologies as well as\nthe availability of multi-core computers and the clusters in the research\nlaboratories. While computing has been evolving with multi-core programming,\nMapReduce paradigms, and middleware platforms, cloud and MapReduce simulations\nstill fail to exploit these developments themselves. This research develops\nCloud2Sim, which tries to fill the gap between the simulations and the actual\ntechnology that they are trying to simulate.\n  First, Cloud2Sim provides a concurrent and distributed cloud simulator, by\nextending CloudSim cloud simulator, using Hazelcast in-memory key-value store.\nThen, it also provides a quick assessment to MapReduce implementations of\nHazelcast and Infinispan, adaptively distributing the execution to a cluster,\nproviding means of simulating MapReduce executions. The dynamic scaler solution\nscales out the cloud and MapReduce simulations to multiple nodes running\nHazelcast and Infinispan, based on load. The distributed execution model and\nadaptive scaling solution could be leveraged as a general purpose auto scaler\nmiddleware for a multi-tenanted deployment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2016 16:04:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-18"}

In this paper we introduce Keyboard Surface Interaction (KSI), an\ninteraction approach that turns the surface of a keyboard into an interaction\nsurface and allows users to rest their hands on the keyboard at all times to\nminimize fatigue. We developed a proof-of-concept implementation, Fingers,\nwhich we optimized over a series of studies.

Our approach is to pre-compute a library of \"funnels\" along\ndifferent maneuvers of the system that the state is guaranteed to remain within\n(despite bounded disturbances) when the feedback controller corresponding to\nthe maneuver is executed.

Current works usually\nassume offline optimization models, which consider worker and task arrivals\nknown and do not take into account the element of time.

Instead of computing\nlikelihood functions, Approximate Bayesian computation relies on numerical\nsimulations, which makes it applicable to complex models in ecology and\nevolution. As usual for statistical modeling, evaluating goodness-of-fit is a\nfundamental step for Approximate Bayesian Computation. Here, we introduce a\ngoodness-of-fit approach based on hypothesis-testing. We introduce two test\nstatistics based on the mean distance between numerical summaries of the data\nand simulated ones. One test statistic relies on summaries simulated with the\nprior predictive distribution whereas the other one relies on simulations from\nthe posterior predictive distribution. For different coalescent models, we find\nthat the statistics are well calibrated, meaning that the type I error can be\ncontrolled. However, the statistical power of the two statistics is extremely\nvariable across models ranging from 20% to 100%. The difference of power\nbetween the two statistics is negligible in models of demographic inference but\nsubstantial in an additional and purely statistical example. When analyzing\nresequencing data to evaluate models of human demography, the two statistics\nconfirm that an out-of-Africa bottleneck cannot be rejected for Asiatic and\nEuropean data. We also consider two speciation models in the context of a\nbutterfly species complex. One goodness-of-fit statistic indicates a poor fit\nfor both models, and the numerical summaries causing the poor fit were\nidentified using posterior predictive checks. Statistical tests for\ngoodness-of-fit should foster evaluation of model fit in Approximate Bayesian\nComputation.

Semantic models of data sources\nrepresent the implicit meaning of the data by specifying the concepts and the\nrelationships within the data. Such models are the key ingredients to\nautomatically publish the data into knowledge graphs. Manually modeling the\nsemantics of data sources requires significant effort and expertise, and\nalthough desirable, building these models automatically is a challenging\nproblem. Most of the related work focuses on semantic annotation of the data\nfields (source attributes).

The\npresented variational principle for excited states, Fn, is demonstrated to lead\nto the correct excited eigenfunction in necessarily small truncated spaces.\nUsing Hylleraas coordinates for He 1S 1s2s, the standard method based on the\ntheorem of Hylleraas - Unheim, and MacDonald, yields misleading main orbitals\n1s1s' and needs a series expansion of 27 terms to be corrected, whereas\nminimizing Fn goes directly to the corect main orbitals, 1s2s, and can be\nadequately improved by 8 terms.

We will first show that several\nwidely-used algorithms for Markov decision processes can be interpreted in\nterms of the primal-dual method, where the value function is updated with\nsuboptimal solutions to the DRP in each iteration. We then provide the optimal\nsolution to the DRP in closed-form, and present the algorithm that results when\nusing this solution to update the value function in each iteration. Unlike the\nalgorithms obtained from suboptimal DRP updates, this algorithm is guaranteed\nto yield the optimal value function in a finite number of iterations. Finally,\nwe show that the iterations of the primal-dual algorithm can be interpreted as\nrepeated application of the policy iteration algorithm to a special class of\nMarkov decision processes. When considered alongside recent results\ncharacterizing the computational complexity of the policy iteration algorithm,\nthis observation could provide new insights into the computational complexity\nof solving discounted-cost Markov decision processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2016 15:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-19"}

Co-non-solvency\noccurs when two competing good solvents for PNIPAm, such as water and alcohol,\nare mixed together. As a result, the same PNIPAm collapses within intermediate\nmixing ratios. This complex conformational transition is driven by preferential\nbinding of methanol with PNIPAm. Interestingly, co-non-solvency can be\ndestroyed when applying high hydrostatic pressures. In this work, using a large\nscale molecular dynamics simulation employing high pressures, we propose a\nmicroscopic picture behind the suppression of the co-non-solvency phenomenon.\nBased on thermodynamic and structural analysis, our results suggest that the\npreferential binding of methanol with PNIPAm gets partially lost at high\npressures, making the background fluid reasonably homogeneous for the polymer.\nThis is consistent with the hypothesis that the co-non-solvency phenomenon is\ndriven by preferential binding and is not based on depletion effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2016 15:33:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-19"}

These phenomena are\nmediated by long distance Glauber gluon exchanges, which are static in time,\nlocalized in the longitudinal distance, where $|t| \\ll s$. In hard scattering,\nGlauber gluons can induce corrections which invalidate factorization. With\nSCET, Glauber exchange graphs can be calculated explicitly, and are distinct\nfrom graphs with soft, collinear, or ultrasoft gluons. We derive a complete\nbasis of operators which describe the leading power effects of Glauber\nexchange. Key ingredients include regulating light-cone rapidity singularities\nand subtractions which prevent double counting. Our results include a novel all\norders gauge invariant pure glue soft operator which appears between two\ncollinear rapidity sectors. The 1-gluon Feynman rule for the soft operator\ncoincides with the Lipatov vertex, but it also contributes to emissions with\n$\\ge 2$ soft gluons.

In\nhard scattering operators Glauber subtractions for soft and collinear loop\ndiagrams ensure that we are not sensitive to the directions for soft and\ncollinear Wilson lines.
