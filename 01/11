This is the result of a positive feedback due to the\ncavity. We propose to add an additional electronic feedback loop based on the\nphotodetection of the scattered light. The advantage is a great flexibility in\nchoosing the feedback algorithm, since manipulations with electric signals are\nvery well developed. In this paper we address the application of such a\nfeedback to atoms in the Bose-Einstein condensed state and explore the quantum\nnoise due to the incoherent feedback action. We show that although the feedback\nbased on the photodetection does not change the local stability of the initial\nuniform distribution with respect to small disturbances, it reduces the region\nof attraction of the uniform equilibrium. The feedback-induced nonlinearity\nenables quantum fluctuations to bring the system out of the stability region\nand cause an exponential growth even if the uniform state is globally stable\nwithout the feedback. Using numerical solution of the feedback master equation\nwe show that there is no feedback-induced noise in the quadratures of the\nexcited atomic and light modes. The feedback loop, however, introduces\nadditional noise into the number of quanta of these modes. Importantly, the\nfeedback opens an opportunity to position the modulated BEC inside a cavity as\nwell as tune the phase of scattered light. This can find applications in\nprecision measurements and quantum simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2016 16:11:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-12"}

The probability density function (PDF)\nof cell lengths has been variously described by exponential and lognormal\nfunctions. While temperature, population density and growth rate have all been\nshown to affect E. coli cell size distributions, and recent models have\nvalidated a link between growth rate and cell size through DNA replication,\ncell size variability is thought to emerge from growth rate variability. A\nmechanistic link that could distinguish the source of stochasticity, could\nimprove our understanding of cell size regulation. Here, we have developed a\npopulation dynamics model of individual cell division based on the BCD, birth,\nchromosome replication and division model, with DNA replication based on the\nCooper and Helmstetter (CH) multi-fork replication. In our model, stochasticity\nin the model arises solely from the dynamics of DNA replication forks. We model\nthe forks as two-state systems: stalled and recovered. Our model predicts an\nincrease in cell size variability with growth rate, consistent with previous\nexperimental reports. We perturb the model to test the effect of increased\nreplication fork (RF) stalling frequency, or uncoupling RF stalling from the\ncell-division machinery. Indeed, despite ignoring DNA and protein segregation\nasymmetry, the model can faithfully reproduce quantitative changes in cell size\ndistributions. In our model, multi-fork replication produces multiplicative\n'noise' and provides a mechanism linking growth rate and cell size variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2016 17:56:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2016 13:05:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 09:44:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 20 May 2019 07:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-21"}

Much of the existing literature in the learning community focuses\non processes possessing some form of computationally tractable conjugacy as is\nthe case for the beta and gamma processes (and, via normalization, the\nDirichlet process). For these processes, proofs of conjugacy and requisite\nderivation of explicit computational formulae for posterior density parameters\nare idiosyncratic to the stochastic process in question. As such, Bayesian\nNonparametric models are currently available for a limited number of conjugate\npairs, e.g. the Dirichlet-multinomial and beta-Bernoulli process pairs. In each\nof these above cases the likelihood process belongs to the class of discrete\nexponential family distributions. The exclusion of continuous likelihood\ndistributions from the known cases of Bayesian Nonparametric Conjugate models\nstands as a disparity in the researcher's toolbox.\n  In this paper we first address the problem of obtaining a general\nconstruction of prior distributions over infinite dimensional spaces possessing\ndistributional properties amenable to conjugacy. Second, we bridge the divide\nbetween the discrete and continuous likelihoods by illustrating a canonical\nconstruction for stochastic processes whose Levy measure densities are from\npositive exponential families, and then demonstrate that these processes in\nfact form the prior, likelihood, and posterior in a conjugate family.

Due to extremely short time and length scales,\nthe measurement and manipulation of electron thermalization in nanoscale\ndevices remains challenging even with the most advanced ultrafast laser\ntechniques. Here, we overcome this challenge by leveraging the atomic thinness\nof two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials in order to introduce a highly\ntunable electron transfer pathway that directly competes with electron\nthermalization. We realize this scheme in a graphene-boron nitride-graphene\n(G-BN-G) vdW heterostructure, through which optically excited carriers are\ntransported from one graphene layer to the other. By applying an interlayer\nbias voltage or varying the excitation photon energy, interlayer carrier\ntransport can be controlled to occur faster or slower than the intralayer\nscattering events, thus effectively tuning the electron thermalization pathways\nin graphene.

However, the AGN fraction increases strongly with Ha luminosity and\ncorrelates best with $L_{H\\alpha}/L_{H\\alpha}^*(z)$. While $L_{H\\alpha}<L_{\\rm\nH\\alpha}^*(z)$ Ha emitters are largely dominated by star-forming galaxies\n(>80%), the most luminous Ha emitters ($L_{H\\alpha}>10L_{H\\alpha}^*(z)$) at any\ncosmic time are essentially all BL-AGN. Using our AGN-decontaminated sample of\nluminous star-forming galaxies, and integrating down to a fixed Ha luminosity,\nwe find a factor of ~1300x evolution in the star formation rate density from\nz=0 to z=2.23. This is much stronger than the evolution from typical Ha\nstar-forming galaxies and in line with the evolution seen for constant\nluminosity cuts used to select \"Ultra-Luminous\" Infrared Galaxies and/or\nsub-millimetre galaxies. By taking into account the evolution in the typical Ha\nluminosity, we show that the most strongly star-forming Ha-selected galaxies at\nany epoch ($L_{H\\alpha}>L^*_{H\\alpha}(z)$) contribute the same fractional\namount of ~15% to the total star-formation rate density, at least up to z=2.23.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2016 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-17"}

A high-S/N FLAMES/GIRAFFE\nspectrum is analysed using a hybrid non-LTE model atmosphere technique.\nComparison with stellar evolution models constrains the fundamental parameters\nof the star. We obtain a firm detection of a surface averaged longitudinal\nmagnetic field with a maximum amplitude of about 1 kG. Assuming a dipolar\nconfiguration of the magnetic field, this implies a dipolar field strength\nlarger than 3.3 kG. Moreover, the large amplitude and fast variation (within\nabout 1 day) of the longitudinal magnetic field implies that CPD-57 3509 is\nspinning very fast despite its apparently slow projected rotational velocity.\nThe star should be able to support a centrifugal magnetosphere, yet the\nspectrum shows no sign of magnetically confined material; in particular,\nemission in H{\\alpha} is not observed. Apparently, the wind is either not\nstrong enough for enough material to accumulate in the magnetosphere to become\nobservable or, alternatively, some leakage process leads to loss of material\nfrom the magnetosphere. The quantitative spectroscopic analysis of the star\nyields an effective temperature and a logarithmic surface gravity of 23750+-250\nK and 4.05+-0.10, respectively, and a surface helium fraction of 0.28+-0.02 by\nnumber.

This set is the disjoint union of the reduced words\nof a set of group elements $\\mathcal{A}_*(x,y)$, which we call the atoms of $y$\nrelative to $x$.

A proper metric\nfor data freshness at the destination is the age-of-information, or simply age,\nwhich is defined as how old the freshest received update is since the moment\nthat this update was generated at the source node (e.g., a sensor). A\nreasonable update policy is the zero-wait policy, i.e., the source node submits\na fresh update once the previous update is delivered and the channel becomes\nfree, which achieves the maximum throughput and the minimum delay.\nSurprisingly, this zero-wait policy does not always minimize the age. This\ncounter-intuitive phenomenon motivates us to study how to optimally control\ninformation updates to keep the data fresh and to understand when the zero-wait\npolicy is optimal. We introduce a general age penalty function to characterize\nthe level of dissatisfaction on data staleness and formulate the average age\npenalty minimization problem as a constrained semi-Markov decision problem\n(SMDP) with an uncountable state space. We develop efficient algorithms to find\nthe optimal update policy among all causal policies, and establish sufficient\nand necessary conditions for the optimality of the zero-wait policy. Our\ninvestigation shows that the zero-wait policy is far from the optimum if (i)\nthe age penalty function grows quickly with respect to the age, (ii) the packet\ntransmission times over the channel are positively correlated over time, or\n(iii) the packet transmission times are highly random (e.g., following a\nheavy-tail distribution).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 00:16:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2016 16:25:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2016 14:43:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2016 15:44:13 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 15:17:39 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 18:53:42 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 15:36:21 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 03:51:02 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 04:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-24"}

The quantitative\ndetermination of the positions of subsurface dopant atoms is an important issue\nin a range of applications from channel doping in ultra-scaled transistors to\nquantum information processing, and hence poses a significant challenge. Here,\nwe establish a metrology combining low-temperature scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopy (STM) imaging and a comprehensive quantum treatment of the\ndopant-STM system to pin-point the exact lattice-site location of sub-surface\ndopants in silicon. The technique is underpinned by the observation that STM\nimages of sub surface dopants typically contain many atomic-sized features in\nordered patterns, which are highly sensitive to the details of the STM tip\norbital and the absolute lattice-site position of the dopant atom itself. We\ndemonstrate the technique on two types of dopant samples in silicon -- the\nfirst where phosphorus dopants are placed with high precision, and a second\ncontaining randomly placed arsenic dopants. Based on the quantitative agreement\nbetween STM measurements and multi-million-atom calculations, the precise\nlattice site of these dopants is determined, demonstrating that the metrology\nworks to depths of about 36 lattice planes. The ability to uniquely determine\nthe exact positions of sub-surface dopants down to depths of 5 nm will provide\ncritical knowledge in the design and optimisation of nanoscale devices for both\nclassical and quantum computing applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 05:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

For instance, the 11 micron band profile is well\nmatched with the emissivity of crystalline olivine. Furthermore, the apparent\nassociation of the absorption feature with a sharp polarisation signature in\nthe spectrum of two previously reported cases suggests a carrier with a\nrelatively high band strength compared to amorphous silicates.

Since the transport coefficients, related to\ndrag and diffusion processes are the main ingredients in the FP equation, the\nevolution of HQs is thus effectively controlled by them. At the initial stage\nof the relativistic heavy ion collisions, asymptotic weak-coupling causes the\nfree-streaming motions of partons in the beam direction and the expansion in\ntransverse directions are almost frozen, hence an anisotropy in the momentum\nspace sets in. Since HQs are too produced in the same time therefore the study\nof the effect of momentum anisotropy on the drag and diffusion coefficients\nbecomes advertently desirable. In this article we have thus studied the drag\nand diffusion of HQs in the anisotropic medium and found that the presence of\nthe anisotropy reduces both drag and diffusion coefficients. In addition, the\nanisotropy introduces an angular dependence to both the drag and diffusion\ncoefficients, as a result both coefficients get inflated when the partons are\nmoving transverse to the direction of anisotropy than parallel to the direction\nof anisotropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 06:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-06"}

When the channel\nmatrix can be accurately captured by a physical (geometric) scattering model\nacross multiple clusters/paths as is the case in mmW MIMO systems, we provide a\nphysical interpretation for this optimal structure: beam steering across the\ndifferent paths with appropriate power allocation and phase compensation.

The target is to minimize the total transmit power consumption\nwhen each user is served by an optimized subset of the base stations (BSs),\nusing non-coherent joint transmission. We first derive a lower bound on the\nergodic spectral efficiency (SE), which is applicable for any channel\ndistribution and precoding scheme. Closed-form expressions are obtained for\nRayleigh fading channels with either maximum ratio transmission (MRT) or zero\nforcing (ZF) precoding. From these bounds, we further formulate the DL power\nminimization problems with fixed SE constraints for the users. These problems\nare proved to be solvable as linear programs, giving the optimal power\nallocation and BS-user association with low complexity. Furthermore, we\nformulate a max-min fairness problem which maximizes the worst SE among the\nusers, and we show that it can be solved as a quasi-linear program.

Two degenerate metrics on the $4+d$-dimensional total manifold are\nused, one corresponding to the spacetime metric and giving the fiber of the\ngauge bundle, and the other one to the metric of the fiber and giving the\nhorizontal bundle of the connection. When combined, the two metrics give the\nKaluza metric and its generalization to the non-abelian case, justifying thus\nhis choice. Considering the two metrics as fundamental rather than the Kaluza\nmetric explains why Kaluza's theory should not be regarded as five-dimensional\nvacuum gravity. This approach suggests that the only evidence of extra\ndimensions is given by the existence of the gauge forces, explaining thus why\nother kinds of evidence are not available. In addition, because the degenerate\nmetric corresponding to the spacetime metric vanishes along the extra\ndimensions, the lengths in the extra dimensions is zero, preventing us to\ndirectly probe them. Therefore this approach suggests that it is not justified\nto search for experimental evidence of the extra dimensions as if they are\nmerely extra spacetime dimensions.

In an F-RAN, as in cloud-RAN\n(C-RAN), a baseband processing unit (BBU) can perform joint baseband processing\non behalf of the remote radio heads (RRHs) that are connected to the BBU by\nmeans of the fronthaul links. In addition to the minimal functionalities of\nconventional RRHs in C-RAN, the RRHs in an F-RAN may be equipped with local\ncaches, in which frequently requested contents can be stored, as well as with\nbaseband processing capabilities. They are hence referred to as enhanced RRH\n(eRRH). This work focuses on the design of the delivery phase for an arbitrary\npre-fetching strategy used to populate the caches of the eRRHs. Two\nfronthauling modes are considered, namely a hard-transfer mode, whereby\nnon-cached files are communicated over the fronthaul links to a subset of\neRRHs, and a soft-transfer mode, whereby the fronthaul links are used to convey\nquantized baseband signals as in a C-RAN. Unlike the hard-transfer mode in\nwhich baseband processing is traditionally carried out only at the eRRHs, the\nsoft-transfer mode enables both centralized precoding at the BBU and local\nprecoding at the eRRHs based on the cached contents, by means of a novel\nsuperposition coding approach. To attain the advantages of both approaches, a\nhybrid design of soft- and hard-transfer modes is also proposed. The problem of\nmaximizing the delivery rate is tackled under fronthaul capacity and per-eRRH\npower constraints. Numerical results are provided to compare the performance of\nhard- and soft-transfer fronthauling modes, as well as of the hybrid scheme,\nfor different baseline pre-fetching strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 14:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-12"}

(In the other points, the singularities are\nadequately cancelled as a whole to lead to a finite value.)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 07:12:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 15:18:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 12:09:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 12:37:10 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 13:24:10 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 07:13:04 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 14:46:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

A\nrobust theoretical framework is therefore required to study and properly\nunderstand human motion. Here we perform the eigenmode analysis of human motion\ndata gathered from mobile communication records, which allows us to explore the\nscaling properties and characteristics of human motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 07:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

This means following the\nelectron's path on its way from a cylindrical cathode moving toward a co-axial\ncylindrical anode in presence of a uniform magnetic field parallel to the\ncommon axis. After analyzing the situation without coupling to an external\noscillatory electric field, we employ methods of canonical perturbation theory\nto find the resonance condition between the frequencies of the free theory w_r,\nw_phi and the applied perturbing oscillatory frequency w. A long-time averaging\nprocess will then eliminate the periodic terms in the equation for the now\ntime-dependent action-angle variables. The terms that are no longer periodic\nwill cause secular changes so that the canonical action-angle variables (J,\ndelta) change in a way that the path of the electron will deform gradually so\nthat it can reach the anode. How the ensemble of the initially randomly\ndistributed electrons forms spokes and how their energy is conveyed to the\ncavity-field oscillation is the main focus of this article. Some remarks\nconcerning the importance of results in QED and the invention of radar theory\nand application conclude the article.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 09:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

A method for using\nthese FPGAs is to identify what proportion of a given workload would benefit\nfrom being implemented upon the available FPGAs while minimising communication\noff-chip. As part of the implementation of these tasks, care should be taken in\nidentifying the parallel execution mode, task or pipeline parallelism that\nshould be used. When considering a case study of computational finance tasks, a\nbenchmark workload of Heston and Black-Scholes-based options implemented using\nOpenCL and OpenSPL, the benefit of this method of using data centre FPGAs is\nillustrated. These devices deliver latency performance close to that of\nworkstation grade GPUs, while requiring considerably less energy, resulting in\n30% more floating point operations per Joule of energy consumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2016 22:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-19"}
