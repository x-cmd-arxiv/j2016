We identify filamentary structures around halos and we use these\nto define a sample of subhalos accreted from filaments as well as a control\nsample of subhalos accreted from other directions. We use these samples to\nstudy differences in satellite orbits produced by filamentary accretion. Our\nresults depend on host halo mass. We find that for low masses, subhalos\naccreted from filaments show $\\sim10\\%$ shorter lifetimes compared to the\ncontrol sample, they show a tendency towards more radial orbits, reach halo\ncentral regions earlier, and are more likely to merge with the host. For higher\nmass halos this lifetime difference dissipates and even reverses for cluster\nsized halos. This behavior appears to be connected to the fact that more\nmassive hosts are connected to stronger filaments with higher velocity\ncoherence and density, with slightly more radial subhalo orbits. Because\nsubhalos tend to follow the coherent flow of the filament, it is possible that\nsuch thick filaments are enough to shield the subhalo from the effect of\ndynamical friction at least during their first infall. We also identify subhalo\npairs/clumps which merge with one another after accretion. They survive as a\nclump for only a very short time, which is even shorter for higher subhalo\nmasses, suggesting that the Magellanic Clouds and other Local group satellite\nassociations, may have entered the MW virial radius very recently and probably\nare in their first infall.

Therefore one would expect that exotic smoothness is directly\nrelated to the quantization of general relativity.

In particular we discuss the appearance of a wildly\nembedded 3-manifold which we identify with a quantum state. Furthermore, we\nanalyze this quantum state by using foliation theory and relate it to an\nelement in an operator algebra. Then we describe a set of geometric,\nnon-commutative operators, the skein algebra, which can be used to determine\nthe geometry of a 3-manifold. This operator algebra can be understood as a\ndeformation quantization of the classical Poisson algebra of observables given\nby holonomies. The structure of this operator algebra induces an action by\nusing the quantized calculus of Connes. The scaling behavior of this action is\nanalyzed to obtain the classical theory of General Relativity (GRT) for large\nscales. This approach has some obvious properties: there are non-linear\ngravitons, a connection to lattice gauge field theory and a dimensional\nreduction from 4D to 2D. Some cosmological consequences like the appearance of\nan inflationary phase are also discussed. At the end we will get the simple\npicture that the change from the standard $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ to the exotic\n$R^{4}$ is a quantization of geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2016 22:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}

That is, in a sensor network,\nthe fusion center sequentially acquires samples by selecting one \"most\ninformative\" sensor at each time until a reliable decision can be made. In\nparticular, the sensor selection is carried out in the online fashion since it\ndepends on all the previous samples at each time. Our goal is to develop the\nsequential test (i.e., stopping rule and decision function) and sensor\nselection strategy that minimize the expected sample size subject to the\nconstraints on the error probabilities and sensor usages. To this end, we first\nrecast the usage-constrained formulation into a Bayesian optimal stopping\nproblem with different sampling costs for the usage-contrained sensors. The\nBayesian problem is then studied under both finite- and infinite-horizon\nsetups, based on which, the optimal solution to the original usage-constrained\nproblem can be readily established. Moreover, by capitalizing on the structures\nof the optimal solution, a lower bound is obtained for the optimal expected\nsample size. In addition, we also propose algorithms to approximately evaluate\nthe parameters in the optimal sequential test so that the sensor usage and\nerror probability constraints are satisfied. Finally, numerical experiments are\nprovided to illustrate the theoretical findings, and compare with the existing\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2016 23:33:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-26"}

While there is a solid testing framework for\ngeneral testing, this is incongruent with mutation-based testing methods,\nbecause it focuses on the correctness of a program for a test, while the\nessence of mutation-based testing concerns the differences between programs\n(including mutants) for a test.\n  In this paper, we begin the construction of our framework by defining a novel\ntesting factor, called a test differentiator, to transform the paradigm of\ntesting from the notion of correctness to the notion of difference.

The performance in\nmeasuring the ZH cross section using events in which the Higgs boson recoils\nagainst a Z boson which decays into a pair of muons or electrons has been\ndemonstrated based on full simulation of the ILD detector for three center of\nmass energies 250, 350, and 500 GeV, and two beam polarizations (Pe-,Pe+)\n=(-80%, +30%) and (+80%, -30%). This paper demonstrates in detail that the\nanalysis which achieved these results are model independent to the sub-percent\nlevel. Data selection methods are designed to optimize the precisions of the ZH\ncross section and at the same time minimize the bias on the measured due to\ndiscrepancy in signal efficiencies among Higgs decay modes. Under conservative\nassumptions which take into account unknown Higgs decay modes, the relative\nbias on the ZH cross section is shown to be smaller than 0.2% for all\ncenter-of-mass energies, which is five times below even the smallest ZH cross\nsection statistical uncertainties expected from the leptonic recoil\nmeasurements in a full 20 years ILC physics program.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 05:20:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2016 10:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-02-10"}

We trace the\nelectromagnetic momentum to be present in the form of a continuous transport of\nelectromagnetic energy from one part of the system to another, without causing\nany net change in the energy of the system. In a second case we show that the\nelectromagnetic momentum is nil irrespective of whether the charged system is\nstationary or in motion, even though the electromagnetic energy is present\nthroughout. We demonstrate that the conventional formulation of electromagnetic\nfield-momentum describes the systems consistently without any real\ncontradictions. Here we also make exposition of a curiosity where\nelectromagnetic energy decreases when the charged system gains velocity. Then\nwe discuss the more general question that has been raised -- Are the\nconventional formulas for energy-momentum of electromagnetic fields valid for\nall cases?

Existing Pregel-like\nsystems support a fault tolerance mechanism called checkpointing, which\nperiodically saves computation states as checkpoints to HDFS, so that when a\nfailure happens, computation rolls back to the latest checkpoint. However, a\ncheckpoint in existing systems stores a huge amount of data, including vertex\nstates, edges, and messages sent by vertices, which significantly degrades the\nfailure-free performance. Moreover, the high checkpointing cost prevents\nfrequent checkpointing, and thus recovery has to replay all the computations\nfrom a state checkpointed some time ago.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel checkpointing approach which only stores\nvertex states and incremental edge updates to HDFS as a lightweight checkpoint\n(LWCP), so that writing an LWCP is typically tens of times faster than writing\na conventional checkpoint. To recover from the latest LWCP, messages are\ngenerated from the vertex states, and graph topology is recovered by replaying\nincremental edge updates. We show how to realize lightweight checkpointing with\nminor modifications of the vertex-centric programming interface. We also apply\nthe same idea to a recently-proposed log-based approach for fast recovery, to\nmake it work efficiently in practice by significantly reducing the cost of\ngarbage collection of logs. Extensive experiments on large real graphs verified\nthe effectiveness of LWCP in improving both failure-free performance and the\nperformance of recovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 07:25:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-26"}

In particular, hash values of large collections can\nbe computed incrementally and/or in parallel. Homomorphic hashing is thus a\nvery useful primitive with applications ranging from database integrity\nverification to streaming set/multiset comparison and network coding.\n  Unfortunately, constructions of homomorphic hash functions in the literature\nare hampered by two main drawbacks: they tend to be much longer than usual hash\nfunctions at the same security level (e.g. to achieve a collision resistance of\n2^128, they are several thousand bits long, as opposed to 256 bits for usual\nhash functions), and they are also quite slow.\n  In this paper, we introduce the Elliptic Curve Multiset Hash (ECMH), which\ncombines a usual bit string-valued hash function like BLAKE2 with an efficient\nencoding into binary elliptic curves to overcome both difficulties. On the one\nhand, the size of ECMH digests is essentially optimal: 2m-bit hash values\nprovide O(2^m) collision resistance. On the other hand, we demonstrate a\nhighly-efficient software implementation of ECMH, which our thorough empirical\nevaluation shows to be capable of processing over 3 million set elements per\nsecond on a 4 GHz Intel Haswell machine at the 128-bit security level---many\ntimes faster than previous practical methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 08:03:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-26"}

We propose a mechanism for the boiling crisis that is based on the\nspreading of the dry spot under a vapor bubble. The spreading is initiated by\nthe vapor recoil force, a force coming from the liquid evaporation into the\nbubble. Since the evaporation intensity increases sharply near the triple\ncontact line, the influence of the vapor recoil can be described as a change of\nthe apparent contact angle. Therefore, for the most usual case of complete\nwetting of the heating surface by the liquid, the boiling crisis can be\nunderstood as a drying transition from complete to partial wetting. The state\nof nucleate boiling, which is boiling in its usual sense, is characterized by a\nvery large rate of heat transfer from the heating surface to the bulk because\nthe superheated liquid is carried away from the heating surface by the\ndeparting vapor bubbles. If the heating power is increased, the temperature of\nthe heating surface increases with the heat flux. When the heat flux from the\nheater reaches a threshold value q CHF (the critical heat flux, CHF), the vapor\nbubbles suddenly form a film which covers the heating surface and insulates the\nlatter from the bulk of the liquid. The temperature of the heating surface\ngrows so rapidly that the heater can fuse unless its power is controlled. This\nphenomenon is known under the names of \"boiling crisis,\" \"burnout,\" or\n\"Departure from Nucleate Boiling\" (DNB) [1]. The final state of this transition\nis called film boiling. This problem has become very important since the\n1940's, with the beginning of the industrial exploitation of heat exchangers\nwith large heat fluxes (as with nuclear power stations). Since then a huge\namount of research has been done for the various conditions of pool boiling\n(boiling without imposed external flow) and flow boiling (boiling of the\nflowing water) [2]. Numerous empirical correlations have been proposed, each\ndescribing the dependence of the CHF on the physical parameters of the liquid\nand of the heater more or less correctly for a particular geometry and\nparticular conditions of boiling [2]. A strong dependence of the threshold on\nthe details of the experimental setup coupled with difficulties in separating\nthe consequences of DNB from its causes is at the origin of a large number of\nfrequently controversial hypotheses [2]. The violence of boiling makes\nobservations quite difficult. Good quality photographic experiments are\npresented in only a few articles (see e.g. [3] -- [6]). Despite an increasing\ninterest in the physical aspect of the problem during recent years [7,8] and\nnumerous empirical approaches, the underlying physics still remains obscure. In\nthis Letter, we propose a model based on a non-equilibrium drying transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 08:42:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-26"}

We want to obtain a list, as complete as possible, of\nconfirmed members of the young open cluster Gamma Velorum, with the aim of\nderiving general cluster properties such as the IMF. We used all available\nspectroscopic membership indicators within the Gaia-ESO public archive together\nwith literature photometry and X-ray data and, for each method, we derived the\nmost complete list of candidate cluster members. Then, we considered\nphotometry, gravity and radial velocities as necessary conditions to select a\nsubsample of candidates whose membership was confirmed by using the lithium and\nH$\\alpha$ lines and X-rays as youth indicators. We found 242 confirmed and 4\npossible cluster members for which we derived masses using very recent stellar\nevolutionary models. The cluster IMF in the mass range investigated in this\nstudy shows a slope of $\\alpha=2.6\\pm0.5$ for $0.5<M/M_\\odot <1.3$ and\n$\\alpha=1.1\\pm0.4$ for $0.16<M/M_\\odot <0.5$ and is consistent with a standard\nIMF. The similarity of the IMF of the young population around $\\gamma^2 $Vel to\nthat in other star forming regions and the field suggests it may have formed\nthrough very similar processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 08:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

In this paper, we focus on the construction of an optical priority\nqueue with a single $(M+2)\\times (M+2)$ crossbar switch and $M$ fiber delay\nlines, and evaluate it in terms of the buffer size of the priority queue.\nCurrently, the best known upper bound of the buffer size is $O(2^M)$, while\nexisting methods can only construct a priority queue with buffer $O(M^3)$.\n  In this paper, we make a great step towards closing the above huge gap.

We use 4-to-1 multiplexers with different buffer sizes,\nwhich can be constructed efficiently with SDL, as intermediate building blocks\nto simplify the design.

Here, a sharp interface,\ncontinuum-level, novel modeling approach, accounting for liquid/solid\nmicro-scale interactions assembled in a disjoining pressure term, is presented.\nBy following a unified conception (the model applies both to the liquid/solid\nand the liquid/ambient interfaces), the friction forces at the contact line, as\nwell as the dynamic contact angle are derived implicitly as a result of the\ndisjoining pressure and viscous effects interplay in the vicinity of the\nsubstrate's intrinsic roughness.

The action of this\ngravity theory is a hybrid combination of the usual Einstein-Hilbert action and\na $f(\\mathcal{R})$ term constructed by the Palatini formalism. Interestingly,\nit seems that the existence of a light and long-range scalar field in this\ngravity may modify the cosmological and galactic dynamics without conflicting\nwith the laboratory and Solar System tests. In this paper we focus on the\ntensor perturbation of thick branes in this novel gravity theory.

We first\nassociate original definition of capturability with a time-margin, which\nencodes a time sequence that can capture the robot.

As\nindicated by magnetic susceptibility measurements, they exhibit predominantly\nantiferromagnetic interactions between rare earth moments. Except for possibly\nPr3Sb3Mg2O14 and Eu3Sb3Mg2O14, none of the compounds show any signs of magnetic\nordering above 2 K. This RE3Sb3Mg2O14 family of compounds is similar to that of\nRE3Sb3Zn2O14, except the series reported here features a fully ordered\ndistribution of cations in both the nonmagnetic antimony and magnesium sites\nand the magnetic rare earth kagome sites.

In the beginning of this\ncentury, Nernst experiments on cuprates were analyzed assuming that: i) The\ncontribution of quasi-particles to the Nernst signal is negligible; and ii)\nGaussian superconducting fluctuations cannot produce a Nernst signal well above\nthe critical temperature. Both these assumptions were contradicted by\nsubsequent experiments. This paper reviews experiments documenting multiple\nsources of a Nernst signal, which, according to the Brigman relation, measures\nthe flow of transverse entropy caused by a longitudinal particle flow. Along\nthe lines of Landauer's approach to transport phenomena, the magnitude of the\ntransverse magneto-thermoelectric response is linked to the quantum of\nthermoelectric conductance and a number of material-dependent length scales:\nthe mean-free-path, the Fermi wavelength, the de Broglie thermal wavelength and\nthe superconducting coherence length. Extremely mobile quasi-particles in\ndilute metals generate a widely-documented Nernst signal. Fluctuating Cooper\npairs in the normal state of superconductors have been found to produce a\ndetectable Nernst signal with an amplitude conform to the Gaussian theory,\nfirst conceived by Ussishkin, Sondhi and Huse. In addition to these microscopic\nsources, mobile Abrikosov vortices, mesoscopic objects carrying simultaneously\nentropy and magnetic flux, can produce a sizeable Nernst response. Finally, in\nmetals subject to a magnetic field strong enough to truncate the Fermi surface\nto a few Landau tubes, each exiting tube generates a peak in the Nernst\nresponse. The survey of these well-established sources of the Nernst signal is\na helpful guide to identify the origin of the Nernst signal in other\ncontroversial cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 15:56:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 13:43:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-28"}

However, the inevitable momentum spread of secondary ions\nlimits the precision of nuclear masses determined by using IMS. Therefore, the\nmomentum measurement in addition to the revolution period of stored ions is\ncrucial to reduce the influence of the momentum spread on the standard\ndeviation of the revolution period, which would lead to a much improved mass\nresolving power of IMS. One of the proposals to upgrade IMS is that the\nvelocity of secondary ions could be directly measured by using two\ntime-of-flight (double TOF) detectors installed in a straight section of a\nstorage ring. In this paper, we outline the principle of IMS with double TOF\ndetectors and the method to correct the momentum spread of stored ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 06:18:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 02:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

In this\narticle, we provide a complete analysis of the experiment, both from a\ntheoretical and conceptual point of view. Firstly, we solve the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation in the weak potential approximation, to obtain the amplitude of the\nrefracted and forward refracted beams, produced by the passage of neutrons\nthrough one of the three plates of the LLL interferometer. Secondly, we analyze\ntheir passage through a static magnetic field region. This allows us to find\nexplicit expressions for the intensities of the four beams exiting the\ninterferometer, two of which will be interfering and show a typical\n4$\\pi$-symmetry, when the strength of the magnetic field is varied. In the last\npart of the article, we provide a conceptual analysis of the experiment,\nshowing a neutron's phase change, when passing through the magnetic field, is\ndue to a longitudinal Stern-Gerlach effect, and not to a Larmor precession. We\nalso emphasize that these experiments do not prove the observability of the\nsign change of the wave function, when a neutron is 2$\\pi$ rotated, but\nstrongly indicate that the latter, like any other elementary \"particle,\" would\nbe a genuinely non-spatial entity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2016 14:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-06"}
