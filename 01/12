Increasing either the temperature or incident electric field (E)\ndecreases the superconducting condensate density and corresponding kinetic\ninductance of the SRRs. This alters the impedance matching in the metamaterial,\nreducing the peak absorption. At low electric fields, the absorption was\noptimized near 80% at T=10K and decreased to 20% at T=70K. For E=40kV/cm and\nT=10K, the peak absorption was 70% decreasing to 40% at 200kV/cm, corresponding\nto a modulation of 43%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 16:01:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 20:43:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

We find that the evolution of the late\ntime IR emission is also similar to the now fading optical emission. We provide\nthe complete record of the IR emission lines, as seen by Spitzer prior to day\n8,000.

We begin by analyse\nthe basic model without controls. We prove the existence of two disease-free\nequilibrium points and the possible existence of up to two endemic equilibrium\npoints (where the disease persists in the population). We show the existence of\na transcritical bifurcation and a possible saddle-node bifurcation and\nexplicitly derive threshold conditions for both, including defining the basic\nreproduction number, R 0 , which determines whether the disease can persist in\nthe population or not. The epidemiological consequence of saddle-node\nbifurcation (backward bifurcation) is that the classical requirement of having\nthe reproduction number less than unity, while necessary, is no longer\nsufficient for disease elimination from the population. It is further shown\nthat in the absence of disease--induced death, the model does not exhibit this\nphenomenon. We perform the sensitivity analysis to determine the model\nrobustness to parameter values. That is to help us to know the parameters that\nare most influential in determining disease dynamics. The model is extended by\nreformulating the model as an optimal control problem, with the use of five\ntime dependent controls, to assess the impact of vaccination combined with\ntreatment, individual protection and vector control strategies (killing adult\nvectors, reduction of eggs and larvae). By using optimal control theory, we\nestablish optimal conditions under which the disease can be eradicated and we\nexamine the impact of a possible combined control tools on the disease\ntransmission. The Pontryagin's maximum principle is used to characterize the\noptimal control.

Gill abandoned a successful career as a clock and watchmaker.\nHis speciality was in astrometry, an area of astronomy of both practical and\nscientific importance that tended to be eclipsed in the 20th century by the\nrise of astrophysics. As Her Majesty's Astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope for\n27 years, David Gill was admired for his prolific contribution to highly\naccurate and trustworthy results. David Gill's collaboration was desired by\nleading astronomers of the day and he was the only southern hemisphere\nrepresentative on the hugely important Conference Internationale des Etoiles\nFondamentales of 1896. He created with Jacobus Kapteyn the first extensive star\ncatalogue derived from photographic plates (the CPD), including over 450,000\nstars. He was an initiator of the biggest multi-national and multi-observatory\nproject of the century, taking on the role of President of the International\nCommission overseeing the Carte du Ciel project. David Gill raised the Cape of\nGood Hope observatory from a rather run-down jobbing observatory of the\nAdmiralty to the best observatory in the Southern hemisphere. He acquired in\nthe process the reputation of an expert in precision instrument design. He also\nmade a substantial name for himself as semi-official director of the geodetic\nsurvey of South Africa. Overall David Gill was highly influential, respected\nand well liked. With the resurgence of interest in astrometry, the contribution\nof David Gill to astronomy is due for a re-assessment a century after he died.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 16:47:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Dec 2017 17:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

The paper consists of the following themes,\nincluding many other topics. We prove that if every parameter ideal of a\nNoetherian local ring of prime characteristic $p>0$ is Frobenius closed, then\nit is $F$-injective. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the\ninjectivity of the Frobenius action on $H^i_{\\fm}(R)$ for all $i \\le\nf_{\\fm}(R)$, where $f_{\\fm}(R)$ is the finiteness dimension of $R$. As\napplications, we prove the following results. (a) If the ring is $F$-injective,\nthen every ideal generated by a filter regular sequence, whose length is equal\nto the finiteness dimension of the ring, is Frobenius closed. It is a\ngeneralization of a recent result of Ma and which is stated for generalized\nCohen-Macaulay local rings. (b) Let $(R,\\fm,k)$ be a generalized Cohen-Macaulay\nring of characteristic $p>0$. If the Frobenius action is injective on the local\ncohomology $H_{\\fm}^i(R)$ for all $i < \\dim R$, then $R$ is Buchsbaum. This\ngives an answer to a question of Takagi.

Typically in a menu based speech solution the user is required to\nrespond by speaking from a closed set of words when prompted by the system. A\nsequence of human speech response to the IVR prompts results in the completion\nof a transaction. A transaction is deemed successful if the speech solution can\ncorrectly recognize all the spoken utterances of the user whenever prompted by\nthe system.

It is an interesting question to ask whether, under suitable\nanalytic and topological conditions, the geometric genus (or other analytic\ninvariants) can be recovered from the link. The Casson invariant conjecture\npredicts that p_g can be identified using the Casson invariant in the case when\n(X,0) is a complete intersection and M has trivial first homology with integral\ncoefficients. The Seiberg-Witten invariant conjecture predicts that the\ngeometric genus of a Gorenstein singularity, whose link has trivial first\nhomology with rational coefficients, can be calculated as a normalized\nSeiberg-Witten invariant of the link. The first conjecture is still open, but\ncounterexamples have been found for the second one. We prove here the\nSeiberg-Witten invariant conjecture for hypersurface singularities given by a\nfunction with Newton nondegenerate principal part. We provide a theory of\ncomputation sequences and of the way they bound the geometric genus. Newton\nnondegenerate singularities can be resolved explicitly by Oka's algorithm, and\nwe exploit the combinatorial interplay between the resolution graph and the\nNewton diagram to show that in each step of the computation sequence we\nconstruct, the given bound is sharp. Our method recovers the geometric genus of\n(X,0) explicitly from the link, assuming that (X,0) is indeed Newton\nnondegenerate with a rational homology sphere link. Assuming some additional\ninformation about the Newton diagram, we recover part of the spectrum, as well\nas the Poincar\\'e series associated with the Newton filtration. Finally, we\nshow that the normalized Seiberg-Witten invariant associated with the canonical\nspin^c structure on the link coincides with our identification of the geometric\ngenus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 19:48:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-12"}

This has prevented the verification of one of the canonical predictions\nfor condensation, namely the phase diagram. In this work, we have created a\npolariton gas in a semiconductor microcavity in which the quasiparticles have a\nlifetime much longer than their thermalization time. This allows them to reach\nthermal equilibrium in a laser-generated confining trap. Their energy\ndistributions are well fit by equilibrium Bose-Einstein distributions over a\nbroad range of densities and temperatures from very low densities all the way\nup to the threshold for Bose-Einstein condensation. The good fits of the\nBose-Einstein distribution over a broad range of density and temperature imply\nthat the particles obey the predicted power law for the phase boundary of\nBose-Einstein condensation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 20:26:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 23:21:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 00:46:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

We suggest that the growth of SMBHs above a few 10^{10}\nM_sun is prevented by small-scale accretion physics, independent of the\nproperties of their host galaxies or of cosmology. Growing more massive BHs\nrequires a gas supply rate from galactic scales onto a nuclear region as high\nas >10^3 M_sun/yr. At such a high accretion rate, most of the gas converts to\nstars at large radii (~10-100 pc), well before reaching the BH. We adopt a\nsimple model (Thompson et al. 2005) for a star-forming accretion disk, and find\nthat the accretion rate in the sub-pc nuclear region is reduced to the smaller\nvalue of at most a few M_sun/yr. This prevents SMBHs from growing above\n~10^{11} M_sun in the age of the Universe. Furthermore, once a SMBH reaches a\nsufficiently high mass, this rate falls below the critical value at which the\naccretion flow becomes advection dominated. Once this transition occurs, BH\nfeeding can be suppressed by strong outflows and jets from hot gas near the BH.\nWe find that the maximum SMBH mass, given by this transition, is between\nM_{BH,max} ~ (1-6) * 10^{10} M_sun, depending primarily on the efficiency of\nangular momentum transfer inside the galactic disk, and not on other properties\nof the host galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 21:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2016 19:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

The mass accretion histories (MAHs) of CDM halos are also\nscale-free, and can be used to infer concentrations directly. These results do\nnot apply to WDM halos: their MAHs are not scale-free because of the\ncharacteristic scale imposed by the power-spectrum suppression. Further, the\nWDM $c({\\rm M},z)$ relation is non-monotonic: concentrations peak at a mass\nscale dictated by the truncation scale, and decrease at higher and lower\nmasses.

As they\nbecome older, stars lose mass and angular momentum, resulting in an observed\nslowdown in surface rotation. The technique of 'gyrochronology' uses the\nrotation period of a star to calculate its age. However, stars of known age\nmust be used for calibration, and, until recently, the approach was untested\nfor old stars (older than 1 gigayear, Gyr). Rotation periods are now known for\nstars in an open cluster of intermediate age (NGC 6819; 2.5 Gyr old), and for\nold field stars whose ages have been determined with asteroseismology. The data\nfor the cluster agree with previous period-age relations, but these relations\nfail to describe the asteroseismic sample. Here we report stellar evolutionary\nmodelling, and confirm the presence of unexpectedly rapid rotation in stars\nthat are more evolved than the Sun. We demonstrate that models that incorporate\ndramatically weakened magnetic braking for old stars can---unlike existing\nmodels---reproduce both the asteroseismic and the cluster data. Our findings\nmight suggest a fundamental change in the nature of ageing stellar dynamos,\nwith the Sun being close to the critical transition to much weaker magnetized\nwinds.

This finding questions the\npresumed torus morphology and its role at parsec scales, as one of its main\nattributes is to collimate the nuclear radiation, and is in line with\ninterferometric observations which show that most of the pc-scale dust is in\nthe polar direction. We estimate that the nuclear dust lane in Circinus\nprovides $1/3$ of the extinction required to obscure the nucleus. This\nconstitutes a conservative lower limit to the obscuration at the central\nparsecs, where the dust filaments might get optically thicker if they are the\nchannels that transport material from $\\sim$100 pc scales to the centre.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 21:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-13"}

We derive a closed-form statistic that:\n(i) Is mathematically proven to be the optimal transient detection statistic in\nthe limit of background-dominated noise; (ii) Is numerically stable; (iii) For\naccurately registered, adequately sampled images, does not leave subtraction or\ndeconvolution artifacts; (iv) Allows automatic transient detection to the\ntheoretical sensitivity limit by providing credible detection significance; (v)\nHas uncorrelated white noise; (vi) Is a sufficient statistic for any further\nstatistical test on the difference image, and in particular, allows to\ndistinguish particle hits and other image artifacts from real transients; (vii)\nIs symmetric to the exchange of the new and reference images; (viii) Is at\nleast an order of magnitude faster to compute than some popular methods; and\n(ix) Is straightforward to implement.

Optical\ncounterparts may be short-lived so rapid characterization of gravitational wave\n(GW) events is paramount for discovering electromagnetic signatures. One way to\nmeet the demand for rapid GW parameter estimation is to trade off accuracy for\nspeed, using waveform models with simplified treatment of the compact objects'\nspin. We report on the systematic errors in GW parameter estimation suffered\nwhen using different spin approximations to recover generic signals. Component\nmass measurements can be biased by $>5\\sigma$ using simple-precession waveforms\nand in excess of $20\\sigma$ when non-spinning templates are employed. This\nsuggests that electromagnetic observing campaigns should not take a strict\napproach to selecting which LIGO/Virgo candidates warrant follow-up\nobservations based on low-latency mass estimates. For sky localization, we find\nsearched areas are up to a factor of ${\\sim}$2 larger for non-spinning\nanalyses, and are systematically larger for any of the simplified waveforms\nconsidered in our analysis. Distance biases for the non-precessing waveforms\ncan be in excess of 100\\% and are largest when the spin angular momenta are in\nthe orbital plane of the binary. We confirm that spin-aligned waveforms should\nbe used for low-latency parameter estimation at the minimum.

This suggests that the high luminosity\nregions are dominated by a central group of young stars surrounded by a shell\nof clumpy interstellar gas. In contrast, the lower luminosity clumps are bright\nin the UV relative to H-alpha, suggesting either a high differential\nattenuation between the ionized gas and the stars, or a post-starburst\npopulation bright in the UV but faded in H-alpha.

Previous\nquantitative modeling research has identified artifact interactions, where a\ndesign change in one component influences others, as an important determinant\nof improvement rates. The models predict that improvement rate for a domain is\nproportional to the inverse of the domain interaction parameter. However, no\nempirical research has previously studied and tested the dependence of\nimprovement rates on artifact interactions. A challenge to testing the\ndependence is that any method for measuring interactions has to be applicable\nto a wide variety of technologies. Here we propose a patent-based method that\nis both technology domain-agnostic and less costly than alternative methods. We\nuse textual content from patent sets in 27 domains to find the influence of\ninteractions on improvement rates. Qualitative analysis identified six specific\nkeywords that signal artifact interactions.

For enhanced mechanical\ndisplacement sensing, squeezed states of light have been shown to reduce the\nphoton counting noise that limits the measurement noise floor. It has long been\npredicted, however, that suppressing the noise floor with squeezed light should\nproduce an unavoidable increase in radiation pressure noise that drives the\nmechanical system. Such nonclassical radiation pressure forces have thus far\nbeen hidden by insufficient measurement strengths and residual thermal\nmechanical motion. Since the ultimate measurement sensitivity relies on the\ndelicate balance between these two noise sources, the limits of the quantum\nenhancement have not been observed. Using a microwave cavity optomechanical\nsystem, we observe the nonclassical radiation pressure noise that necessarily\naccompanies any quantum enhancement of the measurement precision. By varying\nboth the magnitude and phase of the squeezing, we optimize the fundamental\ntrade-off between mechanical imprecision and backaction noise in accordance\nwith the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As the strength of the measurement\nis further increased, radiation pressure forces eventually dominate the\nmechanical motion. In this regime, the optomechanical interaction can be\nexploited as an efficient quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of the\namplitude fluctuations of the light field. By overwhelming mechanical thermal\nnoise with radiation pressure by two orders of magnitude, we demonstrate a\nmechanically-mediated measurement of the squeezing with an effective homodyne\nefficiency of 94%. Thus, with strong radiation pressures forces, mechanical\nmotion enhances the measurement of nonclassical light, just as nonclassical\nlight enhances the measurement of the motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2016 23:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-05"}

We study\ncombinations of existing methods, which are shown to vastly improve\ncomputational efficiency for these hierarchical models while maintaining the\nmodeling flexibility provided by embedded HMMs. The methods include discrete\nfiltering of the HMM likelihood to remove latent states, reduced data\nrepresentations, and a novel procedure for dynamic block sampling of posterior\ndimensions.

Most of them are low-mass X-ray binaries\n(LMXBs) comprised of a stellar-mass BH and a low-mass donor star. Although the\nformation of these systems has been extensively investigated, some crucial\nissues remain unresolved. The most noticeable one is that, the low-mass\ncompanion has difficulties in ejecting the tightly bound envelope of the\nmassive primary during the spiral-in process. While initially intermediate-mass\nbinaries are more likely to survive the common envelope (CE) evolution, the\nresultant BH LMXBs mismatch the observations. In this paper, we use both\nstellar evolution and binary population synthesis to study the evolutionary\nhistory of BH LMXBs.

To address the growing requirements for flexible ramp capacity,\nmarkets for ramp products have been launched in practice such as the ones in\nCalifornia ISO and Midcontinent ISO.

For j-th time frame, the LoR\nmethod computes a superset A_j of the set of bad states reachable in j\ntransitions only by the relaxed system. Set A_j is constructed by a technique\ncalled partial quantifier elimination. If A_j does not contain a bad state and\nthis state is reachable in j transitions in the relaxed system, it is also\nreachable in the original system. Hence the property in question does not hold.\n  The appeal of PC by LoR is as follows. An inductive invariant (or a\ncounterexample) generated by LoR is a result of computing the states reachable\nonly in the relaxed system.

We also used the GEOS database\nto study the Blazhko effect of galactic RRab stars. The closed curves\nrepresenting the Blazhko effect are constructed by plotting the magnitudes at\nmaximum vs. the O-C values. We obtained a variegate family of Blazhko\n\"potatoes\". We could also reconstruct the changes in the pulsational and\nBlazhko periods of RR Lyr itself, resulted to be completely decoupled.\nMoreover, the amplitude of the Blazhko effect decreased so much to be hardly\ndetectable by looking at the maxima collected in 2014 only. The effect seems to\nstart again in the 2015 data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 09:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-13"}

This is possible because human movement is highly\nregular, being constrained by invariance principles. Movement timing and\nmovement path, in particular, are linked through scaling laws. Separating\nvariations of movement timing from the spatial variations of movements is a\nwell-known challenge that is addressed in current approaches only through forms\nof preprocessing that bias analysis. Here we propose a novel nonlinear\nmixed-effects model for analyzing temporally continuous signals that contain\nsystematic effects in both timing and path. Identifiability issues of path\nrelative to timing are overcome by using maximum likelihood estimation in which\nthe most likely separation of space and time is chosen given the variation\nfound in data. The model is applied to analyze experimental data of human arm\nmovements in which participants move a hand-held object to a target location\nwhile avoiding an obstacle. The model is used to classify movement data\naccording to participant. Comparison to alternative approaches establishes\nnonlinear mixed-effects models as viable alternatives to conventional analysis\nframeworks. The model is then combined with a novel factor-analysis model that\nestimates the low-dimensional subspace within which movements vary when the\ntask demands vary. Our framework enables us to visualize different dimensions\nof movement variation and to test hypotheses about the effect of obstacle\nplacement and height on the movement path.

The\nmain reason for biometric technologies becoming more common in the everyday\nlives of consumers is because of the facility to easily capture biometric data\nin real time, using their mobile phones. Biometric technologies are providing\nthe potential security framework to make banking more convenient and secure\nthan it has ever been. At the same time, the exponential growth of enrollment\nin the biometric system produces massive amount of high dimensionality data\nthat leads to degradation in the performance of the mobile banking systems.\nTherefore, in order to overcome the performance issues arising due to this data\ndeluge, this paper aims to propose a distributed mobile biometric system based\non a high performance cluster Cloud.

Using data from the well documented outbursts of\nXTE J$1550$-$564$ we looked at possible hints that the presence of\nQuasi-Periodic Oscillations actually impacts the energy spectrum emitted by the\nsource.

To address this problem, we introduce a\ntransformation approach, mapping probability densities to a Hilbert space of\nfunctions through a continuous and invertible map. Basic methods of functional\ndata analysis, such as the construction of functional modes of variation,\nfunctional regression or classification, are then implemented by using\nrepresentations of the densities in this linear space. Representations of the\ndensities themselves are obtained by applying the inverse map from the linear\nfunctional space to the density space. Transformations of interest include log\nquantile density and log hazard transformations, among others. Rates of\nconvergence are derived for the representations that are obtained for a general\nclass of transformations under certain structural properties. If the\nsubject-specific densities need to be estimated from data, these rates\ncorrespond to the optimal rates of convergence for density estimation. The\nproposed methods are illustrated through simulations and applications in brain\nimaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 14:13:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-13"}

Here, using Brownian dynamics simulations of hard sphere\nparticles, we have examined high volume fraction shear-induced crystals under\noscillatory shear as well as the same volume fraction glass counterparts. We\nfind that, while the displacements under shear of the glass are isotropic, the\nsheared FCC crystal structures oriented parallel to shear, are anisotropic due\nto the cooperative motion of velocity-vorticity layers of particles sliding\nover each other. These sliding layers generally result in lower stresses and\nless overall particle displacements. Additionally, from the two crystal types,\nthe perpendicular crystal exhibits less stresses and displacements at smaller\nstrains, however at larger strains, the sliding layers of the parallel crystal\nare found to be more efficient in minimizing stresses and displacements, while\nthe perpendicular crystal becomes unstable.

The\nobservational constraints used in the recovery procedure are stellar mass,\nradius, effective temperature, and metallicity [Fe/H]. We defined the statistic\nW computed as the ratio of the absolute difference of estimated ages for the\ntwo stars over the age of the older one.

The median expected\ndifference in the reconstructed age between the coeval stars of a binary system\n-- caused alone by the observational uncertainties -- shows a strong dependence\non the evolutionary stage.

However, the diversity of possible configurations in a\nsingle device is usually rather limited. The achievement of a broad variety of\nmagnetic configurations might be valuable for some purposes, for example, to\nassay the effect of the magnetic configuration on turbulent transport. Thus, a\nmethod is created to systematically define sets of modular coils located on\nconcentric toroidal winding surfaces. The method is based on the expression of\na Last Closed Flux Surface (LCFS) by Fourier coefficients in cylindrical\ncoordinates and consists in the definition of successive windings located on\nequidistant concentric winding surfaces, each winding such that produces a\nmagnetic field which, when added to the magnetic field generated by a sole base\nwinding that generates a base magnetic configuration, produces a magnetic\nconfiguration whose LCFS is defined by the Fourier coefficients of the base\nmagnetic configuration plus only one new Fourier coefficient. The utilization\nof a diversity of currents in the different windings would give a linear\ncombination of magnetic fields that reproduce the LCFS defined mathematically\nby the respective Fourier coefficients. The deviation between a particular\nmodelled LCFS and the obtained LCFS from the windings depends on: the order and\nvalue of each Fourier coefficient, the selected shape of concentric winding\nsurfaces, and the possible intersection of the LCFS with the internal winding\nsurface. The method to generate the windings is reported and the application to\none case study is described.

A different class of\ndynamical processes involves the correlated movement of agents over space,\nwhich can be mediated through chemotactic movement or minimization of cell-cell\ninteraction energy. A classic example of the latter is given by the formation\nof spatially segregated assemblies when cells display differential adhesion.\nHere we consider a new class of dynamical models, involving cell adhesion among\ntwo stochastically exchangeable cell states as a minimal model capable of\nexhibiting well-defined, ordered spatial patterns. Our results suggest that a\nwhole space of pattern-forming rules is hosted by the combination of physical\ndifferential adhesion and the value of probabilities modulating cell phenotypic\nswitching, showing that Turing-like patterns can be obtained without resorting\nto reaction-diffusion processes.

In this paper we develop a nonperturbative\ntechnique for obtaining effective $k$-body interactions using Hamiltonians\nconsisting of at most $l$-body interactions with $l<k$. This technique works\nbest for Hamiltonians with a few interactions with very large $k$ and can be\nused together with perturbative gadgets to embed Hamiltonians of considerable\ncomplexity in proper subspaces of two-local Hamiltonians.

Recently, an eclipse timing\nstudy of the Kepler binaries has revealed eclipse timing variations in this\nobject with an amplitude of about 100 sec, and an outer period of 529 days. The\nimplied mass of the third body is that of a superJupiter, but below the mass of\na brown dwarf. We therefore embarked on a radial velocity study of this binary\nto determine its system configuration and to check the hypothesis that it hosts\na giant planet. From the radial velocity measurements, it became immediately\nobvious that the same Kepler target contains another eccentric binary, this one\nwith a 16.5-day orbital period. Direct imaging using adaptive optics reveals\nthat the two binaries are separated by 0.4 arcsec (about 167 AU), and have\nnearly the same magnitude (to within 2%). The close angular proximity of the\ntwo binaries, and very similar Gamma velocities, strongly suggest that KIC\n7177553 is one of the rare SB4 systems consisting of two eccentric binaries\nwhere at least one system is eclipsing. Both systems consist of slowly\nrotating, non-evolved, solar-like stars of comparable masses. From the orbital\nseparation and the small difference in Gamma velocity, we infer that the period\nof the outer orbit most likely lies in the range 1000 to 3000 years. New images\ntaken over the next few years, as well as the high-precision astrometry of the\nGaia satellite mission, will allow us to set much narrower constraints on the\nsystem geometry. Finally, we note that the observed eclipse timing variations\nin the Kepler data cannot be produced by the second binary.

As a by-product we therefore derive a new mathematical\nmodel of photoacoustic tomography based on Maxwell's equations.\n  It is well known by now, that without additional assumptions on the medium,\nit is not possible to uniquely reconstruct all optical parameters from either\none of these modalities alone. We show that in the combined approach one has\nadditional information, compared to a single modality, and the inverse problem\nof reconstruction of the optical parameters becomes feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 12:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}

More specifically, affects-emotions and moods-have\nan impact on cognitive activities and the working performance of individuals.\nDevelopment tasks are undertaken heavily through cognitive processes, yet\nsoftware engineering research (SE) lacks theory on affects and their impact on\nsoftware development activities. This PhD dissertation supports the advocates\nof studying the human and social aspects of SE and the psychology of\nprogramming. This dissertation aims to theorize on the link between affects and\nsoftware development performance. A mixed method approach was employed, which\ncomprises studies of the literature in psychology and SE, quantitative\nexperiments, and a qualitative study, for constructing a multifaceted theory of\nthe link between affects and programming performance. The theory explicates the\nlinkage between affects and analytical problem-solving performance of\ndevelopers, their software development task productivity, and the process\nbehind the linkage. The results are novel in the domains of SE and psychology,\nand they fill an important lack that had been raised by both previous research\nand by practitioners. The implications of this PhD lie in setting out the basic\nbuilding blocks for researching and understanding the affect of software\ndevelopers, and how it is related to software development performance. Overall,\nthe evidence hints that happy software developers perform better in analytic\nproblem solving, are more productive while developing software, are prone to\nshare their feelings in order to let researchers and managers understand them,\nand are susceptible to interventions for enhancing their affects on the job.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2016 14:27:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2016 10:30:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-01-27"}
