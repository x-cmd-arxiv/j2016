In this paper, we derive a new form of thermodynamically-consistent\nquasi-incompressible diffuse-interface Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard model for a\ntwo-phase flow of incompressible fluids with different densities. The\nderivation is based on mixture theory by invoking the second law of\nthermodynamics and Coleman-Noll procedure. We also demonstrate that our model\nand some of the existing models are equivalent and we provide a unification\nbetween them. In addition, we develop a linear and energy-stable\ntime-integration scheme for the derived model. Such a linearly-implicit scheme\nis nontrivial, because it has to suitably deal with all nonlinear terms, in\nparticular those involving the density. Our proposed scheme is the first linear\nmethod for quasi-incompressible two-phase flows with nonsolenoidal velocity\nthat satisfies discrete energy dissipation independent of the time-step size,\nprovided that the mixture density remains positive. The scheme also preserves\nmass. Numerical experiments verify the suitability of the scheme for two-phase\nflow applications with high density ratios using large time steps by\nconsidering the coalescence and break-up dynamics of droplets including\npinching due to gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2016 16:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 09:35:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 18:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

A very popular\nand powerful way of parameter estimation is the method of maximum likelihood\nestimation (MLE). Among the most widely used families of statistical models are\nmixture models, especially, mixtures of Gaussian distributions. A popular\nhard-clustering variant of the MLE problem is the so-called complete-data\nmaximum likelihood estimation (CMLE) method. The standard approach to solve the\nCMLE problem is the Classification-Expectation-Maximization (CEM) algorithm.\nUnfortunately, it is only guaranteed that the algorithm converges to some\n(possibly arbitrarily poor) stationary point of the objective function.\n  In this paper, we present two algorithms for a restricted version of the CMLE\nproblem. That is, our algorithms approximate reasonable solutions to the CMLE\nproblem which satisfy certain natural properties.

The energy range of the results is 1.71\\,GeV $<W<$ 2.19\\,GeV, with an\nangular range $-0.75 < \\cos\\theta^{\\star}_K < +0.85$.\n  Results: The observables extracted for both reactions are beam asymmetry\n$\\Sigma$, target asymmetry $T$, and the beam-recoil double polarization\nobservables $O_x$ and $O_z$.\n  Conclusions: Comparison with theoretical fits indicates that in the regions\nwhere no previous data existed, the new data contain significant new\ninformation, and strengthen the evidence for the set of resonances used in the\nlatest Bonn-Gatchina fit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2016 16:47:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 20:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

To study the stars\nthat produce such an intriguing pattern of photometric variability, we\nidentified a sample of eight stars with rotation periods between 0.8 and 11\ndays and photometric variability amplitudes of up to 7.5 %, showing a similar\nCoRoT light curve.

Forward integration of\nthe lunar orbit from this initial state predicts a modern inclination at least\nan order of magnitude smaller than the lunar value, a long-standing discrepancy\nknown as the lunar inclination problem. Here we show that the modern lunar\norbit provides a sensitive record of gravitational interactions with\nEarth-crossing planetesimals not yet accreted at the time of the Moon-forming\nevent.

Such observations have prompted questions about the abundance and\ndistribution of lunar hydrogen. Here, we investigate the related question of\nthe origin of lunar H: is the hydrogen observed a remnant of a much larger\ninitial inventory that was inherited from a wet Earth but partly depleted\nduring the process of origin, or was hydrogen quantitatively lost from the\nlunar material, with water being delivered to lunar reservoirs via subsequent\nimpacts after the origins sequence? Motivated by recent results pointing to a\nlimited extent of hydrogen escape from the gravity field of the Earth during\nlunar origin, we apply a newly developed thermodynamic model of liquid-vapor\nsilicates to the proto-lunar disk to interrogate the behavior of H as a trace\nelement in the energetic aftermath of the giant impact. We find that: (1)\npre-existing H-bearing molecules are rapidly dissociated at the temperatures\nconsidered (3,100-4,200 K) and vaporized hydrogen predominantly exists as\nOH(v), H(v) and MgOH(v) for nearly the full range of thermal states encountered\nin the proto-lunar disk, (2) despite such a diversity in the vapor speciation,\nwhich reduces the water fugacity and favors hydrogen exsolution from\nco-existing liquids, the equilibration of the vapor atmosphere with the disk\nliquid results in significant dissolution of H into proto-lunar magmas, and (3)\nequilibrium H isotopic fractionation in this setting is limited to < 10 per mil\nand the terrestrial character of lunar D/H recently inferred should extend to\nsuch a precision if liquid-vapor equilibration in the proto-lunar disk is the\nprocess that gave rise to lunar hydrogen.

The proposed fRBF kernel performs very similarly to the RBF kernel.\nBoth RBF and fRBF kernels require an important tuning parameter ($\\gamma$).\nInterestingly, for a significant portion of the datasets, the min-max kernel\noutperforms the best-tuned RBF/fRBF kernels. The acos kernel and acos-$\\chi^2$\nkernel also perform well in general and in some datasets achieve the best\naccuracies.\n  One crucial issue with the use of nonlinear kernels is the excessive\ncomputational and memory cost. These days, one increasingly popular strategy is\nto linearize the kernels through various randomization algorithms. In our\nstudy, the randomization method for the min-max kernel demonstrates excellent\nperformance compared to the randomization methods for other types of nonlinear\nkernels, measured in terms of the number of nonzero terms in the transformed\ndataset.\n  Our study provides evidence for supporting the use of the min-max kernel and\nthe corresponding randomized linearization method (i.e., the so-called \"0-bit\nCWS\"). Furthermore, the results motivate at least two directions for future\nresearch: (i) To develop new (and linearizable) nonlinear kernels for better\naccuracies; and (ii) To develop better linearization algorithms for improving\nthe current linearization methods for the RBF kernel, the acos kernel, and the\nacos-$\\chi^2$ kernel. One attempt is to combine the min-max kernel with the\nacos kernel or the acos-$\\chi^2$ kernel. The advantages of these two new and\ntuning-free nonlinear kernels are demonstrated vias our extensive experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2016 19:11:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-22"}

A quasi-satellite trajectory is a heliocentric orbit in co-orbital\nresonance with the planet, characterized by a non zero eccentricity and a\nresonant angle that librates around zero. Likewise, in the rotating frame with\nthe planet it describes the same trajectory as the one of a retrograde\nsatellite even though the planet acts as a perturbator. In the last few years,\nthe discoveries of asteroids in this type of motion made the term\n\"quasi-satellite\" more and more present in the literature. However, some\nauthors rather use the term \"retrograde satellite\" when referring to this kind\nof motion in the studies of the restricted problem in the rotating frame. In\nthis paper we intend to clarify the terminology to use, in order to bridge the\ngap between the perturbative co-orbital point of view and the more general\napproach in the rotating frame. Through a numerical exploration of the\nco-orbital phase space, we describe the quasi-satellite domain and highlight\nthat it is not reachable by low eccentricities by averaging process. We will\nshow that the quasi-satellite domain is effectively included in the domain of\nthe retrograde satellites and neatly defined in terms of frequencies.\nEventually, we highlight a remarkable high eccentric quasi-satellite orbit\ncorresponding to a frozen ellipse in the heliocentric frame. We extend this\nresult to the eccentric case (planet on an eccentric motion) and show that two\nfamilies of frozen ellipses originate from this remarkable orbit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2016 19:15:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 14:52:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2017 19:45:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 5 Nov 2018 13:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-06"}

Many\nbitmap compression techniques have been proposed, almost all relying primarily\non run-length encoding (RLE). However, on unsorted data, we can get superior\nperformance with a hybrid compression technique that uses both uncompressed\nbitmaps and packed arrays inside a two-level tree. An instance of this\ntechnique, Roaring, has recently been proposed. Due to its good performance, it\nhas been adopted by several production platforms (e.g., Apache Lucene, Apache\nSpark, Apache Kylin and Druid).\n  Yet there are cases where run-length encoded bitmaps are smaller than the\noriginal Roaring bitmaps---typically when the data is sorted so that the\nbitmaps contain long compressible runs. To better handle these cases, we build\na new Roaring hybrid that combines uncompressed bitmaps, packed arrays and RLE\ncompressed segments. The result is a new Roaring format that compresses better.\n  Overall, our new implementation of Roaring can be several times faster (up to\ntwo orders of magnitude) than the implementations of traditional RLE-based\nalternatives (WAH, Concise, EWAH) while compressing better.

When\nthe items' weights are arranged in the same order as their values, we show that\nthe induced coupling for the cumulative values is a submartingale coupling.

The relative rates\nof these processes are set by the relative energy density of the interstellar\nradiation field and the magnetic field within the Bubbles; consequently, under\nthe hypothesis of a common origin, the combination of the gamma-ray and\nmicrowave measurements can be used to estimate the magnetic field within the\nBubbles.

A critical uncertainty in extracting\nthe intensity, spectrum, and morphology of this excess concerns the accuracy of\nastrophysical diffuse gamma-ray emission models near the GC. Recently, it has\nbeen noted that many diffuse emission models utilize a cosmic-ray injection\nrate far below that predicted based on the observed star formation rate in the\nCentral Molecular Zone. In this study, we add a cosmic-ray injection component\nwhich non-linearly traces the Galactic H2 density determined in\nthree-dimensions, and find that the associated gamma-ray emission is degenerate\nwith many properties of the GC gamma-ray excess. In models that utilize a large\nsideband (40x40 deg surrounding the GC) to normalize the best-fitting diffuse\nemission models, the intensity of the GC excess decreases by a factor of 2, and\nthe morphology of the excess becomes less peaked and less spherically\nsymmetric. In models which utilize a smaller region of interest (15x15 deg) the\naddition of an excess template instead suppresses the intensity of the best-fit\nastrophysical diffuse emission, and the GC excess is rather resilient to\nchanges in the details of the astrophysical diffuse modeling. In both analyses,\nthe addition of a GC excess template still provides a statistically significant\nimprovement to the overall fit to the gamma-ray data. We also implement\nadvective winds at the GC, and find that the Fermi-LAT data strongly prefer\noutflows of order several hundred km/s, whose role is to efficiently advect\nlow-energy cosmic rays from the Galactic center. Finally, we perform numerous\ntests of our models, and conclude that they significantly improve our\nunderstanding of multi-wavelength non-thermal emission from the GC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2016 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-14"}

At this precise value of\nfrustration, the classical model has a very large degeneracy which makes the\nproblem difficult to handle. We show that introducing a ferromagnetic $J_3$\ncoupling partially lifts this degeneracy. It gives rise to a four-site magnetic\nunit cell with the constraint that the spins on every square must add to zero.\nThis leads to a two-parameter family of ground states and an emergent vector\norder parameter. We reinterpret this family of ground states as coexistence\nstates of three spirals. Using spin wave analysis, we show that thermal and\nquantum fluctuations break this degeneracy differently. Thermal fluctuations\nbreak it down to a threefold degeneracy with a N\\'eel phase and two stripe\nphases. This threefold symmetry is restored via a $Z_3$ thermal transition, as\nwe demonstrate using classical Monte Carlo simulations. On the other hand,\nquantum fluctuations select the N\\'eel state.

The idea is to filter away low-energy charge\ncarriers in order to increase Seebeck coefficient without compromising\nelectronic conductivity. This concept was investigated in the present paper for\na specific material (ZnSb) by a combination of first-principles atomic-scale\ncalculations, Boltzmann transport theory, and experimental studies of the same\nsystem. The potential of filtering in this material was first quantified, and\nit was as an example found that the power factor could be enhanced by an order\nof magnitude when the filter barrier height was 0.5~eV. Measured values of the\nHall carrier concentration in bulk ZnSb were then used to calibrate the\ntransport calculations, and nanostructured ZnSb with average grain size around\n70~nm was processed to achieve filtering as suggested previously in the\nliterature. Various scattering mechanisms were employed in the transport\ncalculations and compared with the measured transport properties in\nnanostructured ZnSb as a function of temperature. Reasonable correspondence\nbetween theory and experiment could be achieved when a combination of constant\nlifetime scattering and energy filtering with a 0.25~eV barrier was employed.\nHowever, the difference between bulk and nanostructured samples was not\nsufficient to justify the introduction of an energy filtering mechanism.

The advent of high sensitivity, high resolution imaging in the\nsubmillimetre where both the solid and gas components of disks can be detected\nopens up new possibilities for understanding the dynamical histories of these\nsystems and therefore, a better ability to place our own solar system, which\nhosts a highly evolved debris disk, in context. Comparisons of dust masses from\nprotoplanetary and debris disks have revealed a stark downturn in mass in\nmillimetre-sized grains around a stellar age of 10 Myr, ostensibly in the\n\"transition disk\" phase, suggesting a period of rapid accretion of such grains\nonto planetesimals. This rapid formation phase is in keeping with radionucleide\nstudies of Kuiper Belt Objects in the solar system. Importantly, this suggests\nthat any thermal gradients in the gas of disks of this era will be \"frozen in\"\nto the planetesimals as they rapidly accrete from the solids and ices in their\nvicinity. Measurements of radial gradients in thermal tracers such as DHO, DCN\nand other tracers can therefore provide insight into the nascent solar system's\nabudances. In studies of dynamical evolution of the solar system, it is tacitly\nassumed that such abundances can reveal the location of formation for bodies\nnow found in the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt. Similarly, evidence of gas\ndetected from collisional evolution in young debris disks could potentially\nreveal how rapidly objects have dynamically evolved in those systems, most of\nwhich will be significantly younger than the solar system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2016 23:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

Metal absorbers probe the UVB's slope because different ions are\nsensitive to different energies.

We take a first step towards studying the reionization-epoch UVB's\nslope and inhomogeneity by comparing observations of 12 metal absorbers at\n$z\\sim6$ versus predictions from a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation using\nthree different UVBs: a soft, spatially-inhomogeneous \"galaxies+QSOs\" UVB; a\nhomogeneous \"galaxies+QSOs\" UVB (Haardt & Madau 2012); and a QSOs-only model.\nAll UVBs reproduce the observed column density distributions of CII, SiIV, and\nCIV reasonably well although high-column, high-ionization absorbers are\nunderproduced, reflecting numerical limitations. With upper limits treated as\ndetections, only a soft, fluctuating UVB reproduces both the observed SiIV/CIV\nand CII/CIV distributions. The QSOs-only UVB overpredicts both CIV/CII and\nCIV/SiIV, indicating that it is too hard.

In\nearlier work we pursued the idea that warm plasma is supplied to the corona via\ndirect heating of the chromosphere by nanoflares, contrary to the prevailing\nbelief that the corona is heated in-situ and the chromosphere is subsequently\nenergized and ablated by thermal conduction.

In the present work we follow up on another suggestion that the\ncorona could be powered by chromospheric nanoflares that repeat on a timescale\nsubstantially shorter than the cooling/draining timescale. That is, a single\nmagnetic strand is re-supplied with coronal plasma before the existing plasma\nhas time to cool and drain.

Smooth haptic\nfeedback is an important task for haptic rendering with complex virtual\nobjects. However, commonly the update rate of the haptic rendering may drop\ndown during multi-point contact in complex scenarios because high computational\ncost is required for collision detection and physically-based dynamic\nsimulation. If the haptic rendering is done at a lower update rate, it may\ncause discontinuous or instable force/torque feedback. Therefore, to implement\nsmooth and accurate haptic rendering, the update rate of force/torque\ncalculation should be kept in a high and constant frequency. In the proposed\nmethod, the auto-regressive model with real-time coefficients update is\nproposed to predict interactive forces/torques during the physical simulation.\nIn addition, we introduce a spline function to dynamically interpolate smooth\nforces/torques in haptic display according to the update rate of physical\nsimulation.

We aim to study the long term temporal\nand spectral variability in the radiation from Mkn 421 during 2009-2015.\n  Methods: We quantify the variability and lognormality from the radio to the\nVHE bands, and compute the correlations between the various wavebands using the\nz-transformed discrete correlation function. We construct the Spectral Energy\nDistribution (SED) contemporaneous with HAGAR observation seasons and fit it\nwith a one zone synchrotron self Compton model to study the spectral\nvariability.\n  Results: The flux is found to be highly variable across all time scales. The\nvariability is energy dependant, and is maximum in the X-ray and Very High\nEnergy (VHE) bands. A strong correlation is found between the Fermi-LAT (gamma)\nand radio bands, and between Fermi-LAT and optical, but none between Fermi-LAT\nand X-ray. Lognormality in the flux distribution is clearly detected. This is\nthe third blazar, following BL~Lac and PKS~2155$+$304 to show this behavior.\nThe SED can be well fit by a one zone SSC model, and variations in the flux\nstates can be attributed mainly due to changes in the particle distribution.

The classical\naim in this context is to compute a control policy that maximizes the\nprobability of satisfying the specification.

For infinite-time horizon specifications, this implies that the\nspecification is violated with probability 1 in the long run no matter what\npolicy is chosen, which prevents previous policy computation methods from being\nuseful in these scenarios.\n  In this paper, we introduce a new optimization criterion for MDP policies\nthat captures the task of working towards the satisfaction of some\ninfinite-time horizon $\\omega$-regular specification.

We give an algorithm to compute policies that are\noptimal in this criterion and show that it captures the ideas of optimism and\nrisk-averseness in MDP control: while the computed policies are optimistic in\nthat a MDP run enters a failure state relatively late, they are risk-averse by\nalways maximizing the probability to reach their respective next goal state.

Unlike\nexisting indoor localization systems, our approach does not require any\ntime-consuming and laborious site survey phase to characterize the radio\nsignals in the environment. To be precise, we construct the fingerprint map by\ncutting the layouts of the interested area into regions with only the knowledge\nof positions of APs. This can be done offline within a second and has a\npotential for practical use. The localization is then achieved by matching the\nordered AP-sequence to the ones in the fingerprint map. Different from\ntraditional fingerprinting that employing all APs information, we use only\nselected APs to perform localization, due to the fact that, without site\nsurvey, the possibility in obtaining the correct AP sequence is lower if it\ninvolves more APs. Experimental results show that, the proposed system achieves\nlocalization accuracy < 5m with an accumulative density function (CDF) of 50%\nto 60% depending on the density of APs. Furthermore, we observe that, using all\nAPs for localization might not achieve the best localization accuracy, e.g. in\nour case, 4 APs out of total 7 APs achieves the best performance. In practice,\nthe number of APs used to perform localization should be a design parameter\nbased on the placement of APs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 10:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

In dynamic\natmosphere and wind models, the stellar pulsation is often simulated by\nprescribing a simple sinusoidal variation in velocity and luminosity at the\ninner boundary of the model atmosphere. We experiment with different forms of\nthe luminosity variation in order to assess the effects on the wind velocity\nand mass-loss rate, when progressing from the simple sinusoidal recipe towards\nmore realistic descriptions. Using state-of-the-art dynamical models of C-rich\nAGB stars, a range of different asymmetric shapes of the luminosity variation\nand a range of phase shifts of the luminosity variation relative to the radial\nvariation are tested. These tests are performed on two stellar atmosphere\nmodels. The first model has dust condensation and, as a consequence, a stellar\nwind is triggered, while the second model lacks both dust and wind. The first\nmodel with dust and stellar wind is very sensitive to moderate changes in the\nluminosity variation. There is a complex relationship between the luminosity\nminimum, and dust condensation: changing the phase corresponding to minimum\nluminosity can either increase or decrease mass-loss rate and wind velocity.\nThe luminosity maximum dominates the radiative pressure on the dust, which in\nturn, is important for driving the wind. These effects of changed luminosity\nvariation are coupled with the dust formation. In contrast there is very little\nchange to the structure of the model without dust.

Because of the powerfulness of MLP and $ 1\\times 1 $\nconvolutions in spatial domain, NiN has stronger ability of feature\nrepresentation and hence results in better recognition rate. However, MLP\nitself consists of fully connected layers which give rise to a large number of\nparameters. In this paper, we propose to replace dense shallow MLP with sparse\nshallow MLP. One or more layers of the sparse shallow MLP are sparely connected\nin the channel dimension or channel-spatial domain. The proposed method is\nimplemented by applying unshared convolution across the channel dimension and\napplying shared convolution across the spatial dimension in some computational\nlayers. The proposed method is called CiC. Experimental results on the CIFAR10\ndataset, augmented CIFAR10 dataset, and CIFAR100 dataset demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed CiC method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 12:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

Measuring peak counts\nseparately from different scales yields tighter constraints than using a\ncombined peak histogram from a single map that includes multiscale information.\nOur results suggest that a compensated filter function with counts included\nseparately from different smoothing scales yields the tightest constraints on\ncosmological parameters from WL peaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 13:08:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 15:47:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-03"}

The absence of simultaneous data at lower\nenergies led to a rather incomplete characterization of the broadband spectral\nenergy distribution (SED). We study the source properties and the emission\nmechanisms, probing whether a simple one-zone synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC)\nscenario is able to explain the observed broadband spectrum. We analyzed VHE to\nradio data from 2011 and 2012 collected by MAGIC, $Fermi$-LAT, $Swift$, KVA,\nOVRO, and Mets\\\"ahovi in addition to optical polarimetry data and radio maps\nfrom the Liverpool Telescope and MOJAVE. The VHE spectrum was fit with a simple\npower law with a photon index of $3.69\\pm0.22$ and a flux above 150 GeV of\n$(1.46\\pm0.16)\\times10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. 1ES 1011+496 was found to\nbe in a generally quiescent state at all observed wavelengths, showing only\nmoderate variability from radio to X-rays. A low degree of polarization of less\nthan 10% was measured in optical, while some bright features polarized up to\n60% were observed in the radio jet. A similar trend in the rotation of the\nelectric vector position angle was found in optical and radio. The radio maps\nindicated a superluminal motion of $1.8\\pm0.4\\,c$, which is the highest speed\nstatistically significantly measured so far in a high-frequency-peaked BL Lac.\nFor the first time, the high-energy bump in the broadband SED of 1ES 1011+496\ncould be fully characterized from 0.1 GeV to 1 TeV which permitted a more\nreliable interpretation within the one-zone SSC scenario. The polarimetry data\nsuggest that at least part of the optical emission has its origin in some of\nthe bright radio features, while the low polarization in optical might be due\nto the contribution of parts of the radio jet with different orientations of\nthe magnetic field to the optical emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 13:19:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2016 09:39:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 12:16:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 6 Jun 2016 11:14:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-09"}

A recent\nimpressive tragedy is the 2014 Shanghai Stampede, where 36 people were killed\nand 49 were injured in celebration of the New Year's Eve on December 31th 2014\nin the Shanghai Bund. Due to the innately stochastic and complicated individual\nmovement, it is not easy to predict collective gatherings, which potentially\nleads to crowd events. In this paper, with leveraging the big data generated on\nBaidu map, we propose a novel approach to early warning such potential crowd\ndisasters, which has profound public benefits. An insightful observation is\nthat, with the prevalence and convenience of mobile map service, users usually\nsearch on the Baidu map to plan a routine. Therefore, aggregating users' query\ndata on Baidu map can obtain priori and indication information for estimating\nfuture human population in a specific area ahead of time. Our careful analysis\nand deep investigation on the Baidu map data on various events also\ndemonstrates a strong correlation pattern between the number of map query and\nthe number of positioning users in an area. Based on such observation, we\npropose a decision method utilizing query data on Baidu map to invoke warnings\nfor potential crowd events about 1-3 hours in advance. Then we also construct a\nmachine learning model with heterogeneous data (such as query data and mobile\npositioning data) to quantitatively measure the risk of the potential crowd\ndisasters.

To solve\nthese problems we propose the random parallel stochastic algorithm (RAPSA). We\ncall the algorithm random parallel because it utilizes multiple processors to\noperate in a randomly chosen subset of blocks of the feature vector. We call\nthe algorithm parallel stochastic because processors choose elements of the\ntraining set randomly and independently. Algorithms that are parallel in either\nof these dimensions exist, but RAPSA is the first attempt at a methodology that\nis parallel in both, the selection of blocks and the selection of elements of\nthe training set. In RAPSA, processors utilize the randomly chosen functions to\ncompute the stochastic gradient component associated with a randomly chosen\nblock. The technical contribution of this paper is to show that this minimally\ncoordinated algorithm converges to the optimal classifier when the training\nobjective is convex. In particular, we show that: (i) When using decreasing\nstepsizes, RAPSA converges almost surely over the random choice of blocks and\nfunctions.

These models extend those of noisy communication channel and of\nreliable communication through a noisy channel. The capacity of a noisy\ncomputation is defined and justified by a coding theorem and a converse. Under\nsome constraints on the encoding process, capacity is the upper bound of input\nrates allowing reliable computation, i.e. decodability of noisy outputs into\nexpected outputs. These results hold when the one-sided random processes under\nconcern are asymptotic mean stationary (AMS) and ergodic. In addition, some\ncharacterizations of AMS and ergodic noisy computations are given based on\nstability properties of the perfect function f and of the random channel F.\nThese results are derived from the more general framework of channel products.\nFinally, a way to apply the noisy and reliable computation models to cases\nwhere the perfect function f is defined according to a formal computational\nmodel is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 14:08:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

MPICH, as one of the contemporary widely-used MPI software\nstacks, implements the broadcast operation based on point-to-point operation.\nDepending on the parameters, such as message size and process count, the\nlibrary chooses to use different algorithms, as for instance binomial\ndissemination, recursive-doubling exchange or ring all-to-all broadcast\n(allgather).

While it has been shown that the\ntopological response (anomalous Hall conductivity) is protected against the CDW\nstate, we find that the long wavelength plasmon excitation is radically\ninfluenced by the dynamics of the CDW order parameter. In the normal state, we\nshow that an undamped collective mode should exist at q~Q_(CDW) if there is an\nattractive interaction favoring the formation of the CDW state. The undamped\nnature of this collective mode is attributed to a gap-like feature in the\nparticle-hole continuum at q~Q_(CDW) due to the chirality of the Weyl nodes,\nwhich is not seen in other materials with CDW instability. In the CDW state,\nthe long wavelength plasmon excitations become more dispersive due to the\nadditional interband scattering not allowed in the normal state. Moreover,\nbecause the translational symmetry is spontaneously broken, Umklapp scattering,\nthe process conserving the total momentum only up to nQ_(CDW) with n an integer\nand Q_(CDW) the ordering wave vector, emerges in the CDW state. We find that\nthe plasmon excitation couples to the phonon mode of the CDW order via the\nUmklapp scattering, leading to two branches of resonant collective modes\nobservable in the density-density correlation function at q~0 and q~Q_(CDW).\nBased on our analysis, we propose that measuring these resonant plasmon-axion\nexcitations around q~0 and q~Q_(CDW) by the momentum-resolved electron energy\nloss spectroscopy (M-EELS) could serve as a reliable way to detect the axionic\nCDW state in Weyl semimetals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 14:41:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2016 12:44:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

Naturally, the patch-size has a major impact on the\nmatching quality, and on the consequent application performance. Under the\nassumption that our patch database is sufficiently sampled, using large patches\n(e.g. 21-by-21) should be preferred over small ones (e.g. 7-by-7). However,\nthis \"dense-sampling\" assumption is rarely true; in most cases large patches\ncannot find relevant nearby examples. This phenomenon is a consequence of the\ncurse of dimensionality, stating that the database-size should grow\nexponentially with the patch-size to ensure proper matches. This explains the\nfavored choice of small patch-size in most applications.\n  Is there a way to keep the simplicity and work with small patches while\ngetting some of the benefits that large patches provide? In this work we offer\nsuch an approach. We propose to concatenate the regular content of a\nconventional (small) patch with a compact representation of its (large)\nsurroundings - its context. Therefore, with a minor increase of the dimensions\n(e.g. with additional 10 values to the patch representation), we\nimplicitly/softly describe the information of a large patch. The additional\ndescriptors are computed based on a self-similarity behavior of the patch\nsurrounding.\n  We show that this approach achieves better matches, compared to the use of\nconventional-size patches, without the need to increase the database-size.\nAlso, the effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on three distinct\nproblems: (i) External natural image denoising, (ii) Depth image\nsuper-resolution, and (iii) Motion-compensated frame-rate up-conversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 14:44:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 May 2016 14:28:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 14:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

Thus, we\nmodel the galaxy bispectrum and forecast the accuracy with which it will probe\nthe parameter $f_{\\rm NL}$, which represents the degree of primordial\nlocal-type non Gaussianity.

We start our discussion\nwith exploring the possibility of MSSM inflation in the light of recent\nobserved data from various D -flat directions using the saddle and inflection\npoint techniques. The effective inflaton potential around saddle point and\ninflection point have been utilized in estimating the observable parameters and\nconfronting them with WMAP7 and Planck dataset. Next we explore the possibility\nof inflation from the five dimensional ${\\cal N} = 2$ supergravity setup by\nderiving the effective potential in the context of RS like braneworld model and\nDBI Galileon. After deriving an four dimensional effective potential, we obtain\nthe inflationary observables from both the scenarios and confront them with the\nWMAP data.

However, in the ATC diffusion algorithm, fixed step\nsizes are used in the update equations for velocity vectors and location\nvectors. When the nodes are too far away from the target, such strategies may\nrequire large number of iterations to reach the target.
