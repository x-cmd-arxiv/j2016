Apart from nonlocality,\nthese sets have other interesting properties. In particular, the completable\nsets lead to the construction of a class of complete orthogonal product bases\nwith the property that if such a basis is given then no state can be eliminated\nfrom that basis by performing orthogonality-preserving measurements.

The\norigin of these modifications are corrections to the Mukhanov-Sasaki equations\nthat govern the propagation of the primeval cosmological perturbations. The\nspecific form of these corrections depends on a series of details of the\nquantization approach and of the prescription followed to implement it.\nGenerally, nonetheless, the complexity of the theoretical quantum formulation\nis simplified in practice appealing to a semiclassical or effective\napproximation, in order to perform concrete numerical computations. In this\nwork, we introduce technical tools and design a procedure to deal with these\nquantum corrections beyond the most direct approximations employed so far in\nthe literature. In particular, by introducing an interaction picture, we\nextract the quantum dynamics of the homogeneous geometry in absence of scalar\nfield potential and inhomogeneities, dynamics that has been intensively studied\nand that can be integrated. The rest of our analysis focuses on the interaction\nevolution, putting forward methods to cope with it. The ultimate aim is to\ndevelop treatments that increase our ability to discriminate between the\npredictions of different quantization proposals for cosmological perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2016 17:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

The key goal of AL-DRAM is to exploit the extra margin\nthat is built into the DRAM timing parameters to reduce DRAM latency. The key\nobservation is that the timing parameters are dictated by the worst-case\ntemperatures and worst-case DRAM cells, both of which lead to small amount of\ncharge storage and hence high access latency. One can therefore reduce latency\nby adapting the timing parameters to the current operating temperature and the\ncurrent DIMM that is being accessed. Using an FPGA-based testing platform, our\nwork first characterizes the extra margin for 115 DRAM modules from three major\nmanufacturers. The experimental results demonstrate that it is possible to\nreduce four of the most critical timing parameters by a minimum/maximum of\n17.3%/54.8% at 55C while maintaining reliable operation. AL-DRAM adaptively\nselects between multiple different timing parameters for each DRAM module based\non its current operating condition. AL-DRAM does not require any changes to the\nDRAM chip or its interface; it only requires multiple different timing\nparameters to be specified and supported by the memory controller. Real system\nevaluations show that AL-DRAM improves the performance of memory-intensive\nworkloads by an average of 14% without introducing any errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2016 17:39:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-29"}

In the\ngeneric application of ED to derive the Schroedinger equation for N particles\nthe dynamics is a non-dissipative diffusion in which the system follows a\n\"Brownian\" trajectory with fluctuations superposed on a smooth drift. We show\nthat there is a family of ED models that differ at the \"microscopic\" or\nsub-quantum level in that one can enhance or suppress the fluctuations relative\nto the drift.

The\nprocess of collapse is described by the radial evolution in the dual\nholographic theory. If the theory is in the same phase as the assumed IR fixed\npoint, the initial state is smoothly projected to the final state. If in a\ndifferent phase, the initial state undergoes a phase transition which in turn\ngives rise to a horizon in the bulk geometry. We demonstrate the connection\nbetween critical behavior and horizon in an example, by deriving the bulk\nmetrics that emerge in various phases of the U(N) vector model in the large N\nlimit based on the holographic dual constructed from quantum RG. The gapped\nphase exhibits a geometry that smoothly ends at a finite proper distance in the\nradial direction. The geometric distance in the radial direction measures a\ncomplexity : the depth of RG transformation that is needed to project the\ngenerally entangled UV state to a direct product state in the IR. For gapless\nstates, entanglement persistently spreads out to larger length scales, and the\ninitial state can not be projected to the direct product state. The obstruction\nto smooth projection at charge neutral point manifests itself as the long\nthroat in the anti-de Sitter space. The Poincare horizon at infinity marks the\ncritical point which exhibits a divergent length scale in the spread of\nentanglement. For the gapless states with non-zero chemical potential, the bulk\nspace becomes the Lifshitz geometry with the dynamical critical exponent two.\nThe identification of horizon as critical point may provide an explanation for\nthe universality of horizon.

The results are relevant\nfor the dynamics of small, charged dust particles emitted by the volcanic moon\nIo, which form the Jovian dust streams.

This\nphenomenon, referred as space-charge effect, determines a broadening and shift\nin energy for the typical PES structures and a dramatic loss of energy\nresolution. In this article we examine the effects of space charge in PES with\na particular focus on time-resolved hard X-ray (~10 keV) experiments. The\ntrajectory of the electrons photoemitted from pure Cu in a hard X-ray PES\nexperiment has been reproduced through $N$-body simulations and the broadening\nof the photoemission core-level peaks has been monitored as a function of\nvarious parameters (photons per pulse, linear dimension of the photon spot,\nphoton energy). The energy broadening results directly proportional to the\nnumber $N$ of electrons emitted per pulse (mainly represented by secondary\nelectrons) and inversely proportional to the linear dimension $a$ of the photon\nspot on the sample surface, in agreement with the literature data about\nultraviolet and soft X-ray experiments. The evolution in time of the energy\nbroadening during the flight of the photoelectrons is also studied. Despite its\ndetrimental consequences on the energy spectra, we found that space charge has\nnegligible effects on the momentum distribution of photoelectrons and a\nmomentum broadening is not expected to affect angle-resolved experiments.\nStrategy to reduce the energy broadening and the feasibility of hard X-ray PES\nexperiments at the new free-electron laser facilities are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2016 22:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

Unfortunately, implementing this requires\ncontinuous evaluation of the gradient and the inverse Hessian of the objective\nfunction which is not amenable to digital implementation. Alternatively, we\ndraw inspiration from self-triggered control to propose a strategy that\nautonomously adapts the times at which it makes computations about the\nobjective function, yielding a piece-wise affine state update law. The\nalgorithm does so by predicting the temporal evolution of the gradient using\nknown upper bounds on higher order derivatives of the objective function. Our\nproposed method guarantees convergence to arbitrarily small neighborhood of the\noptimal trajectory in finite time and without incurring Zeno behavior. We\nillustrate our framework with numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2016 23:47:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

The approach is efficient as it attempts to model\nthe connection between appearance and geometric displacement through a linear\nrelationship that assumes independence across pixel coordinates.

Specifically, its performance\nis tightly coupled with how well the linear model can synthesize appearance\nfrom geometric displacement, even though the alignment task itself is\nassociated with the inverse problem. In this paper, we present a new approach,\nreferred to as the Conditional LK algorithm, which: (i) directly learns linear\nmodels that predict geometric displacement as a function of appearance, and\n(ii) employs a novel strategy for ensuring that the generative pixel\nindependence assumption can still be taken advantage of.

The\nelectric field due to the Hall voltage is taken into consideration. We find the\nground state where the electron configuration is uniquely determined so as to\nhave the minimum classical Coulomb energy. Residual Coulomb interaction HI\nyields quantum transitions which satisfy the momentum conservation along the\ncurrent direction. The number of Coulomb transitions from nearest electron\npairs is dependent sensitively upon the fractional number of the filling\nfactor. For example, the number u(2/3) of allowed transitions at nu=2/3\nabruptly decreases when the filling factor nu deviates slightly from 2/3. The\nlimiting value of the number is equal to half of u(2/3). The discontinuous\nbehavior produces the valley structure in the energy spectrum. This mechanism\nproduces the Hall plateaus at the specific filling factors nu=1/(2j+1), 2j\n/(2j+1), j/(2j+1), j/(2j-1) etc. and also at the non-standard filling factors\nnu=7/11, 4/11, 4/13, 5/13, 5/17, 6/17 etc. We have studied the pair energies of\nmore distant electron pairs in Chapter 5.

Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the\nfamous architecture LeNet-5, we successfully classified functional MRI data of\nAlzheimer's subjects from normal controls where the accuracy of test data on\ntrained data reached 96.85%. This experiment suggests us the shift and scale\ninvariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning classification is\nmost powerful method to distinguish clinical data from healthy data in fMRI.\nThis approach also enables us to expand our methodology to predict more\ncomplicated systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2016 04:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

The general conclusion from this\nstudy is that a properly organized VLBI programme for radio star observation\nwith a reasonable load on the VLBI network can allow for the realization of\nGCRF-ICRF link with an error of about 0.1 mas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2016 08:04:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 13:34:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

It is well known that the brain maps derived from weights of\nlinear classifiers are hard to interpret because of high correlations between\npredictors, low signal to noise ratios, and the high dimensionality of\nneuroimaging data. Therefore, improving the interpretability of brain decoding\napproaches is of primary interest in many neuroimaging studies. Despite\nextensive studies of this type, at present, there is no formal definition for\ninterpretability of multivariate brain maps. As a consequence, there is no\nquantitative measure for evaluating the interpretability of different brain\ndecoding methods. In this paper, first, we present a theoretical definition of\ninterpretability in brain decoding; we show that the interpretability of\nmultivariate brain maps can be decomposed into their reproducibility and\nrepresentativeness. Second, as an application of the proposed theoretical\ndefinition, we formalize a heuristic method for approximating the\ninterpretability of multivariate brain maps in a binary magnetoencephalography\n(MEG) decoding scenario. Third, we propose to combine the approximated\ninterpretability and the performance of the brain decoding model into a new\nmulti-objective criterion for model selection.

There is no molecular evidence for X-ray induced chemistry\nin the low-mass objects on the observed scales of a few 1000 AU. For high-mass\nregions, the FUV flux required to produce the observed molecular ratios is\nsmaller than the unattenuated flux expected from the central object(s) at the\nHerschel beam radius.

Known natural and artificial materials\nand surfaces provide a particular functionality in the frequency range they\noperate but cast a \"shadow\" and produce reflections at other frequencies. Here,\nwe introduce a concept of multifunctional engineered materials that possess\ndifferent predetermined functionalities at different frequencies. Such response\ncan be accomplished by cascading metasurfaces (thin composite layers) that are\ndesigned to perform a single operation at the desired frequency and are\ntransparent elsewhere. Previously, out-of-band transparent metasurfaces for\ncontrol over reflection and absorption were proposed. In this paper, to\ncomplete the full set of functionalities for wave control, we synthesize\ntransmitarrays that tailor transmission in a desired way, being \"invisible\"\nbeyond the operational band. The designed transmitarrays for wavefront shaping\nand anomalous refraction are tested numerically and experimentally. To\ndemonstrate our concept of multifunctional engineered materials, we have\ndesigned a cascade of three metasurfaces that performs three different\nfunctions for waves at different frequencies. Remarkably, applied to volumetric\nmetamaterials, our concept can enable a single composite possessing desired\nmultifunctional response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2016 11:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

In the SIDDHARTA experiment at the electron-positron\ncollider DAFNE of LNF-INFN we measured the most precise values of the strong\ninteraction observables, i.e. the strong interaction on the 1s ground state of\nthe electromagnetically bound kaonic hydrogen atom leading to a hadronic shift\nand a hadronic broadening of the 1s state.

Our simulation facilitates more straightforward interpretation of\nnumerical results than previous work by putting a certain number of perturbers\nin a well-motivated configuration. We detected a clear sign of non-linear\ninteraction between wakelets, which make global spiral arms by connecting two\nadjacent wakelets. We found that the wave number of the strongest non-linear\ninteraction depends on galactic disk mass and shear rate. This dependence is\nconsistent with the prediction of swing amplification mechanism and other\nprevious results. Our results provide unification of previous results which\nseemed not consistent with each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2016 13:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

One application of\nparticular interest is network applications that manipulate or reason about\ncomplex message structures, such as XML messages. This paper presents a\ndecision procedure for reasoning about algebraic data types using abstractions\nthat are provided by catamorphisms: fold functions that map instances of\nalgebraic data types to values in a decidable domain. We show that the\nprocedure is sound and complete for a class of catamorphisms that satisfy a\ngeneralized sufficient surjectivity condition. Our work extends a previous\ndecision procedure that unrolls catamorphism functions until a solution is\nfound.\n  We use the generalized sufficient surjectivity condition to address an\nincompleteness in the previous unrolling algorithm (and associated proof). We\nthen propose the categories of monotonic and associative catamorphisms, which\nwe argue provide a more intuitive inclusion test than the generalized\nsufficient surjectivity condition. We use these notions to address two open\nproblems from previous work: (1) we provide a bound, with respect to formula\nsize, on the number of unrollings necessary for completeness, showing that it\nis linear for monotonic catamorphisms and exponentially small for associative\ncatamorphisms, and (2) we demonstrate that associative catamorphisms can be\ncombined within a formula while preserving completeness. Our combination\nresults extend the set of problems that can be reasoned about using the\ncatamorphism-based approach.\n  We also describe an implementation of the approach, called RADA, which\naccepts formulas in an extended version of the SMT-LIB 2.0 syntax. The\nprocedure is quite general and is central to the reasoning infrastructure for\nGuardol, a domain-specific language for reasoning about network guards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2016 13:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

In holography, bulk theories with higher-derivative corrections\nincorporate coupling constant corrections to the boundary theory observables in\nan expansion around infinite coupling. In this work, we investigate the\ncoupling constant dependence and universality of anomalous conductivities (and\nthus of the anomalous Ward identities) in general, four-dimensional systems\nthat possess asymptotically anti-de Sitter holographic duals with a\nnon-extremal black brane in five dimensions, and anomalous transport introduced\ninto the boundary theory via the bulk Chern-Simons action.

Owing to the\nexistence of the membrane paradigm, the proof reduces to a construction of bulk\neffective theories at the horizon and the boundary.

Our idea is that, even when\narguments and attacks are defined by means of a logical belief base, there may\nbe some uncertainty about how accurate is the content of an argument, and so\nthe presence (or absence) of attacks concerning it. We use enthymemes to\nillustrate this notion of uncertainty of arguments and attacks. Indeed, as\nargued in the literature, real arguments are often enthymemes instead of\ncompletely specified deductive arguments. This means that some parts of the\npair (support, claim) may be missing because they are supposed to belong to\nsome \"common knowledge\", and then should be deduced by the agent which receives\nthe enthymeme. But the perception that agents have of the common knowledge may\nbe wrong, and then a first agent may state an enthymeme that her opponent is\nnot able to decode in an accurate way. It is likely that the decoding of the\nenthymeme by the agent leads to mistaken attacks between this new argument and\nthe existing ones. In this case, the agent can receive some information about\nattacks or arguments acceptance statuses which disagree with her argumentation\nframework. We exemplify a way to incorporate this new piece of information by\nmeans of existing works on the dynamics of abstract argumentation frameworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2016 14:29:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

The black hole binary SWIFT J1753.5-0127 is providing a unique data set\nto study accretion flows. Various investigations of this system and of other\nblack holes have not, however, led to an agreement on the accretion flow\ngeometry or on the seed photon source for Comptonization during different\nstages of X-ray outbursts. We place constraints on these accretion flow\nproperties by studying long-term spectral variations of this source. Methods.\nWe performed phenomenological and self-consistent broad band spectral modeling\nof Swift J1753.5-0127 using quasi-simultaneous archived data from\nINTEGRAL/ISGRI, Swift/UVOT/XRT/BAT, RXTE/PCA/HEXTE and MAXI/GSC instruments.\nResults. We identify a critical flux limit, F \\sim 1.5 \\times 10^{-8}\nerg/cm^2/s, and show that the spectral properties of SWIFT J1753.5-0127 are\nmarkedly different above and below this value. Above the limit, during the\noutburst peak, the hot medium seems to intercept roughly 50 percent of the disk\nemission. Below it, in the outburst tail, the contribution of the disk photons\nreduces significantly and the entire spectrum from the optical to X-rays can be\nproduced by a synchrotron-self-Compton mechanism. The long-term variations in\nthe hard X-ray spectra are caused by erratic changes of the electron\ntemperatures in the hot medium. Thermal Comptonization models indicate\nunreasonably low hot medium optical depths during the short incursions into the\nsoft state after 2010, suggesting that non-thermal electrons produce the\nComptonized tail in this state. The soft X-ray excess, likely produced by the\naccretion disk, shows peculiarly stable temperatures for over an order of\nmagnitude changes in flux. Conclusions. The long-term spectral trends of SWIFT\nJ1753.5-0127 are likely set by variations of the truncation radius and a\nformation of a hot, quasi-spherical inner flow in the vicinity of the black\nhole.

This mode or the more general diboson modes may also play an\nimportant role in probing for new physics beyond the SM.

Assuming the mass m_Q (or m_{tilde Q}) >> Lambda_h, a diphoton\nresonance could be interpreted as either a Q bar{Q} state eta_Q with J^{PC} =\n0^{-+} or a tilde{Q} tilde{Q}^dagger state eta_{tilde Q} with J^{PC}=0^{++}.\nFor the Q bar{Q} scenario, there will be a spin-triplet partner psi_Q which is\nslightly heavier than eta_Q due to the hyperfine interactions mediated by\nhypercolor gluon exchange; while for the tilde{Q} tilde{Q}^dagger scenario, the\nspin-triplet partner chi_{tilde Q} arises from higher radial excitation with\nnonzero orbital angular momentum. We consider productions and decays of eta_Q,\neta_{tilde Q}, psi_Q, and chi_{tilde Q} at the LHC using the NRQCD\nfactorization approach. We discuss how to test these scenarios by using the DY\nprocess and the forward dijet azimuthal angular distributions to determine the\nJ^{PC} quantum number of the diphoton resonance. Constraints on the parameter\nspace can be obtained by interpreting some of the small diphoton excesses\nreported by the LHC as the composite scalar or pseudoscalar of the model.\nAnother important test of the model is the presence of a nearby\nhypercolor-singlet but color-octet state like the eta^8_Q or eta^8_{tilde Q},\nwhich can also be constrained by dijet or monojet+monophoton data.

Even for simple models of the\ngeneral circulation, such as the dry dynamical core, the LRF cannot be\ncalculated from first principles due to the lack of a complete theory for\neddy-mean flow feedbacks. According to the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem\n(FDT), the LRF can be calculated using only the covariance and lag-covariance\nmatrices of the unforced system. However, efforts in calculating the LRFs for\nGCMs using FDT have produced mixed results, and the reason(s) behind the poor\nperformance of the FDT remains unclear. In Part 1 of this study, the LRF of an\nidealized GCM, the dry dynamical core with Held-Suarez physics, is accurately\ncalculated using Green's functions. In this paper (Part 2), the LRF of the same\nmodel is computed using FDT, which is found to perform poorly for some of the\ntest cases. The accurate LRF of Part 1 is used with a linear stochastic\nequation to show that dimension-reduction by projecting the data onto leading\nEOFs, which is commonly used for FDT, can alone be a significant source of\nerror. Simplified equations and examples of 2 x 2 matrices are then used to\ndemonstrate that this error arises because of the non-normality of the\noperator. These results suggest that errors caused by dimension-reduction are a\nmajor, if not the main, contributor to the poor performance of the LRF\ncalculated using FDT, and that further investigations of dimension-reduction\nstrategies with a focus on non-normality are needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2016 15:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

Our proposed M-estimator obtains optimal sample efficiency\nrates (in the class of moment-based estimators) and the same well-known rates\non prediction accuracy as other spectral estimators. It also makes it\nstraightforward to incorporate regularization into the sample moment\nconditions.
