Following the disappearance of an initial Ha filament\naligned along the polarity inversion line (PIL) of the AR, a new Ha filament\nformed in its place some 20 hours later, which remained stable for at least 1.5\ndays. The creation of the new Ha filament was driven by the ascent of\nhorizontal magnetic fields from the photosphere into the chromosphere at three\nseparate locations along the PIL. The magnetic fields at two of these locations\nwere situated directly underneath the initial Ha filament and formed orphan\npenumbrae already aligned along the Ha filament channel. The 700 G orphan\npenumbrae were stable and trapped in the photosphere until the disappearance of\nthe overlying initial Ha filament, after which they started to ascend into the\nchromosphere at 10pm5 m/s. Each ascent was associated with a simultaneous\nmagnetic flux reduction of up to 50% in the photosphere. The ascended orphan\npenumbrae formed dark 'seed' structures in Ha in parallel with the PIL, which\nelongated and merged to form an Ha filament. The filament channel featured\nhorizontal magnetic fields of on average 260 G at log(tau)=-2 suspended above\nthe nearly field-free lower photosphere. The fields took on an 'inverse'\nconfiguration at log(tau)=-2 suggesting a flux rope for the new Ha filament.\nThe orphan penumbral fields ascend into the chromosphere 9-24 hours before the\nHa filament is fully formed. The destruction of the initial Ha filament was\nlikely caused by the flux emergence at the third location along the PIL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2016 16:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

By separating\nthe real and imaginary components of the voltage phasors, the power flow\nequations can be formulated as a system of quadratic polynomials. Only the real\nsolutions to these polynomial equations are physically meaningful. This paper\nfocuses on the maximum number of real solutions to the power flow equations. An\nupper bound on the number of real power flow solutions commonly used in the\nliterature is the maximum number of complex solutions. There exist two- and\nthree-bus systems for which all complex solutions are real. It is an open\nquestion whether this is also the case for larger systems. This paper\ninvestigates four-bus systems using techniques from numerical algebraic\ngeometry and conjectures a negative answer to this question. In particular,\nthis paper studies lossless, four-bus systems composed of PV buses connected by\nlines with arbitrary susceptances. Computing the Galois group, which is\ndegenerate, enables conversion of the problem of counting the number of real\nsolutions to the power flow equations into counting the number of positive\nroots of a univariate sextic polynomial. From this analysis, it is conjectured\nthat the system has at most 16 real solutions, which is strictly less than the\nmaximum number of complex solutions, namely 20. We also provide explicit\nparameter values where this system has 16 real solutions so that the\nconjectured upper bound is achievable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2016 16:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-21"}

We assume that the relationship between the data -phenotype,\ngenetic markers and environmental covariates - can be modelled by a generalized\nlinear model (GLM). The inclusion of environmental covariates makes it possible\nto account for important confounding factors, such as sex and population\nsubstructure. A multivariate score statistic, which under the complete null\nhypothesis of no phenotype-genotype association asymptotically has a\nmultivariate normal distribution with a covariance matrix that can be estimated\nfrom the data, is used to test a large number of genetic markers for\nassociation with the phenotype. We stress the importance of controlling the\nfamilywise error rate (FWER), and use the asymptotic distribution of the\nmultivariate score test statistic to find a local significance level for the\nindividual test. Using real data (from one study on schizophrenia and bipolar\ndisorder and one on maximal oxygen uptake) and constructed correlated\nstructures, we show that our method is a powerful alternative to the popular\nBonferroni and Sidak methods.

These parameters critically depend on the internal balance of heating\nversus cooling, which is mostly determined by the presence of short-lived\nradionuclides (SLRs), such as aluminum-26 and iron-60, as well as the heat\nconductivity of the material. The heating by SLRs depends on their initial\nabundances, the formation time of the planetesimal and its size. It has been\nargued that the cooling history is determined by the porosity of the granular\nmaterial, which undergoes dramatic changes via compaction processes and tends\nto decrease with time. In this study we assess the influence of these\nparameters on the thermo-mechanical evolution of young planetesimals with both\n2D and 3D simulations.

The typical method used for such computations is the Hutchinson method\nwhich is a Monte Carlo (MC) averaging over matrix quadratures. To improve its\nconvergence, several variance reductions techniques have been proposed. In this\npaper, we study the effects of deflating the near null singular value space. We\nmake two main contributions.\n  First, we analyze the variance of the Hutchinson method as a function of the\ndeflated singular values and vectors. Although this provides good intuition in\ngeneral, by assuming additionally that the singular vectors are random unitary\nmatrices, we arrive at concise formulas for the deflated variance that include\nonly the variance and mean of the singular values. We make the remarkable\nobservation that deflation may increase variance for Hermitian matrices but not\nfor non-Hermitian ones. This is a rare, if not unique, property where\nnon-Hermitian matrices outperform Hermitian ones. The theory can be used as a\nmodel for predicting the benefits of deflation.\n  Second, we use deflation in the context of a large scale application of\n\"disconnected diagrams\" in Lattice QCD. On lattices, Hierarchical Probing (HP)\nhas previously provided an order of magnitude of variance reduction over MC by\nremoving \"error\" from neighboring nodes of increasing distance in the lattice.\nAlthough deflation used directly on MC yields a limited improvement of 30% in\nour problem, when combined with HP they reduce variance by a factor of over 60\ncompared to MC. For this, we pre-computated 1000 smallest singular values of an\nill-conditioned matrix of size 25 million.

The fraction of Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs;\nequivalent width (EW)=>20A) increases from ~10% at z~2 to ~40% at z~5-6, which\nis consistent with previous studies that employ higher Lyman alpha EW cut. This\nincrease in the LAE fraction could be, in part, due to a decrease in the dust\ncontent of galaxies as redshift increases. When we compare best-fit SED\nestimated stellar parameters for LAEs and non-LAEs, we find that E(B-V) is\nsmaller for LAEs at all redshifts and the difference in the median E(B-V)\nbetween LAEs and non-LAEs increases as redshift increases, from 0.05 at z~2 to\n0.1 at z~3.5 to 0.2 at z~5-6. For the luminosities probed here (~L*), we find\nthat star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses of galaxies, with and\nwithout Lyman alpha in emission, show small differences such that, LAEs have\nlower SFRs and stellar masses compared to non-LAEs. This result could be a\ndirect consequence of the sample selection. Our sample of LAEs are selected\nbased on their continuum magnitudes and they probe higher continuum\nluminosities compared to narrow-band/emission line selected LAEs. Based on our\nresults, it is important to note that all LAEs are not universally similar and\ntheir properties are strongly dependent on the sample selection, and/or\ncontinuum luminosities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2016 20:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

To make them more suitable for the description of\nsmall stellar systems hosted by galaxies, we introduce a 'tidal' truncation (by\nmeans of a procedure that guarantees full continuity of the distribution\nfunction). The new $f_T^{(\\nu)}$-models are shown to provide a better fit to\nthe observed photometric and spectroscopic profiles for a sample of 13 globular\nclusters studied earlier by means of non-truncated models; interestingly, the\nbest-fit models also perform better with respect to the radial-orbit\ninstability. Then we design a flexible but simple two-component family of\ntruncated models, to study the separate issues of mass segregation and of\nmultiple populations. We do not aim at a fully realistic description of\nglobular clusters, to compete with the description currently obtained by means\nof dedicated simulations. The goal here is to try to identify the simplest\nmodels, that is, those with the smallest number of free parameters, but still\nable to provide a reasonable description for clusters that are evidently beyond\nthe reach of one-component models: with this tool we aim at identifying the key\nfactors that characterize mass segregation or the presence of multiple\npopulations.

In this paper we introduce a new\napproach for approximating the expectation value of a local observable in\nground states of local Hamiltonians that are represented as PEPS\ntensor-networks. Instead of contracting the full tensor-network, we try to\nestimate the expectation value using only a local patch of the tensor-network\naround the observable. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that this is often easier\nto do when the system is frustrated. In such case, the spanning vectors of the\nlocal patch are subject to non-trivial constraints that can be utilized via a\nsemi-definite program to calculate rigorous lower- and upper-bounds on the\nexpectation value.

In this regard\nMo-M$_{2,3}$ edges represents an interesting alternative as they are situated\nclose to the O-K edges. They should allow thus the extraction of a wealth of\nchemical information from the same spectra. However the main difficulty to\novercome in order to work properly with these edges is the delayed maxima of\nthe Mo-M$_{4,5}$ edges which hinders the automated background subtraction with\nthe usual inverse power low function. In this study we propose another\nbackground subtraction method specifically designed to overcome this obstacle\nand we apply it to the study of MoO3 and MoO2.

Upon cooling below the transition\ntemperature, this compound exhibits a gap opening with an energy shift of\nquasiparticle peaks like a band gap insulator. The quasiparticle peaks are\nstrongly suppressed, however, with further decrease of temperature, and\neventually vanish at the lowest temperature, leaving a non-dispersive flat band\nlacking long-lived electrons. We thereby identify a remarkable crossover from\nSlater to Mott insulators with decreasing temperature. These observations\nexplain the puzzling absence of Weyl points in this material, despite its\nproximity to the zero temperature metal-insulator transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2016 13:44:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}
