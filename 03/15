It is of paramount\nimportance that the required resources, such as energy and bandwidth, do not\nscale with traffic. While the aggregate network traffic is growing at an\nunprecedented rate, users tend to request the same popular contents at\ndifferent time instants. Therefore, caching the most popular contents at the\nnetwork edge is a promising solution to reduce the traffic and the energy\nconsumption over the backhaul links. In this paper, two scenarios are\nconsidered, where caching is performed either at a small base station, or\ndirectly at the user terminals, which communicate using \\ac{D2D}\ncommunications. In both scenarios, joint design of the transmission and caching\npolicies is studied when the user demands are known in advance. This joint\ndesign offers two different caching gains, namely, the \\textit{pre-downloading}\nand \\textit{local caching gains}. It is shown that the finite cache capacity\nlimits the attainable gains, and creates an inherent tradeoff between the two\ntypes of gains. In this context, a continuous time optimization problem is\nformulated to determine the optimal transmission and caching policies that\nminimize a generic cost function, such as energy, bandwidth, or throughput. The\njointly optimal solution is obtained by demonstrating that caching files at a\nconstant rate is optimal, which allows to reformulate the problem as a\nfinite-dimensional convex program. The numerical results show that the proposed\njoint transmission and caching policy dramatically reduces the total cost,\nwhich is particularised to the total energy consumption at the \\ac{MBS}, as\nwell as to the total economical cost for the service provider, when users\ndemand economical incentives for delivering content to other users over the D2D\nlinks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 16:46:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Each possible edit operation is penalized by a\nnon-negative cost and the cost of a transformation is measured by summing the\ncosts of its operations. A solution to this problem consists in defining a\ntransformation having a minimal cost, among all possible transformations. To\ncompute such a solution, the classical approach consists in representing\nremoval and insertion operations by augmenting the two sets so that they get\nthe same size. This allows to express the problem as a linear sum assignment\nproblem (LSAP), which thus finds an optimal bijection (or permutation, perfect\nmatching) between the two augmented sets. While the LSAP is known to be\nefficiently solvable in polynomial time complexity, for instance with the\nHungarian algorithm, useless time and memory are spent to treat the elements\nwhich have been added to the initial sets. In this report, we show that the\nproblem can be formalized as an extension of the LSAP which considers only one\nadditional element in each set to represent removal and insertion operations. A\nsolution to the problem is no longer represented as a bijection between the two\naugmented sets. We show that the considered problem is a binary linear program\n(BLP) very close to the LSAP. While it can be solved by any BLP solver, we\npropose an adaptation of the Hungarian algorithm which improves the time and\nmemory complexities previously obtained by the approach based on the LSAP. The\nimportance of the improvement increases as the size of the two sets and their\nabsolute difference increase.

Several industrial applications take advantage of this fact, such as\nthose in plastic bag production, where the brushes act as slip agents; however,\nthe complex mechanisms that give rise to such reduction of friction are not yet\nfully understood. In this work we report coarse grained, dissipative particle\ndynamics simulations carried out for surfaces functionalized with erukamide\nbrushes, a polymer commonly used in the plastics industry as a slip agent\nbetween surfaces. We calculate their rheological properties, such as the\ncoefficient of friction (COF) and the viscosity, {\\eta}, as functions of the\nnumber of chains grafted on the surfaces under the influence of stationary,\nCouette flow. Moreover, we consider also the case when a fraction of the\nerukamide chains is not adsorbed and moves freely between the surfaces. We show\nthat the COF reaches an equilibrium value of about 0.29 in these two cases, in\nagreement with experimental results. On other hand, the viscosity grows\nmonotonically, as a result of the increasing collisions when the erukamide\ncontent is increased. The force between brushes is found to be in agreement\nwith predictions from scaling theories. We find that the addition to free\nchains helps stabilize the film formed by the brushes and the solvent, as\nothers have found experimentally. The mechanisms that give rise to these\nphenomena are studied in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 19:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-15"}

The Haumean family is the only one\ncurrently known in the transneptunian belt. Various models have been proposed\nbut the formation of the family remains poorly understood. In this work, we\nhave investigated the rotational properties of the family members and\nunconfirmed family candidates with short-term variability studies, and report\nthe most complete review to date. We present results based on five years of\nobservations and report the short-term variability of five family members, and\nseven candidates. The mean rotational periods, from Maxwellian fits to the\nfrequency distributions, are 6.27+/-1.19 h for the confirmed family members,\n6.44+/-1.16 h for the candidates, and 7.65+/-0.54 h for other TNOs (without\nrelation to the family).

These studies model the propagation of memes, i.e.,\npieces of information, between users in a social network similarly to the way\ndiseases spread in human society. Importantly, one would expect a meme to\nspread in a social network amongst the people who are interested in the topic\nof that meme. Yet, the importance of topicality for information diffusion has\nbeen less explored in the literature.\n  Here, we study empirical data about two different types of memes (hashtags\nand URLs) spreading through the Twitter's online social network. For every\nmeme, we infer its topics and for every user, we infer her topical interests.\nTo analyze the impact of such topics on the propagation of memes, we introduce\na novel theoretical framework of information diffusion. Our analysis identifies\ntwo distinct mechanisms, namely topical and non-topical, of information\ndiffusion. The non-topical information diffusion resembles disease spreading as\nin simple contagion. In contrast, the topical information diffusion happens\nbetween users who are topically aligned with the information and has\ncharacteristics of complex contagion. Non-topical memes spread broadly among\nall users and end up being relatively popular. Topical memes spread narrowly\namong users who have interests topically aligned with them and are diffused\nmore readily after multiple exposures. Our results show that the topicality of\nmemes and users' interests are essential for understanding and predicting\ninformation diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 19:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-15"}

This conclusion is reached from emerging\ndatasets on $z>2$ proto-clusters and the characteristics of their member\ngalaxies, in particular, rare starbursts and ultraluminous active galactic\nnuclei (AGN). The most challenging observational hurdle in identifying such\nstructures is their very large volumes, $\\sim10^{4}$ comoving Mpc$^3$ at $z>2$,\nsubtending areas $\\sim$half a degree on the sky. Thus the contrast afforded by\nan overabundance of very rare galaxies in comparison to the background can more\neasily distinguish overdense structures from the surrounding, normal density\nfield. Five $2<z<3$ proto-clusters from the literature are discussed in detail\nand are found to contain up to 12 dusty starbursts or luminous AGN galaxies\neach, a phenomenon that is unlikely to occur by chance even in overdense\nenvironments. Measurements of gas depletion times suggest that they are indeed\nshort-lived on $\\sim$100 Myr timescales, and the probability of finding a\nstructure containing more than 8 such systems is $\\sim$0.2\\%, unless their\n`triggering' is correlated on very large spatial scales, $\\sim$10 Mpc across.\nThe volume density of starburst-rich proto-clusters is found to be comparable\nto all $>10^{15} M_\\odot$ galaxy clusters in the nearby Universe, a factor of\nfive larger than expected in some simulations.

In these sites, users\ntypically choose their information sources, which in turn determine what\nspecific information they receive, how much information they receive and how\nquickly this information is shown to them. In this context, a natural question\nthat arises is how efficient are social media users at selecting their\ninformation sources.\n  In this work, we propose a computational framework to quantify users'\nefficiency at selecting information sources. Our framework is based on the\nassumption that the goal of users is to acquire a set of unique pieces of\ninformation. To quantify user's efficiency, we ask if the user could have\nacquired the same pieces of information from another set of sources more\nefficiently. We define three different notions of efficiency -- link, in-flow,\nand delay -- corresponding to the number of sources the user follows, the\namount of (redundant) information she acquires and the delay with which she\nreceives the information. Our definitions of efficiency are general and\napplicable to any social media system with an underlying information network,\nin which every user follows others to receive the information they produce.\n  In our experiments, we measure the efficiency of Twitter users at acquiring\ndifferent types of information. We find that Twitter users exhibit sub-optimal\nefficiency across the three notions of efficiency, although they tend to be\nmore efficient at acquiring non-popular than popular pieces of information. We\nthen show that this lack of efficiency is a consequence of the triadic closure\nmechanism by which users typically discover and follow other users in social\nmedia. Finally, we develop a heuristic algorithm that enables users to be\nsignificantly more efficient at acquiring the same unique pieces of\ninformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 20:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

Associated with higher-spin systems in spacetime\ndimension 4 is a Chern-Simons action for a superconnection taking its values in\na direct product of an infinite-dimensional algebra of oscillators and a\nFrobenius algebra. A crucial ingredient of the model is that it elevates the\nrigid closed and central two-form of Vasiliev's theory to a dynamical 2-form\nand doubles the higher-spin algebra, thereby considerably reducing the number\nof possible higher spin invariants and giving a nonzero effective functional\non-shell. The two action principles we give for higher-spin systems in 3D are\nbased on Chern-Simons and BF models. In the first case, the theory we give\nunifies higher-spin gauge fields with fractional-spin fields and an internal\nsector. In particular, Newton's constant is related to the coupling constant of\nthe internal sector. In the second case, the BF action we review gives the\nfully nonlinear Prokushkin-Vasiliev, bosonic equations for matter-coupled\nhigher spins in 3D.

Here, we report the exfoliation of the magnetic semiconductor\n$\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ into the first halide monolayers and the magnetic\ncharacterization of the spin $\\frac{1}{2}$ honeycomb arrangement of\nturbostratically stacked RuCl$_3$ monolayers. The exfoliation is based on a\nreductive lithiation/hydration approach, which gives rise to a loss of\ncooperative magnetism due to the disruption of the spin $\\frac{1}{2}$ state by\nelectron injection into the layers. After an oxidative treatment, cooperative\nmagnetism similar to the bulk is restored. The oxidized pellets of restacked\nsingle layers feature a magnetic transition at T$_N$ = 7 K in the in-plane\ndirection, while the magnetic properties in the out-of-plane direction vastly\ndiffer from bulk $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. The macroscopic pellets of RuCl$_3$\ntherefore behave like a stack of monolayers without any symmetry relation in\nthe stacking direction. The deliberate introduction of turbostratic disorder to\nmanipulate the spin structure of RuCl$_3$ is of interest for research in\nfrustrated magnetism and complex magnetic order as predicted by the\nKitaev-Heisenberg model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 20:42:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 17:21:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-18"}

The apparently large production cross section is\nnevertheless very difficult to explain in minimal models. We consider the\npossibility that the resonance is a pseudoscalar boson $A$ with a two--photon\ndecay mediated by a charged and uncolored fermion having a mass at the $\\frac12\nM_A$ threshold and a very small decay width, $\\ll 1$ MeV; one can then generate\na large enhancement of the $A\\gamma\\gamma$ amplitude which explains the excess\nwithout invoking a large multiplicity of particles propagating in the loop,\nlarge electric charges and/or very strong Yukawa couplings. The implications of\nsuch a threshold enhancement are discussed in two explicit scenarios: i) the\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model in which the $A$ state is produced via\nthe top quark mediated gluon fusion process and decays into photons\npredominantly through loops of charginos with masses close to $\\frac12 M_A$ and\nii) a two Higgs doublet model in which $A$ is again produced by gluon fusion\nbut decays into photons through loops of vector--like charged heavy leptons.

In all these scenarios, while the mass of the charged fermion\nhas to be adjusted to be extremely close to half of the $A$ resonance mass, the\nsmall total widths are naturally obtained if only suppressed three-body decay\nchannels occur.

Yet the sequential voting\nmechanisms that are commonly used by these systems are at odds with existing\ntheoretical and empirical literature on optimal aggregation. This literature\nsuggests that sequential voting will promote herding---the tendency for\nindividuals to copy the decisions of others around them---and hence lead to\nsuboptimal content recommendation. Is there a problem with our practice, or a\nproblem with our theory? Previous attempts at answering this question have been\nlimited by a lack of objective measurements of content quality.

Our perspective is that binary spacetimes are\nnatural exemplars of chaotic scattering, because they admit more than one\nfundamental null orbit, and thus an uncountably-infinite set of perpetual null\norbits which generate scattering singularities in initial data. Inspired by the\nthree-disc model, we develop an appropriate symbolic dynamics to describe\nplanar null geodesics on the double black hole spacetime. We show that a\none-dimensional (1D) black hole shadow may constructed through an iterative\nprocedure akin to the construction of the Cantor set; thus the 1D shadow is\nself-similar. Next, we study non-planar rays, to understand how angular\nmomentum affects the existence and properties of the fundamental null orbits.\nTaking slices through 2D shadows, we observe three types of 1D shadow: regular,\nCantor-like, and highly chaotic. The switch from Cantor-like to regular occurs\nwhere outer fundamental orbits are forbidden by angular momentum. The highly\nchaotic part is associated with an unexpected feature: stable and bounded null\norbits, which exist around two black holes of equal mass $M$ separated by $a_1\n< a < \\sqrt{2} a_1$, where $a_1 = 4M/\\sqrt{27}$. To show how this possibility\narises, we define a certain potential function and classify its stationary\npoints. We conjecture that the highly chaotic parts of the 2D shadow possess\nthe Wada property. Finally, we consider the possibility of following null\ngeodesics through event horizons, and chaos in the maximally-extended\nspacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 21:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 14:19:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 15:17:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-09"}

These graphs are used for recommendation systems and\ndiscovering most reliable (trusted) products.

In particular, the evolutions of the energy\nspectrum and velocity distribution of FEBs due to the interaction with the\nambient plasma and field when propagating can significantly influence the\nefficiency and property of their emissions. In this paper, we discuss some\npossible evolutions of the energy spectrum and velocity distribution of FEBs\ndue to the energy loss processes and the pitch-angle effect caused by the\nmagnetic field inhomogeneity, and analyze the effects of these evolutions on\nelectron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission, which is one of the most important\nmechanisms of producing solar radio bursts by FEBs.

Consistent and accurate\npropagation of uncertainties is important to ensuring good estimation\nperformance. It is well known that the posterior state estimates in nonlinear\nproblems may assume non-Gaussian multimodal densities. In the past, Gaussian\nmixture filters and particle filters were introduced to handle non-Gaussianity\nand nonlinearity. However, these methods have seen only limited success as most\nmixture filters attempt to fix the number of mixture modes during estimation\nprocess, and the particle filters suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In\nthis paper, we propose a particle based Gaussian mixture filtering approach for\nthe general nonlinear estimation problem that is free of the particle depletion\nproblem inherent to most particle filters.

Intuitively, a user tends to trust different subsets\nof her social friends, regarding with different scenarios. Therefore, the main\nchallenge of social recommendation is to exploit the optimal social dependency\nbetween users for a specific recommendation task. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel recommendation method, named probabilistic relational matrix\nfactorization (PRMF), which aims to learn the optimal social dependency between\nusers to improve the recommendation accuracy, with or without users' social\nrelationships. Specifically, in PRMF, the latent features of users are assumed\nto follow a matrix variate normal (MVN) distribution. The positive and negative\ndependency between users are modeled by the row precision matrix of the MVN\ndistribution. Moreover, we have also proposed an efficient alternating\nalgorithm to solve the optimization problem of PRMF. The experimental results\non real datasets demonstrate that the proposed PRMF method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art social recommendation approaches, in terms of root mean square\nerror (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 01:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

The program was designed with the goal of\ndetecting gas within the gravitational sphere of influence of the central black\nholes. In NGC 1332, the 0.3\"-resolution ALMA data reveal CO emission from the\nhighly inclined (i~ 83 degrees) circumnuclear disk, spatially coincident with\nthe dust disk seen in Hubble Space Telescope images. The disk exhibits a\ncentral upturn in maximum line-of-sight velocity reaching +-500 km/s relative\nto the systemic velocity, consistent with the expected signature of rapid\nrotation around a supermassive black hole. Rotational broadening and beam\nsmearing produce complex and asymmetric line profiles near the disk center. We\nconstructed dynamical models for the rotating disk and fitted the modeled CO\nline profiles directly to the ALMA data cube. Degeneracy between rotation and\nturbulent velocity dispersion in the inner disk precludes the derivation of\nstrong constraints on the black hole mass, but model fits allowing for a\nplausible range in the magnitude of the turbulent dispersion imply a central\nmass in the range ~(4-8)x10^8 Msun. We argue that gas-kinematic observations\nresolving the black hole's projected radius of influence along the disk's minor\naxis will have the capability to yield black hole mass measurements that are\nlargely insensitive to systematic uncertainties in turbulence or in the stellar\nmass profile.

Naively one might expect this process to continue down to\nthe smallest mass that is able to radiate away its binding energy on a\ndynamical timescale, the opacity limit for fragmentation, at $\\sim 0.01$\n$M_\\odot$. However, the observed peak of the initial mass function (IMF) lies a\nfactor of $20-30$ higher in mass, suggesting that some other mechanism halts\nfragmentation before the opacity limit is reached. In this paper we analyse\nradiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star cluster formation in typical\nMilky Way environments in order to determine what physical process limits\nfragmentation in them. We examine the regions in the vicinity of stars that\nform in the simulations to determine the amounts of mass that are prevented\nfrom fragmenting by thermal and magnetic pressure.

There is an urgent need of program analysis and\nrepair techniques capable of handling both the scale and variations in student\nsubmissions, while ensuring quality of feedback.\n  Towards this goal, we present a novel methodology called semi-supervised\nverified feedback generation. We cluster submissions by solution strategy and\nask the instructor to identify or add a correct submission in each cluster. We\nthen verify every submission in a cluster against the instructor-validated\nsubmission in the same cluster. If faults are detected in the submission then\nfeedback suggesting fixes to them is generated.

While many\nextra-solar planets and planetary candidates have been found in close orbits\naround stars by the radial velocity and the transit method, direct detections\nat wider orbits are rare. The Ursa Major (UMa) group, a young stellar\nassociation at an age of about 200-600 Myr and an average distance of 25 pc,\nhas not yet been addressed as a whole although its members represent a very\ninteresting sample to search for and characterize sub-stellar companions by\ndirect imaging. Our goal was to find or to provide detection limits on wide\nsub-stellar companions around nearby UMa group members using high-resolution\nimaging. We searched for faint companions around 20 UMa group members within 30\npc. The primaries were placed below a semi-transparent coronagraph, a rather\nrarely used mode of NACO, to increase the dynamic range of the images. In most\ncases, second epoch images of companion candidates were taken to check whether\nthey share common proper motion with the primary. Our coronagraphic images rule\nout sub-stellar companions around the stars of the sample.

It is already known that in a differentially rotating system, the\nuniform toroidal magnetic field is unstable due to a magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI) under a non-axisymmetric and vertical perturbation, while it\nis stable under a purely vertical perturbation. Contrary to the previous study,\nthis paper proposes an unstable mode completely confined to the equatorial\nplane, driven by the expansive nature of the magnetic pressure gradient force\nunder a non-uniform toroidal field. The basic nature of this growing eigenmode,\nto which we give a name \"magneto-gradient driven instability\", is studied using\nlinear analysis, and the corresponding nonlinear evolution is then investigated\nusing two-dimensional ideal MHD simulations. Although a single localized\nmagnetic field channel alone cannot provide sufficient Maxwell stress to\ncontribute significantly to the angular momentum transport, we find that the\nmode coupling between neighboring toroidal fields under multiple localized\nmagnetic field channels drastically generates a highly turbulent state and\nleads to the enhanced transport of angular momentum, comparable to the\nefficiency seen in previous studies on MRIs. This horizontally confined mode\nmay play an important role in the saturation of an MRI through complementray\ngrowth with the toroidal MHDs and coupling with magnetic reconnection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 11:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

Purpose: We\ninvestigate the description of the different decay stages in both the optimum\norientation and the orientation-averaged pictures of the cluster decay process.\nMethod: We consider the decays of 232,233,234U and 236,238Pu isotopes. The\nquantum mechanical knocking frequency and penetration probability based on the\nWentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation are used to find the decay width.\nResults: We found that the orientation-averaged decay width is one or two\norders of magnitude less than its value along the non-compact optimum\norientation. The difference between the two values increases with decreasing\nthe mass number of the emitted cluster. Correspondingly, the extracted\npreformation probability based on the averaged decay width increases with the\nsame orders of magnitude compared to its value obtained considering the optimum\norientation.

We describe a new\nextension of the weak lensing formalism capable of describing strongly lensed\nimages. By integrating the non-linear geodesic deviation equation, the\namplification matrix of weak lensing is generalised to a sum over independent\namplification tensors of increasing rank. We show how an image distorted by a\ngeneric lens may be constructed as a sum over `roulettes', which are the\nnatural curves associated with the independent spin modes of the amplification\ntensors. Highly distorted images can be constructed even for large sources\nobserved near or within the Einstein radius of a lens where the shear and\nconvergence are large. The amplitude of each roulette is formed from a sum over\nappropriate derivatives of the lensing potential. Consequently, measuring these\nindividual roulettes for images around a lens gives a new way to reconstruct a\nstrong lens mass distribution without requiring a lens model.

Using direct numerical simulations we show that the turbulent\nfluctuations of the supersaturation field offer different conditions for the\ngrowth of droplets which evolve in time due to turbulent transport and mixing.\nBased on that, we propose a Lagrangian stochastic model for condensation and\nevaporation of small droplets in turbulent flows.

The\nmodel has two parameters fixed by the total amount of water and the\nthermodynamic properties, as well as the Lagrangian integral timescale of the\nturbulent supersaturation. The model reproduces very well the droplet size\ndistributions obtained from direct numerical simulations and their time\nevolution. A noticeable result is that, after a stage where the squared radius\nsimply diffuses, the system converges exponentially fast to a statistical\nsteady state independent of the initial conditions. The main mechanism involved\nin this convergence is a loss of memory induced by a significant number of\ndroplets undergoing a complete evaporation before growing again.

In animal studies acoustic trauma can lead to behavioral signs of\nST, in human studies ST patients without increased hearing thresholds were\nfound to suffer from so called hidden HL. Additionally, ST is correlated with\npathologically increased spontaneous firing rates and neuronal hyperactivity\n(NH) along the auditory pathway. Homeostatic plasticity (HP) has been proposed\nas a compensation mechanism leading to the development of NH, arguing that\nafter HL initially decreased mean firing rates of neurons are subsequently\nrestored by increased spontaneous rates. However all HP models fundamentally\nlack explanatory power since the function of keeping mean firing rate constant\nremains elusive as does the benefit this might have in terms of information\nprocessing. Furthermore the neural circuitry being able to perform the\ncomparison of preferred with actual mean firing rate remains unclear. Here we\npropose an entirely new interpretation of ST related development of NH in terms\nof information theory. We suggest that stochastic resonance (SR) plays a key\nrole in short- and long-term plasticity within the auditory system and is the\nultimate cause of NH and ST. SR has been found ubiquitous in neuroscience and\nrefers to the phenomenon that sub-threshold, unperceivable signals can be\ntransmitted by adding noise to sensor input. We argue that after HL, SR serves\nto lift signals above the increased hearing threshold, hence subsequently\ndecreasing thresholds again. The increased amount of internal noise is the\ncorrelate of the NH, which finally leads to the development of ST, due to\nneuronal plasticity along the auditory pathway. We demonstrate the plausibility\nof our hypothesis by using a computational model and provide exemplarily\nfindings of human and animal studies that are consistent with our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 15:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

The FSN method is essentially an\nextension of the well known Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method for finding\napproximate analytical solutions for ordinary differential equations. The FSN\nmethod we use is applicable well beyond perturbation theory to solve systems of\nordinary differential equations, linear in the derivatives, that also depend on\na small parameter, which here we take to be related to the inverse wave-number.\n  We use the FSN method to find new approximate oscillating solutions in linear\norder cosmological perturbation theory for a flat radiation-matter universe.\nTogether with this model's well known growing and decaying M\\'esz\\'aros\nsolutions, these oscillating modes provide a complete set of sub-horizon\napproximations for the metric potential, radiation and matter perturbations.\nComparison with numerical solutions of the perturbation equations shows that\nour approximations can be made accurate to within a typical error of 1%, or\nbetter.
