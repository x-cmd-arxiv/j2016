The estimator is a product of\nPoisson estimators, allowing us to update a single block of subsample\nindicators in each MCMC iteration so that a desired correlation is achieved\nbetween the logs of successive likelihood estimates. This is important since\npseudo-marginal MCMC with positively correlated likelihood estimates can use\nsubstantially smaller subsamples without adversely affecting the sampling\nefficiency. The block-Poisson estimator is unbiased but not necessarily\npositive, so the algorithm runs the MCMC on the absolute value of the\nlikelihood estimator and uses an importance sampling correction to obtain\nconsistent estimates of the posterior mean of any function of the parameters.\nOur article derives guidelines to select the optimal tuning parameters for our\nmethod and shows that it compares very favourably to regular MCMC without\nsubsampling, and to two other recently proposed exact subsampling approaches in\nthe literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2016 16:25:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2016 02:38:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 03:57:16 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 07:05:31 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2018 07:06:36 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 03:42:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}

We show that\nthe computational complexity of CI is O(N log N) when removing nodes\none-by-one, with N the number of nodes. This is made possible by using an\nappropriate data structure to process the CI values, and by the finite radius l\nof the CI sphere. Furthermore, we introduce a simple extension of CI when l is\ninfinite, the CI propagation (CI_P) algorithm, that considers the global\noptimization of influence via message passing in the whole network and\nidentifies a slightly smaller fraction of influencers than CI. Remarkably, CI_P\nis able to reproduce the exact analytical optimal percolation threshold\nobtained by Bau, Wormald, Random Struct.

However, this small augmented performance of the\norder of 1-2 % in the low influencers tail comes at the expense of increasing\nthe computational complexity from O(N log N) to O(N^2 log N), rendering both,\nCI_P and CI_BP, prohibitive for finding influencers in modern-day big-data.

This plasma atmosphere, formed and maintained by the ISM-accreted matter\ndue to the so-called strangeness barrier, is supposed to be of two-temperature.\nAll the seven XDINS spectra could be well fitted by the radiative model, from\noptical/UV to X-ray bands. The fitted radiation radii of XDINSs are from 7 to\n13km, while the modelled electron temperatures are between 50 and 250eV, except\nRX J0806.4-4123 with a radiation radius ~3.5km, indicating that this source\ncould be a low-mass strangeon star candidate. This strangeon star model could\nfurther be tested by soft X-ray polarimetry, such as the Lightweight Asymmetry\nand Magnetism Probe which is expected to work on Chinese space station around\n2020.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2016 03:27:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2017 05:33:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 23:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

The lasso-penalized mixture of\nlinear regressions model (L-MLR) is a class of regularization methods for the\nmodel selection problem in the fixed number of variables setting. In this\narticle, we propose a new algorithm for the maximum penalized-likelihood\nestimation of the L-MLR model. This algorithm is constructed via the\nminorization--maximization algorithm paradigm. Such a construction allows for\ncoordinate-wise updates of the parameter components, and produces globally\nconvergent sequences of estimates that generate monotonic sequences of\npenalized log-likelihood values. These three features are missing in the\npreviously presented approximate expectation-maximization algorithms.

In our algorithm, we solve this issue by\nshowing that it can be converted into a polynomial root finding problem.

Both of these ideas are of course multi-faceted, and we confine\nourselves to making two points. Both points are about dualities in string\ntheory, and both have the 'flavour' that two dual theories are 'closer in\ncontent' than you might think. For both points, we adopt a simple conception of\na duality as an 'isomorphism' between theories: more precisely, as appropriate\nbijections between the two theories' sets of states and sets of quantities.\n  The first point (Section 3) is that this conception of duality meshes with\ntwo dual theories being 'gauge related' in the general philosophical sense of\nbeing physically equivalent. For a string duality, such as T-duality and\ngauge/gravity duality, this means taking such features as the radius of a\ncompact dimension, and the dimensionality of spacetime, to be 'gauge'.\n  The second point (Sections 4, 5 and 6) is much more specific. We give a\nresult about gauge/gravity duality that shows its relation to gauge symmetries\n(in the physical sense of symmetry transformations that are\nspacetime-dependent) to be subtler than you might expect. For gauge theories,\nyou might expect that the duality bijections relate only gauge-invariant\nquantities and states, in the sense that gauge symmetries in one theory will be\nunrelated to any symmetries in the other theory. This may be so in general; and\nindeed, it is suggested by discussions of Polchinski and Horowitz. But we show\nthat in gauge/gravity duality, each of a certain class of gauge symmetries in\nthe gravity/bulk theory, viz. diffeomorphisms, is related by the duality to a\nposition-dependent symmetry of the gauge/boundary theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2016 08:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-29"}

We generalised the theoretical\nmodel of standing slow magnetoacoustic oscillations in a hot plasma, including\nthe effects of the radiative losses, and accounting for plasma heating. The\nheating mechanism is not specified and taken empirically to compensate the\ncooling by radiation and thermal-conduction.

Numerical\nsolution of an initial value problem for the evolutionary equation demonstrates\nthat different dependences of the radiative cooling and plasma heating on the\ntemperature lead to different regimes of the oscillations, including growing,\nquasi-stationary and rapidly decaying. Our findings provide a theoretical\nfoundation for probing the coronal heating function, and may explain the\nobservations of decayless long-period quasi-periodic pulsations in flares.

Firstly, we provide a principled mathematical definition of \"label\nspaces matching (LS-DM)\" based on information divergence, which is also\nreferred to as LS-M criterion.

It\nmakes use of the phase differences in Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spectra\nacross antenna pairs. For strong, localized terrestrial sources these are\nstable over time, while being approximately uniform-random for a sum over many\nsources or for noise. Using only milliseconds-long datasets, the method finds\nthe strongest interfering transmitters, a first-order solution for relative\ntiming calibrations, and faulty data channels. No knowledge of gain response or\nquiescent noise levels of the receivers is required. With relatively small data\nvolumes, this approach is suitable for use in an online system monitoring setup\nfor interferometric arrays.\n  We have applied the method to our cosmic-ray data collection, a collection of\nmeasurements of short pulses from extensive air showers, recorded by the LOFAR\nradio telescope. Per air shower, we have collected 2 ms of raw time series data\nfor each receiver. The spectral cleaning has a calculated optimal sensitivity\ncorresponding to a power signal-to-noise ratio of 0.08 (or -11 dB) in a\nspectral window of 25 kHz, for 2 ms of data in 48 antennas.

This is particularly critical in commercial off-the-shelf\ndevices, which require simple yet efficient solutions. First, we analyze the\noperation of such a commercial device to understand the impact of link blockage\nin practice. To this end, we measure TCP throughput for different traffic loads\nwhile blocking the link at regular intervals. Second, we derive a Markov model\nbased on our practical insights to compute throughput for the case of transient\nblockage. We use this model to evaluate the trade-off between throughput and\nperiodic beam sweeping. Finally, we validate our results using throughput\ntraces collected using the aforementioned commercial device.

The 610 MHz total intensity and 325-610\nMHz spectral index images of NGC4235 tentatively suggest the presence of a\n\"relic\" radio lobe, most likely from a previous episode of AGN activity. This\nmakes NGC4235 only the second known Seyfert galaxy after Mrk6 to show\nsignatures of episodic activity. Spitzer and Herschel infrared spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) modelling using the clumpyDREAM code predicts star formation\nrates (SFR) that are an order of magnitude lower than those required to power\nthe radio lobes in these Seyferts (~0.13-0.23 M_sun/yr compared to the required\nSFR of ~2.0-2.7 M_sun/yr in NGC4594 and NGC4235, respectively). This finding\nalong with the detection of parsec and sub-kpc radio jets in both Seyfert\ngalaxies, that are roughly along the same position angles as the radio lobes,\nstrongly support the suggestion that Seyfert lobes are AGN-powered. SED\nmodelling supports the \"true\" type 2 classification of NGC4594: this galaxy\nlacks significant dust obscuration as well as a prominent broad-line region.\nBetween the two Seyfert galaxies, there is an inverse relation between their\nradio-loudness and Eddington ratio and a direct relation between their\nEddington-scaled jet power and bolometric power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2016 11:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}
