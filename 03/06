Possible\nobservational detections have even been made for galaxy clusters.\nTheoretically, Adhikari et al. have estimated the location of the splashback\nradius by computing the secondary infall trajectory of a dark matter shell\nthrough a growing dark matter halo with an NFW profile. However, since they\nimposed a shape of the halo profile rather than computing it consistently from\nthe trajectories of the dark matter shells, they could not provide the full\nshape of the dark matter profile around the splashback radius.

Here we apply probabilistic\nnumerical simulation approaches to produce PDC hazard maps, based on a\ncomprehensive spectrum of flow properties and vent locations. These maps and\nprovide all probable Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) scenarios from different\nsource vents in the caldera, relevant for risk management planning. For each\nVEI scenario, we report the conditional probability for PDCs (i.e., the\nprobability for a given area to be affected by the passage of PDCs) and related\ndynamic pressure. Model results indicate that PDCs from VEI<4 events would be\nconfined within the Campi Flegrei caldera, PDC propagation being impeded by the\nnorthern and eastern caldera walls. Conversely, PDCs from VEI 4-5 events could\ninvade a wide area beyond the northern caldera rim, as well as part of the\nNaples metropolitan area to the east. A major controlling factor of PDC\ndispersal is represented by the location of the vent area. PDCs from the\npotentially largest eruption scenarios (analogous to the ~15 ka, VEI 6\nNeapolitan Yellow Tuff or even the ~39 ka, VEI 7 Campanian Ignimbrite extreme\nevent) would affect a large part of the Campanian Plain to the north and the\ncity of Naples to the east. Thus, in case of renewal of eruptive activity at\nCampi Flegrei, up to 3 million people will be potentially exposed to volcanic\nhazard, pointing out the urgency of an emergency plan.

To combine both of amplitude\nand phase variations, we propose a variant of principal component analysis\n(PCA) that captures non-linear components representing the amplitude, phase and\ntheir associations simultaneously. The proposed method, which we call\nfunctional combined PCA, is aimed to provide more efficient dimension reduction\nwith interpretable components, in particular when the amplitudes and phases are\nclearly associated.

Based on analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories\nfor ten proteins with different sizes and folds, we found that nonlinear\nbackbone torsional pair (BTP) correlations, which are spatially more\nlong-ranged and are mainly executed by loop residues, exist extensively in most\nanalyzed proteins. Examination of torsional motion for correlated BTPs\nsuggested that aharmonic torsional state transitions are essential for such\nnon-linear correlations, which correspondingly occur on widely different and\nrelatively longer time scales. In contrast, BTP correlations between backbone\ntorsions in stable $\\alpha$ helices and $\\beta$ strands are mainly linear and\nspatially more short-ranged, and are more likely to associate with intra-well\ntorsional dynamics. Further analysis revealed that the direct cause of\nnon-linear contributions are heterogeneous, and in extreme cases canceling,\nlinear correlations associated with different torsional states of participating\ntorsions. Therefore, torsional state transitions of participating torsions for\na correlated BTP are only necessary but not sufficient condition for\nsignificant non-linear contributions. These findings implicate a general search\nstrategy for novel allosteric modulation of protein activities. Meanwhile, it\nwas suggested that ensemble averaged correlation calculation and static contact\nnetwork analysis, while insightful, are not sufficient to elucidate mechanisms\nunderlying allosteric signal transmission in general, dynamical and time scale\nresolved analysis are essential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Mar 2016 05:41:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2016 02:55:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-23"}

Motivated by these\nconsiderations, researchers have introduced and investigated the framework of\npreferred repairs, in the context of denial constraints and subset repairs.\nThere, a priority relation between facts is lifted towards a priority relation\nbetween consistent databases, and repairs are restricted to the ones that are\noptimal in the lifted sense. Three notions of lifting (and optimal repairs)\nhave been proposed: Pareto, global, and completion.\n  In this paper we investigate the complexity of deciding whether the priority\nrelation suffices to clean the database unambiguously, or in other words,\nwhether there is exactly one optimal repair. We show that the different lifting\nsemantics entail highly different complexities. Under Pareto optimality, the\nproblem is coNP-complete, in data complexity, for every set of functional\ndependencies (FDs), except for the tractable case of (equivalence to) one FD\nper relation.

In\ncontrast, under completion optimality the problem is solvable in polynomial\ntime for every set of FDs. In fact, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for\narbitrary conflict hypergraphs.

We find an unusually strong dependence of\nthe structural energetics on the choice of exchange-correlation functional,\nwith the usual local density approximation (LDA) yielding the wrong\nground-state structure, and generalized gradient (GGA) extensions being in\nbetter agreement with the bulk experimental structure. Using the GGA we show\nthe existence of a metastable face-centered-cubic (fcc)-like AFM structure that\nis reached from the ground state body-centered-cubic (bcc) AFM structure by\nfollowing the epitaxial Bain path. We predict that this metastable fcc-like\nstructure has a significantly higher conductivity than the bcc AFM phase. We\nshow that the behavior is well described using non-linear elasticity theory,\nwhich captures the softening and eventual sign change of the orthorhombic shear\nmodulus under compressive strain, consistent with this structural instability.\nFinally, we predict the existence of an additional unit-cell-doubling lattice\ninstability, which should be observable at low temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Mar 2016 13:31:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

We extend this analysis to large massive bound systems where the\nNewtonian approximation is not appropriate and we compare the derived\ndissociation time with the corresponding time in the context of the Newtonian\napproximation. By identifying the time when the effective potential minimum\ndisappears due to the repulsive force of dark energy we find that the\ndissociation time of bound systems occurs earlier than the prediction of the\nNewtonian approximation. However, the effect is negligible for all existing\ncosmological bound systems and it would become important only in hypothetical\nbound extremely massive ($10^{20} M_\\odot$) and large ($100Mpc$) bound systems.\nWe verify this result by explicit solution of the geodesic equations.

It has one parameter less than\nthe Crystal Ball function and, where appropriate, offers more stable fits to\npeaks that continue into exponential tails. The function may also be extended\nwith two exponential tails on each side of the Gaussian, and this has two\nparameters less than the corresponding double-shouldered Crystal Ball function.\nThis function has been used to model background and signal processes in a\nrecent Higgs pair production search and may be of versatile use in experimental\nphysics and other fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Mar 2016 07:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

VaR may be interpreted as a quantile of future portfolio values\nconditional on the information available, where the most common quantile used\nis 95%. Here we demonstrate Conditional Autoregressive Value at Risk, first\nintroduced by Engle, Manganelli (2001). CAViaR suggests that negative/positive\nreturns are not i.i.d., and that there is significant autocorrelation. The\nmodel is tested using data from 1986- 1999 and 1999-2009 for GM, IBM, XOM, SPX,\nand then validated via the dynamic quantile test. Results suggest that the\ntails (upper/lower quantile) of a distribution of returns behave differently\nthan the core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2016 22:33:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-18"}

However, it is worth investigating the\neffects of refinancing after taking the underlying costs into consideration.\nHere we develop a synthetic mortgage calculator that sufficiently accounts for\nsuch costs and the implications on new monthly payments. To confirm the\naccuracy of the calculator, we simulate the effects of refinancing over 15 and\n30 year periods. We then model the effects of refinancing as risk to the issuer\nof the mortgage, as there is negative duration associated with shifts in the\ninterest rate. Furthermore, we investigate the effects on the swap market as\nwell as the treasury bond market. We model stochastic interest rates using the\nVasicek model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2016 22:33:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-18"}
