To address this problem, we\ndevelop a data-driven robust taxi dispatch framework to consider\nspatial-temporally correlated demand uncertainties.

In such\nsystems, the dissipation of the kinetic energy of tidal flows in the host star\nmay modify its rotational evolution and shape the orbital architecture of the\nsurrounding planetary system. In this context, recent works demonstrated that\nthe amplitude of this dissipation can vary over several orders of magnitude as\na function of stellar mass, age and rotation. In addition, the stellar rotation\nevolution strongly impacts angular momentum exchanges within star-planet\nsystems. Therefore, it is now necessary to take into account the structural and\nrotational evolution of stars when studying the orbital evolution of close-in\nplanets. The presence of planets may also modify the rotation of the host stars\nand as a consequence their evolution, magnetic activity and mixing. In this\nwork, we present the first study of the dynamics of close-in planets of various\nmasses orbiting low-mass stars (from $0.6$ to $1.2~M_\\star$) where we compute\nthe simultaneous evolution of the star's structure, rotation and tidal\ndissipation in its external convective enveloppe. We find that tidal friction\ndue to the stellar dynamical tide, i.e. tidal inertial waves excited in the\nconvection zone, can be larger by several orders of magnitude than the one of\nthe equilibrium tide, especially during the PMS phase. Consequently, the\norbital migration of the planet is now more pronounced and depends more on the\nstellar mass, rotation and age. This would very weakly affect the planets in\nthe habitable zone because they are located at orbital distances such that\nstellar tide-induced migration happens on very long timescales. We also\ndemonstrate that the rotational evolution of host stars is only weakly affected\nby the presence of planets except for massive companions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2016 21:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

Unfortunately however, it\nis widely reported that the accuracy of standard BEM schemes is limited,\nespecially when the current source density is dipolar and its location\napproaches one of the brain boundary surfaces. This is a particularly limiting\nproblem given that during an high-resolution EEG imaging procedure, several EEG\nforward problem solutions are required for which the source currents are near\nor on top of a boundary surface.\n  This work will first present an analysis of standardly discretized EEG\nforward problems, reporting on a theoretical issue of some of the formulations\nthat have been used so far in the community. We report on the fact that several\nstandardly used discretizations requires the expansion term to be a square\nintegrable function. Instead, those techniques are not consistent when a more\nappropriate mapping is considered. Such a mapping allows the expansion function\nterm to be a less regular function, thus sensibly reducing the need for mesh\nrefinements and low-precisions handling strategies that are currently required.\nThese mappings, however, require a different and conforming discretization\nwhich must be suitably adapted to them. To do this we adopt a mixed\ndiscretization based on dual boundary elements residing on a suitably defined\ndual mesh. Finally we show how the resulting EEG problems has favorable\nproperties with respect to previously proposed schemes and we show their\napplicability to real case modeling scenarios obtained from MRI data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2016 22:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-22"}

Such blocking also affects\nfunctionality of webpages and impairs user experience. As a consequence, many\nprivacy preserving tools (PP-Tools) that have been developed to limit online\ntracking, often executed via JS, may suffer from poor performance and limited\nuptake. A mechanism that can isolate JS necessary for proper functioning of the\nwebsite from tracking JS would thus be useful. Through the use of a manually\nlabelled dataset composed of 2,612 JS, we show how current PP-Tools are\nineffective in finding the right balance between blocking tracking JS and\nallowing functional JS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study\nto assess the performance of current web PP-Tools.\n  To improve this balance, we examine the two classes of JS and hypothesize\nthat tracking JS share structural similarities that can be used to\ndifferentiate them from functional JS. The rationale of our approach is that\nweb developers often borrow and customize existing pieces of code in order to\nembed tracking (resp. functional) JS into their webpages. We then propose\none-class machine learning classifiers using syntactic and semantic features\nextracted from JS. When trained only on samples of tracking JS, our classifiers\nachieve an accuracy of 99%, where the best of the PP-Tools achieved an accuracy\nof 78%.\n  We further test our classifiers and several popular PP-Tools on a corpus of\n4K websites with 135K JS. The output of our best classifier on this data is\nbetween 20 to 64% different from the PP-Tools. We manually analyse a sample of\nthe JS for which our classifier is in disagreement with all other PP-Tools, and\nshow that our approach is not only able to enhance user web experience by\ncorrectly classifying more functional JS, but also discovers previously unknown\ntracking services.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2016 23:33:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-22"}

For stochastic systems with polynomial dynamics, the moments of the\nstate can be expressed as a, possibly infinite, system of deterministic linear\nordinary differential equations. By casting the problem as a deterministic\ncontrol problem in moment space, semidefinite programming is used to find a\nlower bound on the optimal solution. The constraints in the semidefinite\nprogram are imposed by the ordinary differential equations for moment dynamics\nand semidefiniteness of the outer product of moments.

The starting point of\nthis phase, called nucleation exhibits an important variability among\nreplicated experiments.To analyse the stochastic nature of this phenomenon, one\nof the simplest models considers two populations of chemical components:\nmonomers and polymerised monomers. Initially there are only monomers. There are\ntwo reactions for the polymerization of a monomer: either two monomers collide\nto combine into two polymerised monomers or a monomer is polymerised after the\nencounter of a polymerised monomer. It turns out that this simple model does\nnot explain completely the variability observed in the experiments. This paper\ninvestigates extensions of this model to take into account other mechanisms of\nthe polymerization process that may have impact an impact on fluctuations.The\nfirst variant consists in introducing a preliminary conformation step to take\ninto account the biological fact that, before being polymerised, a monomer has\ntwo states, regular or misfolded. Only misfolded monomers can be polymerised so\nthat the fluctuations of the number of misfolded monomers can be also a source\nof variability of the number of polymerised monomers. The second variant\nrepresents the reaction rate $\\alpha$ of spontaneous formation of a polymer as\nof the order of $N^{-\\nu}$, with $\\nu$ some positive constant. First and second\norder results for the starting instant of nucleation are derived from these\nlimit theorems.

In this paper, we describe an approach to learning\nfrom demonstration that can be used to train soft robotic hands to perform\ndexterous manipulation tasks. Our method uses object-centric demonstrations,\nwhere a human demonstrates the desired motion of manipulated objects with their\nown hands, and the robot autonomously learns to imitate these demonstrations\nusing reinforcement learning. We propose a novel algorithm that allows us to\nblend and select a subset of the most feasible demonstrations to learn to\nimitate on the hardware, which we use with an extension of the guided policy\nsearch framework to use multiple demonstrations to learn generalizable neural\nnetwork policies.

The mechanism for this is that the\nlinearized Yang-Mills equations in the background of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\n(RN) black holes possess a normalizable zero mode, resulting in non-Abelian\n(nA) magnetic clouds near the horizon. In this work we show that the same\npattern may occur also for asymptotically flat RN black holes.

We study the\nshadow (apparent shape), an optical appearance because of its strong\ngravitational field, cast by a nonsingular black hole which is characterized by\nthree parameters, i.e., mass ($M$), spin ($a$), and a deviation parameter\n($k$). The nonsingular black hole under consideration, is a generalization of\nthe Kerr black hole {that} can be recognized asymptotically ($r>>k, k>0$)\nexplicitly as the Kerr-Newman black hole, and in the limit $k \\rightarrow 0$ as\nthe Kerr black hole. It turns out that the shadow of a nonsingular black hole\nis a dark zone covered by {a} deformed circle. Interestingly, it is seen that\nthe shadow of a black hole is affected due to the parameter $k$. Indeed, for a\ngiven $a$, the size of a shadow reduces as the parameter $k$ increases and the\nshadow becomes more distorted as we increase the value of the parameter $k$\nwhen compared with the analogous Kerr black hole shadow. We also investigate,\nin detail, how the ergoregion of a black hole is changed due to the deviation\nparameter $k$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2016 11:07:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 13:52:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

Here, we demonstrate that the latter approach also\nprovides a corresponding distinction between different co-existing dynamical\nregimes of the standard map, a paradigmatic example of a low-dimensional\nconservative system.

Such objects are predicted by\nunified models, which attribute most of the AGN diversity to their inclination\non the line of sight, and play an important role for the understanding of the\ngrowth of black holes in the early Universe. The fraction of obscured AGN at\nlow redshift can be derived from the observed CXB spectrum assuming AGN\nspectral templates and luminosity functions.

P. Kulkarni at the 8th\nCosmic Dust meeting. Dust has a profound effect on the physics and chemistry of\nthe interstellar gas in galaxies and on the appearance of galaxies.\nUnderstanding the cosmic evolution of dust with time is therefore crucial for\nunderstanding the evolution of galaxies. Despite the importance of interstellar\ndust, very little is known about its nature and composition in distant\ngalaxies. We summarize the results of our ongoing programs using observations\nof distant quasars to obtain better constraints on dust grains in foreground\ngalaxies that happen to lie along the quasar sightlines. These observations\nconsist of a combination of mid-infrared data obtained with the Spitzer Space\nTelescope and optical/UV data obtained with ground-based telescopes and/or the\nHubble Space Telescope. The mid-IR data target the 10 $\\mu$m and 18 $\\mu$m\nsilicate absorption features, while the optical/UV data allow determinations of\nelement depletions, extinction curves, 2175 {\\AA} bumps, etc. Measurements of\nsuch properties in absorption-selected galaxies with redshifts ranging from\n$z\\sim0$ to $z>2$ provide constraints on the evolution of interstellar dust\nover the past $> 10$ Gyr. The optical depth of the 10 $\\mu$m silicate\nabsorption feature ($\\tau_{10}$) in these galaxies is correlated with the\namount of reddening along the sightline. But there are indications [e.g., based\non the $\\tau_{10}$ /$E(B-V)$ ratio and possible grain crystallinity] that the\ndust in these distant galaxies differs in structure and composition from the\ndust in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds.

Here we study a rectangular array of triangular antidots\nwith zigzag edge geometries and show that their band gap behavior qualitatively\ndiffers from the standard behavior which is exhibited, e.g, by rectangular\narrays of armchair-edged triangles. In the spin unpolarized case, zigzag-edged\nantidots give rise to large band gaps compared to armchair-edged antidots,\nirrespective of the rules which govern the existence of gaps in armchair-edged\nantidot lattices. In addition the zigzag-edged antidots appear more robust than\narmchair-edged antidots in the presence of geometrical disorder. The inclusion\nof spin polarization within a mean-field Hubbard approach gives rise to a large\noverall magnetic moment at each antidot due to the sublattice imbalance imposed\nby the triangular geometry. Half-metallic behavior arises from the formation of\nspin-split dispersive states near the Fermi energy, reducing the band gaps\ncompared to the unpolarized case.

In this article, we propose an algorithm that can be applied on-board a\nvehicle to online estimate the expected number of driving events occurring, and\nthus be used to estimate the distribution of driving events for a certain group\nof customers. Since the driving events are not observed directly, the algorithm\nuses a hidden Markov model to extract the events. The parameters of the HMM are\nestimated using an online EM algorithm. The introduction of the online EM is\ncrucial for practical usage, on-board vehicles, due to that its complexity of\nan iteration is fixed. Typically, the EM algorithm is used to find the, fixed,\nparameters that maximizes the likelihood. By introducing a fixed forgetting\nfactor in the online EM, an adaptive algorithm is acquired.

They are believed to trace\nshock-waves in the intra-cluster medium. Recent observations demonstrated that\nsome prominent radio relics exhibit a steepening above 2 GHz in their radio\nspectrum. This challenges standard theoretical models because shock\nacceleration is expected to accelerate electrons to very high energies with a\npower-law distribution in momentum. In this work we attempt to reconcile these\ndata with the shock-acceleration scenario. We propose that the spectral\nsteepening may be caused by the highest energy electrons emitting\npreferentially in lower magnetic fields than the bulk of synchrotron bright\nelectrons in relics. Here, we focus on a model with an increasing mag- netic\nfield behind the shock front, which quickly saturates and then declines. We\nderive the time-evolution of cosmic-ray electron spectra in time variable\nmagnetic fields and an expanding medium. We then apply the formalism on the\nlarge radio relic in the cluster CIZA J2242.8+5301 (the Sausage relic). We show\nthat under favourable circumstances of magnetic field amplification downstream,\nour model can explain the observed radio spectrum, the brightness profile and\nthe spectral index profile of the relic. A possible interpretation for the\nrequired amplification of the magnetic field downstream is a dynamo acting\nbehind the shock with an injection scale of magnetic turbulence of about 10\nkpc. Our models require injection efficiencies of CRe - which are in tension\nwith simple diffusive shock acceleration from the thermal pool. We show that\nthis problem can likely be alleviated considering pre-existing CRe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2016 12:39:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

They include practically all\ndifferential systems of interest, at least those that have conservation laws.\nIn this paper, we discuss quasi-Noether systems that possess\ninfinite-dimensional (infinite) symmetries involving arbitrary functions of\nindependent variables. For quasi-Noether systems admitting infinite symmetries\nwith arbitrary functions of all independent variables, we state and prove an\nextension of the Second Noether Theorem. In addition, we prove that infinite\nsets of conservation laws involving arbitrary functions of all independent\nvariables are trivial and that the associated differential system is\nunder-determined. We discuss infinite symmetries and infinite conservation laws\nof two important examples of non-variational quasi-Noether systems: the\nincompressible Euler equations and the Navier-Stokes equations in vorticity\nformulation, and we show that the infinite sets of conservation laws involving\narbitrary functions of all independent variables are trivial. We also analyze\ninfinite symmetries involving arbitrary functions of not all independent\nvariables, prove that the fluxes of conservation laws in these cases are total\ndivergences on solutions, and demonstrate examples of this situation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2016 03:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

Learners with diverse social, cultural, economic,\nlinguistic, and religious backgrounds from all over the world are taking\nbenefits from e-learning. In e-learning, culture of target learners plays a\nvital role and need to be explored for better results. Diversity of culture and\nlearning styles should keep under considerations while designing e-learning\nenvironment. It may help to attain the required results. In this research work,\nauthors proposed and designed a novel architecture for e-learning system\nincorporating cultural diversity of learners. The focus is to concentrate on\ncultural factors from e-learning system. Furthermore; a prototype of the\nproposed system is implemented for the validation of proposed architecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2016 10:43:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}
