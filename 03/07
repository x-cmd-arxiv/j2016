The\nfeature of this problem is that a weight matrix of the control cost in the cost\nfunctional is singular. Due to this singularity, the problem can be solved\nneither by application of the Pontriagin's Maximum Principle, nor using the\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation approach, i.e. this problem is singular. Since\nthe weight matrix of the control cost, being singular, is not in general zero,\nonly a part of the control coordinates is singular, while the others are\nregular. This problem is solved by a regularization method. Namely, it is\nassociated with a new optimal control problem for the same equation of\ndynamics. The cost functional in this new problem is the sum of the original\ncost functional and an infinite horizon integral of the squares of the singular\ncontrol coordinates with a small positive weight. Due to a smallness of this\ncoefficient, the new problem is a partial cheap control problem. Using a\nperturbation technique, an asymptotic analysis of this partial cheap control\nproblem is carried out. Based on this analysis, the infimum of the cost\nfunctional in the original problem is derived, and a minimizing sequence of\nstate-feedback controls is designed. An illustrative example of a singular\ntrajectory tracking is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Mar 2016 16:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-08"}

For instance, as Pt and Ir below Co induce DMI of opposite\nchirality, inserting Co between Pt (below) and Ir (above) in Ir/Co/Pt trilayers\nenhances the DMI of Co/Pt bilayers by 15\\%. Furthermore, in case of Pb/Co/Pt\ntrilayers (Ir/Fe/Co/Pt multilayers), DMI can be enhanced by 50\\% (almost\ndoubled) compared to Co/Pt bilayers reaching a very large DMI amplitude of 2.7\n(3.2) meV/atom.

These two methodological families used for neuroimaging data\nanalysis can be viewed as two extremes of a continuum. Yet, they originated\nfrom different historical contexts, build on different theories, rest on\ndifferent assumptions, evaluate different outcome metrics, and permit different\nconclusions. This paper portrays commonalities and differences between\nclassical statistics and statistical learning with their relation to\nneuroimaging research. The conceptual implications are illustrated in three\ncommon analysis scenarios. It is thus tried to resolve possible confusion\nbetween classical hypothesis testing and data-guided model estimation by\ndiscussing their ramifications for the neuroimaging access to neurobiology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Mar 2016 18:56:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 May 2016 12:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-05"}

In this\npaper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the DY process in $pA$\ninteractions at RHIC and LHC energies in the color dipole framework.

In this analysis, we take into account besides the $\\gamma^*$\nalso the $Z^0$ contribution to the production cross section, thus extending the\npredictions to large dilepton invariant masses. Besides the nuclear attenuation\nof produced dileptons at large energies and forward rapidities emerging due to\nthe onset of shadowing effects, we predict a strong suppression at large $p_T$,\ndilepton invariant masses and Feynman $x_F$ caused by the Initial State\nInteraction effects in kinematic regions where no shadowing is expected.

While early-type\n(elliptical+lenticular) and late-type (spiral) galaxies split into two separate\nrelations in the $L_{sph}-n_{sph}$ and $M_{BH}-L_{sph}$ diagrams, they reunite\ninto a single $M_{BH} \\propto n_{sph}^{3.39 \\pm 0.15}$ sequence with relatively\nsmall intrinsic scatter ($\\epsilon \\simeq 0.25 \\rm~dex$). The black hole mass\nappears to be closely related to the spheroid central concentration of stars,\nwhich mirrors the inner gradient of the spheroid gravitational potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 01:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

In a magnetar, the\nLandau levels of degenerate and relativistic electrons are strongly quantized.\nA new quantity $g_{n}$, the electron Landau-level stability coefficient is\nintroduced. According to the requirement that $g_{n}$ decreases with increasing\nthe magnetic field intensity $B$, the magnetic-field index $\\beta$ in the\nexpression of $E_{\\rm F}(e)$ must be positive. By introducing the\nDirac$-\\delta$ function, we deduce a general formulae for the Fermi energy of\ndegenerate and relativistic electrons, and obtain a particular solution to\n$E_{\\rm F}(e)$ in a superhigh magnetic field (SMF).

By\nmodifying the phase space of relativistic electrons, a SMF can enhance the\nelectron number density $n_e$, and decrease the maximum of electron Landau\nlevel number, which results in a redistribution of electrons. According to\nPauli exclusion principle, the degenerate electrons will fill quantum states\nfrom the lowest Landau level to the highest Landau level. As $B$ increases,\nmore and more electrons will occupy higher Landau levels, though $g_{n}$\ndecreases with the Landau level number $n$. The enhanced $n_{e}$ in a SMF means\nan increase in the electron Fermi energy and an increase in the electron\ndegeneracy pressure.

Recent studies provided a global picture of\ncosmic star formation history. However, what drives the evolution of star\nformation activities in galaxies has long been a matter of debate. The key\nfactor of the star formation is the transition of hydrogen from atomic to\nmolecular state, since the star formation is associated with the molecular\nphase. This transition is also strongly coupled with chemical evolution,\nbecause dust grains, i.e., tiny solid particles of heavy elements, play a\ncritical role in molecular formation. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding\nof neutral-molecular gas transition, star formation and chemical enrichment is\nnecessary to clarify the galaxy formation and evolution.

In this two-dimensional collapse model a scalar\nfield coupled to the dilaton gravity, moving leftwards, collapses to form a\nblack hole. There are two sets of asymptotic ($t\\to\\infty$) observers, around\n$x\\to\\infty$ and $x\\to-\\infty$. The observers at the right null infinity\nwitness a thermal flux of radiation associated with time dependent geometry\nleading to a black hole formation and its subsequent Hawking evaporation, in an\nexpected manner. We show that even the observers at left null infinity find\nthemselves in thermal ambiance, without experiencing any change of spacetime\ngeometry all along their trajectories. They remain as inertial observers in a\n\\emph{flat} region of spacetime where curvature tensor identically vanishes in\na portion of full spacetime. These observers find the state of the quantum\nfield in a late time thermal configuration, with \\emph{exactly the same}\ntemperature as measured by the observers at right null infinity, {\\it despite\nbeing inertial in flat spacetime region throughout their history}. This is very\nclosely related to the standard Unruh effect in the flat spacetime, except for\na key difference --- since they are inertial throughout and {\\it have no\ncausally connected source in the past light cone to account for what they see}.\nThe result arises from quantum correlations which extend outside the past light\ncone and is conceptually similar to the EPR correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 07:42:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2016 10:11:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2016 12:20:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 25 May 2018 10:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}

We find large variations in Hg concentration between different\nmeteorites (ca. 10 ppb to 14'000 ppb), with the highest concentration orders of\nmagnitude above the expected bulk solar system silicates value. From the\npresence of several different Hg carrier phases in thermal release profiles\n(150 to 650 {\\deg}C), we argue that these variations are unlikely to be mainly\ndue to terrestrial contamination. The Hg abundance of meteorites shows no\ncorrelation with petrographic type, or mass-dependent fractionation of Hg\nisotopes. Most carbonaceous chondrites show mass-independent enrichments in the\nodd-numbered isotopes 199Hg and 201Hg. We show that the enrichments are not\nnucleosynthetic, as we do not find corresponding nucleosynthetic deficits of\n196Hg. Instead, they can partially be explained by Hg evaporation and\nredeposition during heating of asteroids from primordial radionuclides and\nlate-stage impact heating. Non-carbonaceous chondrites, most achondrites and\nthe Earth do not show these enrichments in vapor-phase Hg. All meteorites\nstudied here have however isotopically light Hg ({\\delta}202Hg = ~-7 to -1)\nrelative to the Earth's average crustal values, which could suggest that the\nEarth has lost a significant fraction of its primordial Hg. However, the late\naccretion of carbonaceous chondritic material on the order of ~2%, which has\nbeen suggested to account for the water, carbon, nitrogen and noble gas\ninventories of the Earth, can also contribute most or all of the Earth's\ncurrent Hg budget. In this case, the isotopically heavy Hg of the Earth's crust\nwould have to be the result of isotopic fractionation between surface and\ndeep-Earth reservoirs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 07:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

However, their interpretation\nrests on a number of simplifying assumptions that regularly ignore important\ncomplexities of real data, in particular within-host evolution and non-sampled\npatients.\n  Here we propose a new approach to transmission inference called SCOTTI\n(Structured COalescent Transmission Tree Inference). This method is based on a\nstatistical framework that models each host as a distinct population, and\ntransmissions between hosts as migration events. Our computationally efficient\nimplementation of this model enables the inference of host-to-host transmission\nwhile accommodating within-host evolution and non-sampled hosts. SCOTTI is\ndistributed as an open source package for the phylogenetic software BEAST2.\n  We show that SCOTTI can generally infer transmission events even in the\npresence of considerable within-host variation, can account for the uncertainty\nassociated with the possible presence of non-sampled hosts, and can efficiently\nuse data from multiple samples of the same host, although there is some\nreduction in accuracy when samples are collected very close to the infection\ntime.\n  We illustrate the features of our approach by investigating transmission from\ngenetic and epidemiological data in a Foot and Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV)\nveterinary outbreak in England and a Klebsiella pneumoniae outbreak in a Nepali\nneonatal unit.

The active users are contending to report\ntheir activity to the AP over a multiple access channel. We devise a contention\nalgorithm that assumes a combination of physical-layer network coding and\nK-out-of-N signature coding, allowing for multiple detection of up to K users\nat the access point. In addition, we rely on the principles of coded slotted\nALOHA (CSA) and use of successive interference cancellation to enable\nsubsequent resolution of the collisions that originally featured more than K\nusers. The objective is to identify the subset of active users such that the\ntarget performance, e.g., probability of active user resolution and/or\nthroughput is reached, which implies that the duration of the contention period\nis also not known a priori. In contrast to standard CSA approaches, in the\nproposed algorithm each user, active or not, has a predefined schedule of slots\nin which it sends its signature. We analyze the performance of the proposed\nalgorithm both in the asymptotic and non-asymptotic settings. We also derive an\nestimator that, based on the observation of collision multiplicities, estimates\nhow many users are active and thereby enables tuning of the length of the\ncontention period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 10:53:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

This is the case for voltage-gated\nCa2+ channels (VGCCs). They are present in all mammalian central neurons,\ncontrolling presynaptic release of transmitter, postsynaptic signaling and\nsynaptic integration. The amplitudes of their single channel currents in a\nphysiological concentration of extracellular Ca2+, however, are small and not\nwell determined. But measurement of this quantity is essential for estimating\nnumbers of functional VGCCs in the membrane and the size of channel-associated\nCa2+ signaling domains, and for understanding the stochastic nature of Ca2+\nsignaling. Here, we recorded the VGCC current in nucleated patches from layer 5\npyramidal neurons in rat neocortex, in physiological external Ca2+ (1-2 mM).\nThe ensemble-averaging of current responses required for conventional\nfluctuation analysis proved impractical because of the rapid rundown of VGCC\ncurrents. We therefore developed a more robust method, using mean current\nfitting of individual current responses and band-pass filtering. Furthermore,\nvoltage ramp stimulation proved useful. We validated the accuracy of the method\nby analyzing simulated data. At an external Ca2+ concentration of 1 mM, and a\nmembrane potential of -20 mV, we found that the average single channel current\namplitude was about 0.04 pA, increasing to 0.065 pA at 2 mM external Ca2+, and\n0.12 pA at 5 mM. The relaxation time constant of the fluctuations was in the\nrange 0.2-0.8 ms. The results are relevant to understanding the stochastic\nproperties of dendritic Ca2+ spikes in neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons.\nWith the reported method, single channel current amplitude of native VGCCs can\nbe resolved accurately despite conditions of unstable rundown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 11:14:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2016 09:49:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 12:55:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

Grasping unknown objects can be\nachieved by using a trial and error exploration strategy. Bayesian optimization\nis a sample efficient optimization algorithm that is especially suitable for\nthis setups as it actively reduces the number of trials for learning about the\nfunction to optimize. In fact, this active object exploration is the same\nstrategy that infants do to learn optimal grasps. One problem that arises while\nlearning grasping policies is that some configurations of grasp parameters may\nbe very sensitive to error in the relative pose between the object and robot\nend-effector. We call these configurations unsafe because small errors during\ngrasp execution may turn good grasps into bad grasps. Therefore, to reduce the\nrisk of grasp failure, grasps should be planned in safe areas. We propose a new\nalgorithm, Unscented Bayesian optimization that is able to perform sample\nefficient optimization while taking into consideration input noise to find safe\noptima. The contribution of Unscented Bayesian optimization is twofold as if\nprovides a new decision process that drives exploration to safe regions and a\nnew selection procedure that chooses the optimal in terms of its safety without\nextra analysis or computational cost. Both contributions are rooted on the\nstrong theory behind the unscented transformation, a popular nonlinear\napproximation method. We show its advantages with respect to the classical\nBayesian optimization both in synthetic problems and in realistic robot grasp\nsimulations. The results highlights that our method achieves optimal and robust\ngrasping policies after few trials while the selected grasps remain in safe\nregions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 12:51:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-08"}

In this paper, we present a numerical approach to determining the\nspatial-spectral relative-phase and time-delay maps of hyperentangled photons\nall over the spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) emission cone. We\nconsider the hyperentangled-photons produced by superimposing noncollinear SPDC\nemissions of two crossed and coherently-pumped nonlinear crystals.

While rigorous quantum treatment of SPDC emission requires Gaussian\nstate representation, in low-gain regime (like the case of the study), it is\nwell approximated to the first order to superposition of vacuum and two-photon\nstates. The relative phase and time-delay maps are then calculated between the\ntwo-photon wavepackets created along symmetrical locations of the crystals.\nAssuming monochromatic plane-wave pump field, the mutual signal-idler relations\nlike energy conservation and transverse-momentum conservation define well one\nof the two-photon with reference to its conjugate. The weaker conservation of\nlongitudinal momentum (due to relatively thin crystals) allows two-photon\nemission directions coplanar with the pump beam while spreading around the\nperfect phase-matching direction.

Accuracy of DNC results has been improved steadily,\nresulting in two DNC branches: the classical algebraic analysis and the more\nrecent optimization-based analysis. The optimization-based branch provides a\ntheoretical solution for tight bounds. Its computational cost grows, however,\n(possibly super-)exponentially with the network size. Consequently, a heuristic\noptimization formulation trading accuracy against computational costs was\nproposed. In this paper, we challenge optimization-based DNC with a new\nalgebraic DNC algorithm.\n  We show that: (i) no current optimization formulation scales well with the\nnetwork size and (ii) algebraic DNC can be considerably improved in both\naspects, accuracy and computational cost. To that end, we contribute a novel\nDNC algorithm that transfers the optimization's search for best attainable\ndelay bounds to algebraic DNC. It achieves a high degree of accuracy and our\nnovel efficiency improvements reduce the cost of the analysis dramatically.

We assume that individuals arrive\nto maximize the utility of voluntary prevention, as the epidemic reaches an\nendemic level alleviated by prevention and treatment. We thus obtain an\nexpression for the asymptotic prevention coverage. Notably, we obtain that, if\nthe relative cost of prevention versus treatment is sufficiently low, epidemics\nmay be averted through the use of prevention alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 10:31:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2016 14:04:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

The input dataset\nconsists of incident cases partitioned into outbreaks, each initiated from a\nsingle index case. We split of the input dataset into two successive subsets,\nto evaluate two successive R values, according to the Bayesian paradigm. We\nused the Bayes factor between the model with two different R values and that\nwith a single R value to justify that the change in R is statistically\nsignificant. We validated our approach using simulated data, generated using\nknown R. In particular, we found that claiming two distinct R values may depend\nsignificantly on the number of outbreaks. We then reanalyzed data previously\nstudied by Jansen et al. [Jansen et al. Science 301 (5634), 804], concerning\nthe effective reproduction number for measles in the UK, during 1995-2002. Our\nanalyses showed that the 1995-2002 dataset should be divided into two separate\nsubsets for the periods 1995-1998 and 1999-2002. In contrast, Jansen et al.\ntake this splitting point as input of their analysis. Our estimated effective\nreproduction numbers R are in good agreement with those found by Jansen et al.\nIn conclusion, our methodology for detecting temporal changes in R using\noutbreak-size data worked satisfactorily with both simulated and real-world\ndata. The methodology may be used for updating R in real time, as surveillance\noutbreak data become available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 10:40:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}
