In order to take into account the thixotropy,\nthe constitutive relation uses a structural parameter which is driven by a\nkinetic equation. Here, the Houska's model is considered. Depending on the\nbreakdown rate of the structural parameter, localization or shear-banding are\nobserved. We show that for fragile structures, a shear-banding flow may be\nobserved although for stronger structures, only localisation of the flow is\nobserved such as in Bingham fluids. Physical explanations of the shear-banding\ndiscussed by several authors in the literature highlight that the shear-banding\nmay be associated with a discontinuity into the structure of the material and a\nnon-monotonic evolution of the stress according to the constitutive relation\nwith the strain rate. Solving numerically the flow, we show that such a\nrheological model based on the existence of a structural parameter is able to\npredict shear-banding. Moreover, the consequences of the thixotropy on the\nlinear stability of the azimuthal flow is studied in a large range of\nparameters. Although the thixotropy allows shear banding for the base flow, it\ndoes not modify fundamentaly the stability of the Couette flow compared to a\nsimple yield stress fluid. The apparent shear-thinning behaviour depends on the\nthixotropic parameters of the fluid and the results about the onset of the\nTaylor vortices in shear-thinning fluids are retrieved. Nevertheless, the\nshear-banding modifies the stratification of the viscosity in the flowing zone\nsuch that the critical conditions are mainly driven by the width of the flowing\nregion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 16:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

The jets we study have\nfinite thermal pressure in addition to having realistic magnetic field\nstructures and velocity shear.

Specializing to the case of normalized centered quadratic\nvariations for stationary Gaussian sequences, we show that a third moment\ntheorem holds: convergence occurs if and only if the sequence's third moments\ntend to $0$.

Moreover, orbital stability analysis\nshows tides can drive many hot Jupiters to spiral inevitably toward their host\nstars. Thus, the coupled processes of orbital evolution and RLO likely shape\nthe observed distribution of close-in exoplanets and may even be responsible\nfor producing some of the short-period rocky planets. However, the exact\noutcome for an overflowing planet depends on its internal response to mass\nloss, and the accompanying orbital evolution can act to enhance or inhibit RLO.\nIn this study, we apply the fully-featured and robust Modules for Experiments\nin Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) suite to model RLO of short-period gaseous\nplanets. We show that, although the detailed evolution may depend on several\nproperties of the planetary system, it is largely determined by the core mass\nof the overflowing gas giant. In particular, we find that the orbital expansion\nthat accompanies RLO often stops and reverses at a specific maximum period that\ndepends on the core mass. We suggest that RLO may often strand the remnant of a\ngas giant near this orbital period, which provides an observational prediction\nthat can corroborate the hypothesis that short-period gas giants undergo RLO.\nWe conduct a preliminary comparison of this prediction to the observed\npopulation of small, short-period planets and find some planets in orbits that\nmay be consistent with this picture. To the extent that we can establish some\nshort-period planets are indeed the remnants of gas giants, that population can\nelucidate the properties of gas giant cores, the properties of which remain\nlargely unconstrained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 18:30:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 18:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

We do this in the\nfrequency domain and generate a time series containing only variations in the\nsignal due to the antenna pattern. Although less flexible than the classic\nheterodyne approach, SplInter allows for rapid analysis of putative signals\nfrom isolated (and some binary) pulsars, and efficient follow-up searches for\ncandidate signals generated by other search methods. The computational saving\nover the heterodyne approach can be many orders of magnitude, up to a factor of\naround fifty thousand in some cases, with a minimal impact on overall\nsensitivity for most targets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 19:16:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 11:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-19"}

Previous studies of stellar rotation in the Hyades relied on targeted\nobservations of single stars or data from shallower all-sky variability\nsurveys. The re-purposed Kepler mission, K2, is the first opportunity to\nmeasure rotation periods ($P_{rot}$) for many Hyads simultaneously while also\nbeing sensitive to fully convective M dwarf members. We analyze K2 data for 65\nHyads and present $P_{rot}$ values for 48. Thirty-seven of these are new\nmeasurements, including the first $P_{rot}$ measurements for fully convective\nHyads. For nine of the 11 stars with $P_{rot}$ in the literature and this work,\nthe measurements are consistent; we attribute the two discrepant cases to spot\nevolution. Nearly all stars with masses $\\le0.3M_\\odot$ are rapidly rotating,\nindicating a change in rotation properties at the boundary to full convection.\nWhen confirmed and candidate binaries are removed from the mass-period plane,\nonly three rapid rotators with masses $\\ge0.3M_\\odot$ remain. This is in\ncontrast to previous results showing that the single-valued mass-period\nsequence for $\\approx$600 Myr-old stars ends at $\\approx0.65M_\\odot$ when\nbinaries are included. We also find that models of rotational evolution predict\nfaster rotation than is actually observed at $\\approx$600 Myrs for stars\n$\\le0.9M_\\odot$. The dearth of single rapid rotators more massive than\n$\\approx0.3M_\\odot$ indicates that magnetic braking is more efficient than\npreviously thought, and that age-rotation studies must account for\nmultiplicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 19:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

In contrast to conventional electrowetting devices that use\npolar liquids, limited by high absorption in the infrared region, we present\nroom-temperature ionic liquid-based (RTIL, N-Propyl-Nmethylpyrrolidinium\nBis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, Pyr1333a, Solvionic) lens and prism elements with\nunprecedented spectral bandwidths. Our electrowetting lenses tune over 20\ndiopters and have been demonstrated at 588, 1550 and 3000 nm wavelengths.\nAdditionally, we have demonstrated prism elements with a steering angle of\n0.56{\\deg} at 1550 nm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 19:32:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 20:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

Our\nmeasurements here of the first normal stress difference over a wide range of\nparticle volume fraction elucidate the relative contributions from hydrodynamic\nlubrication and frictional contact forces, which have been debated. At moderate\nvolume fractions we find $N_1<0$, consistent with hydrodynamic models, however\nat higher volume fractions and shear stresses these models break down and we\ninstead observe dilation ($N_1>0$), indicating frictional contact networks.\nRemarkably, there is no signature of this transition in the viscosity, instead\nthis change in the sign of $N_1$ occurs while the shear thickening remains\ncontinuous. These results suggest a scenario where shear thickening is driven\nprimarily by the formation of frictional contacts, with hydrodynamic forces\nplaying a supporting role at lower concentrations. Motivated by this picture,\nwe introduce a simple model which combines these frictional and hydrodynamic\ncontributions and accurately fits the measured viscosity over a wide range of\nparticle volume fraction and shear stress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 19:44:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-27"}

The advent of Herschel has now\nmade it possible to obtain a more precise comparison between the two regimes,\nand it has been found that about a third of the young HII regions emit more\nLyman continuum photons than expected, thus presenting a Lyman excess. With the\npresent study we wish to distinguish between two scenarios that have been\nproposed to explain the existence of the Lyman excess: (i) underestimation of\nthe bolometric luminosity, or (ii) additional emission of Lyman-continuum\nphotons from an accretion shock. We observed an outflow (SiO) and an infall\n(HCO+) tracer toward a complete sample of 200 HII regions, 67 of which present\nthe Lyman excess. Our goal was to search for any systematic difference between\nsources with Lyman excess and those without. While the outflow tracer does not\nreveal any significant difference between the two subsamples of HII regions,\nthe infall tracer indicates that the Lyman-excess sources are more associated\nwith infall signposts than the other objects. Our findings indicate that the\nmost plausible explanation for the Lyman excess is that in addition to the\nLyman continuum emission from the early-type star, UV photons are emitted from\naccretion shocks in the stellar neighbourhood. This result suggests that\nhigh-mass stars and/or stellar clusters containing young massive stars may\ncontinue to accrete for a long time, even after the development of a compact\nHII region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 20:17:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

Additionally, due to the lack of knowledge about street\nparking spaces, heuristic circling the blocks not only costs drivers' time and\nfuel, but also increases city congestion. In the wake of recent trend to build\nconvenient, green and energy-efficient smart cities, we rethink common\ntechniques adopted by high-profile smart parking systems, and present a\nuser-engaged (crowdsourcing) and sonar-based prototype to identify urban\non-street parking spaces. The prototype includes an ultrasonic sensor, a GPS\nreceiver and associated Arduino micro-controllers. It is mounted on the\npassenger side of a car to measure the distance from the vehicle to the nearest\nroadside obstacle. Multiple road tests are conducted around Wheatley, Oxford to\ngather results and emulate the crowdsourcing approach. By extracting parked\nvehicles' features from the collected trace, a supervised learning algorithm is\ndeveloped to estimate roadside parking occupancy and spot illegal parking\nvehicles. A quantity estimation model is derived to calculate the required\nnumber of sensing units to cover urban streets. The estimation is\nquantitatively compared to a fixed sensing solution. The results show that the\ncrowdsourcing way would need substantially fewer sensors compared to the fixed\nsensing system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 20:22:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-02"}

Wide-field near-IR surveys with HST are generally inefficient,\nas guide star acquisitions make it impractical to observe more than one\npointing per orbit. This limitation can be circumvented by guiding with gyros\nalone, which is possible as long as the telescope has three functional gyros.\nThe method presented here allows us to observe mosaics of eight independent\nWFC3-IR pointings in a single orbit by utilizing the fact that HST drifts by\nonly a very small amount in the 25 seconds between non-destructive reads of\nunguided exposures. By shifting the reads and treating them as independent\nexposures the full resolution of WFC3 can be restored. We use this \"drift and\nshift\" (DASH) method in the Cycle 23 COSMOS-DASH program, which will obtain 456\nWFC3 $H_{160}$ pointings in 57 orbits, covering an area of 0.6 degree$^2$ in\nthe COSMOS field down to $H_{160} = 25$. When completed, the program will more\nthan triple the area of extra-galactic survey fields covered by near-IR imaging\nat HST resolution. We demonstrate the viability of the method with the first\nfour orbits (32 pointings) of this program.

The MuSCADeT algorithm\ntakes advantage of the sparsity of astronomical objects in morphological\ndictionaries such as wavelets and their differences in spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) across multi-band observations. This allows us to devise a\nmodel independent and automated approach to separate objects with different\ncolours. We show with simulations that we are able to separate highly blended\nobjects and that our algorithm is robust against SED variations of objects\nacross the field of view. To confront our algorithm with real data, we use HST\nimages of the strong lensing galaxy cluster MACS J1149+2223 and we show that\nMuSCADeT performs better than traditional profile-fitting techniques in\ndeblending the foreground lensing galaxies from background lensed galaxies.\nAlthough the main driver for our work is the deblending of strong gravitational\nlenses, our method is fit to be used for any purpose related to deblending of\nobjects in astronomical images.

In the mean\ntime, disk mass loss has been conventionally attributed to photoevaporation,\nwhich controls disk dispersal. However, a paradigm shift towards accretion\ndriven by magnetized disk winds has been realized in the recent years, thanks\nto studies of non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic effects in PPDs. I present a\nframework of global PPD evolution aiming to incorporate these advances,\nhighlighting the role of wind-driven accretion and wind mass loss. Disk\nevolution is found to be largely dominated by wind-driven processes, and\nviscous spreading is suppressed. The timescale of disk evolution is controlled\nprimarily by the amount of external magnetic flux threading the disks, and how\nrapidly the disk loses the flux. Rapid disk dispersal can be achieved if the\ndisk is able to hold most of its magnetic flux during the evolution. In\naddition, because wind launching requires sufficient level of ionization at\ndisk surface (mainly via external far-UV radiation), wind kinematics is also\naffected by far-UV penetration depth and disk geometry. For typical disk\nlifetime of a few Myrs, the disk loses approximately the same amount of mass\nthrough the wind as through accretion onto the protostar, and most of the wind\nmass loss proceeds from the outer disk via a slow wind. Fractional wind mass\nloss increases with increasing disk lifetime. Significant wind mass loss likely\nsubstantially enhances the dust to gas mass ratio, and promotes planet\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 21:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

The OMD\nalgorithm requires the computation of a certain Bregman projection, that has\nclosed form solutions for simple convex sets like the Euclidean ball or the\nsimplex. However, for general polyhedra one often needs to exploit the general\nmachinery of convex optimization. We give a novel primal-style algorithm for\ncomputing Bregman projections on the base polytopes of polymatroids. Next, in\nthe case of the MWU algorithm, although it scales logarithmically in the number\nof pure strategies or experts $N$ in terms of regret, the algorithm takes time\npolynomial in $N$; this especially becomes a problem when learning\ncombinatorial objects. We give a general recipe to simulate the multiplicative\nweights update algorithm in time polynomial in their natural dimension. This is\nuseful whenever there exists a polynomial time generalized counting oracle\n(even if approximate) over these objects. Finally, using the combinatorial\nstructure of symmetric Nash-equilibria (SNE) when both players play bases of\nmatroids, we show that these can be found with a single projection or convex\nminimization (without using online learning).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 23:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-03"}

We evaluated the magnetic anisotropies of\nthese S = 1/2 ions on the basis of DFT calculations including spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC), and probed their origin by performing perturbation theory\nanalyses with SOC as perturbation within the LS coupling scheme. The observed\nspin orientations of Sr3NiIrO6 and Sr2IrO4 are correctly predicted by DFT\ncalculations, and are accounted for by the perturbation theory analysis. As for\nthe spin orientation of Na2IrO3, both experimental studies and DFT calculations\nhave not been unequivocal. Our analysis reveals that the Ir4+ spin orientation\nof Na2IrO3 should have nonzero components along the c- and a-axes directions.\nThe spin orientations determined by DFT calculations are sensitive to the\naccuracy of the crystal structures employed, which is explained by perturbation\ntheory analyses when interactions between adjacent Ir4+ ions are taken into\nconsideration. There are indications implying that the 5d electrons of Na2IrO3\nare less strongly localized compared with those of Sr3NiIrO6 and Sr2IrO4.

We present a theoretical model deriving this effect\nfrom first principles: stochastic variations in the gas density are converted\ninto potential fluctuations that act on the dark matter; the associated force\ncorrelation function is calculated and the corresponding stochastic equation\nsolved. Assuming a power law spectrum of fluctuations with maximal and minimal\ncutoff scales, we derive the velocity dispersion imparted to the halo particles\nand the relevant relaxation time.

Using this algorithm, we are able to generate probability distributions\nin distance, metallicity and RGB width for a series of subfields spanning these\nstructures. Specifically, we confirm a distance gradient of approximately 20\nkpc per degree along a 6 degree extension of the Giant Stellar Stream, with the\nfarthest subfields from M31 lying ~ 120 kpc more distant than the inner-most\nsubfields. Further, we find a metallicity that steadily increases from\n-0.7^{+0.1}_{-0.1} dex to -0.2^{+0.2}_{-0.1} dex along the inner half of the\nstream before steadily dropping to a value of -1.0^{+0.2}_{-0.2} dex at the\nfarthest reaches of our coverage. The RGB width is found to increase rapidly\nfrom 0.4^{+0.1}_{-0.1} dex to 1.1^{+0.2}_{-0.1} dex in the inner portion of the\nstream before plateauing and decreasing marginally in the outer subfields of\nthe stream.

Our results for the internal energy exhibit the temperature\ndependence consistent with the prediction including the \\alpha ' corrections.\nNext we perform simulations at small N but at lower temperature so that the\n\\alpha ' corrections can be neglected on the gravity side. Our results are\nconsistent with the prediction including the leading string loop correction,\nwhich suggests that the conjecture holds even at finite N.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 00:58:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 11:05:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

However, the long term goal is to\nease the volumetric acquisition of liver tumors in order to evaluate for\ntreatment response. Additional aim is the registration of intraoperative US\nimages via the interactive segmentations to the patient's pre-interventional CT\nacquisitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 01:42:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

We\nargue that the pattern diversity and reproducibility may be explained by\ninterpreting the pattern development as a first-order phase transition to a\nspatially modulated phase. Brazovskii showed that for such transitions on a\nflat, infinite sheet, the patterns are uniform striped or hexagonal. Biological\nobjects, however, have finite extent and offer different topologies, such as\nthe spherical surfaces of pollen grains. We consider Brazovskii transitions on\nspheres and show that the patterns have a richer phenomenology than simple\nstripes or hexagons. We calculate the free energy difference between the\nunpatterned state and the many possible patterned phases, taking into account\nfluctuations and the system's finite size. The proliferation of variety on a\nsphere may be understood as a consequence of topology, which forces defects\ninto perfectly ordered phases. The defects are then accommodated in different\nways.

In particular, the first\ndifficulty is that when pointwise maximizing virtual surplus under\nmulti-dimensional feasibility (i.e., the Border feasibility), (1) neither the\noptimal interim allocation is trivially monotone in the virtual value, (2) nor\nthe virtual value is monotone in the bidder's type. As a result, the optimal\ninterim allocations resulting from virtual surplus maximization no longer\nguarantees BIC. To address (1), we prove a generalization of Border's theorem\nand show that optimal interim allocation is indeed monotone in the virtual\nvalue. To address (2), we adapt Myerson's ironing procedure to this setting by\nredefining the (ironed) virtual value as a function of the lowest utility\npoint. The second difficulty, perhaps a more challenging one, is that the\nlowest utility type in general is no longer at the endpoints of the type\ninterval. To address this difficulty, we show by construction that there exist\nan allocation rule and an induced lowest utility type such that they form a\nsolution of the virtual surplus maximization and in the meanwhile guarantees\nIIR. In the single bidder case, the optimal auction consists of a randomized\nbundle menu and a deterministic bundle menu; while in the multiple bidder case,\nthe optimal auction is a randomization between two extreme mechanisms. The\noptimal solutions of our setting can be implemented by a Bayesian IC and IR\nauction, however, perhaps surprisingly, the revenue of this auction cannot be\nachieved by any (dominant-strategy) IC and IR auction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 03:12:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 02:07:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2016 11:48:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-03"}

We provide a variational characterization of the\nperformance of this regularized learner as $N$ grows to infinity while $n$\nstays constant, the associated optimality conditions lead to a partial\ndifferential equation that must be satisfied by the associated function\nestimate $\\hat{f}$. From this formulation we derive several predictions on the\nlimiting behavior the $d$-dimensional function $\\hat{f}$, including (a) a phase\ntransition in its smoothness at the threshold $p = d + 1$, and (b) a tradeoff\nbetween smoothness and sensitivity to the underlying unlabeled data\ndistribution $P$. Thus, over the range $p \\leq d$, the function estimate\n$\\hat{f}$ is degenerate and \"spiky,\" whereas for $p\\geq d+1$, the function\nestimate $\\hat{f}$ is smooth.

However, since WiFi networks are intermittently available, a\nmobile device user in WiFi offloading usually needs to wait for WiFi connection\nand thus experiences longer delay of packet transmission. To motivate users to\nparticipate in WiFi offloading, cellular network operators give incentives\n(rewards like coupons, e-coins) to users who wait for WiFi connection and\ntransmit packets through WiFi networks.\n  In this paper, we aim at maximizing users' rewards while meeting constraints\non queue stability and energy consumption. However, we face scheduling\nchallenges from random packet arrivals, intermittent WiFi connection and time\nvarying wireless link states. To address these challenges, we first formulate\nthe problem as a stochastic optimization problem. We then propose an optimal\nscheduling policy, named Optimal scheduling Policy under Energy Constraint\n(OPEC), which makes online decisions as to when to delay packet transmission to\nwait for WiFi connection and which wireless link (WiFi link or cellular link)\nto transmit packets on. OPEC automatically adapts to random packet arrivals and\ntime varying wireless link states, not requiring a priori knowledge of packet\narrival and wireless link probabilities. As verified by simulations, OPEC\nscheduling policy can achieve the maximum rewards while keeping queue stable\nand meeting energy consumption constraint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 06:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-03"}

Instead of fabricating optical\nmaterials, the SOE consists of a disordered medium and a photopolymer-based\nwavefront recorder, with shapes the wavefront of impinging light on demand.\nWith the proposed stand-alone SOEs, we experimentally demonstrate control of\nvarious properties of light, including intensity, polarisation, spectral\nfrequency and near field. Due to the tremendous freedom brought about by\ndisordered media, the proposed approach will provide unexplored routes to\nmanipulate arbitrary optical fields in stand-alone optical elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 06:49:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-03"}

The\nresults obtained are consistent with the view that the Hercules and Wolf 630\nstreams could be formed by a long-term influence of the Galactic bar leading to\na characteristic bimodal splitting of the UV velocity plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 08:20:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 07:49:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Jul 2016 16:48:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-04"}

When the policy is trained to process raw\nsensory inputs, such as images and depth maps, it can also acquire a strategy\nthat combines perception and control. However, effectively processing such\ncomplex inputs requires an expressive policy class, such as a large neural\nnetwork. These high-dimensional policies are difficult to train, especially\nwhen learning to control safety-critical systems. We propose PLATO, an\nalgorithm that trains complex control policies with supervised learning, using\nmodel-predictive control (MPC) to generate the supervision, hence never in need\nof running a partially trained and potentially unsafe policy. PLATO uses an\nadaptive training method to modify the behavior of MPC to gradually match the\nlearned policy in order to generate training samples at states that are likely\nto be visited by the learned policy. PLATO also maintains the MPC cost as an\nobjective to avoid highly undesirable actions that would result from strictly\nfollowing the learned policy before it has been fully trained. We prove that\nthis type of adaptive MPC expert produces supervision that leads to good\nlong-horizon performance of the resulting policy. We also empirically\ndemonstrate that MPC can still avoid dangerous on-policy actions in unexpected\nsituations during training. Our empirical results on a set of challenging\nsimulated aerial vehicle tasks demonstrate that, compared to prior methods,\nPLATO learns faster, experiences substantially fewer catastrophic failures\n(crashes) during training, and often converges to a better policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 08:50:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2016 23:58:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 18:12:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 02:20:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

Here, we consider the possibility that stars\nhosting these hybrid CONe cores might belong to a close binary system and,\neventually, become white dwarfs accreting from a non-degenerate companion at\nrates leading to a supernova explosion. We have computed the hydrodynamical\nphase of the explosion of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs harboring hybrid\ncores, assuming that the explosion starts at the center, either as a detonation\n(as may be expected in some degenerate merging scenarios) or as a deflagration\n(that afterwards transitions into a delayed detonation). We assume these hybrid\ncores are made of a central CO volume, of mass M(CO), surrounded by an ONe\nshell. We show that, in case of a pure detonation, a medium-sized CO-rich\nregion, M(CO)<0.4 Msun, results in the ejection of a small fraction of the\nmantle while leaving a massive bound remnant. Part of this remnant is made of\nthe products of the detonation, Fe-group nuclei, but they are buried in its\ninner regions, unless convection is activated during the ensuing cooling and\nshrinking phase of the remnant. In contrast, and somehow paradoxically, delayed\ndetonations do not leave remnants but for the minimum M(CO) we have explored,\nM(CO)=0.2 Msun, and even in this case the remnant is as small as 0.13 Msun. The\nejecta produced by these delayed detonations are characterized by slightly\nsmaller masses of 56Ni and substantially smaller kinetic energies than obtained\nfor a delayed detonation of a 'normal' CO white dwarf. The optical emission\nexpected from these explosions would hardly match the observational properties\nof typical Type Ia supernovae, although they make interesting candidates for\nthe subluminous class of SN2002cx-like or SNIax.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 10:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

The main idea\nis to allow variables in the query and bind the variables to values when\nevaluating the query. For query languages that bind variables only once, query\nevaluation is usually NP-complete. There are query languages that allow binding\ninside the scope of Kleene star operators, which can themselves be in the scope\nof bindings and so on.

The result is an infinite, syntactically defined hierarchy of\nexpressions. We prove that the corresponding language hierarchy is strict.\nGiven an expression in the hierarchy, we prove that it is undecidable to check\nif there is a language equivalent expression at lower levels. We prove that\nevaluating a query based on an expression at level i can be done in $\\Sigma_i$\nin the polynomial time hierarchy.

As a measure of stickiness, we investigate P(t),\nthe probability of remaining in the mushroom cap for at least time t given\nuniform initial conditions in the chaotic part of the cap. The stickiness is\nsensitively dependent on the radius of the stem r via the Diophantine\nproperties of rho = (2/\\pi) arccos r.

In\nthis paper we give a new probabilistic model which incorporates some\nmultiplicative structure and as a result captures the Graham-Ringrose\nphenomenon. We prove that if we sample such a random graph independently for\nevery prime, then almost surely (i) for infinitely many primes $p$ the clique\nnumber is $\\Omega(\\log p\\log\\log p)$, whilst (ii) for almost all primes the\nclique number is $(2+o(1))\\log p$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 12:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-03"}

Individual sailfish\n(Istiophorus platypterus) alternate attacks with other group members on their\nschooling prey (Sardinella aurita). While only 24% of attacks result in prey\ncapture, multiple prey are injured in 95% of attacks, resulting in an increase\nof injured fish in the school with the number of attacks. How quickly prey are\ncaptured is positively correlated with the level of injury of the school,\nsuggesting that hunters can benefit from other conspecifics' attacks on the\nprey. To explore this, we built a mathematical model capturing the dynamics of\nthe hunt. We show that group hunting provides major efficiency gains (prey\ncaught per unit time) for individuals in groups of up to 70 members. We also\ndemonstrate that a free riding strategy, where some individuals wait until the\nprey are sufficiently injured before attacking, is only beneficial if the cost\nof attacking is high, and only then when waiting times are short. Our findings\nprovide evidence that cooperative benefits can be realised through the\nfacilitative effects of individuals' hunting actions without spatial\ncoordination of attacks. Such \"proto-cooperation\" may be the pre-cursor to more\ncomplex group-hunting strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 12:24:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2016 09:41:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2016 08:38:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-03"}
