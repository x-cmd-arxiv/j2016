Thermal management of flexible electronics creates a demand for\nflexible materials with highly anisotropic thermal conductivity, which work as\nheat spreaders to remove excess heat in the in-plane direction and as heat\nshields to protect human skin or device components under them from heating.\nThis study proposes a self-assembled silver nanowire network with high thermal\nand electrical anisotropy with the potential to solve these challenges. The\nin-plane thermal conductivity of the network along the axial direction of\nsilver nanowires is measured as 37 W/m-K while the cross-plane thermal\nconductivity is only 0.36 W/m-K. The results of measurements of electrical and\nthermal conductivities suggest that abundant wire-wire contacts strongly impede\nthermal transport. The excellent alignment of nanowires results in the same\nanisotropy ratio of 3 for both thermal and electrical conduction in the two\nin-plane directions. The ratio remains unchanged as the temperature decrease to\n50 K, which indicates that wire-wire contacts lower the thermal and electrical\nconduction in the two directions to the same extent and their effect is\nindependent of temperature. In addition, phonon softening markedly reduces the\nDebye temperatures of the network, which are fitted from the electrical\nresistivity data. As a result of phonon thermal conduction, the Lorenz numbers\nof the film in the two directions, which are approximately the same, are larger\nthan the Sommerfeld value at room temperature and decrease as temperature\ndecreases because of small angle scattering and the reduced phonon\ncontribution. This nanowire network provides a solution to the emerging\nchallenges of thermal management of flexible electronics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 16:00:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-30"}

Our algorithm is similar to SVRG but instead of the full\ngradient, it uses a surrogate which can be efficiently computed on a small\nsubset of the input data. It achieves a linear convergence rate ---up to some\nerror level, depending on the nature of the optimization problem---and features\na trade-off between the computational complexity and the convergence rate.\nEmpirical evaluation shows that CheapSVRG performs at least competitively\ncompared to the state of the art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 16:34:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

A particular focus is put\non sub-cycle and single-cycle pulses and their utilization for coherent\ncontrol. The discussion is mostly limited to cases where the pulse duration is\nshorter than the characteristic time scales associated with the involved\nspectral features of the excitations. We work out that the pulse action amounts\nin essence to a quantum map between the quantum states of the system at an\nappropriately chosen time moment during the pulse. The influence of a\nparticular pulse shape on the post-pulse dynamics is reduced to several\nintegral parameters entering the expression for the quantum map. The validity\nrange of this reduction scheme for different strengths of the driving fields is\nestablished and discussed for particular nanostructures.

Different from most of\nthe existing work on privacy-aware surveys, our model does not assume the data\ncollector to be trustworthy. Then, an individual takes full control of its own\ndata privacy and reports only a privacy-preserving version of her data.\n  In this paper, the value of $\\epsilon$ units of privacy is measured by the\nminimum payment of all nonnegative payment mechanisms, under which an\nindividual's best response at a Nash equilibrium is to report the data with a\nprivacy level of $\\epsilon$.

Many studies in the last couples of decades have\nidentified motor primitives at the kinematic, kinetic, and electromyographic\nlevel, thus supporting modularity at different levels of organization in the\nmotor system. However, these studies relied on heterogeneous definitions of\nmotor primitives and on different algorithms for their identification. Standard\nunsupervised learning algorithms such as principal component analysis,\nindependent component analysis, and non-negative matrix factorization, or more\nadvanced techniques involving the estimation of temporal delays of the relevant\nmixture components have been applied. This plurality of algorithms has made\ndifficult to compare and interpret results obtained across different studies.\nMoreover, how the different definitions of motor primitives relate to each\nother has never been examined systematically. Here we propose a comprehensive\nframework for the definition of different types of motor primitives and a\nsingle algorithm for their identification.

In this\narticle we focus on hole-conjugate states, nu=2/3 and nu=3/5, and present a new\npicture of their edge reconstruction. For example, while the present model for\nnu=2/3 consists of a single downstream charge channel with conductance 2/3\ne^2/h and an upstream neutral mode, we show that the current is carried by two\nseparate downstream edge channels, each with conductance 1/3 e^2/h, accompanied\nby upstream neutral mode(s). We find that if the two downstream channels are\nnot equilibrated, inter-mode equilibration (via particle exchange) takes place\nover a distance of microns, with the two channels effectively behaving as a\nsingle channel. Moreover, the inter-channel equilibration is accompanied by an\nexcitation of upstream neutral modes. In turn, the counter-propagating neutral\nmodes, moving in close proximity to the charge modes, fragment into propagating\ncharges, inducing thus downstream current fluctuations with zero net current -\na novel mechanism for non-equilibrium noise.

One behavior of interest is having a power law in the degree\ndistribution.

However, their\nemergence poses an unsolved question on how to harness such a technology and\nbandwidth diversity. This paper addresses one of the simplest questions in this\nclass, namely, the issue of associating each mobile to one of those bandwidths.\nIntriguingly, this association issue is intrinsically distinct from those in\ntraditional networks. We first propose a generic stochastic geometry model\nlending itself to analyzing a wide class of association policies exploiting\nvarious information on the network topology, e.g. received pilot powers and\nfading values.

In this class of optimal association, we prove a result that the\nperformance improves as the information known about the network increases.\nSecondly, this model is used to quantify the performance of any arbitrary\nassociation policy and not just the optimal association policy.

Here we simulate the\nintensity and spatial fluctuations in Lyman Alpha ${\\rm (Ly\\alpha)}$ emission\nfrom filaments in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and discuss the prospects for\nthe next generation of space based instruments to detect the low surface\nbrightness universe at UV wavelengths. Starting with a high resolution N-body\nsimulation we obtain the dark matter density fluctuations and associate baryons\nwith the dark matter particles assuming that they follow the same spatial\ndistribution. The IGM thermal and ionization state is set by a model of the UV\nbackground and by the relevant cooling processes for a hydrogen and helium gas.\nThe ${\\rm Ly\\alpha}$ emissivity is then estimated, taking into account\nrecombination and collisional excitation processes. We find that the detection\nof these filaments through their ${\\rm Ly\\alpha}$ emission is well in the reach\nof the next generation of UV space based instruments and so it should be\nachieved in the next decade. The density field is populated with halos and\ngalaxies and their ${\\rm Ly\\alpha}$ emission is estimated.

Being one of the brightest sources in the extragalactic\nX-ray and $\\gamma$-ray sky as well as one of the nearest blazars to Earth, Mrk\n421 is an excellent source for testing the scenario of the blazar-neutrino\nconnection. Here, we model the spectral energy distribution of Mrk 421 during a\n13-day flare in 2010 with unprecedented multi-wavelength coverage, and\ncalculate the respective neutrino flux. We find a correlation between the $>1$\nPeV neutrino and photon fluxes, in all energy bands. Using typical IceCube\nthrough-going muon event samples with good angular resolution and high\nstatistics, we derive the mean event rate above 100 TeV ($\\sim0.57$ evt/yr) and\nshow that it is comparable to that expected from a four-month quiescent period\nin 2009. Due to the short duration of the flare, an accumulation of similar\nflares over several years would be necessary to produce a meaningful signal for\nIceCube. To better assess this, we apply the correlation between the neutrino\nand $\\gamma$-ray fluxes to the 6.9 yr Fermi-LAT light curve of Mrk 421. We find\nthat the mean event count above 1 PeV for the full IceCube detector livetime is\n$3.59\\pm0.60$ ($2.73\\pm0.38$) $\\nu_\\mu+\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$ with (without) major\nflares included in our analysis. This estimate exceeds, within the\nuncertainties, the $95\\%$ ($90\\%$) threshold value for the detection of one or\nmore muon (anti-)neutrinos. Meanwhile, the most conservative scenario, where no\ncorrelation of $\\gamma$-rays and neutrinos is assumed, predicts $1.60\\pm0.16$\n$\\nu_\\mu+\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu$ events. We conclude that a non-detection of high-energy\nneutrinos by IceCube would probe the neutrino/$\\gamma$-ray flux correlation\nduring major flares or/and the hadronic contribution to the blazar emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 20:00:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 21:59:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

Today it is\npossible to calculate from first principles many materials properties related\nto the electron-phonon interaction, including the critical temperature of\nconventional superconductors, the carrier mobility in semiconductors, the\ntemperature dependence of optical spectra in direct and indirect-gap\nsemiconductors, the relaxation rates of photoexcited carriers, the electron\nmass renormalization in angle-resolved photoelectron spectra, and the\nnon-adiabatic corrections to phonon dispersion relations.

The insulating phase can often be suppressed\nby quantum tuning, i.e. varying a nonthermal parameter such as chemical\ncomposi- tion or pressure, resulting in a zero-temperature quantum phase\ntransition (QPT) to a metallic state driven by quantum fluctuations, in\ncontrast to conventional phase transitions driven by thermal fluctuations.\nTheories of exotic phenomena known to occur near the Mott QPT such as quantum\ncriticality and high-temperature superconductivity often assume a second-order\nQPT, but direct experimental evidence for either first- or second-order\nbehavior at the magnetic QPT associated with the Mott transition has been\nscarce and further masked by the superconducting phase in unconventional\nsuperconductors. Most measurements of QPTs have been performed by\nvolume-integrated probes, such as neutron scattering, magnetization, and\ntransport, in which discontinuous behavior, phase separation, and spatially\ninhomogeneous responses are averaged and smeared out, leading at times to\nmisidentification as continuous second-order transitions. Here, we demonstrate\nthrough muon spin relaxation/rotation (MuSR) experiments on two archetypal Mott\ninsulating systems, composition-tuned RENiO3 (RE=rare earth element) and\npressured-tuned V2O3, that the QPT from antiferromagnetic insulator to\nparamagnetic metal is first-order: the magnetically ordered volume fraction\ndecreases to zero at the QPT, resulting in a broad region of intrinsic phase\nseparation, while the ordered magnetic moment retains its full value across the\nphase diagram until it is suddenly destroyed at the QPT. These findings call\nfor further investigation into the role of inelastic soft modes and the nature\nof dynamic spin and charge fluctuations underlying the transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 20:39:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

While it is\ncommon to ignore the displacement current in the ideal, classical\nmagnetohydrodynamic limit, when the flows become relativistic this\napproximation is less than absolutely well-justified. In such a situation, it\nis more natural to consider a positively charged fluid made up of positrons or\nprotons interacting with a negatively charged fluid made up of electrons. The\ntwo fluids interact collectively with the full set of Maxwell's equations. As a\nresult, a solution strategy for that coupled system of equations is sought and\nfound here. Our strategy extends to higher orders, providing increasing\naccuracy. Three important innovations are reported here. In our first\ninnovation, the magnetic field within each zone is reconstructed in a\ndivergence-free fashion while the electric field within each zone is\nreconstructed in a form that is consistent with Gauss' law. In our second\ninnovation, a multidimensionally upwinded strategy is presented which ensures\nthat the magnetic field can be updated via a discrete interpretation of\nFaraday's law and the electric field can be updated via a discrete\ninterpretation of the generalized Ampere's law. Our third innovation consists\nof an efficient design for several popular IMEX schemes so that they provide\nstrong coupling between the finite-volume-based fluid solver and the\nelectromagnetic fields at high order. Several accuracy analyses are presented\nshowing that our method meets its design accuracy in the MHD limit as well as\nin the limit of electromagnetic wave propagation. Several stringent test\nproblems are also presented. We also present a relativistic version of the GEM\nproblem, which shows that our algorithm can successfully adapt to challenging\nproblems in high energy astrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 20:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

However, it still remains challenging and\nfalls short of classification accuracy and efficiency. Traditional approaches\ntypically involve extracting discriminative features from the original time\nseries using dynamic time warping (DTW) or shapelet transformation, based on\nwhich an off-the-shelf classifier can be applied. These methods are ad-hoc and\nseparate the feature extraction part with the classification part, which limits\ntheir accuracy performance.

In this\nreview, effects of the electron-vibration coupling on the charge and heat\ntransport of soft nanoscopic systems are theoretically investigated in the\npresence of time-dependent perturbations, such as a forcing antenna or pumping\nterms between the leads and the nanosystem. A well established approach valid\nfor non-equilibrium adiabatic regimes is generalized to the case where external\ntime-dependent perturbations are present. Then, a number of relevant\napplications of the method are reviewed for systems composed by a quantum dot\n(or molecule) described by a single electronic level coupled to a vibrational\nmode. Before introducing time-dependent perturbations, the range of validity of\nthe adiabatic approach is discussed showing that a very good agreement with the\nresults of an exact quantum calculation is obtained in the limit of low level\noccupation. Aim of this review has been to discuss common features of different\nsoft nanosystems under external drive. The most interesting effects induced by\ntime-dependent perturbations are obtained when the external forcing is nearly\nresonant with the slow vibrational modes. Indeed, not only the external forcing\ncan enhance the electronic response, but it also induces nonlinear regimes\nwhere the interplay between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom plays\na major role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 22:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-24"}

We solve the intrinsic intractability of this\nsolution by generating observations that represent scene realizations, i.e.\ncombination samples of object hypothesis provided by the object detector, while\nmodeling the state by means of a set of constantly resampled particles.\nExperiments performed on different real world, challenging datasets confirm the\neffectiveness of the proposed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 22:55:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-24"}

In the\nconsidered SCN, small base stations (SBSs) are equipped with data storage units\nand cooperate to serve users' requests either from files cached in the storage\nor directly from the capacity-limited backhaul. The aim of the SBSs is to\ndefine a caching policy that reduces the load on the capacity-limited backhaul\nlinks. This cache control problem is formulated as a stochastic differential\ngame (SDG). In this game, each SBS takes into consideration the storage state\nof the other SBSs to decide on the fraction of content it should cache. To\nsolve this problem, the formulated SDG is reduced to an MFG by considering an\nultra-dense network of SBSs in which the existence and uniqueness of the\nmean-field equilibrium is shown to be guaranteed.

Four different versions of the wave\nfunction are defined (light-front spectator, light-front, light-front with\nscaling and non-relativistic) and used to compute the cross sections as a\nfunction of how far off the mass-shell (how virtual) is the struck constituent.\n  Results: We show that making an exact calculation of the quasi-elastic\nscattering cross section involves using the light-front spectator wave\nfunction. All of the other approaches fail to reproduce the model exact\ncalculation if the value of Bjorken $x$ differs from unity. The model is\nextended to consider an essential effect of spin to show that constituent\nnucleons cannot be treated as being on their mass shell even when taking the\nmatrix element of a `good' current.\n  Conclusions: It is necessary to develop realistic light-front spectator wave\nfunctions to meet the needs of current and planned experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 23:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

This is based on almost c--projective\ngeometry, which is the almost complex analogue of projective differential\ngeometry. The boundary at infinity is a (possibly non-integrable) CR structure.\nThe theory applies to almost Hermitean manifolds which admit a complex metric\nconnection of minimal torsion, which means that they are quasi--Kaehler in the\nsense of Gray--Hervella; in particular it applies to Kaehler and nearly Kaehler\nmanifolds. Via this canonical connection, we obtain a notion of c-projective\ncompactification for quasi--Kaehler metrics of any signature.\n  We describe an asymptotic form for metrics that is necessary and sufficient\nfor c--projective compactness. This metric form provides local examples and, in\nparticular, shows that the usual complete Kaehler metrics associated to\nsmoothly bounded, strictly pseudoconvex domains in C^n are c--projectively\ncompact. For a smooth manifold with boundary and a complete quasi-Kaehler\nmetric $g$ on the interior, we show that if its almost c--projective structure\nextends smoothly to the boundary then so does its scalar curvature. We prove\nthat $g$ is almost c--projectively compact if and only if this scalar curvature\nis non-zero on an open dense set of the boundary, in which case it is, along\nthe boundary, locally constant and hence nowhere zero there. Finally we\ndescribe the asymptotics of the curvature, showing, in particular, that the\ncanonical connection satisfies an asymptotic Einstein condition. Key to much of\nthe development is a certain real tractor calculus for almost c--projective\ngeometry, and this is developed in the article.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 01:34:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-31"}

This design allows one to measure phase shifts with\nhigh precision and linearity over the entire range of $0-360^\\circ$.

The tests were performed in the vicinity of the ferroelectric transitions\nwhere the large variations of the speed and attenuation demand a detector with\noutstanding characteristics. The described detector has a wide dynamic range\nand allows for measuring in a single run over the whole temperature range of\nthe ferroelectric transitions, rather than just in limited intervals available\npreviously. Moreover, due to the wide dynamic range of the gain measurements\nand high sensitivity this instrument was able to reveal previously unresolvable\nfeatures associated with the development of the ferroelectric transitions of\nKTN crystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 01:35:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

In financial factor models, the unknown factors\ncan be reasonably well explained by a few observable proxies, such as the\nFama-French factors. In diffusion index forecasts, identified factors are\nstrongly related to several directly measurable economic variables such as\nconsumption-wealth variable, financial ratios, and term spread. With those\ncovariates, both the factors and loadings are identifiable up to a rotation\nmatrix even only with a finite dimension. To incorporate the explanatory power\nof these covariates, we propose a smoothed principal component analysis (PCA):\n(i) regress the data onto the observed covariates, and (ii) take the principal\ncomponents of the fitted data to estimate the loadings and factors. This allows\nus to accurately estimate the percentage of both explained and unexplained\ncomponents in factors and thus to assess the explanatory power of covariates.\nWe show that both the estimated factors and loadings can be estimated with\nimproved rates of convergence compared to the benchmark method. The degree of\nimprovement depends on the strength of the signals, representing the\nexplanatory power of the covariates on the factors. The proposed estimator is\nrobust to possibly heavy-tailed distributions. We apply the model to forecast\nUS bond risk premia, and find that the observed macroeconomic characteristics\ncontain strong explanatory powers of the factors. The gain of forecast is more\nsubstantial when the characteristics are incorporated to estimate the common\nfactors than directly used for forecasts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 01:38:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 02:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

To date, the successive cancellation list (SCL)\ndecoding algorithm is the primary approach that can guarantee outstanding\nerror-correcting performance of polar codes. However, the hardware designs of\nthe original SCL decoder have large silicon area and long decoding latency.\nAlthough some recent efforts can reduce either the area or latency of SCL\ndecoders, these two metrics still cannot be optimized at the same time. This\npaper, for the first time, proposes a general log-likelihood-ratio (LLR)-based\nSCL decoding algorithm with multi-bit decision. This new algorithm, referred as\nLLR-2Kb-SCL, can determine 2K bits simultaneously for arbitrary K with the use\nof LLR messages. In addition, a reduced-data-width scheme is presented to\nreduce the critical path of the sorting block. Then, based on the proposed\nalgorithm, a VLSI architecture of the new SCL decoder is developed. Synthesis\nresults show that for an example (1024, 512) polar code with list size 4, the\nproposed LLR-2Kb-SCL decoders achieve significant reduction in both area and\nlatency as compared to prior works. As a result, the hardware efficiency of the\nproposed designs with K=2 and 3 are 2.33 times and 3.32 times of that of the\nstate-of-the-art works, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 02:48:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

Random\nconvex analysis is convex analysis over random locally convex modules. Since\nrandom locally convex modules have the more complicated topological and\nalgebraic structures than ordinary locally convex spaces, establishing random\nconvex analysis will encounter harder mathematical challenges than classical\nconvex analysis so that there are still a lot of fundamentally important\nunsolved problems in random convex analysis. This paper is devoted to solving\nsome important theoretic problems. First, we establish the inferior limit\nbehavior of a proper lower semicontinuous $L^0$--convex function on a random\nlocally convex module endowed with the locally $L^0$--convex topology, which\nmakes perfect the Fenchel--Moreau duality theorem for such functions. Then, we\ninvestigate the relations among continuity, locally $L^0$--Lipschitzian\ncontinuity and almost surely sequent continuity of a proper $L^0$--convex\nfunction. And then, we establish the elegant relationships among\nsubdifferentiability, G\\^ateaux--differentiability and\nFr\\'ech\\'et--differentiability for a proper $L^0$--convex function defined on\nrandom normed modules. At last, based on the Ekeland's variational principle\nfor a proper lower semicontinuous $\\bar{L}^0$--valued function, we show that\n$\\varepsilon$--subdifferentials can be approximated by subdifferentials.

We\nfound that most of these conditions are thermodynamically equivalent,\nespecially at small baryon chemical potential. We propose that further crucial\nconsistency tests should be performed at low energies. The fireball\nthermodynamics is another way of guessing conditions describing the chemical\nfreezeout parameters extracted from high-energy experiments. We endorse the\npossibility that the various chemical freezeout conditions should be\ninterpreted as different aspects of one universal condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 08:03:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-24"}

Our goal is to accurately predict the\nprogress of the disease in individual patients. As very few measurements are\navailable for each patient, it is difficult to produce good predictors for\nindividuals. A recently proposed clustering-based method enhances the power of\nprediction using patient data with similar spatiotemporal patterns. Each\npatient is categorized into a cluster of patients, and a predictive model is\nconstructed using all of the data in the class. Predictions are highly\ndependent on the quality of clustering, but it is difficult to identify the\nbest clustering method. Thus, we propose a method for aggregating cluster-based\npredictors to obtain better prediction accuracy than from a single\ncluster-based prediction. Further, the method shows very high performances by\nhierarchically aggregating experts generated from several cluster-based\nmethods. We use real datasets to demonstrate that our method performs\nsignificantly better than conventional clustering-based and patient-wise\nregression methods, because the hierarchical aggregating strategy has a\nmechanism whereby good predictors in a small community can thrive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 09:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-24"}

The\npurpose of the applied technique is to find imperfect instances of spots within\na certain class of circles by applying a voting procedure on the cDNA\nmicroarray images for spots localization, addressing and characterizing the\npixels of each spot into foreground pixels and background simultaneously.\nIntensive experiments on the University of North Carolina (UNC) microarray\ndatabase indicate that the proposed method is superior to the K-means method\nand the Support vector machine (SVM).

Moreover, the published\nsimulation results fail to predict the post-solidification pool shape without\nadapting non-physical values for input parameters, suggesting the neglect of\nsignificant physics in the models employed. The experimentally observed violent\nflow surface instabilities, scaling analyses for the occurrence of turbulence\nin Marangoni driven flows, and the fact that in simulations transport\ncoefficients generally have to be increased by an order of magnitude to match\nexperimentally observed pool shapes, suggest the common assumption of laminar\nflow in the pool may not hold, and that the flow is actually turbulent. Here,\nwe use direct numerical simulations (DNS) to investigate the role of turbulence\nin laser melting of a steel alloy with surface active elements. Our results\nreveal the presence of two competing vortices driven by thermocapillary forces\ntowards a local surface tension maximum. The jet away from this location at the\nfree surface, separating the two vortices, is found to be unstable and highly\noscillatory, indeed leading to turbulence-like flow in the pool. The resulting\nadditional heat transport, however, is insufficient to account for the observed\ndifferences in pool shapes between experiment and simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 10:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-24"}

Currently, the sample of molecular clouds where\n$^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratios have been measured is small and has to be enlarged in\norder to allow statistically significant studies. In particular, the N$_2$H$^+$\nmolecule currently shows the largest spread of $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratios in\nhigh-mass star forming regions. However, the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio in\nN$_2$H$^+$ was obtained in only two low-mass star forming regions (L1544 and\nB1b). The current work extends this sample to a third dark cloud. We targeted\nthe 16293E prestellar core, where the N$^{15}$NH$^+$ $J$=1-0 line was detected.\nUsing a model previously developed for the physical structure of the source, we\nsolved the molecular excitation with a non-local radiative transfer code.

As a first step of the analysis, the\nN$_2$H$^+$ abundance profile was constrained by reproducing the N$_2$H$^+$\n$J$=1-0 and 3-2 maps. A scaling factor was then applied to this profile to\nmatch the N$^{15}$NH$^+$ $J$=1-0 spectrum. We derive a column density ratio\nN$_2$H$^+$ / N$^{15}$NH$^+$ = $330^{+170}_{-100}$.

The interest in these random variables is\ndue to the fact that the configuration model, conditioned on being simple, is a\nuniform random graph with prescribed degrees. Simplicity corresponds to the\nabsence of self-loops and multiple edges. We show that the number of self-loops\nand multiple edges converges in distribution to two independent Poisson random\nvariables when the second moment of the empirical degree distribution\nconverges. We also provide an estimate on the total variation distance between\nthe number of self-loops and multiple edges and the Poisson limit of their sum.\nThis revisits previous works of Bollob\\'as, of Janson, of Wormald and others.\nThe error estimates also imply sharp asymptotics for the number of simple\ngraphs with prescribed degrees. The error estimates follow from an application\nof Stein's method for Poisson convergence, which is a novel method for this\nproblem. The asymptotic independence of self-loops and multiple edges follows\nfrom a Poisson version of the Cram\\'er-Wold device using thinning, which is of\nindependent interest. When the degree distribution has infinite second moment,\nour general results break down. We can, however, prove a central limit theorem\nfor the number of self-loops, and for the multiple edges between vertices of\ndegrees much smaller than the square root of the size of the graph, or when we\ntruncate the degrees similarly.

In this work, we present foundations\nof a covariant theory of light propagation in a medium by considering a light\nwave simultaneously with the dynamics of the medium atoms driven by optoelastic\nforces between the induced dipoles and the electromagnetic field.

In the mass-polariton (MP)\nquasiparticle approach, we consider the light pulse as a coupled state between\nthe photon and matter, isolated from the rest of the medium. The momentum and\nthe transferred mass of MP follow unambiguously from the Lorentz invariance and\nthe fundamental conservation laws of nature.

The random graph model favours reactivity for\nmonomers that are positioned close in the network topology, and disfavours\nreactivity for those that are obscured by the surrounding. The phenomena of\nconversion-dependant reaction rates, gelation, and micro-gelation are thus\nnaturally predicted by the model and do not have to be imposed. Resulting\nnon-homogeneous network topologies are analysed to extract such descriptors as:\nsize distribution, crosslink distances, and gel-point conversion. Furthermore,\nnew to the molecular simulation community descriptors are invented. These\ndescriptors are especially useful for understanding evolution of pure gel,\namongst them: cluster coefficient, network modularity, cluster size\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 13:12:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-21"}
