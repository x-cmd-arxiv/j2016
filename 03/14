To\nreach these 5G requirements the industry is looking at new spectrum bands in\nthe range up to 100 GHz where there is spectrum availability for wide bandwidth\nchannels. For the development of new 5G systems to operate in bands up to 100\nGHz there is a need for accurate radio propagation models which are not\naddressed by existing channel models developed for bands below 6 GHz. This\npaper presents a preliminary overview of the 5G channel models for bands up to\n100 GHz in indoor offices and shopping malls, derived from extensive\nmeasurements across a multitude of bands. These studies have found some\nextensibility of the existing 3GPP models to the higher frequency bands up to\n100 GHz. The measurements indicate that the smaller wavelengths introduce an\nincreased sensitivity of the propagation models to the scale of the environment\nand show some frequency dependence of the path loss as well as increased\noccurrence of blockage. Further, the penetration loss is highly dependent on\nthe material and tends to increase with frequency. The small-scale\ncharacteristics of the channel such as delay spread and angular spread and the\nmultipath richness is somewhat similar over the frequency range, which is\nencouraging for extending the existing 3GPP models to the wider frequency\nrange. Further work will be carried out to complete these models, but this\npaper presents the first steps for an initial basis for the model development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2016 21:38:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Physical realizations of multidimensional solitons in atomic\nBose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and nonlinear optics are briefly discussed\ntoo. Unlike 1D solitons, which are typically stable, 2D and 3D ones are\nvulnerable to instabilities induced by the occurrence of the critical and\nsupercritical collapse, respectively, in the same 2D and 3D models that give\nrise to the solitons. Vortex solitons are subject to a still stronger splitting\ninstability. For this reason, a central problem is search for physical settings\nin which 2D and 3D solitons may be stabilized. The brief review addresses one\nwell-established topic, viz., the stabilization of the 3D and 2D states, with S\n= 0 and 1, trapped in harmonic-oscillator (HO) potentials, and another topic\nwhich was developed very recently: the stabilization of 2D and 3D free-space\nsolitons, which juxtapose components with S = 0 and (+/-)1 (semi-vortices and\nmixed modes), in a binary system with the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) between its\ncomponents.

By\nselection, IRDCs represent only a fraction of the Galactic clouds capable of\nforming massive stars and star clusters. Due to their low dust temperatures,\nIRDCs are bright in the far-IR and millimeter and thus, observations at these\nwavelengths have the potential to provide a complete sample of star-forming\nmassive clouds across the Galaxy. Our aim is to identify the clouds at the\ninitial conditions of massive star formation across the Galaxy and compare\ntheir physical properties as a function of their Galactic location. We have\nexamined the physical properties of a homogeneous galactic cold core sample\nobtained with the Planck satellite across the Galactic Plane.

As a defining\nproperty, our method represents both the images and learned classifiers using\nbinary hash codes, which are simultaneously learned from the training data.\nClassifying an image thereby reduces to computing the Hamming distance between\nthe binary codes of the image and classifiers and selecting the class with\nminimal Hamming distance. Conventionally, compact hash codes are primarily used\nfor accelerating image search. Our work is first of its kind to represent\nclassifiers using binary codes. Specifically, we formulate multi-class image\nclassification as an optimization problem over binary variables. The\noptimization alternatively proceeds over the binary classifiers and image hash\ncodes. Profiting from the special property of binary codes, we show that the\nsub-problems can be efficiently solved through either a binary quadratic\nprogram (BQP) or linear program. In particular, for attacking the BQP problem,\nwe propose a novel bit-flipping procedure which enjoys high efficacy and local\noptimality guarantee. Our formulation supports a large family of empirical loss\nfunctions and is here instantiated by exponential / hinge losses. Comprehensive\nevaluations are conducted on several representative image benchmarks. The\nexperiments consistently observe reduced complexities of model training and\ndeployment, without sacrifice of accuracies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 03:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-15"}

Originally developed for meteorology, especially weather\nforecasting, DA is now an accepted technique in various scientific fields. One\nkey issue that remains controversial is the implementation of DA in massive\nsimulation models under limited computation time and resources. In this paper,\nwe propose an adjoint-based DA method for massive autonomous models that\nproduces optimum estimates and their uncertainties within practical computation\ntime and resource constraints. The uncertainties are given as several diagonal\ncomponents of an inverse Hessian matrix, which is the covariance matrix of a\nnormal distribution that approximates the target posterior probability density\nfunction in the neighborhood of the optimum. Conventional algorithms for\nderiving the inverse Hessian matrix require $O(CN^2+N^3)$ computations and\n$O(N^2)$ memory, where $N$ is the number of degrees of freedom of a given\nautonomous system and $C$ is the number of computations needed to simulate time\nseries of suitable length. The proposed method using a second-order adjoint\nmethod allows us to directly evaluate the diagonal components of the inverse\nHessian matrix without computing all of its components. This drastically\nreduces the number of computations to $O(C)$ and the amount of memory to $O(N)$\nfor each diagonal component. The proposed method is validated through numerical\ntests using a massive two-dimensional Kobayashi's phase-field model. We confirm\nthat the proposed method correctly reproduces the parameter and initial state\nassumed in advance, and successfully evaluates the uncertainty of the\nparameter. Such information regarding uncertainty is valuable, as it can be\nused to optimize the design of experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 08:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-18"}

The origin of blazar variability, seen from radio up to gamma rays,\nis still a heavily debated matter and broadband flares offer a unique testbed\ntowards a better understanding of these extreme objects. Such an energetic\noutburst was detected by Fermi/LAT in 2008 from the blazar PKS 1502+106. The\noutburst was observed from gamma rays down to radio frequencies.\n  Aims. Through the delay between flare maxima at different radio frequencies,\nwe study the frequency-dependent position of the unit-opacity surface and infer\nits absolute position with respect to the jet base.

The radio flare of PKS 1502+106 is studied through single-dish flux\ndensity measurements at 12 frequencies in the range 2.64 to 226.5 GHz. To\nquantify it, we employ both a Gaussian process regression and a discrete\ncross-correlation function analysis.\n  Results. We find that the light curve parameters (flare amplitude and\ncross-band delays) show a power-law dependence on frequency. Delays decrease\nwith frequency, and the flare amplitudes increase up to about 43 GHz and then\ndecay. This behavior is consistent with a shock propagating downstream the jet.\nThe self-absorbed radio cores are located between about 10 and 4 pc from the\njet base and their magnetic field strengths range between 14 and 176 mG, at the\nfrequencies 2.64 to 86.24 GHz.

Combining the lensing effect for lenses at three\ndifferent redshifts and three different source redshifts, a relation between\nshear ratios is derived which must be valid independent of a multiplicative\nbias. We propose these generalized shear-ratio tests as a diagnostic for the\npresence of systematics in upcoming weak lensing surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 12:09:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

Each\nagent has a battery -- a power source allowing it to move along network edges.\nAn agent uses its battery proportionally to the distance traveled. We consider\ntwo tasks : convergecast, in which at the beginning, each agent has some\ninitial piece of information, and information of all agents has to be collected\nby some agent; and broadcast in which information of one specified agent has to\nbe made available to all other agents. In both tasks, the agents exchange the\ncurrently possessed information when they meet. The objective of this paper is\nto investigate what is the minimal value of power, initially available to all\nagents, so that convergecast or broadcast can be achieved. We study this\nquestion in the centralized and the distributed settings. In the centralized\nsetting, there is a central monitor that schedules the moves of all agents. In\nthe distributed setting every agent has to perform an algorithm being unaware\nof the network. In the centralized setting, we give a linear-time algorithm to\ncompute the optimal battery power and the strategy using it, both for\nconvergecast and for broadcast, when agents are on the line. We also show that\nfinding the optimal battery power for convergecast or for broadcast is NP-hard\nfor the class of trees. On the other hand, we give a polynomial algorithm that\nfinds a 2-approximation for convergecast and a 4-approximation for broadcast,\nfor arbitrary graphs. In the distributed setting, we give a 2-competitive\nalgorithm for convergecast in trees and a 4-competitive algorithm for broadcast\nin trees. The competitive ratio of 2 is proved to be the best for the problem\nof convergecast, even if we only consider line networks. Indeed, we show that\nthere is no (2 -- $\\epsilon$)-competitive algorithm for convergecast or for\nbroadcast in the class of lines, for any $\\epsilon$ \\textgreater{} 0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 12:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-15"}

One example is the reaction between OH and CH3OH, which has been\nrecently found to be accelerated at low temperatures yielding CH3O as main\nproduct. This finding opened the question of whether the CH3O observed in the\ndense core Barnard 1b could be formed by the gas-phase reaction of CH3OH and\nOH. Several chemical models including this reaction and grain-surface processes\nhave been developed to explain the observed abundance of CH$_3$O with little\nsuccess. Here we report for the first time rate coefficients for the gas-phase\nreaction of OH and CH3OH down to a temperature of 22 K, very close to those in\ncold interstellar clouds. Two independent experimental set-ups based on the\nsupersonic gas expansion technique coupled to the pulsed laser photolysis-laser\ninduced fluorescence technique were used to determine rate coefficients in the\ntemperature range 22-64 K. The temperature dependence obtained in this work can\nbe expressed as k(22-64 K) = (3.6+/-0.1)e-12 (T/ 300)^(-1.0+/-0.2) cm3\nmolecule-1 s-1. Implementing this expression in a chemical model of a cold\ndense cloud results in CH3O/CH3OH abundance ratios similar or slightly lower\nthan the value of 3e-3 observed in Barnard 1b. This finding confirms that the\ngas-phase reaction between OH and CH3OH is an important contributor to the\nformation of interstellar CH3O. The role of grain-surface processes in the\nformation of CH3O, although it cannot be fully neglected, remains\ncontroversial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 12:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

The theory\ndescribes the liquid-crystalline phases with spatial symmetries in between a\nquantum crystalline solid and an isotropic superfluid: quantum nematics and\nsmectics. It is based on an Abelian-Higgs-type duality mapping of phonons onto\ngauge bosons (\"stress photons\"), which encode for the capacity of the crystal\nto propagate stresses. Dislocations and disclinations, the topological defects\nof the crystal, are sources for the gauge fields and the melting of the crystal\ncan be understood as the proliferation (condensation) of these defects, giving\nrise to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism on the dual side. For the liquid crystal\nphases, the shear sector of the gauge bosons becomes massive signaling that\nshear rigidity is lost. Resting on symmetry principles, we derive the\nphenomenological imaginary time actions of quantum nematics and smectics and\nanalyze the full spectrum of collective modes. The quantum nematic is a\nsuperfluid having a true rotational Goldstone mode due to rotational symmetry\nbreaking, and the origin of this 'deconfined' mode is traced back to the\ncrystalline phase. The two-dimensional quantum smectic turns out to be a\ndizzyingly anisotropic phase with the collective modes interpolating between\nthe solid and nematic in a non-trivial way. We also consider electrically\ncharged bosonic crystals and liquid crystals, and carefully analyze the\nelectromagnetic response of the quantum liquid crystal phases. In particular,\nthe quantum nematic is a real superconductor and shows the Meissner effect.\nTheir special properties inherited from spatial symmetry breaking show up\nmostly at finite momentum, and should be accessible by momentum-sensitive\nspectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 13:21:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2017 01:32:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

Contrary to the existing methods, we propose a\nvideo deblurring algorithm that can deal with general blurs inherent in dynamic\nscenes. To handle general and locally varying blurs caused by various sources,\nsuch as moving objects, camera shake, depth variation, and defocus, we estimate\npixel-wise non-uniform blur kernels. We infer bidirectional optical flows to\nhandle motion blurs, and also estimate Gaussian blur maps to remove optical\nblur from defocus in our new blur model. Therefore, we propose a single energy\nmodel that jointly estimates optical flows, defocus blur maps and latent\nframes. We also provide a framework and efficient solvers to minimize the\nproposed energy model. By optimizing the energy model, we achieve significant\nimprovements in removing general blurs, estimating optical flows, and extending\ndepth-of-field in blurry frames.

Although time-varying signals\nare abundant in nature, in many practical scenarios the information of interest\nresides in more irregular graph domains. This lack of regularity hampers the\ngeneralization of the classical notion of stationarity to graph signals. The\ncontribution in this paper is twofold. Firstly, we propose a definition of weak\nstationarity for random graph signals that takes into account the structure of\nthe graph where the random process takes place, while inheriting many of the\nmeaningful properties of the classical definition in the time domain. Our\ndefinition requires that stationary graph processes can be modeled as the\noutput of a linear graph filter applied to a white input. We will show that\nthis is equivalent to requiring the correlation matrix to be diagonalized by\nthe graph Fourier transform. Secondly, we analyze the properties of the power\nspectral density and propose a number of methods to estimate it. We start with\nnonparametric approaches, including periodograms, window-based average\nperiodograms, and filter banks. We then shift the focus to parametric\napproaches, discussing the estimation of moving-average (MA), autoregressive\n(AR) and ARMA processes. Finally, we illustrate the power spectral density\nestimation in synthetic and real-world graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 04:01:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Aug 2017 00:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

We demonstrate\nthat when BKT is extended to allow it more flexibility in modeling statistical\nregularities---using extensions previously proposed in the literature---BKT\nachieves a level of performance indistinguishable from that of DKT. We argue\nthat while DKT is a powerful, useful, general-purpose framework for modeling\nstudent learning, its gains do not come from the discovery of novel\nrepresentations---the fundamental advantage of deep learning. To answer the\nquestion posed in our title, knowledge tracing may be a domain that does not\nrequire `depth'; shallow models like BKT can perform just as well and offer us\ngreater interpretability and explanatory power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 04:20:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 04:51:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}
