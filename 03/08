The goal of the present\nstudy is to model separately the emission from the star forming (SF) component\nand the emission from the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) in the nearby\nspiral galaxy M33. We decomposed the observed SED of M33 into its SF and\ndiffuse components. Mid-infrared (MIR) and far-infrared (FIR) fluxes were\nextracted from Spitzer and Herschel data. At submm and mm wavelengths, we used\nground-based observations from APEX to measure the emission from the SF\ncomponent and data from the Planck space telescope to estimate the diffuse\nemission. Both components were separately fitted using radiation transfer\nmodels based on standard dust properties and a realistic geometry. Both modeled\nSEDs were combined to build the global SED of M33. In addition, the radiation\nfield necessary to power the dust emission in our modeling was compared with\nobservations from GALEX, Sloan, and Spitzer. Our modeling is able to reproduce\nthe observations at MIR and FIR wavelengths, but we found a strong excess of\nemission at submm and mm wavelengths, where the model expectations severely\nunderestimate the LABOCA and Planck fluxes. We also found that the ultraviolet\n(UV) radiation escaping the galaxy is 70% higher than the model predictions. We\ndetermined a gas-to-dust mass ratio Gdust~100, significantly lower than the\nvalue expected from the sub-solar metallicity of M33. We discussed different\nhypotheses to explain the discrepancies found in our study (i.e., excess of\nemission at submm and mm wavelengths, deficit of UV attenuation, and abnormally\nlow value of Gdust), concluding that different dust properties in M33 is the\nmost plausible explanation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 16:03:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}

The main purpose of this paper is to derive the\ngoverning equations for a current-controlled piezo-electric beam and to\ninvestigate stabilizability. Besides the consideration of current control,\nthere are several new aspects to the model here. Most significantly, magnetic\neffects are included. For the electromagnetic part of the model, electrical\npotential and magnetic vector potential are chosen to be quadratic-through\nthickness to include the induced effects of the electromagnetic field. Two sets\nof decoupled system of partial differential equations are obtained; one for\nstretching motion and another one for bending motion. Hamilton's principle is\nused to derive a boundary value problem that models a single piezo-electric\nbeam actuated by a charge (or current) source at the electrodes. Current or\ncharge controllers at the electrodes can only control the stretching motion.\nAttention is therefore focused on control of the stretching equations in this\npaper. It is shown that the Lagrangian of the beam is invariant under certain\ntransformations. A Coulomb-type gauge condition which is widely used in the\nelectromagnetic theory is used here.

This is of particular importance in methods based on estimation\nof kernel mean embeddings of probability measures. For characteristic kernels,\nwhich include most commonly used ones, the kernel mean embedding uniquely\ndetermines its probability measure, so it can be used to design a powerful\nstatistical testing framework, which includes nonparametric two-sample and\nindependence tests. In practice, however, the performance of these tests can be\nvery sensitive to the choice of kernel and its lengthscale parameters. To\naddress this central issue, we propose a new probabilistic model for kernel\nmean embeddings, the Bayesian Kernel Embedding model, combining a Gaussian\nprocess prior over the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space containing the mean\nembedding with a conjugate likelihood function, thus yielding a closed form\nposterior over the mean embedding. The posterior mean of our model is closely\nrelated to recently proposed shrinkage estimators for kernel mean embeddings,\nwhile the posterior uncertainty is a new, interesting feature with various\npossible applications. Critically for the purposes of kernel learning, our\nmodel gives a simple, closed form marginal pseudolikelihood of the observed\ndata given the kernel hyperparameters. This marginal pseudolikelihood can\neither be optimized to inform the hyperparameter choice or fully Bayesian\ninference can be used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 17:16:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2016 10:08:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-03"}

To demonstrate this fact we generate scattered\ncosmological data both at the level of $w(z)$ and the luminosity distance\n$D_L(z)$ based on either thawing or freezing quintessence models and fit them\nusing parametrizations of convex and of concave type.

Repeated observations through\n2016 have not detected radio pulsations again. The torque on the neutron star,\nas inferred from its rotation frequency derivative f-dot, decreased in an\nunsteady manner by a factor of 3 in the first year of radio monitoring. In\ncontrast, during its final year as a detectable radio source, the torque\ndecreased steadily by only 9%. The period-averaged flux density, after\ndecreasing by a factor of 20 during the first 10 months of radio monitoring,\nremained steady in the next 22 months, at an average of 0.7+/-0.3 mJy at 1.4\nGHz, while still showing day-to-day fluctuations by factors of a few.

Using computer\nsimulations, we demonstrate in this work that potentials with a local minimum\nand a repulsive tail, not belonging to either of the known types, are also\ncapable of generating clusters. A detailed comparative analysis shows that the\nnew type of cluster-forming potential serves as a bridge between the other two.\nThe new clusters are expanded in shape and their assembly is driven by entropy,\nlike in the purely repulsive systems but only at low density. At high density,\nclusters are collapsed and stabilized by energy, in common with the systems\nwith competing attractive and repulsive interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 17:52:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-08"}

In cases where the\nfeature spaces can be structured as Riemannian manifolds, the corresponding\nrepresentations become trajectories on manifolds. Analysis of these\ntrajectories is challenging due to non-linearity of underlying spaces and\nhigh-dimensionality of trajectories. In vision problems, given the nature of\nphysical systems involved, these phenomena are better characterized on a\nlow-dimensional manifold compared to the space of Riemannian trajectories. For\ninstance, if one does not impose physical constraints of the human body, in\ndata involving human action analysis, the resulting representation space will\nhave highly redundant features. Learning an effective, low-dimensional\nembedding for action representations will have a huge impact in the areas of\nsearch and retrieval, visualization, learning, and recognition. The difficulty\nlies in inherent non-linearity of the domain and temporal variability of\nactions that can distort any traditional metric between trajectories. To\novercome these issues, we use the framework based on transported square-root\nvelocity fields (TSRVF); this framework has several desirable properties,\nincluding a rate-invariant metric and vector space representations. We propose\nto learn an embedding such that each action trajectory is mapped to a single\npoint in a low-dimensional Euclidean space, and the trajectories that differ\nonly in temporal rates map to the same point. We utilize the TSRVF\nrepresentation, and accompanying statistical summaries of Riemannian\ntrajectories, to extend existing coding methods such as PCA, KSVD and Label\nConsistent KSVD to Riemannian trajectories or more generally to Riemannian\nfunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 18:53:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Our survey easily detects resolved\nmain-sequence companions as faint as spectral type K\\null. Thus the fact that\nthe two most probable companions (those of FF~Aql and RV~Sco) are earlier than\ntype K is not simply a function of the detection limit. We find no physical\ncompanions having separations larger than 4,000~AU in the X-ray survey. Two\nCepheids are exceptions in that they do have young companions at significantly\nlarger separations ($\\delta$~Cep and S~Nor), but both belong to a cluster or a\nloose association, so our working model is that they are not gravitationally\nbound binary members, but rather cluster/association members.

In the same paper, Teichm\\\"uller\nintroduced the so-called universal Teichm\\\"uller curve -- a space over\nTeichm\\\"uller space where the fiber above each point is a Riemann surface\nrepresenting that point. In fact, Teichm\\\"uller proved the existence of the\nTeichm\\\"uller curve as a space of Riemann surfaces parametrized by an analytic\nspace, with an existence and uniqueness theorem establishing this analytic\nstructure. This result was later reformulated and proved by Grothendieck in a\nseries of ten lectures he gave at Cartan's seminar in 1960-1961. In his\napproach , Grothendieck replaced Teichm\\\"uller's explicit parameters by a\ngeneral construction of fiber bundles whose base is an arbitrary analytic\nspace. This work on Teichm\\\"uller space led him to recast the bases of analytic\ngeometry using the language of categories and functors.

Some properties of linear sets are\nexpressed in terms of the projective line over the ring $E$.

This leads among\nother things to a characterization of the linear sets of pseudoregulus type. It\nis proved that a scattered linear set $L$ related to $T\\in\\mathrm{PG}(1,E)$ is\nof pseudoregulus type if and only if there exists a projectivity $\\varphi$ of\n$\\mathrm{PG}(1,E)$ such that $L_T^\\varphi=L'_T$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 19:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-08"}

To help clarify this dependency, we numerically simulate the\neffects of a batch stirring device on a 2D incompressible Newtonian fluid in\nthe laminar regime.

Here we show that the spin\npolarization density of a Majorana zero mode, computed as an average of the\nspin operator over its wave function, vanishes everywhere. A single\nnon-degenerate Majorana zero mode, therefore, does not couple to an applied\nmagnetic field, except via hybridization with higher energy excited states (if\npresent), which may perturb its wave function. If `spin' is defined by\nconsidering only the particle components of the wave function, as has been done\nin some recent works, Majorana zero modes do have a non-zero spatial profile of\nthis quantity, measurable in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments.\nHowever, if such a quantity is measured in spin-resolved tunneling experiments\n(without spatial resolution), we show that it cannot be used as a unique\nsignature of Majorana zero modes in the topologically non-trivial\nsuperconducting phase. As a byproduct, we show that in spatially inhomogeneous\nsystems, accidental zero energy modes, which for all practical purposes behave\nas Majorana zero modes (including giving rise to a zero bias conductance peak\nof height 2e^2/h), can appear with increasing magnetic field even in the\nabsence of a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT). But only after gap\nclosing and the associated TQPT, the modes are localized near the system edges,\nresulting in the maximum topological protection. In the light of these\nconsiderations, demonstrating the nonlocal character of the\ntopologically-protected Majorana pair and its emergence {\\em after} the systems\nundergo a TQPT, become critical tasks for the ongoing experimental search for\nMajorana bound states in condensed matter systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 20:58:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-17"}

The idea is to\nidentify approximate symmetries supported on thin strips through the bulk that\nbehave as string operators associated to an anyon model. We can express these\nribbon operators in matrix product form and define a cost function that allows\nus to efficiently optimize over this ansatz class. We test this method on spin\nmodels with abelian topological order by finding ribbon operators for\n$\\mathbb{Z}_d$ quantum double models with local fields and Ising-like terms. In\naddition, we identify ribbons in the abelian phase of Kitaev's honeycomb model\nwhich serve as the logical operators of the encoded qubit for the quantum\nerror-correcting code. We further identify the topologically encoded qubit in\nthe quantum compass model, and show that despite this qubit, the model does not\nsupport topological order. Finally, we discuss how the method supports\ngeneralizations for detecting nonabelian topological order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 21:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2016 23:34:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 01:26:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-16"}

Using a set of\nMonte Carlo cluster simulations with different concentrations and binary\nfractions, we investigate the effect of unresolved binaries on proper-motion\ndispersion profiles, treating the simulations like HST proper-motion samples.\nSince globular clusters evolve towards a state of partial energy equipartition,\nmore massive stars lose energy and decrease their velocity dispersion. As a\nconsequence, on average, binaries have a lower velocity dispersion, since they\nare more massive kinematic tracers. We show that, in the case of clusters with\nhigh binary fraction (initial binary fraction of 50%) and high concentration\n(i.e., closer to energy equipartition), unresolved binaries introduce a\ncolor-dependent bias in the velocity dispersion of main-sequence stars of the\norder of 0.1-0.3 km s$^{-1}$ (corresponding to $1-6$% of the velocity\ndispersion), with the reddest stars having a lower velocity dispersion, due to\nthe higher fraction of contaminating binaries. This bias depends on the ability\nto distinguish binaries from single stars, on the details of the\ncolor-magnitude diagram and the photometric errors. We apply our analysis to\nthe HSTPROMO data set of NGC 7078 (M15) and show that no effect ascribable to\nbinaries is observed, consistent with the low binary fraction of the cluster.\nOur work indicates that binaries do not significantly bias proper-motion\nvelocity-dispersion profiles, but should be taken into account in the error\nbudget of kinematic analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 21:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

The surface\nDirac states become gapped everywhere on the surface, but chiral edge states\nremain on the edges. In an applied current, the edge states produce a quantized\nHall resistance that equals the Chern number C = +1 or -1 (in natural units),\neven in zero magnetic field. This quantum anomalous Hall effect was observed by\nChang et al. With reversal of the magnetic field, the system is trapped in a\nmetastable state because of magnetic anisotropy. Here we investigate how the\nsystem escapes the metastable state at low temperatures (10-200 mK). When the\ndissipation (measured by the longitudinal resistance) is ultralow, we find that\nthe system escapes by making a few, very rapid transitions, as detected by\nlarge jumps in the Hall and longitudinal resistances. Using the field at which\nthe initial jump occurs to estimate the escape rate, we find that raising the\ntemperature strongly suppresses the rate. From a detailed map of the resistance\nvs. gate voltage and temperature, we show that dissipation strongly affects the\nescape rate. We compare the observations with dissipative quantum tunneling\npredictions. In the ultralow dissipation regime, there exist two temperature\nscales T1 = 70 mK and T2 = 145 mK between which jumps can be observed. The\njumps display a spatial correlation that extends over a large fraction of the\nsample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 21:55:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-02"}

Our aim is\nto use asteroseismology to consistently measure the extent of convective cores\nin a sample of main-sequence stars whose masses lie around the mass-limit for\nhaving a convective core. We first test and validate a seismic diagnostic that\nwas proposed to probe in a model-dependent way the extent of convective cores\nusing the so-called $r_{010}$ ratios, which are built with $l=0$ and $l=1$\nmodes. We apply this procedure to 24 low-mass stars chosen among Kepler targets\nto optimize the efficiency of this diagnostic. For this purpose, we compute\ngrids of stellar models with both the CESAM2k and MESA evolution codes, where\nthe extensions of convective cores are modeled either by an instantaneous\nmixing or as a diffusion process. Among the selected targets, we are able to\nunambiguously detect convective cores in eight stars and we obtain seismic\nmeasurements of the extent of the mixed core in these targets with a good\nagreement between the CESAM2k and MESA codes. By performing optimizations using\nthe Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, we then obtain estimates of the amount of\nextra-mixing beyond the core that is required in CESAM2k to reproduce seismic\nobservations for these eight stars and we show that this can be used to propose\na calibration of this quantity. This calibration depends on the prescription\nchosen for the extra-mixing, but we find that it should be valid also for the\ncode MESA, provided the same prescription is used. This study constitutes a\nfirst step towards the calibration of the extension of convective cores in\nlow-mass stars, which will help reduce the uncertainties on the ages of these\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 22:49:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

The three types of\nintercalates for the iron chalcogenides can be placed in three categories: 1.)\nalkali and alkaline earth cations intercalated through the liquid ammonia\ntechnique; 2.) cations intercalated with organic amines such as\nethylenediamine; and 3.) layered hydroxides intercalated during hydrothermal\nconditions. A recurring theme in these studies is the role of the intercalated\nguest in electron doping the chalcogenide host and in enhancing the\ntwo-dimensionality of the electronic structure by spacing the FeSe layers\napart. We end this review discussing possible new avenues in the intercalation\nchemistry of transition metal monochalcogenides, and the promise of these\nmaterials as a unique set of new inorganic two-dimensional systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2016 22:53:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-23"}

In this problem, given a directed\ngraph, each vertex represents a user with a need of information, and the\nneighborhood of each vertex represents the side information availability to\nthat user. The aim is to find an encoding to minimum number of bits (optimal\nrate) that, when broadcasted, will be sufficient to the need of every user. Not\nonly the optimal rate is intractable, but it is also very hard to characterize\nwith some other well-studied graph parameter or with a simpler formulation,\nsuch as a linear program.

The ground\nstate of this model is found to be ferromagnetic (FM) semi-metal.

Indeed, our VCA calculations find that the\nparamagnetic (PM) state dominates the finite temperature phase diagram. More\nsurprisingly, we find that massless Dirac quasiparticles with the linear energy\ndispersion emerge at the Fermi energy upon introducing the electron correlation\n$U$ at the impurity sites in the PM phase. The Dirac Fermi velocity is found to\nbe highly correlated to the quasiparticle weight of the emergent massless Dirac\nquasiparticles at the Fermi energy and monotonically increases with $U$.

This is previously known for RAAG's with\nfinite outer automorphism groups. In this paper, we identify two classes of\nRAAG's, where their outer automorphism groups are allowed to contain adjacent\ntransvections and partial conjugations, hence infinite. If $G$ belongs to one\nof these classes, then any other RAAG $G'$ is quasi-isometric to $G$ if and\nonly if $G'$ is commensurable to $G$. We also show that in this case, there\nexists an algorithm to determine whether two RAAG's are quasi-isometric by\nlooking at their defining graphs. Compared to the finite out case, as well as\nthe previous quasi-isometry rigidity results for symmetric spaces, thick\nEuclidean buildings and mapping class groups, the main issue we need to deal\nwith here is the reconstruction map may not have nice properties as before, or\nmay not even exist. We introduce a deformation argument, as well as techniques\nfrom cubulation to deal with this issue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2016 03:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

Here there are two players, a defender and an attacker. The\ndefender wants to allocate her limited resources to defend critical targets and\nthe attacker seeks his most favorable target to attack. In the past decade,\nthere has been a surge of research interest in analyzing and solving security\ngames that are motivated by applications from various domains. This paper\nexamines security games from a theoretical perspective and provides a unified\nview of various security game models. In particular, each security game can be\ncharacterized by a set system $E$ which consists of the defender's pure\nstrategies, The defender's best response problem can be viewed as a\ncombinatorial optimization problem over $E$. Our framework captures most of the\nbasic security game models in the literature, including all the deployed\nsystems, The set system $E$ arising from various domains encodes standard\ncombinatorial problems like bipartite matching, maximum coverage, min-cost\nflow, packing problems, etc. Our main result shows that equilibrium computation\nin security games is essentially a combinatorial problem. In particular, we\nprove that, for any set system $E$, the following problems can be reduced to\neach other in polynomial time: (0) combinatorial optimization over $E$, (1)\ncomputing the minimax equilibrium for zero-sum security games over $E$, (2)\ncomputing the strong Stackelberg equilibrium for security games over $E$, (3)\ncomputing the best or worst (for the defender) Nash equilibrium for security\ngames over $E$. Here, by \"games over $E$\" we mean the class of security games\nwith arbitrary payoff structures, but a fixed set $E$ of defender pure\nstrategies. This shows that the complexity of a security game is essentially\ndetermined by the set system $E$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2016 04:30:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2016 00:55:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-14"}

Here we propose an approach to enhance the interparticle\ninteraction using exciton-polaritons in MoS$_2$ monolayer quantum-dots embedded\nin 2D photonic crystal microcavities.

Below the\nsuperconducting critical temperature of Nb, the QPC shows a single-channel\nconductance greater than the conductance quantum $2e^{2}/h$ at zero bias, which\nindicates the presence of Andreev-reflected quasiparticles, time-reversed\nstates of the injected electron, returning back through the QPC. The marked\nsensitivity of the conductance enhancement to voltage bias and perpendicular\nmagnetic field suggests a mechanism analogous to reflectionless tunneling--a\nhallmark of phase-coherent transport, with the boundary of the 2DEG cavity\nplaying the role of scatters. When the QPC transmission is reduced to the\ntunneling regime, the differential conductance vs bias voltage probes the\nsingle-particle density of states in the proximity area. Measured conductance\nspectra show a double peak within the superconducting gap of Nb, demonstrating\nthe formation of Andreev bound states in the 2DEG.

Also, we adapted the\nLouvain greedy approach to optimize the Infomap measure. The main idea is, to\nrecalculate only a small area around the changes. Depending on the graph size\nand the amount of changes, this yields a massive runtime decrease. As\nvalidation data, we provide a graph generator, which produces spe- cific\ncommunity structures, at given times and also intermediate steps to transform\nthe graph from one to another specific graph. Experiments show that runtime\ndecrease is possible without much loss of quality.

This allows a straightforward estimation of the fractal\ndimension $d_f$ of aggregates in {\\it Small-Angle X-ray Scattering} (SAXS)\nexperiments. However, this behavior is not commonly studied in optical\nscattering experiments because of the lack of information on its domain of\nvalidity. In the present work, we propose a definition of the\nmultiple-scattering structure factor, which naturally generalizes the\nsingle-scattering function $S(q)$. We show that the mean-field theory of\nelectromagnetic scattering provides an explicit condition to interpret the\nsignificance of multiple scattering. In this paper, we investigate and discuss\nelectromagnetic scattering by three classes of fractal aggregates. The results\nobtained from the TMatrix method show that the fractal scaling range is divided\ninto two domains: 1) a genuine fractal regime, which is robust; 2) a possible\nanomalous scaling regime, $S(q) \\propto 1/q^{\\delta}$, with exponent $\\delta$\nindependent of $d_f$, and related to the way the scattering mechanism uses the\nlocal morphology of the scatterer. The recognition, and an analysis, of the\nlatter domain is of importance because it may result in significant reduction\nof the fractal regime, and brings into question the proper mechanism in the\nbuild-up of multiple-scattering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2016 09:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-20"}

While numerous experiments have revealed details of\nthe molecular structure and working mechanism of DNAP which consists of both a\npolymerase site and an exonuclease (proofreading) site, there were quite few\ntheoretical studies on the fidelity issue. The first model which explicitly\nconsidered both sites was proposed in 1970s' and the basic idea was widely\naccepted by later models. However, all these models did not systematically and\nrigorously investigate the dominant factor on DNAP fidelity, i.e, the\nhigher-order terminal effects through which the polymerization pathway and the\nproofreading pathway coordinate to achieve high fidelity. In this paper, we\npropose a new and comprehensive kinetic model of DNAP based on some recent\nexperimental observations, which includes previous models as special cases. We\npresent a rigorous and unified treatment of the corresponding steady-state\nkinetic equations of any-order terminal effects, and derive analytical\nexpressions for fidelity in terms of kinetic parameters under bio-relevant\nconditions. These expressions offer new insights on how the the higher-order\nterminal effects contribute substantially to the fidelity in an order-by-order\nway, and also show that the polymerization-and-proofreading mechanism is\ndominated only by very few key parameters. We then apply these results to\ncalculate the fidelity of some real DNAPs, which are in good agreements with\nprevious intuitive estimates given by experimentalists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2016 10:06:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 May 2016 13:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-29"}

These structures are often interpreted as the result of\nplanet-disc interactions. However, these disks are also known to be unstable to\nthe magneto-rotational instability (MRI) which is believed to be one of the\ndominant angular momentum transport mechanism in these objects. It is therefore\nnatural to ask if the MRI itself could produce these structures without\ninvoking planets. The nonlinear evolution of the MRI is strongly affected by\nthe low ionisation fraction in protoplanetary disks. The Hall effect in\nparticular, which is dominant in dense and weakly ionised parts of these\nobjects, has been shown to spontaneously drive self- organising flows in\nshearing box simulations. Here, we investigate the behaviour of global\nMRI-unstable disc models dominated by the Hall effect and characterise their\ndynamics. We perform 3D unstratified Hall-MHD simulations of keplerian disks\nfor a broad range of Hall, ohmic and ambipolar Elsasser numbers. We confirm the\ntransition from a turbulent to an organised state as the intensity of the Hall\neffect is increased. We observe the formation of zonal flows, their number\ndepending on the available magnetic flux and on the intensity of the Hall\neffect. For intermediate Hall intensity, the flow self-organises into\nlong-lived magnetised vortices. Neither the addition of a toroidal field nor\nohmic or ambipolar diffusion drastically change this picture in the range of\nparameters we have explored. The ability of these structures to trap dust\nparticles in this configuration is demonstrated. We conclude that Hall-MRI\ndriven organisation is a plausible scenario which could explain some of the\nstructures found in recent observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2016 10:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

In this paper, it is shown\nthat if the upgrade to HVDC is applied systematically to selected transmission\nlines across the grid, a hybrid architecture is obtained that enables an\nefficient and globally optimal solution of the optimal power flow (OPF)\nproblem. More precisely, for conventional meshed AC transmission grids the OPF\nproblem is nonconvex and in general NP-hard, rendering it hard to solve. We\nprove that after the upgrade to the proposed hybrid architecture, the same mesh\ntopology facilitates an exact convex relaxation of the OPF problem, enabling\nits globally optimal solution with efficient polynomial time algorithms.

Unsurprisingly, when\ntheir density is high, zealots drive the whole population to consensus on their\nopinion. For low densities a rich phase diagram emerges: a finite population of\ndissenters can survive and be the only stationary state or may need a critical\nmass or dissenters to be sustained; the critical mass may vanish or not as the\ndensity is reduced; the transition to the high density regime can be smooth or\nabrupt, and shows interesting hysteretic effects. For each choice of the\ninteraction rules we calculate the critical density of zealots above which\ndiverse opinions cannot survive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2016 11:44:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-09"}

The inferred mean line-of-sight (LOS)\nvelocity, Doppler width, and source function were similar to previous works of\nsmaller quiescent filaments. However, the derived optical thickness was larger.\nLOS velocity trends inferred from the H-alpha line core fits were in accord,\nbut smaller, than the ones obtained with CM inversions. Signatures of\ncounter-streaming flows were detected in the filament.The largest conglomerates\nof brightenings in the line core of Na I D2 coincided well with small-scale\nmagnetic fields as seen by HMI. Mixed magnetic polarities were detected close\nto the ends of barbs. The computation of photospheric horizontal flows based on\nHMI magnetograms revealed flow kernels with a size of 5-8 Mm and velocities of\n0.30-0.45 km/s at the ends of the filament. The physical properties of\nextremely large filaments are similar to their smaller counterparts, except for\nthe optical thickness which in our sample was found to be larger. We found that\na part of the filament, which erupted the day before, is in the process of\nreestablishing its initial configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2016 12:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

This model, which exhibits a first order phase\ntransition for $q>4$, exemplifies a generic numerical challenge in statistical\nphysics: The evaluation of the partition function and thermodynamic\nobservables, which involve high dimensional sums of sharply structured\nmulti-modal density functions. It poses a major challenge to most standard\nnumerical techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo. In this paper we will\ndemonstrate that nested sampling is particularly suited for such problems and\nit has a couple of advantages. For calculating the partition function of the\nPotts model with $N$ sites: a) one run stops after $O(N)$ moves, so it takes\n$O(N^{2})$ operations for the run, b) only a single run is required to compute\nthe partition function along with the assignment of confidence intervals, c)\nthe confidence intervals of the logarithmic partition function decrease with\n$1/\\sqrt{N}$ and d) a single run allows to compute quantities for all\ntemperatures while the autocorrelation time is very small, irrespective of\ntemperature. Thermodynamic expectation values of observables, which are\ncompletely determined by the bond configuration in the representation of\nFortuin and Kasteleyn, like the Helmholtz free energy, the internal energy as\nwell as the entropy and heat capacity, can be calculated in the same single run\nneeded for the partition function along with their confidence intervals. In\ncontrast, thermodynamic expectation values of magnetic properties like the\nmagnetization and the magnetic susceptibility require sampling the additional\nspin degree of freedom.

Our aim is to\ndetermine the validity of secular theory in describing the evolution of\neccentric discs, and to explore their nonlinear evolution for moderate\neccentricities. Linear secular theory is found to correctly predict the\nstructure and precession rates of discs with small eccentricities. However,\ndiscs with larger eccentricities (and eccentricity gradients) are observed to\nprecess faster (retrograde relative to the orbital motion), at a rate that\ndepends on their eccentricities (and eccentricity gradients). We derive\nanalytically a nonlinear secular theory for eccentric gas discs, which explains\nthis result as a modification of the pressure forces whenever eccentric orbits\nin a disc nearly intersect. This effect could be particularly important for\nhighly eccentric discs produced in tidal disruption events, or for narrow\ngaseous rings; it might also play a role in causing some of the variability in\nsuperhump binary systems. In two dimensions, the eccentricity of a moderately\neccentric disc is long-lived and persists throughout the duration of our\nsimulations. Eccentric modes are however weakly damped by their interaction\nwith non-axisymmetric spiral density waves (driven by the Papaloizou-Pringle\ninstability, which occurs in our idealised setup with solid walls), as well as\nnumerical diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2016 15:20:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

Thus, the efficient modeling\nof convoluted search space, the clever use of energy functions, and more\nimportantly, the use of effective sampling algorithms become crucial to address\nthis problem. For protein structure modeling, an off-lattice model provides\nlimited scopes to exercise and evaluate the algorithmic developments due to its\nastronomically large set of data-points. In contrast, an on-lattice model\nwidens the scopes and permits studying the relatively larger proteins because\nof its finite set of data-points.
