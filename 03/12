Specifically, pure thermal feedback results in excessive\ncondensation and smothering of the AGN by cold gas because the feedback energy\ndoes not propagate to large enough radii. We do not see large differences\nbetween implementations of different triggering mechanisms, as long as the\nspatial resolution is sufficiently high, probably because all of the\nimplementations tested here trigger strong AGN feedback under similar\nconditions.

Since the behavior of recurrent networks is strongly\ninfluenced by the particular input signal driving the dynamics, a universal,\napplication-independent method for determining the edge of criticality is still\nmissing.

The mismatch between predictions and observations under a warming\nclimate calls for a reassessment of how atmospheric power $W$ is defined,\nestimated and constrained. Here we review published formulations for $W$ and\nshow how they differ when applied to a moist atmosphere. Three factors, a\nnon-zero source/sink in the continuity equation, the difference between\nvelocities of gaseous air and condensate, and interaction between the gas and\ncondensate modifying the equations of motion, affect the formulation of $W$.\nStarting from the thermodynamic definition of mechanical work, we derive an\nexpression for $W$ from an explicit consideration of the equations of motion\nand continuity. Our analyses clarify how some past formulations are incomplete\nor invalid. Three caveats are identified. First, $W$ critically depends on the\nboundary condition for gaseous air velocity at the Earth's surface. Second,\nconfusion between gaseous air velocity and mean velocity of air and condensate\nin the expression for $W$ results in gross errors despite the observed\nmagnitudes of these velocities are very close.

Our near-IR measurements are on average a factor 3 larger than\noptical SFR, even when extinction corrections are applied. We found that LIRGs\nhave a median-observed star formation rate surface density of 1.72\nMsun/yr/kpc^2 for the extinction-corrected distribution, whilst ULIRGs have\n0.23 Msun/yr/kpc^2, respectively. These median values for ULIRGs increase up to\n2.90 Msun/yr/kpc^2, when only their inner regions, covering the same size as\nthe average FoV of LIRGs, are considered.

Exoplanet searches have demonstrated that giant planets are\npreferentially found around metal-rich stars and that their fraction increases\nwith the stellar mass. AIMS.

Using this\ninformation, we aim to study the role of the stellar evolution in the orbital\nparameters of the companions, and to unveil possible correlations between the\nstellar properties and the occurrence rate of giant planets. METHODS. Using\nFEROS and CHIRON spectra, we have computed precision radial velocities and we\nhave derived atmospheric and physical parameters for all of our targets.\nAdditionally, velocities computed from UCLES spectra are presented here. By\nstudying the periodic radial velocity signals, we have detected the presence of\nseveral substellar companions. RESULTS. We present four new planetary systems\naround the giant stars HIP8541, HIP74890, HIP84056 and HIP95124.

In its many applications, 3D\ncoordinate-space representation is used, and infinite-domain calculations are\nlimited to a finite volume represented by a box. For finite quantum systems\n(atoms, molecules, nuclei), the commonly used periodic or reflecting boundary\nconditions introduce spurious quantization of the continuum states and\nartificial reflections from boundary; hence, an incorrect treatment of\nevaporated particles. These artifacts can be practically cured by introducing\nabsorbing boundary conditions (ABC) through an absorbing potential in a certain\nboundary region sufficiently far from the described system. But also the\ncalculations of infinite matter (crystal electrons, quantum fluids, neutron\nstar crust) suffer artifacts from a finite computational box. In this regime,\ntwist- averaged boundary conditions (TABC) have been used successfully to\ndiminish the finite-volume effects. In this work, we extend TABC to\ntime-dependent framework and apply it to resolve the box artifacts for finite\nquantum systems using as test case small- and large-amplitude nuclear\nvibrations. We demonstrate that by using such a method, one can reduce finite\nvolume effects drastically without adding any additional parameters. While they\nare almost equivalent in the linear regime, TABC and ABC differ in the\nnonlinear regime in their treatment of evaporated particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2016 20:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}

This theory corresponds to the bosonic\nsector of a Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction of eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity which induces a determined self-interacting potential for the\nscalar field. We compute the conserved charges and carry out the thermodynamics\nof an anti-de Sitter (AdS) dyonic black hole solution recently proposed. The\ncharges coming from symmetries of the action are computed by using the\nRegge-Teitelboim Hamiltonian approach. These correspond to the mass, which\nacquires contributions from the scalar field, and the electric charge.\nIntegrability conditions are introduced because the scalar field leads to\nnon-integrable terms in the variation of the mass. These conditions are\ngenerically solved by introducing boundary conditions that arbitrarily relates\nthe leading and subleading terms of the scalar field fall-off. The Hamiltonian\nEuclidean action, computed in the grand canonical ensemble, is obtained by\ndemanding the action to attain an extremum. Its value is given by a radial\nboundary term plus an additional polar angle boundary term due to the presence\nof a magnetic monopole. Remarkably, the magnetic charge can be identified from\nthe variation of the additional polar angle boundary term, confirming that the\nfirst law of black hole thermodynamics is a consequence of having a\nwell-defined and finite Hamiltonian action principle, even if the charge does\nnot come from a symmetry of the action. The temperature and electrostatic\npotential are determined demanding regularity on the black hole solution,\nwhereas the value of the magnetic potential is already identified in the\nvariation of the additional polar angle boundary term. Consequently, the first\nlaw of black hole thermodynamics is identically satisfied by construction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2016 20:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

For a\nsufficiently weak disorder strength, we show that the massless Dirac fixed\npoint is at the heart of the robustness of superuniversality. We establish this\nby considering both perturbative and nonperturbative effects of disorder. The\nsuperuniversality breaks down at a critical strength of disorder, beyond which\nthe topologically distinct localized phases become separated by a delocalized\ndiffusive phase. In the global phase diagram, the disorder controlled fixed\npoint where superuniversality is lost, serves as a multicritical point, where\nthe delocalized diffusive and two topologically distinct localized phases meet\nand the nature of the localization-delocalization transition depends on the\nunderlying symmetry class. Based on these features we construct the global\nphase diagrams of noninteracting, dirty topological systems in three\ndimensions. We also establish a similar structure of the phase diagram and the\nsuperuniversality for weak disorder in higher spatial dimensions.

In the topological superconducting phase at large\nmagnetic field, strong proximity coupling reduces the localization length of\nMajorana bound states, such that the induced disorder eliminates the\ntopological gap while bulk Majorana zero modes emerge, even for short wires.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2016 21:01:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

We\nformulate our model as the Wasserstein gradient flow of an interaction energy,\nwith a penalization to enforce the constraint on the height of the density.\nFrom this perspective, the problem can be seen as a singular limit of the\nKeller-Segel equation with degenerate diffusion. Two key properties distinguish\nour problem from previous work on height constrained equations: nonconvexity of\nthe interaction kernel (which places the model outside the scope of classical\ngradient flow theory) and nonlocal dependence of the velocity field on the\ndensity (which causes the problem to lack a comparison principle).

The curved boundaries of the elements are modeled exactly and\nhence there is no approximation in the geometrical modeling. 2-D integrals of\nthe matrix elements are reduced to 1-D integrals. Therefore, the matrix filling\ncan be performed very fast.

The construction of our\nspanner is based on Delaunay triangulations defined with respect to the\nequilateral-triangle distance, and uses a different approach than that used by\nBonichon et al. Our approach leads to a simple and intuitive construction of a\nwell-structured spanner, and reveals useful structural properties of the\nDelaunay triangulations defined with respect to the equilateral-triangle\ndistance.\n  The structure of the constructed spanner implies that when ${\\cal P}$ is in\nconvex position, the maximum degree of this spanner is at most 3. Combining the\nabove degree upper bound with the fact that 3 is a lower bound on the maximum\ndegree of any plane spanner of ${\\cal C}$ when the point-set ${\\cal P}$ is in\nconvex position, the results in this paper give a tight bound of 3 on the\nmaximum degree of plane spanners of ${\\cal C}$ for point-sets in convex\nposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2016 23:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-15"}

A lack of efficient methods\nfor evaluating finite-time transition probabilities of bivariate processes,\nhowever, has restricted statistical inference in these models. Researchers rely\non computationally expensive methods such as matrix exponentiation or Monte\nCarlo approximation, restricting likelihood-based inference to small systems,\nor indirect methods such as approximate Bayesian computation. In this paper, we\nintroduce the birth(death)/birth-death process, a tractable bivariate extension\nof the birth-death process. We develop an efficient and robust algorithm to\ncalculate the transition probabilities of birth(death)/birth-death processes\nusing a continued fraction representation of their Laplace transforms. Next, we\nidentify several exemplary models arising in molecular epidemiology,\nmacro-parasite evolution, and infectious disease modeling that fall within this\nclass, and demonstrate advantages of our proposed method over existing\napproaches to inference in these models. Notably, the ubiquitous stochastic\nsusceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model falls within this class, and we\nemphasize that computable transition probabilities newly enable direct\ninference of parameters in the SIR model. We also propose a very fast method\nfor approximating the transition probabilities under the SIR model via a novel\nbranching process simplification, and compare it to the continued fraction\nrepresentation method with application to the 17th century plague in Eyam.\nAlthough the two methods produce similar maximum a posteriori estimates, the\nbranching process approximation fails to capture the correlation structure in\nthe joint posterior distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2016 23:17:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2017 16:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-08"}

In contrast to conventional hashing schemes,\nwhich typically rely on an $\\ell_2$-norm (i.e., average distortion)\nminimization, NIBH is based on a $\\ell_{\\infty}$-norm (i.e., worst-case\ndistortion) minimization that provides several benefits, including superior\ndistance, ranking, and near-neighbor preservation performance.

The main aim of the study is to\nunderstand the most plausible mechanism responsible for the unusual cometary\nshape of the cloud in the context of its magnetic field geometry. When\nunpolarized starlight passes through the intervening interstellar dust grains\nthat are aligned with their short axes parallel to the local magnetic field, it\ngets linearly polarized. The plane-of-the-sky magnetic field component can\ntherefore be traced by doing polarization measurements of background stars\nprojected on clouds. Because the light in the optical wavelength range is most\nefficiently polarized by the dust grains typically found in the outer layers of\nthe molecular clouds, optical polarimetry enables us to trace the magnetic\nfield geometry of the outer layers of the clouds. We made R-band polarization\nmeasurements of 207 stars in the direction of Gal 110-13. The distance of Gal\n110-13 was determined as $\\sim450\\pm80$ pc using our polarization and 2MASS\nnear-infrared data. The foreground interstellar contribution was removed from\nthe observed polarization values by observing a number of stars located in the\nvicinity of Gal 110-13 which has Hipparcos parallax measurements. The\nplane-of-the-sky magnetic field lines are found to be well ordered and aligned\nwith the elongated structure of Gal 110-13.

Instead, the Universe we are proposing is\nfilled with a perfect fluid of self-interacting dark matter (DM), the volume\nelements of which perform hydrodynamic flows. To the best of our knowledge, it\nis the first time in a cosmological framework that the energy of the cosmic\nfluid internal motions is also taken into account as a source of the universal\ngravitational field. As we demonstrate, this form of energy may compensate for\nthe DE needed to compromise spatial flatness, while, depending on the\nparticular type of thermodynamic processes occurring in the interior of the DM\nfluid (isothermal or polytropic), the Universe depicts itself as either\ndecelerating or accelerating (respectively).

An analytical solution of the PD electromechanical\nequations in the integral form is presented for the static case when a point\nmechanical force and a point electric force act in a three dimensional infinite\nsolid dielectric. A parametric study on how the different length scales\ninfluence the response is also undertaken.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2016 11:33:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-15"}

The dose strongly depends on both the\nangular sensitivity and on the visibility of a grating-based Talbot-Lau\ninterferometer. Using a conventional x-ray tube, a high sensitivity and a high\nvisibility are somewhat contradicting goals: To increase sensitivity, the\ngrating period has to be reduced and/or the grating distance increased.\nTechnically, this means using a higher Talbot order (3rd or 5th one instead of\nfirst one). This however reduces the visibility somewhat, because only a\nsmaller part of the tube spectrum will get used. This work proposes to relax\nthis problem by changing the phase grating geometry. This allows to double\nsensitivity (i.e., double the Talbot order) without reducing the visibility.\nOne proposed grating geometry is an older binary one (75% of a period\n$\\pi$-shifting), but applied in a novel way. The second proposed geometry is a\nnovel one, requiring three height levels for polychromatic correction. The\nadvantage is quantified by a simulation of the resulting interference patterns.\nVisibilities for the common $\\pi$-shifting gratings are compared with the\nproposed alternative geometries. This is done depending on photon energy and\nopening ratio of the coherence grating G0. It shows that despite of doubled\nsensitivity of the proposed gratings, the overall visibility might even improve\na little.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2016 14:41:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2016 22:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

It has been proposed that the\nshedding of the strong neutron star magnetic field ($B$) during the collapse is\nthe power source for the radio emission. Previously, these models have utilized\nthe simplicity of the Schwarzschild metric which has the restriction that the\nmagnetic flux is magnetic \"hair\" that must be shed before final collapse. But,\nneutron stars have angular momentum and charge and a fully relativistic Kerr\nNewman solution exists in which $B$ has its source inside of the event horizon.\nIn this letter, we consider the magnetic flux to be shed as a consequence of\nthe electric discharge of a metastable collapsed state of a Kerr Newman black\nhole. It has also been argued that the shedding model will not operate due to\npair creation. By considering the pulsar death line, we find that for a neutron\nstar with $B = 10^{11} - 10^{13}$ G and a long rotation period, $>1$ s this is\nnot a concern.

Diffusion in biological systems is often\nmodeled by a discrete space jump process in order to capture the inherent noise\nof biological systems, which becomes important in the low copy number regime.\nTo model diffusion in the crowded cell environment efficiently, we compute the\njump rates in this mesoscopic model from local first exit times, which account\nfor the microscopic positions of the crowding molecules, while the diffusing\nmolecules jump on a coarser Cartesian grid. We then extract a macroscopic\ndescription from the resulting jump rates, where the excluded volume effect is\nmodeled by a diffusion equation with space dependent diffusion coefficient. The\ncrowding molecules can be of arbitrary shape and size and numerical experiments\ndemonstrate that those factors together with the size of the diffusing molecule\nplay a crucial role on the magnitude of the decrease in diffusive motion. When\ncorrecting the reaction rates for the altered diffusion we can show that\nmolecular crowding either enhances or inhibits chemical reactions depending on\nlocal fluctuations of the obstacle density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2016 10:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-18"}

Given a set of instances, off-line tuning of the algorithm's\nparameters can be done by automated algorithm configuration tools (e.g., SMAC).\nHowever, the large number of neighborhoods can make the tuning expensive and\ndifficult even when the number of parameters has been reduced by some\nintuition. In this work, we propose a systematic method to characterize each\nneighborhood's behaviours, representing them as a feature vector, and using\ncluster analysis to form similar groups of neighborhoods. The novelty of our\ncharacterization method is the ability of reflecting changes of behaviours\naccording to hardness of different solution quality regions.
