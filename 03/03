It is based on electrical fields that\nchange the properties of the cell membrane. With that, cancer treatment can\nreach the cell more easily. Electropermeabilization occurs only with accurate\ndosage of the electrical field. For applications, a monitoring for the amount\nof electropermeabilization is needed. It is a first step to image the\nmacroscopic electrical field during the process. Nevertheless, this is not\ncomplete, because electropermeabilization depends on critical individual\nproperties of the cells such as their curvature. From the macroscopic field,\none cannot directly infer that microscopic state. In this article, we study\neffective parameters in a homogenization model as the next step to monitor the\nmicroscopic properties in clinical practice. We start from a physiological cell\nmodel for electropermeabilization and analyze its well-posedness. For a\ndynamical homogenization scheme, we prove convergence and then analyze the\neffective parameters, which can be found by macroscopic imaging methods. We\ndemonstrate numerically the sensitivity of these effective parameters to\ncritical microscopic parameters governing electropermeabilization. This opens\nthe door to solve the inverse problem of rreconstructing these parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 17:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-03"}

Recent theoretical studies indicated the possibility of producing\nthermonuclear detonations of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) at masses less\nthan the Chandrasekhar mass through accretion of helium-rich matter, which\nwould, depending on mass accretion rate, mass, and initial temperature of the\nWD, spectrally resemble either a normal SN Ia or a peculiar one. This study\naims to further resolve the state of binary systems comprised of a\nsub-Chandrasekhar-mass CO WD and a helium star at the point where an\naccretion-induced detonation occurs and constrains the part of the initial\nparameter space where this kind of phenomenon is possible. Preexisting data\nobtained through simulations of single, constantly accreting CO WDs is used as\nan indicator for the behavior of new binary models in which the WD is treated\nas a point mass and which include the non-degenerate partner as a fully\nresolved stellar model. We parameterize the ignition of the accumulated helium\nlayer, changes in the WD temperature, and changes in the CO core mass depending\non the mass transfer rate. The initial conditions allowing for detonation do\nnot form a single contiguous area in the parameter space, whose shape is\nprofoundly influenced by the behavior of the donor star.

Nevertheless, their\ncombination suffers from three significant disadvantages. The first is that\nthey attempt to compute only the part of the diagram that is continuously\nconnected to the initial data; disconnected branches are overlooked. The second\nis that the subproblems required (typically determinant calculation and\nnullspace construction) are expensive and hard to scale to very large\ndiscretizations. The third is that they can miss connected branches associated\nwith nonsimple bifurcations, such as when an eigenvalue of even multiplicity\ncrosses the origin. Without expert knowledge or lucky guesses, these techniques\nalone can paint an incomplete picture of the dynamics of a system.\n  In this paper we propose a new algorithm for computing bifurcation diagrams,\ncalled deflated continuation, that is capable of overcoming all three of these\ndisadvantages. The algorithm combines classical continuation with a deflation\ntechnique that elegantly eliminates known branches from consideration, allowing\nthe discovery of disconnected branches with Newton's method. Deflated\ncontinuation does not rely on any device for detecting bifurcations and does\nnot involve computing eigendecompositions; all subproblems required in deflated\ncontinuation can be solved efficiently if a good preconditioner is available\nfor the underlying nonlinear problem.

Recent variable-magnetic-field studies of Mn3O4 have been performed on\nmelt-grown crystals, which can exhibit twin domains due to a Jahn-Teller\nstructural transition below the melting temperature. Because of the near\ndegeneracy of the magnetostructural phases, however, strain associated with the\ntwin domains likely affects the magnetic responses of Mn3O4.

Each applicant and course has a capacity, indicating the maximum\nnumber of courses and applicants they can be assigned to, respectively. We thus\nessentially have a many-to-many bipartite matching problem with one-sided\npreferences, which has applications to the assignment of students to optional\ncourses at a university. We consider additive preferences and lexicographic\npreferences as two means of extending preferences over individual courses to\npreferences over bundles of courses. We additionally focus on the cases that\ncourses have prerequisite constraints and where courses may be corequisites.\n  For these extensions to the basic problem, we present the following\nalgorithmic results, which are mainly concerned with the computation of Pareto\noptimal matchings (POMs). Firstly, we consider compulsory prerequisites. For\nadditive preferences, we show that the problem of finding a POM is NP-hard. On\nthe other hand, in the case of lexicographic preferences we give a\npolynomial-time algorithm for finding a POM, based on the well-known sequential\nmechanism. However we show that the problem of deciding whether a given\nmatching is Pareto optimal is co-NP-complete. We further prove that finding a\nmaximum cardinality (Pareto optimal) matching is NP-hard. Under alternative\nprerequisites, we show that finding a POM is NP-hard for either additive or\nlexicographic preferences. Finally we consider corequisites. We prove that, as\nin the case of compulsory prerequisites, finding a POM is NP-hard for additive\npreferences, though solvable in polynomial time for lexicographic preferences.\nIn the latter case, the problem of finding a maximum cardinality POM is NP-hard\nand very difficult to approximate\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 20:34:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 21:28:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 08:11:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-11"}

It allows clients to dynamically adapt media\ncharacteristics to network conditions in order to ensure a high quality of\nexperience, that is, minimize playback interruptions, while maximizing video\nquality at a reasonable level of quality changes. In the case of live\nstreaming, this task becomes particularly challenging due to the latency\nconstraints. The challenge further increases if a client uses a wireless\nnetwork, where the throughput is subject to considerable fluctuations.\nConsequently, live streams often exhibit latencies of up to 30 seconds. In the\npresent work, we introduce an adaptation algorithm for HTTP-based live\nstreaming called LOLYPOP (Low-Latency Prediction-Based Adaptation) that is\ndesigned to operate with a transport latency of few seconds. To reach this\ngoal, LOLYPOP leverages TCP throughput predictions on multiple time scales,\nfrom 1 to 10 seconds, along with an estimate of the prediction error\ndistribution. In addition to satisfying the latency constraint, the algorithm\nheuristically maximizes the quality of experience by maximizing the average\nvideo quality as a function of the number of skipped segments and quality\ntransitions. In order to select an efficient prediction method, we studied the\nperformance of several time series prediction methods in IEEE 802.11 wireless\naccess networks. We evaluated LOLYPOP under a large set of experimental\nconditions limiting the transport latency to 3 seconds, against a\nstate-of-the-art adaptation algorithm from the literature, called FESTIVE. We\nobserved that the average video quality is by up to a factor of 3 higher than\nwith FESTIVE. We also observed that LOLYPOP is able to reach a broader region\nin the quality of experience space, and thus it is better adjustable to the\nuser profile or service provider requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 20:38:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 10:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-22"}

Emphasis is placed on the approach to charge\nneutrality and on the differences between Dirac and Weyl materials. At charge\nneutrality, the zero-temperature limit of the dc conductivity is not universal\nand also depends on the residual scattering model employed. However, the Lorenz\nnumber L retains its usual value L_0. With increasing temperature, the\nWiedemann-Franz law is violated. At high temperatures, L exhibits a new plateau\nat a value dependent on the details of the scattering rate. Such details can\nalso appear in the optical conductivity, both in the Drude response and\ninterband background. In the clean limit, the interband background is linear in\nphoton energy and always extrapolates to the origin. This background can be\nshifted to the right through the introduction of a massless gap. In this case,\nthe extrapolation can cut the axis at a finite photon energy as is observed in\nsome experiments. It is also of interest to differentiate between the two types\nof Weyl semimetals: those with broken time-reversal symmetry and those with\nbroken spatial-inversion symmetry. We show that, while the former will follow\nthe same behaviour as the 3D Dirac semimetals, for the zero magnetic field\nproperties discussed here, the latter type will show a double step in the\noptical conductivity at finite doping and a single absorption edge at charge\nneutrality. The Drude conductivity is always finite in this case, even at\ncharge neutrality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 20:58:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

The sample under study contains 416 galaxies observed with IFS,\ncovering a wide range of Hubble types and stellar masses. Spectral synthesis\ntechniques are applied to obtain radial profiles of the intensity of the star\nformation rate in the recent past, and the local sSFR. To emphasize the\nbehavior of these properties for galaxies that are on and off the main sequence\nof star formation (MSSF) we stack the individual radial profiles in bins of\ngalaxy morphology and stellar masses. Our main results are: a) The intensity of\nSFR shows declining profiles that exhibit very little differences between\nspirals. The dispersion between the profiles is significantly smaller in late\ntype spirals.

However, details of the past merger history of present-day\nellipticals, such as the typical merger mass ratio, are difficult to constrain\nobservationally. Within the context and assumptions of the two-phase formation\nscenario, we propose a straightforward method, using photometric data alone, to\nestimate the average mass ratio of mergers that contributed to the build-up of\nmassive elliptical galaxies. We study a sample of nearby massive elliptical\ngalaxies selected from the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey, using two-dimensional\nanalysis to decompose their light distribution into an inner, denser component\nplus an extended, outer envelope, each having a different optical color. The\ncombination of these two substructures accurately recovers the negative color\ngradient exhibited by the galaxy as whole. The color difference between the two\ncomponents (<\\Delta(B-V)> ~ 0.10 mag; <\\Delta(B-R)> ~ 0.14 mag), based on the\nslope of the M_stellar-color relation for nearby early-type galaxies, can be\ntranslated into an estimate of the average mass ratio of the mergers. The rough\nestimate, 1:5 to 1:10, is consistent with the expectation of the two-phase\nformation scenario, suggesting that minor mergers were largely responsible for\nbuilding up to the outer stellar envelope of present-day massive ellipticals.\nWith the help of accurate photometry, large sample size, and more choices of\ncolors promised by ongoing and future surveys, the approach proposed here can\nreveal more insights into the growth of massive galaxies during the last few\nGyr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

By using a set of Monte Carlo\ncluster simulations evolved in quasi-isolation, we show that the stellar mass\ndependence of the velocity dispersion $\\sigma(m)$ can be described by an\nexponential function $\\sigma^2\\propto \\exp(-m/m_\\mathrm{eq})$, with the\nparameter $m_\\mathrm{eq}$ quantifying the degree of partial energy\nequipartition of the systems. This simple parametrization successfully captures\nthe behaviour of the velocity dispersion at lower as well as higher stellar\nmasses, that is, the regime where the system is expected to approach full\nequipartition. We find a tight correlation between the degree of equipartition\nreached by a GC and its dynamical state, indicating that clusters that are more\nthan about 20 core relaxation times old, have reached a maximum degree of\nequipartition. This equipartition$-$dynamical state relation can be used as a\ntool to characterize the relaxation condition of a cluster with a kinematic\nmeasure of the $m_\\mathrm{eq}$ parameter. Vice versa, the mass-dependence of\nthe kinematics can be predicted knowing the relaxation time solely on the basis\nof photometric measurements. Moreover, any deviations from this tight relation\ncould be used as a probe of a peculiar dynamical history of a cluster. Finally,\nour novel approach is important for the interpretation of state-of-the-art\nHubble Space Telescope proper motion data, for which the mass dependence of\nkinematics can now be measured, and for the application of modeling techniques\nwhich take into consideration multi-mass components and mass segregation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 21:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

In the thermalizing phase the entanglement spectrum obeys level\nstatistics governed by an appropriate random matrix ensemble. For Hamiltonian\nsystems this can be viewed as evidence in favor of a strong version of the\neigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Similar results are also obtained\nfor Floquet systems, where they constitute a result `beyond ETH', and show that\nthe corrections to ETH governing the Floquet entanglement spectrum have\nstatistical properties governed by a random matrix ensemble.

Under calm and clear\nsky conditions a shallow warm layer of several meters depth develops on the\nsurface of the ocean. This warm layer drives an anomalous flux from the ocean\nto the atmosphere. A novel Kelvin wave trajectory database based on satellite\ndata is introduced in this study. The investigation of its data shows that\nsubstantial fraction of Kelvin waves is initiated as a result of interaction\nwith another Kelvin wave. Two distinct categories are defined and analyzed: the\ntwo- and multiple Kelvin wave initiations, and a spin off initiation. Results\nshow that primary forcing of such waves are high diurnal cycle and/or increased\nwind speed and latent heat flux at the ocean surface. Variability of the ocean\nsurface and subsurface along Kelvin wave trajectories over Indian Ocean is\ninvestigated: wind speed and latent heat flux increase and a sea surface\ntemperature anomaly decreases during a wave passage. It is also shown that\nKelvin waves are longitude-diurnal cycle phase locked over the Maritime\nContinent. This cycle phase locking is such that it agrees with mean, local\ndiurnal cycle of convection in the atmosphere. The strength of the\nlongitude-diurnal cycle phase locking differs between non-blocked Kelvin waves,\nwhich make successful transition over the Maritime Continent, and blocked waves\nthat terminate within it.

In atomic-scale transistors,\nthis conductance is exquisitely sensitive to single electrons hopping via\nindividual orbitals. Single-electron transport in molecular transistors has\nbeen previously studied using top-down approaches to gating, such as\nlithography and break junctions. But atomically precise control of the gate -\nwhich is crucial to transistor action at the smallest size scales - is not\npossible with these approaches.

This degree of control allowed us to tune the\nmolecule into the regime of sequential single-electron tunnelling, albeit with\na conductance gap more than one order of magnitude larger than observed\npreviously. This unexpected behaviour arises from the existence of two\ndifferent orientational conformations of the molecule, depending on its charge\nstate.

The $\\mathrm{N_{TB}}$ phase is distinguished by a heliconical winding of\nthe average molecular long axis (director) with a remarkably short (nanoscale)\npitch and, in systems of achiral dimers, with an equal probability to form\nright- and left-handed domains.

An\noffline adversary is limited only by the amount of computational resources he\nor she is willing to invest to crack a user's password. The danger is\ncompounded by the existence of authentication servers who fail to adopt proper\npassword storage practices like key-stretching. Password managers can help\nmitigate these risks by adopting key stretching procedures like hash iteration\nor memory hard functions to derive site specific passwords from the user's\nmaster password on the client-side. While key stretching can reduce the offline\nadversary's success rate, these procedures also increase computational costs\nfor a legitimate user. Motivated by the observation that most of the password\nguesses of the offline adversary will be incorrect, we propose a client side\ncost asymmetric secure hashing scheme (Client-CASH). Client-CASH randomizes the\nruntime of client-side key stretching procedure in a way that the expected\ncomputational cost of our key derivation function is greater when run with an\nincorrect master password. We make several contributions. First, we show how to\nintroduce randomness into a client-side key stretching algorithms through the\nuse of halting predicates which are selected randomly at the time of account\ncreation. Second, we formalize the problem of finding the optimal running time\ndistribution subject to certain cost constraints for the client and certain\nsecurity constrains on the halting predicates. Finally, we demonstrate that\nClient-CASH can reduce the adversary's success rate by up to $21\\%$. These\nresults demonstrate the promise of the Client-CASH mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 22:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-04"}

In order to combine them one has to\naccount for the fact that they are not independent quantities, since they probe\nthe same density field. It is important to develop a good understanding of\ntheir correlation in order to extract parameter constraints. We present a\ndetailed modelling of the joint covariance matrix between cluster number counts\nand the galaxy angular power spectrum. We employ the framework of the halo\nmodel complemented by a Halo Occupation Distribution model (HOD). We\ndemonstrate the importance of accounting for non-Gaussianity to produce\naccurate covariance predictions. Indeed, we show that the non-Gaussian\ncovariance becomes dominant at small scales, low redshifts or high cluster\nmasses. We discuss in particular the case of the super-sample covariance (SSC),\nincluding the effects of galaxy shot-noise, halo second order bias and\nnon-local bias. We demonstrate that the SSC obeys mathematical inequalities and\npositivity.

The reason for this dichotomy of wind-fed HMXBs is still a matter\nof debate. Among the several explanations that have been proposed, some of them\ninvoke specific stellar wind properties of the donor stars. Only dedicated\nempiric analysis of the donors' stellar wind can provide the required\ninformation to accomplish an adequate test of these theories. However, such\nanalyses are scarce. To close this gap, we perform a comparative analysis of\nthe optical companion in two important systems: IGR J17544-2619 (SFXT) and Vela\nX-1 (SGXB). We analyse the spectra of each star in detail and derive their\nstellar and wind properties. We compare the wind parameters, giving us an\nexcellent chance of recognizing key differences between donor winds in SFXTs\nand SGXBs. We find that the stellar parameters derived from the analysis\ngenerally agree well with the spectral types of the two donors: O9I (IGR\nJ17544-2619) and B0.5Iae (Vela X-1). An important difference between the\nstellar winds of the two stars is their terminal velocities v_inf=1500km/s in\nIGR J17544-2619 and v_inf=700km/s in Vela~X-1, which has important consequences\non the X-ray luminosity of these sources. Their specific combination of wind\nspeed and pulsar spin favours an accretion regime with a persistently high\nluminosity in Vela X-1, while it favours an inhibiting accretion mechanism in\nIGR~J17544-2619. Our study demonstrates that the wind relative velocity is\ncritical in the determination of the class of HMXBs hosting a supergiant donor,\ngiven that it may shift the accretion mechanism from direct accretion to\npropeller regimes when combined with other parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 23:28:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 11:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

In general, there are two scenarios of evolution. Either the\nsolution behaves in an oscillatory, quasiperiodic manner or the nonlinear\neffects cause the energy to concentrate on smaller scales leading to a\nturbulent behaviour. Which of these two possibilities occurs depends on a model\nand the initial conditions. In the quasiperiodic scenario there exist very\nspecial time-periodic solutions. They result for a delicate balance between\ndispersion and nonlinear interaction. The main body of this dissertation is\nconcerned with construction (by means of perturbative and numerical methods) of\ntime-periodic solutions for various nonlinear wave equations on bounded\ndomains. While turbulence is mainly associated with hydrodynamics, recent\nresearch in General Relativity has also revealed turbulent phenomena. Numerical\nstudies of a self-gravitating massless scalar field in spherical symmetry gave\nevidence that anti-de Sitter space is unstable against black hole formation. On\nthe other hand there appeared many examples of asymptotically anti-de Sitter\nsolutions which evade turbulent behaviour and appear almost periodic for long\ntimes. We discuss here these two contrasting scenarios putting special\nattention to the construction and properties of strictly time-periodic\nsolutions. We analyze different models where solutions of this type exist.\nMoreover, we describe similarities and differences among these models\nconcerning properties of time-periodic solutions and methods used for their\nconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 00:10:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-04"}

The three-dimensional nonlinear force-free\nfield configuration further discloses twisted field lines (a flux rope) at a\nlow altitude, cospatial with the dark threads in He I 10830 \\r{A} images. The\ninstability of the flux rope may initiate the flare-related reconnection. These\nobservations provide clear evidence of magnetic reconnection in the\nchromosphere and show the similar mechanisms of a microflare to those of major\nflares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 00:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-21"}

Next, the topological nature of the system is carefully examined and for\ntesting purposes, species density data are used in conjunction with data\nderived from liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry of proteins. We confirm\nthe induction of hierarchy and time through a one-dimensional probability space\nwith certain topologies. For further clarification of induced fractals\nincluding the relation to renormalization in physics, a theoretical development\nis proposed based on a newly identified fact, namely that scaling parameters\nfor magnetization exactly correspond to imaginary parts of the Riemann zeta\nfunction's nontrivial zeros. A master torus and a Lagrangian/Hamiltonian are\nderived expressing fractal structures as a solution for diminishing divergent\nterms in renormalization. We will also focus on an application of our developed\nmodel. We extend current PzDom model to the so-called exPzDom model to qualify\npopulation dynamics as a topological matter as a whole, not focusing on\nhierarchy. The indicators in the exPzDom model adhere well to the empirical\ndynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infected people and align appropriately with actual\npolicies instituted by the Japanese government. In our patch with zeta\ndominance (PzDom) model or its extended version (exPzDom), calculations only\nrequire knowledge of the density of individuals over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 03:24:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2016 06:01:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 16:11:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 10:26:12 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 05:20:48 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2017 06:47:35 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 28 Mar 2019 15:30:38 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 2019 07:14:20 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 16:23:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

This implies that\nvector boson fusion and associated vector boson production are in general\nsuppressed rendering conventional Higgs searches insensitive.

Most previous work either cannot be applied to scenarios where the\nsize of the map collection is large, or simply assumed that the robot\nself-location is globally known. In this paper, we tackle the problem of\nsimultaneous self-localization and change detection, by reformulating the\nproblem as a map retrieval problem, and propose a local map descriptor with a\ncompressed bag-of-words (BoW) structure as a scalable solution. We make the\nfollowing contributions. (1) To enable a direct comparison of the spatial\nlayout of visual features between different local maps, the origin of the local\nmap coordinate (termed \"viewpoint\") is planned by scene parsing and determined\nby our \"viewpoint planner\" to be invariant against small variations in\nself-location and changes, aiming at providing similar viewpoints for similar\nscenes (i.e., the relevant map pair). (2) We extend the BoW model to enable the\nuse of not only the appearance (e.g., polestar) but also the spatial layout\n(e.g., spatial pyramid) of visual features with respect to the planned\nviewpoint. The key observation is that the planned viewpoint (i.e., the origin\nof local map coordinate) acts as a pseudo viewpoint that is usually required by\nspatial BoW (e.g., SPM) and also by anomaly detection (e.g., NN-d, LOF). (3)\nExperimental results on a challenging \"loop-closing\" scenario show that the\nproposed method outperforms previous BoW methods in self-localization, and\nfurthermore, that the use of both appearance and pose information in change\ndetection produces better results than the use of either information alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 05:35:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-04"}

Results show that the canonical tack location of Jupiter\nat 1.5 AU is inconsistent with the most massive planet residing at 1 AU at\ngreater than 95% confidence. This favours a tack farther out at 2 AU for the\ndisc model and parameters employed.

The Z2\ndegeneracy they entail renders the existence of two decoupled Majorana modes at\nzero energy an exact property of a finite system at arbitrary values of its\nbulk parameters. We trace the evolution of these modes across the transition\nfrom the disordered phase to the ordered one and analyze the concomitant\nqualitative changes of local magnetic properties of an isolated impurity. In\nthe disordered phase, the two ground states differ only close to the impurity,\nand they are related by the action of an explicitly constructed quasi-local\noperator. In this phase the local transverse spin susceptibility follows a\nCurie law. The critical response of a boundary impurity is logarithmically\ndivergent and maps to the two-channel Kondo problem, while it saturates for\ncritical bulk impurities, as well as in the ordered phase. The results for the\nIsing chain translate to the related problem of a resonant level coupled to a\n1d p-wave superconductor or a Peierls chain, whereby the magnetic order is\nmapped to topological order. We find that the topological phase always exhibits\na continuous impurity response to local fields as a result of the level\nrepulsion of local levels from the boundary Majorana zero mode. In contrast,\nthe disordered phase generically features a discontinuous magnetization or\ncharging response. This difference constitutes a general thermodynamic\nfingerprint of topological order in phases with a bulk gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 09:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

We\nstudied its flaring activity close to the DSO/G2 pericenter passage to\nconstrain the physical properties and origin of the flares.\nSimultaneous/coordinated observations were made in 2014 Feb-Apr with\nXMM-Newton, HST/WFC3, VLT/SINFONI, VLA and CARMA. We detected 2 X-ray and 3 NIR\nflares on Mar. 10 and Apr. 2 with XMM-Newton and HST and 2 NIR flares on Apr. 3\nand 4 with VLT. The Mar. 10 X-ray flare has a long rise and a rapid decay. Its\nNIR counterpart peaked 4320s before the X-ray peak implying a variation in the\nX-ray-to-NIR flux ratio. This flare may be a single flare where change in the\nflux ratio is explained by the adiabatic compression of a plasmon or 2 close\nflares with simultaneous X-ray/NIR peaks. We observed an increase in the rising\nradio flux density on Mar. 10 with the VLA. It could be the delayed emission\nfrom a NIR/X-ray flare preceding our observation. The Apr. 2 X-ray flare\noccurred for HST in the Earth occultation of Sgr A*. We thus only observed the\nstart of its NIR counterpart. After the occultation, we observed the decay\nphase of a bright NIR flare with no X-ray counterpart. On Apr. 3, 2 CARMA\nflares were observed. The 1rst one may be the delayed emission of a VLT NIR\nflare. We thus observed 7 NIR flares whose 3 have an X-ray counterpart. We\nstudied the physical parameters of the flaring region for each NIR flare but\nnone of the possible radiative processes can be ruled out for the X-ray flares\ncreation. Our X-ray flaring rate is consistent with those observed in the 2012\nChandra XVP campaign. No increase in the flaring activity was thus triggered\nclose to the DSO/G2 pericenter passage. Moreover, higher X-ray flaring rates\nhad already been observed with no increase in the quiescent level. There is\nthus no direct link between an X-ray flaring-rate increase and an\naccretion-rate change.

Being able to use impression-level data, such as user cookies,\nencourages user behaviour targeting, and hence has significantly improved the\neffectiveness of ad campaigns. However, a fundamental drawback of RTB is its\ninstability because the bid decision is made per impression and there are\nenormous fluctuations in campaigns' key performance indicators (KPIs). As such,\nadvertisers face great difficulty in controlling their campaign performance\nagainst the associated costs. In this paper, we propose a feedback control\nmechanism for RTB which helps advertisers dynamically adjust the bids to\neffectively control the KPIs, e.g., the auction winning ratio and the effective\ncost per click. We further formulate an optimisation framework to show that the\nproposed feedback control mechanism also has the ability of optimising campaign\nperformance. By settling the effective cost per click at an optimal reference\nvalue, the number of campaign's ad clicks can be maximised with the budget\nconstraint. Our empirical study based on real-world data verifies the\neffectiveness and robustness of our RTB control system in various situations.\nThe proposed feedback control mechanism has also been deployed on a commercial\nRTB platform and the online test has shown its success in generating\ncontrollable advertising performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 11:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-04"}

Such an explosion mechanism is called the violent\nmerger scenario. Based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations\nof merging CO WDs, we derived more stringent critical mass ratio (qcr) leading\nto the violent merger scenario than the previous results.

Generally, the critical purpose of\ngraph-oriented learning algorithms is to construct an informative graph for\nimage clustering and classification tasks. In addition to the classical\n$K$-nearest-neighbor and $r$-neighborhood methods for graph construction,\n$l_1$-graph and its variants are emerging methods for finding the neighboring\nsamples of a center datum, where the corresponding ingoing edge weights are\nsimultaneously derived by the sparse reconstruction coefficients of the\nremaining samples. However, the pair-wise links of $l_1$-graph are not capable\nof capturing the high order relationships between the center datum and its\nprominent data in sparse reconstruction. Meanwhile, from the perspective of\nvariable selection, the $l_1$ norm sparse constraint, regarded as a LASSO\nmodel, tends to select only one datum from a group of data that are highly\ncorrelated and ignore the others. To simultaneously cope with these drawbacks,\nwe propose a new elastic net hypergraph learning model, which consists of two\nsteps. In the first step, the Robust Matrix Elastic Net model is constructed to\nfind the canonically related samples in a somewhat greedy way, achieving the\ngrouping effect by adding the $l_2$ penalty to the $l_1$ constraint. In the\nsecond step, hypergraph is used to represent the high order relationships\nbetween each datum and its prominent samples by regarding them as a hyperedge.\nSubsequently, hypergraph Laplacian matrix is constructed for further analysis.\nNew hypergraph learning algorithms, including unsupervised clustering and\nmulti-class semi-supervised classification, are then derived.

By maintaining the equal\ncomponents for the converted part and the residual part, the cylindrically\npolarized vortex beams carrying orbital angular momentum are experimentally\ndemonstrated based on a single metasurface at subwavelength scale.

Using asteroseismic techniques, it has recently become possible to\nprobe the internal rotation profile of low-mass (~1.1-1.5 Msun) subgiant and\nred giant stars. Under the assumption of local angular momentum conservation,\nthe core contraction and envelope expansion occurring at the end of the main\nsequence would result in a much larger internal differential rotation than\nobserved. This suggests that angular momentum redistribution must be taking\nplace in the interior of these stars. Aims. We investigate the physical nature\nof the angular momentum redistribution mechanisms operating in stellar\ninteriors by constraining the efficiency of post-main sequence rotational\ncoupling. Methods. We model the rotational evolution of a 1.25 Msun star using\nthe Yale Rotational stellar Evolution Code. Our models take into account the\nmagnetic wind braking occurring at the surface of the star and the angular\nmomentum transport in the interior, with an efficiency dependent on the degree\nof internal differential rotation. Results. We find that models including a\ndependence of the angular momentum transport efficiency on the radial\nrotational shear reproduce very well the observations. The best fit of the data\nis obtained with an angular momentum transport coefficient scaling with the\nratio of the rotation rate of the radiative interior over that of the\nconvective envelope of the star as a power law of exponent ~3. This scaling is\nconsistent with the predictions of recent numerical simulations of the\nAzimuthal Magneto-Rotational Instability. Conclusions.

A larger abundance of micrometre-sized grains leads to an overall\nheating of the disc, so that the water ice line moves further away from the\nstar. An increase in the water fraction inside the disc, maintaining a fixed\ndust abundance, increases the temperature in the icy regions of the disc and\nlowers the temperature in the inner regions. Discs with a larger silicate\nfraction have the opposite effect. Here we explore the consequence of the dust\ncomposition and abundance for the formation and migration of planets. We find\nthat discs with low water content can only sustain outwards migration for\nplanets up to 4 Earth masses, while outwards migration in discs with a larger\nwater content persists up to 8 Earth masses in the late stages of the disc\nevolution. Icy planetary cores that do not reach run-away gas accretion can\nthus migrate to orbits close to the host star if the water abundance is low.\nOur results imply that hot and warm super-Earths found in exoplanet surveys\ncould have formed beyond the ice line and thus contain a significant fraction\nin water. These water-rich super-Earths should orbit primarily around stars\nwith a low oxygen abundance, where a low oxygen abundance is caused by either a\nlow water-to-silicate ratio or by overall low metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 15:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

Therefore, designing new ways to control\nmagnetic anisotropy in technologically important materials is highly desirable.\nHere we show that magnetic anisotropy of epitaxial thin-films of half-metallic\nferromagnet La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_{3}$ (LSMO) is determined by the proximity\nto thermodynamic equilibrium conditions during growth. We performed a series of\nX-ray diffraction and ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) experiments in two\ndifferent sets of samples: the first corresponds to LSMO thin-films deposited\nunder tensile strain on (001) SrTiO$_{3}$ by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD; far\nfrom thermodynamic equilibrium); the second were deposited by a slow Chemical\nSolution Deposition (CSD) method, under quasi-equilibrium conditions. Thin\nfilms prepared by PLD show a in-plane cubic anisotropy with an overimposed\nuniaxial term. A large anisotropy constant perpendicular to the film plane was\nalso observed in these films. However, the uniaxial anisotropy is completely\nsuppressed in the CSD films. The out of plane anisotropy is also reduced,\nresulting in a much stronger in plane cubic anisotropy in the chemically\nsynthesized films. This change is due to a different rotation pattern of\nMnO$_{6}$ octahedra to accomodate epitaxial strain, which depends not only on\nthe amount of tensile stress imposed by the STO substrate, but also on the\ngrowth conditions. Our results demonstrate that the nature and magnitude of the\nmagnetic anisotropy in LSMO can be tuned by the thermodynamic parameters during\nthin-film deposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 15:21:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

In particular, cells close to the channel wall produce\nstrong flows which advect cells in the bulk against their swimming direction.\nWe examine in detail the transition from a disordered state to persistent\ndirected motion as a function of the channel width,and show that the width at\nthe crossover point is comparable to the typical correlation length of swirls\nseen in the unbounded system. Our results shed light on the mechanisms driving\nthe collective behaviour of bacteria and other active matter systems, and\nstress the importance of the ubiquitous boundaries found in natural habitats.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 15:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-04"}

More recently, isolated, highly dispersed pulses dubbed fast\nradio bursts (FRBs) have been identified as the potential signature of an\nextragalactic cataclysmic radio source distinct from pulsars and RRATs.\nClusterrank helped us discover 14 pulsars and 8 RRATs in data from the Arecibo\n327 MHz Drift Pulsar Survey (AO327). The new RRATs have DMs in the range $23.5\n- 86.6$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and periods in the range $0.172 - 3.901$ s.

The DMs of all\nnew discoveries are consistent with a Galactic origin. In comparing statistics\nof the new RRATs with sources from the RRATalog, we find that both sets are\ndrawn from the same period distribution.

Indeed, these\nsystems involve many parts and processes but are studied piecewise and their\nliteratures and data are consequently fragmented, distributed and sometimes--at\nleast apparently--inconsistent. This makes it extremely difficult to build\nsignificant explanatory models with the result that effects in these systems\nthat are brought about by many interacting factors are poorly understood.\n  The rule-based approach to modelling has shown some promise for the\nrepresentation of the highly combinatorial systems typically found in\nsignalling where many of the proteins are composed of multiple binding domains,\ncapable of simultaneous interactions, and/or peptide motifs controlled by\npost-translational modifications. However, the rule-based approach requires\nhighly detailed information about the precise conditions for each and every\ninteraction which is rarely available from any one single source. Rather, these\nconditions must be painstakingly inferred and curated, by hand, from\ninformation contained in many papers--each of which contains only part of the\nstory.\n  In this paper, we introduce a graph-based meta-model, attuned to the\nrepresentation of cellular signalling networks, which aims to ease this massive\ncognitive burden on the rule-based curation process. This meta-model is a\ngeneralization of that used by Kappa and BNGL which allows for the flexible\nrepresentation of knowledge at various levels of granularity. In particular, it\nallows us to deal with information which has either too little, or too much,\ndetail with respect to the strict rule-based meta-model. Our approach provides\na basis for the gradual aggregation of fragmented biological knowledge\nextracted from the literature into an instance of the meta-model from which we\ncan define an automated translation into executable Kappa programs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 05:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-22"}

One\nof its most serious malfunctions is the blackout, a catastrophic event that may\ndisrupt a substantial portion of the system, playing havoc to human life and\ncausing great economic losses. Thus, understanding the mechanisms leading to\nblackouts and creating a reliable and resilient power grid has been a major\nissue, attracting the attention of scientists, engineers and stakeholders. In\nthis paper, we study the blackout problem in power grids by considering a\npractical phase-oscillator model. This model allows one to simultaneously\nconsider different types of power sources (e.g., traditional AC power plants\nand renewable power sources connected by DC/AC inverters) and different types\nof loads (e.g., consumers connected to distribution networks and consumers\ndirectly connected to power plants).

The control strategies show the efficient function of the fast-response\nenergy storage systems in preventing and predicting blackouts in smart grids.\nThis work provides innovative ideas which help us to build up a robuster and\nmore economic smart power system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 13:39:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-07"}
