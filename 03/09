In this article we\nstudy, using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, the rotational and\ntranslational dynamical properties of water molecules confined in stacked\nphospholipid membranes at different levels of hydration, from poorly hydrated\nto a completely hydrated membrane. We find that both the translational and the\nreorientation dynamics of water are dramatically slowed down as the hydration\nis reduced. Analyzing in details the structure and dynamics of the hydrogen\nbond at the interface, we show that both those among water molecules and those\nbetween water and lipids slow down by decreasing the hydration, however the\nlatter are always slower than the former. By increasing hydration, water\nsaturates all the possible hydrogen bonds with the lipids and, by further\nincrease of hydration, the hydrogen bonds among waters becomes the majority.\nHowever, the dynamics of the water-lipids hydrogen bonds becomes up to one\norder of magnitude slower than that of the water-water hydrogen bonds, inducing\na large slowing down of the dynamics of the entire system even at large\nhydration level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2016 16:05:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

The spectral variations of the AIBs in this region are\nconnected to the chemical evolution of the PAH molecules which, in turn,\ndepends on the local physical conditions. We use the capabilities of SOFIA to\nobserve a 3.2' x 3.4' region of NGC 7023 at wavelengths that we observe with\nhigh spatial resolution (2.7\") at 3.3 and 11.2 um. We compare the SOFIA images\nwith existing images of the PAH emission at 8.0 um (Spitzer), emission from\nevaporating very small grains (eVSG) extracted from Spitzer-IRS spectral cubes,\nthe ERE (HST and CFHT), and H_2 (2.12 um). We create maps of the 11.2/3.3 um\nratio to probe the morphology of the PAH size distribution and the 8.0/11.2 um\nratio to probe the PAH ionization. We make use of an emission model and of\nvibrational spectra from the NASA Ames PAHdb to translate the 11.2/3.3 um ratio\nto PAH sizes. The 11.2/3.3 um map shows the smallest PAH concentrate on the PDR\nsurface (H_2 and extended red emission) in the NW and South PDR. We estimated\nthat PAHs in the NW PDR bear, on average, a number of carbon atoms (N_c) of ~70\nin the PDR cavity and ~50 at the PDR surface. In the entire nebula, the results\nreveal a factor of 2 variation in the size of the PAH.

The PAH size map enables us to\nfollow the photochemical evolution of PAHs in NGC 7023. Small PAHs result from\nthe photo-evaporation of VSGs as they reach the PDR surface.

Our main tool is n-fold integer programming, a recent\nvariable dimension technique which we believe to be highly relevant for the\nparameterized complexity community. This paper serves to showcase and highlight\nthis technique.\n  Specifically, we show the following four scheduling problems to be\nfixed-parameter tractable, where p max is the maximum processing time of a job\nand w max is the maximum weight of a job:\n  - Makespan minimization on uniformly related machines $(Q||C_{max} )$\nparameterized by $p_{max}$,\n  - Makespan minimization on unrelated machines $(R||C_{max} )$ parameterized\nby $p_{max}$ and the number of kinds of machines,\n  - Sum of weighted completion times minimization on unrelated machines $(R||\n\\sum w_i C_i )$ parameterized by $p_{max} + w_{max}$ and the number of kinds of\nmachines,\n  - The same problem, $(R|| \\sum w_i C_i),$ parameterized by the number of\ndistinct job times and the number of machines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2016 18:11:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2017 11:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-09"}

In this work we shed a new and fundamental light on optimal\nestimation procedures of risk measures in terms of bias. We show that once the\nparameters of a model need to be estimated, one has to take additional care\nwhen estimating risks. The typical plug-in approach, for example, introduces a\nbias which leads to a systematic underestimation of risk. In this regard, we\nintroduce a novel notion of unbiasedness to the estimation of risk which is\nmotivated by economic principles. In general, the proposed concept does not\ncoincide with the well-known statistical notion of unbiasedness. We show that\nan appropriate bias correction is available for many well-known estimators. In\nparticular, we consider value-at-risk and expected shortfall (tail\nvalue-at-risk). In the special case of normal distributions, closed-formed\nsolutions for unbiased estimators can be obtained. We present a number of\nmotivating examples which show the outperformance of unbiased estimators in\nmany circumstances.

For\nexample, they dominate the optical depth at short wavelengths and their\nsurfaces are the sites of many important chemical reactions such as the\nformation of water. Based on their aerodynamical properties (i.e., their strong\ndynamical coupling with the surrounding gas) it is often assumed that these\nsmall grains are well-mixed with the gas. Our goal is to study the vertical\n(re)distribution of grains taking into account settling, turbulent diffusion,\nas well as collisions with other dust grains. Assuming a fragmentation-limited\nbackground dust population, we developed a Monte Carlo approach that follows\nsingle monomers as they move through a vertical column of gas and become\nincorporated in different aggregates as they undergo sticking and fragmenting\ncollisions. We find that (sub)micron grains are not necessarily well-mixed\nvertically, but can become trapped in a thin layer with a scale-height that is\nsignificantly smaller than that of the gas. This collisional trapping occurs\nwhen the timescale for diffusion is comparable to or longer than the collision\ntimescale in the midplane and its effect is strongest when the most massive\nparticles in the size-distribution show significant settling. Based on\nsimulations and analytical considerations we conclude that for typical\ndust-to-gas ratios and turbulence levels, the collisional trapping of small\ngrains should be a relatively common phenomenon.

We aim to obtain and\ncalibrate the relation between Teff and the $\\rm ^{12}CO$ first overtone bands\nfor M giants in the galactic Bulge covering a wide range in metallicity.

The important factor\nthat controls the efficiency of EGO is the GP covariance function (or kernel)\nwhich should be chosen according to the objective function. Traditionally, a\npa-rameterized family of covariance functions is considered whose parameters\nare learned through statistical procedures such as maximum likelihood or\ncross-validation. However, it may be questioned whether statistical procedures\nfor learning covariance functions are the most efficient for optimization as\nthey target a global agreement between the GP and the observations which is not\nthe ultimate goal of optimization. Furthermore, statistical learning procedures\nare computationally expensive. The main alternative to the statistical learning\nof the GP is self-adaptation, where the algorithm tunes the kernel parameters\nbased on their contribution to objective function improvement. After\nquestioning the possibility of self-adaptation for kriging based optimizers,\nthis paper proposes a novel approach for tuning the length-scale of the GP in\nEGO: At each iteration, a small ensemble of kriging models structured by their\nlength-scales is created. All of the models contribute to an iterate in an\nEGO-like fashion. Then, the set of models is densified around the model whose\nlength-scale yielded the best iterate and further points are produced.\nNumerical experiments are provided which motivate the use of many\nlength-scales.

The most\nstraightforward interpretation leads to a direct detection of our peculiar\nvelocity $\\beta$, consistent with the measurement of the well-known dipole. In\nthis paper we discuss the assumptions behind such interpretation. We show that\nDoppler-like couplings appear from two effects: our peculiar velocity and a\nsecond order large-scale effect due to the dipolar part of the gravitational\npotential. We find that the two effects are exactly degenerate but only if we\nassume second-order initial conditions from single-field Inflation. Thus,\ndetecting a discrepancy in the value of $\\beta$ from the dipole and the Doppler\ncouplings implies the presence of a primordial non-Gaussianity. We also show\nthat aberration-like signals likewise arise from two independent effects: our\npeculiar velocity and lensing due to a first order large-scale dipolar\ngravitational potential, independently on Gaussianity of the initial\nconditions.

The\nenhancement is called spin resonance for a spin fluctuation model, in which\ntheir energy is restricted below twice the superconducting gap value (2Ds),\nwhereas larger energies are possible in other models such as an orbital\nfluctuation model.

Here we present the first microwave imaging study of\na hot flux rope structure during the pre-impulsive stage of an eruptive M7.7\nsolar flare, with the Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) at 17 GHz. The flux rope\nis also observed by the SDO/AIA in its hot passbands of 94 and 131 \\AA\\. In the\nmicrowave data, it is revealed as an overall arcade-like structure consisting\nof several intensity enhancements bridged by generally weak emissions, with\nbrightness temperatures ($T_B$) varying from ~10,000~K to ~20,000 K. Locations\nof microwave intensity enhancements along the structure remain relatively fixed\nat certain specific parts of the flux rope, indicating that the distribution of\nemitting electrons is affected by the large scale magnetic configuration of the\ntwisted flux rope. Wavelet analysis shows a pronounced 2-min period of the\nmicrowave $T_B$ variation during the pre-impulsive stage of interest. The\nperiod agrees well with that reported for AIA sunward-contracting loops and\nupward ejective plasmoids (suggested to be reconnection outflows). This\nsuggests that both periodicities are controlled by the same reconnection\nprocess that takes place intermittently at a 2-min time scale. We infer that at\nleast a part of the emission is excited by non-thermal energetic electrons via\nthe gyro-synchrotron mechanism. The study demonstrates the potential of\nmicrowave imaging in exploring the flux rope magnetic geometry and relevant\nreconnection process during the onset of solar eruption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 03:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

NUFB satisfying linear phase property for all the constituent\nfilters, are desirable in applications such as speech and image processing and\nin communication. This paper proposes a novel design of non-uniform modified\ndiscrete fourier transform filter bank (MDFT FB). Here, each non-uniform\nchannel is obtained by merging the nearby channels of a uniform MDFT FB. The\nreported works of non-uniform cosine modulated filter banks (CMFBs) do not\nsatisfy linear phase property for all the constituent filters. In this work, we\nintroduce the design of a non-uniform MDFT FB which satisfies linear phase\nproperty for all the constituent filters. The proposed design of the\nnon-uniform MDFT FB is checked utilizing the alias cancellation among the\nchannels, distortion and flatness condition of the channels. A condition is\nderived to find the channels when merged with adjacent channels, will cause\naliasing in M channels. In the design and implementation of the proposed\nnon-uniform MDFT FB, the structure of the uniform MDFT filter bank is preserved\nand hence all the advantages of MDFT FB over the DFT filter bank, are\nguaranteed. Hence without increasing the design complexity, the non-uniform\nMDFT FB is designed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 04:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-10"}

To reveal the heterogeneous dynamics in the\nmodel systems, we examine spatial distributions of displacement and time\ndistributions of exchange and persistence times.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the effects of compressibility on the atmospheric dynamics by\nsolving the standard Euler equations. This is done by means of a series of\nsimulations performed in the framework of the equatorial beta-plane\napproximation using the finite volume shock-capturing code RAMSES. At low\nresolution, we recover the classical results described in the literature: we\nfind a strong and steady supersonic equatorial jet of a few km/s that displays\nno signature of shocks. We next show that the jet zonal velocity depends\nsignificantly on the grid meridional resolution. When that resolution is fine\nenough to properly resolve the jet, the latter is subject to a Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability. The jet zonal mean velocity displays regular oscillations with a\ntypical timescale of few days and a significant amplitude of about 15% of the\njet velocity. We also find compelling evidence for the development of a\nvertical shear instability at pressure levels of a few bars. It seems to be\nresponsible for an increased downward kinetic energy flux, significantly\naffecting the temperature of the deep atmosphere, and appears to act as a form\nof drag on the equatorial jet. This instability also creates velocity\nfluctuations that propagate upward and steepen into weak shocks at pressure\nlevels of a few mbars. We conclude that hot Jupiter equatorial jets are\npotentially unstable to both a barotropic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and a\nvertical shear instability. Upon confirmation using more realistic models, both\ninstabilities could result in significant time variability of the atmospheric\nwinds, may provide a small scale dissipation mechanism in the flow, and might\nhave consequences for the internal evolution of hot Jupiters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 07:25:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 06:19:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}

We\ndescribe these categories and show how a permutation on $X$ gives rise to a\ncross-connection. Further we prove that every cross-connection between them is\ninduced by a permutation and construct the regular semigroups that arise from\nthe cross-connections.

This study sheds light into the more general\ntheory of cross-connections and also provides an alternate way of studying the\nstructure of $Sing(X)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 07:37:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2017 23:20:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 23:21:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

At one extreme, it has been argued that neurons encode information\nin relatively slow changes of individual spikes arriving \"rates codes\" and the\nirregularity in the spike trains reflects noise in the system, while in the\nother extreme this irregularity is the temporal codes thus the precise timing\nof every spike carries additional information about the input. It is known that\nin the estimation of Shannon information the patterns and temporal structures\nare taken into account, while the rate code is determined by firing rate. We\ncompare these types of codes for binary Information Sources which model encoded\nspike-trains. Assuming that the information transmitted by a neuron is governed\nby uncorrelated stochastic process or by process with a memory we compare the\ninformation transmission rates carried by such spike-trains with their firing\nrates. We showed that the crucial role in the relation between information and\nfiring rates is played by a quantity which we call \"jumping\" parameter. It\ncorresponds to the probabilities of transitions from no-spike-state to the\nspike-state and vice versa. For low values of jumping parameter the quotient of\ninformation and firing rates is monotonically decreasing function of firing\nrate, thus there is straightforward, one-to-one, relation between temporal and\nrate codes. On the contrary, it turns out that for large enough jumping\nparameter this quotient is non-monotonic function of firing rate and it\nexhibits a global maximum, in this case optimal firing rate exists. Moreover,\nthere is no one-to-one relation between information and firing rates, so the\ntemporal and rate codes differ qualitatively. This leads to the observation\nthat the behavior of the quotient of information and firing rates for large\njumping parameter is important in the context of bursting phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 07:38:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-10"}

KECA roughly reduces to a\nsorting of the importance of kernel eigenvectors by entropy instead of by\nvariance as in Kernel Principal Components Analysis. In this work, we propose\nan extension of the KECA method, named Optimized KECA (OKECA), that directly\nextracts the optimal features retaining most of the data entropy by means of\ncompacting the information in very few features (often in just one or two). The\nproposed method produces features which have higher expressive power. In\nparticular, it is based on the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) framework,\nand introduces an extra rotation to the eigen-decomposition, which is optimized\nvia gradient ascent search. This maximum entropy preservation suggests that\nOKECA features are more efficient than KECA features for density estimation. In\naddition, a critical issue in both methods is the selection of the kernel\nparameter since it critically affects the resulting performance. Here we\nanalyze the most common kernel length-scale selection criteria. Results of both\nmethods are illustrated in different synthetic and real problems. Results show\nthat 1) OKECA returns projections with more expressive power than KECA, 2) the\nmost successful rule for estimating the kernel parameter is based on maximum\nlikelihood, and 3) OKECA is more robust to the selection of the length-scale\nparameter in kernel density estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 08:09:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-10"}

The Weibel instability occurs in the\nplasma if there is an anisotropy in the particle distribution function of the\nparticles. In early universe, the velocity anisotropy required for Weibel\ninstability to operate is generated in the quark gluon plasma by the collapse\nof closed $Z(3)$ domain walls that arise in the deconfined phase of the QCD\n(above $T\\sim 200$ MeV). Such large domains can arise in the context of certain\nlow energy scale inflationary models.

This results in a two stream Weibel\ninstability in the ultra-relativistic quark gluon plasma. The instability in\nturn generates strong magnetic fields in the plasma.

Typically these\nare opposing design goals. For modern radio telescopes operating in the HF\n(3-30 MHz) and VHF-low (30-88 MHz) bands, the problem is more nuanced in that\nfront end noise temperature may be a relatively small component of the system\ntemperature, and increased linearity may be required due to the particular\ninterference problems associated with this spectrum. In this paper we present\nan analysis of the sensitivity-linearity trade off at these frequencies,\napplicable to existing commercially-available monolithic microwave integrated\ncircuit (MMIC) amplifiers in single-ended, differential, and parallelized\nconfigurations. This analysis and associated findings should be useful in the\ndesign and upgrade of front ends for low frequency radio telescopes. The\nanalysis is demonstrated explicitly for one of the better-performing amplifiers\nencountered in this study, the Mini-Circuits PGA-103, and is confirmed by\nhardware measurements. We also present a design based on the Mini-Circuits\nHELA-10 amplifier, which is better-suited for applications where linearity is a\nprimary concern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 12:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-10"}

This system provides\nevidence of the feasibility of brain signals being a viable approach to\ncontrolling the chosen prosthetic. Results are then presented in the second\nframework. This latter one allowed for the training and classification of EEG\nsignals for motor imagery tasks. When analysing the system, clear visual\nrepresentations of the performance and accuracy are presented in the results\nusing a confusion matrix, accuracy measurement and a feedback bar signifying\nsignal strength. Experiments with various acquisition datasets were carried out\nand with a critical evaluation of the results given. Finally depending on the\nclassification of the brain signal a Python script outputs the driving command\nto the Arduino to control the prosthetic.

This work is motivated by the\nprevalence of memory effects observed across a wide range of geometrically\nfrustrated magnetic materials, possibly including the spontaneous Hall effect\nobserved in Pr2Ir2O7. Our model is canonical spin-ice model on the pyrochlore\nlattice, where farther-neighbour spin couplings give rise to a nearest-neighbor\ninteraction between topological defects which can easily be chosen to be\nunnatural or not, i.e. attractive or repulsive between defects of equal gauge\ncharge. Among the novel features of this model are the following. After\napplying a field quench, a rich dynamical approach to equilibrium emerges,\ndominated by multi-scale energy barriers responsible for long-lived\nmagnetization plateaux. These even allow for the metastability of a\n\"fragmented\" spin liquid, an elusive regime where partial order co-exists with\na spin liquid. Perhaps most strikingly, the attraction produces clusters of\ndefects whose stability is due to a combination of energetic barriers for their\nbreak-up and proximity of opposite charges along with an entropic barrier\ngenerated by the topological requirement of annihilating a defect only together\nwith an oppositely charged counterpart. These clusters may take the form of a\n\"jellyfish\" spin texture, comprising an arrangement of same-sign gauge-charges,\ncentered on a hexagonal ring with branches of arbitrary length. The ring\ncarries a clockwise or counterclockwise circular flow of magnetisation. This\nemergent toroidal degrees of freedom provides a possibility for time reversal\nsymmetry breaking with possible relevance to the spontaneous Hall effect\nobserved in Pr2Ir2O7.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 12:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}

The blackbody radiation that these\nplanets emit as they cool may provide the means for their detection. Here we\nuse an analytical toy model to study the cooling and radiation of isolated\nNeptunes. This model can translate a detection (or a null detection) to a\nconstraint on the size and composition of the hypothesized \"Planet Nine\".\nSpecifically, the thick gas atmosphere of Neptune-like planets serves as an\ninsulating blanket which slows down their cooling. Therefore, a measurement of\nthe blackbody temperature, $T_{\\rm eff}\\sim 50\\textrm{K}$, at which a Neptune\nemits can be used to estimate the mass of its atmosphere, $M_{\\rm atm}$.\nExplicitly, we find the relation $T_{\\rm eff}\\propto M_{\\rm atm}^{1/12}$.\nDespite this weak relation, a measurement of the flux at the Wien tail can\nconstrain the atmospheric mass, at least to within a factor of a few, and\nprovide useful limits to possible formation scenarios of these planets.\nFinally, we constrain the size and composition of Planet Nine by combining our\nmodel with the null results of recent all-sky surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 13:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

In experimental astrophysics, the\nhigh reactivity of atoms also constitutes an obstacle to measuring two of the\nfundamental properties in surface physics, namely desorption and diffusion\nenergies, and so far direct measurements are non-existent for O and N atoms. We\ninvestigated the diffusion and desorption processes of O and N atoms on cold\nsurfaces in order to give boundary conditions to astrochemical models.

In particular, these sequences have been tied to memory\nformation and spatial navigation in the hippocampus, a region of mammalian\nbrains. Traditionally, neuronal sequences have been interpreted as noisy\nmanifestations of neuronal templates (i.e., orderings), ignoring much richer\nstructure contained in the sequences. This paper introduces a new tool for\nunderstanding neuronal sequences: the bias matrix. The bias matrix captures the\nprobabilistic tendency of each neuron to fire before or after each other\nneuron. Despite considering only pairs of neurons, the bias matrix captures the\nbest total ordering of neurons for a sequence (Proposition 3.3) and, thus,\ngeneralizes the concept of a neuronal template.\n  We establish basic mathematical properties of bias matrices, in particular\ndescribing the fundamental polytope in which all biases reside (Theorem 3.25).\nWe show how the underlying simple digraph of a bias matrix, which we term the\nbias network, serves as a combinatorial generalization of neuronal templates.\nSurprisingly, every simple digraph is realizable as the bias network of some\nsequence (Theorem 3.34). The bias-matrix representation leads us to a natural\nmethod for sequence correlation, which then leads to a probabilistic framework\nfor determining the similarity of one set of sequences to another. Using data\nfrom rat hippocampus, we describe events of interest and also\nsequence-detection techniques. Finally, the bias matrix and the similarity\nmeasure are applied to this real-world data using code developed by us.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 15:18:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-10"}

Instead {\\it beyond} the mean-field\napproximation the theory predicts that the transition is avoided and\ntransformed into a crossover, as observed in experiments and simulations. To go\nbeyond mean-field a standard perturbative loop expansion is performed at first.\nApproaching the ideal critical point this expansion is divergent at all orders\nand I show that the leading divergent term at any given order is the same of a\ndynamical stochastic equation, called Stochastic-Beta-Relaxation (SBR) in {\\it\nEPL 106, 56003 (2014)}. At variance with the original theory SBR can be studied\nbeyond mean-field directly, without the need to resort to a perturbative\nexpansion. Thus it provides a qualitative and quantitative description of the\ndynamical crossover. For consistency reasons it is important to establish the\nconnection between the dynamical field theory and SBR beyond perturbation\ntheory. This can be done with the help of a stronger result: the dynamical\nfield theory is {\\it exactly} equivalent to a theory with quenched disorder.\nQualitatively the non-perturbative mechanism leading to the crossover is\ntherefore the same of SBR. Quantitatively SBR corresponds to make the\nmean-field approximation once the quenched disorder has been generated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 15:43:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 09:33:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 15:46:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-08"}

Most previously\nproposed algorithms for bias estimation rely on local measurements in\ncentralized systems or tracks in distributed systems, along with additional\ninformation like covariances, filter gains or targets of opportunity. In\naddition, it is generally assumed that such data are made available to the\nfusion center at every sampling time. In practical distributed multisensor\ntracking systems, where each platform sends local tracks to the fusion center,\nonly state estimates and, perhaps, their covariances are sent to the fusion\ncenter at non-consecutive sampling instants or scans. That is, not all the\ninformation required for exact bias estimation at the fusion center is\navailable in practical distributed tracking systems. In this paper, a new\nalgorithm that is capable of accurately estimating the biases even in the\nabsence of filter gain information from local platforms is proposed for\ndistributed tracking systems with intermittent track transmission. Through the\ncalculation of the Posterior Cram\\'er--Rao lower bound and various simulation\nresults, it is shown that the performance of the new algorithm, which uses the\ntracklet idea and does not require track transmission at every sampling time or\nexchange of filter gains, can approach the performance of the exact bias\nestimation algorithm that requires local filter gains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 14:59:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

As in the case of radar tracking, the presence of offset or\nposition biases can exacerbate the challenges in bearing--only estimation.\nModeling various sensor biases is not a trivial task and not much has been done\nin the literature specifically for bearing--only tracking. This paper addresses\nthe modeling of offset biases in bearing--only sensors and the ensuing\nmultitarget tracking with bias compensation. Bias estimation is handled at the\nfusion node to which individual sensors report their local tracks in the form\nof associated measurement reports (AMR) or angle-only tracks. The modeling is\nbased on a multisensor approach that can effectively handle a time--varying\nnumber of targets in the surveillance region. The proposed algorithm leads to a\nmaximum likelihood bias estimator. The corresponding Cram\\'er--Rao Lower Bound\nto quantify the theoretical accuracy that can be achieved by the proposed\nmethod or any other algorithm is also derived. Finally, simulation results on\ndifferent distributed tracking scenarios are presented to demonstrate the\ncapabilities of the proposed approach.

As temperature increases from zero to large\nvalues, a stepwise behaviour of the axial current density as a function of\nchemical potential is changed to a smooth one; the choice of a boundary\ncondition can facilitate either amplification or diminution of the chiral\nseparation effect. This points at a significant role of boundaries for physical\nsystems with hot dense magnetized relativistic spinor matter, e.g., compact\nstars, heavy-ion collisions, novel materials known as Dirac and Weyl\nsemimetals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2016 19:38:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2016 12:03:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}
