Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to obtain a\nlow-dimensional representation of the shape variation in terms of the leading\nprincipal components. In this paper, we propose a generalization of SSMs,\ncalled Gaussian Process Morphable Models (GPMMs). We model the shape variations\nwith a Gaussian process, which we represent using the leading components of its\nKarhunen-Loeve expansion. To compute the expansion, we make use of an\napproximation scheme based on the Nystrom method. The resulting model can be\nseen as a continuous analogon of an SSM. However, while for SSMs the shape\nvariation is restricted to the span of the example data, with GPMMs we can\ndefine the shape variation using any Gaussian process. For example, we can\nbuild shape models that correspond to classical spline models, and thus do not\nrequire any example data. Furthermore, Gaussian processes make it possible to\ncombine different models. For example, an SSM can be extended with a spline\nmodel, to obtain a model that incorporates learned shape characteristics, but\nis flexible enough to explain shapes that cannot be represented by the SSM. We\nintroduce a simple algorithm for fitting a GPMM to a surface or image. This\nresults in a non-rigid registration approach, whose regularization properties\nare defined by a GPMM. We show how we can obtain different registration\nschemes,including methods for multi-scale, spatially-varying or hybrid\nregistration, by constructing an appropriate GPMM. As our approach strictly\nseparates modelling from the fitting process, this is all achieved without\nchanges to the fitting algorithm. We show the applicability and versatility of\nGPMMs on a clinical use case, where the goal is the model-based segmentation of\n3D forearm images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 16:19:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-24"}

Transition disks, i.e., disks with large dust cavities and\ngaps, are promising candidates of active evolution. About two dozen\nSED-selected candidates have been confirmed to have dust cavities through\nmillimeter interferometric imaging, but this sample is biased towards the\nbrightest disks. The Spitzer surveys of nearby low-mass star forming regions\nhave resulted in more than 4000 Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). Using color\ncriteria we have selected a sample of ~150 candidates, and an additional 40\ncandidates and known transition disks from the literature. The Spitzer data\nwere complemented by new observations at longer wavelengths, including new JCMT\nand APEX submillimeter photometry, and WISE and Herschel-PACS mid and\nfar-infrared photometry. Furthermore, optical spectroscopy was obtained and\nstellar types were derived for 85% of the sample, including information from\nthe literature. The SEDs were fit to a grid of RADMC-3D disk models with a\nlimited number of parameters: disk mass, inner disk mass, scale height and\nflaring, and disk cavity radius, where the latter is the main parameter of\ninterest. A large fraction of the targets possibly have dust cavities based on\nthe SED. The derived cavity sizes are consistent with imaging/modeling results\nin the literature, where available. Trends are found with Ldisk/Lstar and\nstellar mass and a possible connection with exoplanet orbital radii. A\ncomparison with a previous study where color observables are used (Cieza et al.\n2010) reveals large overlap between their category of planet-forming disks and\nour transition disks with cavities.

The flaring process is found to\ninvolve interaction between a small and a big loop and the accelerated\nparticles divided in roughly equal numbers between them. Precipitation of the\nelectrons from the small loop produced only weak thermal response because the\nloop volume was small, while the electrons trapped in the big loop lost most of\ntheir energy in the coronal part of the loop, which resulted in the coronal\nplasma heating but no or only weak chromospheric evaporation, and thus\nunusually weak soft X-ray emission. Energy losses of fast electrons in the big\ntenuous loop were slow resulting in the observed delay of the plasma heating.\nWe determined that the impulsively accelerated electron population had a beamed\nangular distribution in the direction of electric force along the magnetic\nfield of the small loop. The accelerated particle transport in big loop was\nprimarily mediated by turbulent waves like in the other reported cold flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 17:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

These old recordings together with published and new data show that for\nat least half a century the star was in a low luminosity state, with B ~18.\nAfter 1960, five large variability cycles of visual luminosity were recorded.\nThe amplitude of the oscillations was seen increasing towards the 1992-1994\nmaximum, then decreasing during the last maxima. The recent light curve\nindicates that the photometric variations have been quite similar in all the\nbands, and that the B-V color index has been constant within +/-0.1 m despite\nthe 1.5m change of the visual luminosity. The spectrum of GR 290 at the large\nmaximum of 1992-94, was equivalent to late-B type, while, during 2002-2014, it\nhas varied between WN10h-11h near the visual maxima to WN8h-9h at the\nluminosity minima.

The bolometric luminosity of the star was not\nconstant, but increased by a factor of ~1.5 between minimum and maximum\nluminosity, in phase with the apparent luminosity variations. In the light of\ncurrent evolutionary models of very massive stars, we find that GR 290 has\nevolved from a ~60 M_Sun progenitor star and should have an age of about 4\nmillion years.

Today,\nproperties in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) are of interest for molecular\nspectroscopy applications. In particular, high-sensitivity spectroscopic\ntechniques based on high-finesse mid-IR cavities hold high promise for medical\napplications. Due to exceptional purity and low losses, whispering gallery mode\nmicroresonators based on polished alkaline earth metal fluoride crystals (i.e\nthe $\\mathrm{XF_2}$ family, where X $=$ Ca, Mg, Ba, Sr,...) have attained\nultra-high quality (Q) factor resonances (Q$>$10$^{8}$) in the near-IR and\nvisible spectral ranges. Here we report for the first time ultra-high Q factors\nin the mid-IR using crystalline microresonators. Using an uncoated chalcogenide\n(ChG) tapered fiber, light from a continuous wave quantum cascade laser (QCL)\nis efficiently coupled to several crystalline microresonators at 4.4 $\\mu$m\nwavelength. We measure the optical Q factor of fluoride crystals in the mid-IR\nusing cavity ringdown technique. We observe that $\\mathrm{MgF_2}$\nmicroresonators feature quality factors that are very close to the fundamental\nabsorption limit, as caused by the crystal's multiphonon absorption\n(Q$\\sim$10$^{7}$), in contrast to near-IR measurements far away from these\nfundamental limits. Due to lower multiphonon absorption in $\\mathrm{BaF_2}$ and\n$\\mathrm{SrF_2}$, we show that ultra-high quality factors of Q $\\geqslant$ 1.4\n$\\times 10^{8}$ can be reached at 4.4 $\\mu$m. This corresponds to an optical\nfinesse of $\\mathcal{F}>$4$\\cdot$ 10$^{4}$, the highest value achieved for any\ntype of mid-IR resonator to date, and a more than 10-fold improvement over the\nstate-of-the-art. Such compact ultra-high Q crystalline microresonators provide\na route for narrow linewidth frequency-stabilized QCL or mid-IR Kerr comb\ngeneration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 19:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

One of the most interesting\ncauses of TTVs is the gravitational interaction between planets. Here we\nconsider a case of two planets in a mean motion resonance (orbital periods in a\nratio of small integers). This case is important because the resonant\ninteraction can amplify the TTV effect and allow planets to be detected more\neasily. We develop an analytic model of the resonant dynamics valid for small\norbital eccentricities and use it to derive the principal TTV terms. We find\nthat a resonant system should show TTV terms with two basic periods (and their\nharmonics). The resonant TTV period is proportional (m/M_*)^(-2/3), where m and\nM_* are the planetary and stellar masses. For m=10^(-4) M_*, for example, the\nTTV period exceeds the orbital period by ~2 orders of magnitude. The amplitude\nof the resonant TTV terms scales linearly with the libration amplitude. The\nratio of the TTV amplitudes of two resonant planets is inversely proportional\nto the ratio of their masses. These and other relationships discussed in the\nmain text can be used to aid the interpretation of TTV observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 19:09:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

Before that the source was little studied in different\nwavelengths. Therefore a multi-wavelength (MWL) campaign was organized in\nspring 2008. Along MAGIC, the MWL campaign included the Metsahovi radio\nobservatory, Bell and KVA optical telescopes and the Swift and AGILE\nsatellites. MAGIC observations span from March to May, 2008 for a total of 27.9\nhours, of which 19.4 hours remained after quality cuts. The light curve showed\nno significant variability. The differential VHE spectrum could be described\nwith a power-law function. Both results were similar to those obtained during\nthe discovery. Swift XRT observations revealed an X-ray flare, characterized by\na harder when brighter trend, as is typical for high synchrotron peak BL Lac\nobjects (HBL). Strong optical variability was found during the campaign, but no\nconclusion on the connection between the optical and VHE gamma-ray bands could\nbe drawn. The contemporaneous SED shows a synchrotron dominated source, unlike\nconcluded in previous work based on nonsimultaneous data, and is well described\nby a standard one zone synchrotron self Compton model. We also performed a\nstudy on the source classification. While the optical and X-ray data taken\nduring our campaign show typical characteristics of an HBL, we suggest, based\non archival data, that 1ES 1011+496 is actually a borderline case between\nintermediate and high synchrotron peak frequency BL Lac objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 19:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-17"}

For DM mass $m\\sim10^{-22}{\\rm eV}$, this scenario\ndelays galaxy formation and avoids cusps in the center of the dark matter\nhaloes. We use new measurements of half-light mass in ultra-faint dwarf\ngalaxies Draco II and Triangulum II to estimate the mass of the DM particle in\nthis model. We find that if the stellar populations are within the core of the\ndensity profile then the data are in agreement with a wave dark matter model\nhaving a DM particle with $m\\sim 3.7-5.6\\times 10^{-22}{\\rm eV}$. The presence\nof this extremely light particle will contribute to the formation of a central\nsolitonic core replacing the cusp of a Navarro-Frenk-White profile and bringing\npredictions closer to observations of cored central density in dwarf galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 19:54:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 09:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

Empirical observations in practical systems suggest that the task\nservice times are highly random and the job service time is bottlenecked by the\nslowest straggling task. One common solution for straggler mitigation is to\nreplicate a task on multiple servers and wait for one replica of the task to\nfinish early. The delay performance of replications depends heavily on the\nscheduling decisions of when to replicate, which servers to replicate on, and\nwhich job to serve first. So far, little is understood on how to optimize these\nscheduling decisions for minimizing the delay to complete the jobs. In this\npaper, we present a comprehensive study on delay-optimal scheduling of\nreplications in both centralized and distributed multi-server systems.\nLow-complexity scheduling policies are designed and are proven to be\ndelay-optimal or near delay-optimal in stochastic ordering among all causal and\nnon-preemptive policies.

The\nstreaming patterns are responsible for a net circulation in the flow which are\nreminiscent of convection cells. In this article, we analyse these streaming\nflows by conducting experiments in a Faraday-wave setup. To visualize the\nflows, tracers are used to generate both trajectory maps and to probe the\nstreaming velocity field via Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). We identify\nthree types of patterns and experimentally show that identical Faraday waves\ncan mask streaming patterns that are qualitatively very different.

This is accomplished by a differential threshold logic\ngate (TLG). A TLG with $n$ inputs implements a subset of Boolean functions of\n$n$ variables that are linear threshold functions. The output of such a gate is\none if and only if an integer weighted linear arithmetic sum of the inputs\nequals or exceeds a given integer threshold. We present a novel architecture of\na TLG that not only allows a single TLG to implement a large number of complex\nlogic functions, which would require multiple levels of logic when implemented\nusing conventional logic primitives, but also allows the selection of that\nsubset of functions by assignment of the transistor threshold voltages to the\ninput transistors. To obfuscate the functionality of the TLG, weights of some\ninputs are set to zero by setting their device threshold to be a high $V_t$.\nThe threshold voltage of the remaining transistors is set to low $V_t$ to\nincrease their transconductance. The function of a TLG is not determined by the\ncell itself but rather the signals that are connected to its inputs. This makes\nit possible to hide the support set of the function by essentially removing\nsome variable from the support set of the function by selective assignment of\nhigh and low $V_t$ to the input transistors. We describe how a standard cell\nlibrary of TLGs can be mixed with conventional standard cells to realize\ncomplex logic circuits, whose function can never be discovered by reverse\nengineering.

When the magnetic field is present, the thermal\nconduction is anisotropic and energy transport is along magnetic field lines.\nIn this paper, we study the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction on the\nwind production in hot accretion flows by performing two-dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations.

But the energy flux of wind can be\nincreased by a factor of $\\sim 10$ due to the increase of wind velocity when\nthermal conduction is included.

This\nnew interest is based on three key properties: their high spatiotemporal\ncomplexity (information capacity), the important role of disorder, and complex\nintermodal interactions. To date, phenomena in MMFs have been studied only in\nlimiting cases where one or more of these properties can be neglected. Here we\nstudy MMFs in a regime in which all these elements are integral.

However, global and local\nsurrounding contexts that are believed to be valuable for object detection are\nnot fully exploited by existing methods yet. In this work, we take a step\ntowards understanding what is a robust practice to extract and utilize\ncontextual information to facilitate object detection in practice.\nSpecifically, we consider the following two questions: \"how to identify useful\nglobal contextual information for detecting a certain object?\" and \"how to\nexploit local context surrounding a proposal for better inferring its\ncontents?\". We provide preliminary answers to these questions through\ndeveloping a novel Attention to Context Convolution Neural Network (AC-CNN)\nbased object detection model. AC-CNN effectively incorporates global and local\ncontextual information into the region-based CNN (e.g. Fast RCNN) detection\nmodel and provides better object detection performance. It consists of one\nattention-based global contextualized (AGC) sub-network and one multi-scale\nlocal contextualized (MLC) sub-network. To capture global context, the AGC\nsub-network recurrently generates an attention map for an input image to\nhighlight useful global contextual locations, through multiple stacked Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. For capturing surrounding local context, the\nMLC sub-network exploits both the inside and outside contextual information of\neach specific proposal at multiple scales. The global and local context are\nthen fused together for making the final decision for detection. Extensive\nexperiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 and VOC 2012 well demonstrate the superiority of\nthe proposed AC-CNN over well-established baselines. In particular, AC-CNN\noutperforms the popular Fast-RCNN by 2.0% and 2.2% on VOC 2007 and VOC 2012 in\nterms of mAP, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2016 02:18:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-25"}

In this work, by first-principles calculation, we found the\npolar distortion in the lone-pair driven ferroelectric material PbTiO$_3$ can\nnot only persist, but also increase with electron doping. We further analyzed\nthe mechanisms of the persisting of the polar distortion. We found that the Ti\nsite polar instability is suppressed but the Pb site polar instability is\nintact with the electron doping. The Pb-site instability is due to the\nlone-pair mechanism which can be viewed as a pseudo-Jahn-Teller effect, a mix\nof the ground state and the excited state by ion displacement from the central\nsymmetric position. The lone-pair mechanism is not strongly affected by the\nelectron doping because neither the ground state or the excited state involved\nis at the Fermi energy.

DEFE can be viewed as a deep ensemble learning scheme that\ntrains a strongly diverse set of neural feature learners without explicitly\nencouraging diversity and penalizing correlations. This is achieved by adopting\nan implicit neural controller (not involved in feedforward compuation) that\ndirectly controls and distributes gradient flows from higher level deep\nprediction network. Such model-independent controller results in that every\nsingle local feature learned are used in the feature-to-output mapping stage,\navoiding the blind averaging of features. DEFE makes the ensembles 'deep' in\nthe sense that it allows deep post-process of these features that tries to\nlearn to select and abstract the ensemble of neural feature learners.

This study considered two types\nof porous dust aggregates, ballistic cluster-cluster agglomerates (BCCAs) and\nballistic particle-cluster agglomerates (BPCAs).

Second, it was determined\nthat the EMT underestimates the backward scattering intensity by multiple\norders of magnitude, especially in BCCAs, because the EMT averages the\nstructure within the size of the aggregates.

A prominent example for such a\nscenario is the task of quantum state merging where two parties aim to merge\ntheir parts of a tripartite quantum state. In standard quantum state merging,\nentanglement is considered as an expensive resource, while local quantum\noperations can be performed at no additional cost. However, recent developments\nshow that some local operations could be more expensive than others: it is\nreasonable to distinguish between local incoherent operations and local\noperations which can create coherence. This idea leads us to the task of\nincoherent quantum state merging, where one of the parties has free access to\nlocal incoherent operations only. In this case the resources of the process are\nquantified by pairs of entanglement and coherence. Here, we develop tools for\nstudying this process, and apply them to several relevant scenarios.

New approaches of ever\ngreater complexity are continue to be added to the literature. In this paper,\nwe review what we believe to be some of the most popular and most useful\nclasses of statistical models used to analyze individual animal movement data.\nSpecifically we consider discrete-time hidden Markov models, more general\nstate-space models and diffusion processes. We argue that these models should\nbe core components in the toolbox for quantitative researchers working on\nstochastic modelling of individual animal movement. The paper concludes by\noffering some general observations on the direction of statistical analysis of\nanimal movement. There is a trend in movement ecology toward what are arguably\noverly-complex modelling approaches which are inaccessible to ecologists,\nunwieldy with large data sets or not based in mainstream statistical practice.\nAdditionally, some analysis methods developed within the ecological community\nignore fundamental properties of movement data, potentially leading to\nmisleading conclusions about animal movement. Corresponding approaches, e.g.\nbased on L\\'evy walk-type models, continue to be popular despite having been\nlargely discredited. We contend that there is a need for an appropriate balance\nbetween the extremes of either being overly complex or being overly simplistic,\nwhereby the discipline relies on models of intermediate complexity that are\nusable by general ecologists, but grounded in well-developed statistical\npractice and efficient to fit to large data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2016 10:30:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2016 18:51:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 08:15:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-31"}

This rule originates\nfrom the entropic descriptor (ED) that is a multi-scale measure of spatial\ninhomogeneity for a given microstructure. A digitized target sample is a cube\nof linear size L in voxels. Then, a number of trial configurations can be\ngenerated by a model of overlapping spheres of a fixed radius, which are\nrandomly distributed on a regular lattice. The TEPL describes the averaged\nmaximum of the ED as a function of the phase concentration and the radius.\nThus, it can be used to determine the radius. The suggested approach is tested\non surrogate samples of ceramic and carbonate. In each of the cases, fifty\nlow-cost trials provided a few good enough candidates to a selection of the\noptimal reconstruction. When a better accuracy is planned, the final\nreconstructions can serve as the starting configurations. Then, the resulting\nreconstructions should be competitive indeed to those starting with random\nconfigurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2016 11:24:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jul 2016 16:54:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Feb 2017 16:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-27"}

This process explores and takes advantage of the reciprocal relation\nthat solid tumours establish with the extracellular matrix (ECM) components and\nother multiple distinct cell types from the surrounding microenvironment.\nThrough the secretion of various proteolytic enzymes such as matrix\nmetalloproteinases (MMP) or the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), the\ncancer cell population alters the configuration of the surrounding ECM\ncomposition and overcomes the physical barriers to ultimately achieve local\ncancer spread into the surrounding tissue. The active interplay between the\ntissue-scale tumour dynamics and the molecular mechanics of the involved\nproteolytic enzymes at the cell-scale underlines the biologically multiscale\ncharacter of invasion, and raises the challenge of modelling this process with\nan appropriate multiscale approach. In this paper, we present a new two-scale\nmoving boundary model of cancer invasion that explores the tissue scale tumour\ndynamics in conjunction with the molecular dynamics of the urokinase\nplasminogen activation system.

The resulting list includes 1405 triggers identified as GRBs. The\nintention of the GBM GRB catalog is to provide information to the community on\nthe most important observables of the GBM detected GRBs. For each GRB the\nlocation and main characteristics of the prompt emission, the duration, peak\nflux and fluence are derived. The latter two quantities are calculated for the\n50-300~keV energy band, where the maximum energy release of GRBs in the\ninstrument reference system is observed, and also for a broader energy band\nfrom 10-1000 keV, exploiting the full energy range of GBM's low-energy NaI(Tl)\ndetectors. Using statistical methods to assess clustering, we find that the\nhardness and duration of GRBs are better fitted by a two-component model with\nshort-hard and long-soft bursts, than by a model with three components.\nFurthermore, information is provided on the settings and modifications of the\ntriggering criteria and exceptional operational conditions during years five\nand six in the mission.

However, the baryon loading efficiency onto the jets from the\naccretion flows and their particle acceleration efficiencies have been veiled\nin mystery. With the latest data sets, we perform multi-wavelength spectral\nanalysis of quiescent spectra of 13 TeV gamma-ray detected\nhigh-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs) following one-zone static\nsynchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model. We determine the minimum, cooling break,\nand maximum electron Lorentz factors following the diffusive shock acceleration\n(DSA) theory.

From the case study on LiFePO4, through\ndensity-functional calculations, we demonstrate that none of these mechanisms\nare strictly applicable to explain the AFI behavior when the transition metal\noxides have polyanions such as (PO4)3-. The symmetry-lowering of the\nmetal-oxygen complex, to stabilize the polyanion, creates an asymmetric crystal\nfield for d/f states. In LiFePO4 this field creates completely non-degenerate\nFe-d states which, with negligible p-d and d-d covalent interactions, become\natomically localized to ensure a gap at the Fermi level. Due to large exchange\nsplitting, high spin state is favored and an antiferromagnetic configuration is\nstabilized.

The aim is to perform a Global\nSensitivity Analysis (GSA) which goes through a Monte-Carlo uncertainty\npropagation, to quantify impact of uncertainties, followed by a Sobol' indices\ncomputation, to rank influence of identified parameters on result variability.\nA process using a coupling of an environment for parametric computation\n(Prom{\\'e}th{\\'e}e) and a code relying on 2D shallow water equations (FullSWOF\n2D) has been developed (P-FS tool). The study has been performed over the lower\npart of the Var river valley using the estimated hydrograph of 1994 flood\nevent. HR topographic data has been made available for the study area, which is\n17.5 km 2 , by Nice municipality. Three uncertain parameters were studied: the\nmeasurement error (var. E), the level of details of above-ground element\nrepresentation in DEM (buildings, sidewalks, etc.) (var. S), and the spatial\ndiscretization resolution (grid cell size for regular mesh) (var. R). Parameter\nvar. E follows a probability density function, whereas parameters var. S and\nvar. R. are discrete operator choices. Combining these parameters, a database\nof 2, 000 simulations has been produced using P-FS tool implemented on a high\nperformance computing structure. In our study case, the output of interest is\nthe maximal\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2016 07:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-25"}

We compare our findings with their nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE)\nanalogs and show that the spectra of the individual rogue waves significantly\ndiffer from their NLSE analogs. A remarkable difference is the one-sided\ndevelopment of the triangular spectrum before the rogue wave becomes evident in\ntime. Also we show that increasing the skewness of the rogue wave results in\nincreased asymmetry in the triangular Fourier spectra. Additionally, the\ntriangular spectra of the rogue waves of the KEE begin to develop at earlier\nstages of the their development compared to their NLSE analogs, especially for\nlarger skew angles. This feature may be used to enhance the early warning times\nof the rogue waves. However we show that in a chaotic wavefield with many\nspectral components the triangular spectra remains as the main attribute as a\nuniversal feature of the typical wavefields produced through modulation\ninstability and characteristic features of the KEE's analytical rogue wave\nspectra may be suppressed in a realistic chaotic wavefield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Mar 2016 18:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}
