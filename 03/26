The generation\nof the neutrino asymmetry in the Higgs phase after EWPT, in its turn, has not\nbeen considered previously because of the absence of any quantum anomaly in an\nexternal electromagnetic field for such electroneutral particles as neutrino,\nunlike the Adler anomaly for charged left and right polarized massless\nelectrons in the same electromagnetic field. Using the neutrino Boltzmann\nequation, modified by the Berry curvature term in the momentum space, we\nestablish the violation of the macroscopic neutrino current in plasma after\nEWPT and exactly reproduce the nonconservation of the lepton current in the\nsymmetric phase before EWPT arising in quantum field theory due to the non-zero\nlepton hypercharge and corresponding triangle anomaly in an external\nhypercharge field. In the last case the violation of the lepton current is\nderived through the kinetic approach without the computation of the\ncorresponding Feynman diagrams. Then the new kinetic equation is applied for\nthe calculation of the neutrino asymmetry accounting for the the Berry\ncurvature and the electroweak interaction with background fermions in the Higgs\nphase, including the stage after the neutrino decoupling at the absence of\nneutrino collisions in plasma. This asymmetry is found to be rather small to be\nobserved. Thus, a difference of the relic neutrino and antineutrino densities,\nif exists, should be acquired mainly in the symmetric phase before EWPT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 16:01:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 07:15:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 10:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-05"}

Nevertheless, conventional methods for collecting image labels\n(e.g., Google search followed by crowd-sourcing) are not applicable due to the\nformidable difficulties of medical annotation tasks for those who are not\nclinically trained. This type of image labeling task remains non-trivial even\nfor radiologists due to uncertainty and possible drastic inter-observer\nvariation or inconsistency.\n  In this paper, we present a looped deep pseudo-task optimization procedure\nfor automatic category discovery of visually coherent and clinically semantic\n(concept) clusters. Our system can be initialized by domain-specific (CNN\ntrained on radiology images and text report derived labels) or generic\n(ImageNet based) CNN models. Afterwards, a sequence of pseudo-tasks are\nexploited by the looped deep image feature clustering (to refine image labels)\nand deep CNN training/classification using new labels (to obtain more task\nrepresentative deep features). Our method is conceptually simple and based on\nthe hypothesized \"convergence\" of better labels leading to better trained CNN\nmodels which in turn feed more effective deep image features to facilitate more\nmeaningful clustering/labels. We have empirically validated the convergence and\ndemonstrated promising quantitative and qualitative results. Category labels of\nsignificantly higher quality than those in previous work are discovered. This\nallows for further investigation of the hierarchical semantic nature of the\ngiven large-scale radiology image database.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 17:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-28"}

Using simple estimates to infer the peak\nposition of the core mass function (CMF) we find a weak dependence on the\ncluster mass suggesting that the physical conditions inside proto-clusters may\ncontribute to set a CMF, and by extension an IMF, that looks independent of the\nenvironment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 18:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

This paper investigates how misspecification affects the\nresults of inference in these models. Specifically, we consider a local\nmisspecification framework in which specification errors are assumed to vanish\nat an arbitrary and unknown rate with the sample size. Relative to global\nmisspecification, the local misspecification analysis has two important\nadvantages. First, it yields tractable and general results. Second, it allows\nus to focus on parameters with structural interpretation, instead of\n\"pseudo-true\" parameters.\n  We consider a general class of two-step estimators based on the K-stage\nsequential policy function iteration algorithm, where K denotes the number of\niterations employed in the estimation. This class includes Hotz and Miller\n(1993)'s conditional choice probability estimator, Aguirregabiria and Mira\n(2002)'s pseudo-likelihood estimator, and Pesendorfer and Schmidt-Dengler\n(2008)'s asymptotic least squares estimator.\n  We show that local misspecification can affect the asymptotic distribution\nand even the rate of convergence of these estimators. In principle, one might\nexpect that the effect of the local misspecification could change with the\nnumber of iterations K. One of our main findings is that this is not the case,\ni.e., the effect of local misspecification is invariant to K. In practice, this\nmeans that researchers cannot eliminate or even alleviate problems of model\nmisspecification by changing K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 19:28:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2016 18:59:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 16:34:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2017 13:06:10 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 16:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-08"}

It is known that motor proteins work in teams enabling\nunidirectional and bidirectional transport of intracellular cargo over long\ndistances. Disruptions of the underlying transport mechanisms, often caused by\nmutations that alter single motor characteristics, are known to cause\nneurodegenerative diseases. For example, phosphorylation of kinesin motor\ndomain at the serine residue is implicated in Huntington's disease, with a\nrecent study of phosphorylated and phosphomimetic serine residues indicating\nlowered single motor stalling forces. In this article we report the effects of\nmutations of this nature on transport properties of cargo carried by multiple\nwild-type and mutant motors. Results indicate that mutants with altered stall\nforces might determine the average velocity and run-length even when they are\noutnumbered by wild type motors in the ensemble. It is shown that mutants gain\na competitive advantage and lead to an increase in expected run-length when\nload on the cargo is in the vicinity of the mutant's stalling force or a\nmultiple of its stalling force. A separate contribution of this article is the\ndevelopment of a semi-analytic method to analyze transport of cargo by multiple\nmotors of multiple types. The technique determines transition rates between\nvarious relative configurations of motors carrying the cargo using the\ntransition rates between various absolute configurations. This enables exact\ncomputation of average velocity and run-length.

From surveys of evolved and unstable luminous\nstar populations in nearby galaxies, we select a sample of yellow and red\nsupergiant candidates in M31 and M33 for review of their spectral\ncharacteristics and spectral energy distributions. Since the position of\nintermediate and late-type supergiants on the color-magnitude diagram can be\nheavily contaminated by foreground dwarfs, we employ spectral classification\nand multi-band photometry from optical and near-infrared surveys to confirm\nmembership. Based on spectroscopic evidence for mass loss and the presence of\ncircumstellar dust in their SEDs, we find that $30-40\\%$ of the yellow\nsupergiants are likely in a post-red supergiant state.

Previous theoretical studies have demonstrated that an eccentric\nplanet orbiting interior to the disk will stir the larger bodies in the belt\nand produce dust via interparticle collisions.

This paper studies the use of reproducing kernel\nHilbert space methods for learning from permutation-valued features. These\nmethods embed the rankings into an implicitly defined function space, and allow\nfor efficient estimation of regression and test functions in this richer space.\nOur first contribution is to characterize both the feature spaces and spectral\nproperties associated with two kernels for rankings, the Kendall and Mallows\nkernels.

We also introduce families of polynomial kernels that\ninterpolate between the Kendall (degree one) and Mallows' (infinite degree)\nkernels. We show the practical effectiveness of our methods via applications to\nEurobarometer survey data as well as a Movielens ratings dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 21:09:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 21:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-24"}

The most biased coin problem asks how many\ntotal coin flips are required to identify a \"heavy\" coin from an infinite bag\ncontaining both \"heavy\" coins with mean $\\theta_1 \\in (0,1)$, and \"light\" coins\nwith mean $\\theta_0 \\in (0,\\theta_1)$, where heavy coins are drawn from the bag\nwith probability $\\alpha \\in (0,1/2)$. The key difficulty of this problem lies\nin distinguishing whether the two kinds of coins have very similar means, or\nwhether heavy coins are just extremely rare. This problem has applications in\ncrowdsourcing, anomaly detection, and radio spectrum search. Chandrasekaran et.\nal. (2014) recently introduced a solution to this problem but it required\nperfect knowledge of $\\theta_0,\\theta_1,\\alpha$. In contrast, we derive\nalgorithms that are adaptive to partial or absent knowledge of the problem\nparameters. Moreover, our techniques generalize beyond coins to more general\ninstances of infinitely many armed bandit problems. We also prove lower bounds\nthat show our algorithm's upper bounds are tight up to $\\log$ factors, and on\nthe way characterize the sample complexity of differentiating between a single\nparametric distribution and a mixture of two such distributions. As a result,\nthese bounds have surprising implications both for solutions to the most biased\ncoin problem and for anomaly detection when only partial information about the\nparameters is known.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 21:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-29"}

To answer\nthese questions, we compared DR approaches in two relatively large databases of\nspontaneous facial behavior (45 participants in total with over 2 minutes of\nFACS-coded video per participant). Facial features were tracked and aligned\nusing active appearance models (AAM). SIFT and Gabor features were extracted\nfrom local facial regions.

The resulting\npristine samples of slow moving particles are the de facto starting point for\nboth fundamental and applied science when a highly-controlled quantum system is\nrequired. Laser cooled atoms have recently led to major advances in quantum\ninformation, the search to understand dark energy, quantum chemistry, and\nquantum sensors. However, CW laser technology currently limits laser cooling\nand trapping to special types of elements that do not include highly abundant\nand chemically relevant atoms such as hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen.\nHere, we demonstrate that Doppler cooling and trapping by optical frequency\ncombs may provide a route to trapped, ultracold atoms whose spectra are not\namenable to CW lasers. We laser cool a gas of atoms by driving a two-photon\ntransition with an optical frequency comb, an efficient process to which every\ncomb tooth coherently contributes. We extend this technique to create a\nmagneto-optical trap (MOT), an electromagnetic beaker for accumulating the\nlaser-cooled atoms for further study. Our results suggest that the efficient\nfrequency conversion offered by optical frequency combs could provide a key\ningredient for producing trapped, ultracold samples of nature's most abundant\nbuilding blocks, as well as antihydrogen. As such, the techniques demonstrated\nhere may enable advances in fields as disparate as molecular biology and the\nsearch for physics beyond the standard model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 23:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

Following this trend, this paper\naddresses the problem of studying customer behavior by exploiting recently\ndeveloped opinion mining techniques.

However, these approaches lack\ncontent-level information and cannot determine the citation intentions of\nusers. Meanwhile, the abundant online review resources concerning academic\nbooks can be used to mine deeper information and content utilizing altmetric\nperspectives. In this study, we measure the impacts of academic books by\nmulti-granularity mining online reviews, and we identify factors that affect a\nbook's impact. First, online reviews of a sample of academic books on Amazon.cn\nare crawled and processed. Then, multi-granularity review mining is conducted\nto identify review sentiment polarities and aspects' sentiment values. Lastly,\nthe numbers of positive reviews and negative reviews, aspect sentiment values,\nstar values, and information regarding helpfulness are integrated via the\nentropy method, and lead to the calculation of the final book impact scores.\nThe results of a correlation analysis of book impact scores obtained via our\nmethod versus traditional book citations show that, although there are\nsubstantial differences between subject areas, online book reviews tend to\nreflect the academic impact.

However, how to\nchoose appropriate values for the parameters used in the clustering step\nremains an open problem. Moreover, some popular histogram features extracted\nfrom overlapping image blocks may cause a high degree of redundancy and\nmulticollinearity. In this paper, we propose a novel Hough Transform-based\nobject detection approach. First, to address the above issues, we exploit a\nBridge Partial Least Squares (BPLS) technique to establish context-encoded\nHough Regression Models (HRMs), which are linear regression models that cast\nprobabilistic Hough votes to predict object locations. BPLS is an efficient\nvariant of Partial Least Squares (PLS). PLS-based regression techniques\n(including BPLS) can reduce the redundancy and eliminate the multicollinearity\nof a feature set. And the appropriate value of the only parameter used in PLS\n(i.e., the number of latent components) can be determined by using a\ncross-validation procedure. Second, to efficiently handle object scale changes,\nwe propose a novel multi-scale voting scheme. In this scheme, multiple Hough\nimages corresponding to multiple object scales can be obtained simultaneously.\nThird, an object in a test image may correspond to multiple true and false\npositive hypotheses at different scales. Based on the proposed multi-scale\nvoting scheme, a principled strategy is proposed to fuse hypotheses to reduce\nfalse positives by evaluating normalized pointwise mutual information between\nhypotheses. In the experiments, we also compare the proposed HRM approach with\nits several variants to evaluate the influences of its components on its\nperformance.

Investigations on\nthe so-called home advantage phenomenon date back to the 70's and every since\nhas attracted the attention of scholars and sport enthusiasts. These studies\nhave been mainly focused on identifying the phenomenon and trying to correlate\nit with external factors such as crowd noise and referee bias. Much less is\nknown about the effects of home advantage in the microscopic dynamics of the\ngame (within the game) or possible team-specific and evolving features of this\nphenomenon. Here we present a detailed study of these previous features in the\nNational Basketball Association (NBA). By analyzing play-by-play events of more\nthan sixteen thousand games that span thirteen NBA seasons, we have found that\nhome advantage affects the microscopic dynamics of the game by increasing the\nscoring rates and decreasing the time intervals between scores of teams playing\nhome. We verified that these two features are different among the NBA teams,\nfor instance, the scoring rate of the Cleveland Cavaliers team is increased\n0.16 points per minute (on average the seasons 2004-05 to 2013-14) when playing\nhome, whereas for the New Jersey Nets (now the Brooklyn Nets) this rate\nincreases in only 0.04 points per minute. We further observed that these\nmicroscopic features have evolved over time in a non-trivial manner when\nanalyzing the results team-by-team. However, after averaging over all teams\nsome regularities emerge; in particular, we noticed that the average\ndifferences in the scoring rates and in the characteristic times (related to\nthe time intervals between scores) have slightly decreased over time,\nsuggesting a weakening of the phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 18:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

Modeling the action of network\ncontrollers that regulate the magnitude of voltage phasors is a challenging\ntask in the complex plane as it has to preserve the framework of holomorphicity\nfor obtention of these complex variables with fixed magnitude. The paper\npresents two distinct approaches to modelling the voltage control of generator\nnodes. Exponential (or voltage-dependent) load models are crucial for accurate\npower flow studies under stressed conditions. This new framework for power flow\nstudies exploits the theory of analytic continuation, especially the monodromy\ntheorem for resolving issues that have plagued conventional numerical methods\nfor decades. Here the focus is on the indispensable role of Pade approximants\nfor analytic continuation of complex functions, expressed as power series,\nbeyond the boundary of convergence of the series. The zero-pole distribution of\nthese rational approximants serves as a proximity index to voltage collapse.\nFinally the mathematical underpinnings of this framework, namely the Stahl's\ntheory and the rate of convergence of Pade approximants are explained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2016 13:38:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Jul 2016 16:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}
