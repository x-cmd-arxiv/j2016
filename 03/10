The Lagrangian view provides a privileged\nperspective for studying the dynamics of turbulence in general, and of the\nvelocity gradient tensor in particular. Stochastic models for the Lagrangian\nevolution of velocity gradients in isotropic turbulence, with closure models\nfor the pressure Hesssian and viscous Laplacian, have been shown to reproduce\nimportant features such as non-Gaussian probability distributions, skewness and\nvorticity strain-rate alignments. The Recent Fluid Deformation (RFD) closure\nintroduced the idea of mapping an isotropic Lagrangian pressure Hessian as\nupstream initial condition using the fluid deformation tensor. Recent work on a\nGaussian fields closure, however, has shown that even Gaussian isotropic\nvelocity fields contain significant anisotropy for the conditional pressure\nHessian tensor due to the inherent velocity-pressure couplings, and that\nassuming an isotropic pressure Hessian as upstream condition may not be\nrealistic. In this paper, Gaussian isotropic field statistics are used to\ngenerate more physical upstream conditions for the recent fluid deformation\nmapping. In this new framework, known isotropy relations can be satisfied {\\it\na priori} and no DNS-tuned coefficients are necessary. A detailed comparison of\nresults from the new model, referred to as the recent deformation of Gaussian\nfields (RDGF) closure, with existing models and DNS shows the improvements\ngained, especially in various single-time statistics of the velocity gradient\ntensor at moderate Reynolds numbers.

We show\nanalytically and verify using test sequences that the use of the baseband\nquantizer lowers the coding efficiency. Experiments show that as the baseband\nquantizer is strengthened by 1.6 bits, the drop of PSNR at a high bitrate is up\nto 1.60dB.

Kinematical constraints are\ndifferentiated from equations of motion by the fact that their particular form\nis fixed once and for all, irrespective of the interactions the system enters\ninto. By contrast, the particular form of a system's equations of motion\ndepends essentially on the particular interaction the system enters into. All\ncontemporary accounts of the structure and semantics of physical theory treat\ndynamics, i.e., the equations of motion, as the most important feature of a\ntheory for the purposes of its philosophical analysis. I argue to the contrary\nthat it is the kinematical constraints that determine the structure and\nempirical content of a physical theory in the most important ways: they\nfunction as necessary preconditions for the appropriate application of the\ntheory; they differentiate types of physical systems; they are necessary for\nthe equations of motion to be well posed or even just cogent; and they guide\nthe experimentalist in the design of tools for measurement and observation. It\nis thus satisfaction of the kinematical constraints that renders meaning to\nthose terms representing a system's physical quantities in the first place,\neven before one can ask whether or not the system satisfies the theory's\nequations of motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 18:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-10"}

While previous work has focused on generalizing notions of\nspreads of a graph signal in the vertex and graph spectral domains, our\napproach is to generalize the methods of Lieb in order to develop uncertainty\nprinciples that provide limits on the concentration of the analysis\ncoefficients of any graph signal under a dictionary transform whose atoms are\njointly localized in the vertex and graph spectral domains. One challenge we\nhighlight is that due to the inhomogeneity of the underlying graph data domain,\nthe local structure in a single small region of the graph can drastically\naffect the uncertainty bounds for signals concentrated in different regions of\nthe graph, limiting the information provided by global uncertainty principles.\nAccordingly, we suggest a new way to incorporate a notion of locality, and\ndevelop local uncertainty principles that bound the concentration of the\nanalysis coefficients of each atom of a localized graph spectral filter frame\nin terms of quantities that depend on the local structure of the graph around\nthe center vertex of the given atom.

With a total combined exposure\ntime of 9.1 Ms, these data yield the strongest constraints to date on the\nevolution of the metal content of the intracluster medium (ICM). We find no\nevidence for strong evolution in the global (r<R500) ICM metallicity (dZ/dz =\n-0.06 +/- 0.04 Zsun), with a mean value at z=0.6 of <Z> = 0.23 +/- 0.01 Zsun\nand a scatter of 0.08 +/- 0.01 Zsun.

We find, in agreement with\nprevious works, a significantly higher mean value for the metallicity in the\ncenters of cool core clusters versus non-cool core clusters. We find weak\nevidence for evolution in the central metallicity of cool core clusters (dZ/dz\n= -0.21 +/- 0.11 Zsun), which is sufficient to account for this enhanced\ncentral metallicity over the past ~10 Gyr.

We present\nan exhaustive classification of such scenarios in the form of effective field\ntheories, paying special attention to new classes of models where the strong\ndynamics involves, along with the Higgs boson, the SM gauge bosons and/or the\nfermions. The IR softness of the new dynamics suppresses its effects at LEP\nenergies, but deviations are in principle detectable at the LHC, even at\nenergies below the threshold for production of new states.

We show that\npairwise peculiar velocity statistics, in particular the relative radial\nvelocity dispersion, $\\sigma_\\parallel$ , can be used to observe this\ntransition when they are binned by some measure of halo environment.

Ambient density is found to be the most\nrelevant measure of environment; it is distinct from isolatedness, and\ncorrelates well with theoretical expectations for the symmetron model. By\nbinning $\\sigma_\\parallel$ in ambient density, we find a strong\nenvironment-dependent signature for the symmetron models, with the velocities\nshowing a clear transition from GR to non-GR behavior. No such transition is\nobserved for $f(R)$, as the relevant scales are deep in the unscreened regime.\nObservations of the relative radial velocity dispersion in forthcoming peculiar\nvelocity surveys, if binned appropriately by environment, therefore offer a\nvaluable way of detecting the screening signature of modified gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 21:52:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Oct 2016 19:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-28"}

This stock of data stands to increase\nwith the developments of the internet of things and cyber-physical systems.\nClearly, these technologies promise benefits. But they also raise the risk of\nsensitive information disclosure. To mitigate this risk, machine learning\nalgorithms can add noise to outputs according to the formulations provided by\ndifferential privacy. At the same time, users can fight for privacy by\ninjecting noise into the data that they report. In this paper, we conceptualize\nthe interactions between privacy and accuracy and between user (input)\nperturbation and learner (output) perturbation in machine learning, using the\nframeworks of empirical risk minimization, differential privacy, and\nStackelberg games. In particular, we solve for the Stackelberg equilibrium for\nthe case of an averaging query.

Specifically, the learner perturbs if and only\nif the number of users is greater than a threshold which increases with the\ndegree to which incentives are misaligned. Provoked by these conclusions - and\nby some observations from privacy ethics - we also suggest future directions.\nWhile other work in this area has studied privacy markets and mechanism design\nfor truthful reporting of user information, we take a different viewpoint by\nconsidering both user and learner perturbation.

The aim of this paper is to investigate, through the use of\nsimulated images, the uncertainties and accuracy of source-finding routines, as\nwell as to quantify systematic effects due to resolution, such as source\nconfusion and source size. While these effects are not new, this work is\nintended as a particular case study that can be scaled and translated to other\nsurveys. We use the simulations to derive uncertainties in the fitted\nparameters, as well as bias corrections for the actual catalogue (presented in\nPaper 2). We compare two different source-finding routines, OBIT and AEGEAN,\nand two different effective resolutions, 8 and 2.75 arcsec. We find that the\ntwo routines perform comparably well, with OBIT being slightly better at\nde-blending sources, but slightly worse at fitting resolved sources. We show\nthat 30 to 70 per cent of sources are missed or fit inaccurately once the\nsource size becomes larger than the beam, possibly explaining source count\nerrors in high-resolution surveys. We also investigate the effect of blending,\nfinding that any sources with separations smaller than the beam size are fit as\nsingle sources. We show that the use of machine-learning techniques can\ncorrectly identify blended sources up to 90 per cent of the time, and\nprior-driven fitting can lead to a 70 per cent improvement in the number of\nde-blended sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 22:15:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2016 19:35:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

Quantifying\nthe efficacy of HMDs against malicious adversaries is thus an important\nproblem. The challenge lies in that real-world malware typically adapts to\ndefenses, evades being run in experimental settings, and hides behind benign\napplications. Thus, realizing the potential of HMDs as a line of defense - that\nhas a small and battery-efficient code base - requires a rigorous foundation\nfor evaluating HMDs.\n  To this end, we introduce EMMA - a platform to evaluate the efficacy of HMDs\nfor mobile platforms. EMMA deconstructs malware into atomic, orthogonal actions\nand introduces a systematic way of pitting different HMDs against a diverse\nsubset of malware hidden inside benign applications. EMMA drives both malware\nand benign programs with real user-inputs to yield an HMD's effective operating\nrange - i.e., the malware actions a particular HMD is capable of detecting. We\nshow that small atomic actions, such as stealing a Contact or SMS, have\nsurprisingly large hardware footprints, and use this insight to design HMD\nalgorithms that are less intrusive than prior work and yet perform 24.7%\nbetter. Finally, EMMA brings up a surprising new result - obfuscation\ntechniques used by malware to evade static analyses makes them more detectable\nusing HMDs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 22:22:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2016 04:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-14"}

We show that\nMo$^{4+}$ ions displace according to a local \"2-in/2-out\" rule on each Mo$_4$\ntetrahedron, driven by orbital dimerisation of Jahn-Teller active Mo$^{4+}$\nions. Long-range orbital order is prevented by the macroscopic degeneracy of\ndimer coverings permitted by the pyrochlore lattice. Cooperative O$^{2-}$\ndisplacements yield a distribution of Mo$-$O$-$Mo angles, which in turn\nintroduces disorder into magnetic interactions.

We propose new algorithms for mapping boolean constraint\nsatisfaction problems (CSPs) onto QA hardware mitigating these limitations. In\nparticular we develop a new embedding algorithm for mapping a CSP onto a\nhardware Ising model with a fixed sparse set of interactions, and propose two\nnew decomposition algorithms for solving problems too large to map directly\ninto hardware.\n  The mapping technique is locally-structured, as hardware compatible Ising\nmodels are generated for each problem constraint, and variables appearing in\ndifferent constraints are chained together using ferromagnetic couplings. In\ncontrast, global embedding techniques generate a hardware independent Ising\nmodel for all the constraints, and then use a minor-embedding algorithm to\ngenerate a hardware compatible Ising model. We give an example of a class of\nCSPs for which the scaling performance of D-Wave's QA hardware using the local\nmapping technique is significantly better than global embedding.\n  We validate the approach by applying D-Wave's hardware to circuit-based\nfault-diagnosis.

Methods: Recently, a fast and accurate Graphics\nProcessor Unit (GPU)-based MC simulation of proton transport was developed and\nused as the dose calculation engine in a GPU-accelerated IMPT optimizer.\nBesides dose, the dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LETd) can be\nsimultaneously scored, which makes biological dose (BD) optimization possible.\nTo convert from LETd to BD, a linear relation was assumed. Using this novel\noptimizer, inverse biological planning was applied to 4 patients: 2 small and 1\nlarge thyroid tumor targets, and 1 glioma case. To create these plans,\nconstraints were placed to maintain the physical dose (PD) within 1.25 times\nthe prescription while maximizing target BD. For comparison, conventional IMRT\nand IMPT plans were created for each case in Eclipse (Varian, Inc). The same\ncritical structure PD constraints were used for the IMRT, IMPT and\nbio-optimized plans. The BD for the IMPT plans were obtained through MC\nre-calculations. Results: Compared to standard IMPT, the bio-optimal plans for\npatients with small tumor targets displayed a BD escalation that was around\ntwice the PD increase. Dose sparing to critical structures was improved\ncompared to both IMRT and IMPT. No significant BD increase could be achieved\nfor the large thyroid case, and when the presence of critical structures\nmitigated the contribution of additional fields.

Since the optimal slip L of the wheel is known rather\napproximately, the actual goal of the controller is to achieve such a switching\nstrategy that makes the dynamics converging to a limit cycle surrounding the\nregion of prospective values of L. In this paper we show that the required\nlimit cycle can be obtained as a bifurcation from a point x0 of S when a\nsuitable parameter D crosses 0. The point x0 turns out to be a fold-fold\nsingularity (the vector fields on the two sides of S are tangent one another at\nx0) and the parameter D measures the deviation of the switching manifold from a\nhyperplane. The proposed result is based on an extension of the classical fold\nbifurcation theory available for smooth maps. Construction of a suitable smooth\nmap is a crucial step of the proof.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 01:04:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2016 06:36:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-18"}

The non-thermal hard\nX-ray emission in 25-50 keV observed by RHESSI shows five distinct impulsive\npeaks of decaying amplitude with a period of about three minutes.

These oscillations may explain the large\norbital eccentricities, as well as the large misalignments with respect to the\nspin of the central star, observed for some exoplanets. The planet is assumed\nto be massive enough to open a gap in the disc. The planet's tilt relative to\nthe binary orbital plane is subject to two types of oscillations. The first\ntype, present at even small inclination angles relative to the binary orbital\nplane, is due to the interaction of the planet with the disc and binary\ncompanion and is amplified by a secular resonance. The second type of\noscillation is the KL oscillation that operates on both the planet and disc at\nlarger binary inclination angles. We find that for a sufficiently massive disc,\neven a relatively low inclination planet-disc system can force a planet to an\ninclination above the critical KL angle, as a consequence of the first type of\ntilt oscillation, allowing it to undergo the second type of oscillation. We\nconclude that the hydrodynamical evolution of a sufficiently massive and\ninclined disc in a binary system broadens the range of systems that form\neccentric and misaligned giant planets to include a wide range of initial\nmisalignment angles (20 to 160 degrees).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 03:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

An algorithm to map the index coded bits to PSK\nsignal set such that the PSK-SICG obtained is maximized for the receiver with\nmaximum side information is given. We go on to show that instead of\ntransmitting the $N$ index coded bits as a signal from $2^N$- PSK, we can as\nwell transmit them as a signal from $2^N$- QAM and all the results including\nthe necessary and sufficient condition to get coding gain holds. We prove that\nsending the index coded bits as a QAM signal is better than sending them as a\nPSK signal when the receivers see an effective signal set of eight points or\nmore.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 05:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-11"}

Because of the\ntremendous potential for clinical applications, certain questions regarding\ndecoded neurofeedback (DecNef) must be addressed. Neurofeedback effects can\nlast for months, but the short- to mid-term dynamics are not known.\nSpecifically, can the same subjects learn to induce neural patterns in two\nopposite directions in different sessions? This leads to a further question,\nwhether learning to reverse a neural pattern may be less effective after\ntraining to induce it in a previous session. Here we employed a\nwithin-subjects' design, with subjects undergoing DecNef training sequentially\nin opposite directions (up or down regulation of confidence judgements in a\nperceptual task), with the order counterbalanced across subjects. Behavioral\nresults indicated that the manipulation was strongly influenced by the order\nand direction of neurofeedback. We therefore applied nonlinear mathematical\nmodeling to parametrize four main consequences of DecNef: main effect of change\nin behavior, strength of down-regulation effect relative to up-regulation,\nmaintenance of learning over sessions, and anterograde learning interference.\nModeling results revealed that DecNef successfully induced bidirectional\nbehavioral changes in different sessions. Furthermore, up-regulation was more\nsizable, and the effect was largely preserved even after an interval of\none-week. Lastly, the second week effect was diminished as compared to the\nfirst week effect, indicating strong anterograde learning interference. These\nresults suggest reinforcement learning characteristics of DecNef, and provide\nimportant constraints on its application to basic neuroscience, occupational\nand sports trainings, and therapies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 06:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-11"}

To achieve this, we first\nformulate the stability problem as a free boundary problem for nonlinear\nelliptic equations. Then we introduce the partial hodograph transformation to\nreduce the free boundary problem into a fixed boundary value problem near a\nbackground solution with fully nonlinear boundary conditions for second-order\nnonlinear elliptic equations in an unbounded domain. To solve this reduced\nproblem, we linearize the nonlinear problem on the background shock solution\nand then, after solving this linearized elliptic problem, develop a nonlinear\niteration scheme that is proved to be contractive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 07:42:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2017 07:27:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 May 2017 01:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}

In this paper, a new evidence of this connection was found. The\nlarge FCN amplitude and phase disturbance occurred at the epoch close to the\nnewly revealed GMJ 2011. This event occurred to be the second large change in\nthe FCN amplitude and phase after the 1999 disturbance that is also associated\nwith the GMJ 1999.

The eclipsing binary GU Mon is located in the star-forming cluster\nDolidze 25, which has the lowest metallicity measured in a Milky Way young\ncluster. Aims. GU Mon has been identified as a short-period eclipsing binary\nwith two early B-type components. We set out to derive its orbital and stellar\nparameters. Methods. We present a comprehensive analysis, including B and V\nlight curves and 11 high-resolution spectra, to verify the orbital period and\ndetermine parameters. We use the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND to obtain\nstellar parameters and create templates for cross-correlation. We obtain a\nmodel to fit the light and radial-velocity curves using the Wilson-Devinney\ncode iteratively and simultaneously. Results. The two components of GU Mon are\nidentical stars of spectral type B1 V, with the same mass and temperature. The\nlightcurves are typical of an EW-type binary. The spectroscopic and photometric\nanalyses agree on a period of 0.896640 +- 0.000007 d. We determine a mass of\n9.0 +- 0.6 Msun for each component and temperatures of 28 000 +- 2 000 K. Both\nvalues are consistent with the spectral type. The two stars are overfilling\ntheir respective Roche lobes, sharing a common envelope, and therefore the\norbit is synchronised and circularised. Conclusions. The GU Mon system has a\nfill-out factor above 0.8, containing two dwarf B-type stars on the main\nsequence. The two stars are in a very advanced stage of interaction, with their\nextreme physical similarity likely due to the common envelope. The expected\nevolution of such a system will very probably lead to a merger while still on\nthe main sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 08:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}

They are expected to exhibit non-Abelian particle statistics, in contrast\nto the usual statistics of fermions and bosons, enabling quantum operations to\nbe performed by braiding isolated modes around one another. Quantum braiding\noperations are topologically protected insofar as these modes are pinned near\nzero energy, and the pinning is predicted to be exponential as the modes become\nspatially separated. Following theoretical proposals, several experiments have\nidentified signatures of Majorana modes in proximitized nanowires and atomic\nchains, with small mode-splitting potentially explained by hybridization of\nMajoranas. Here, we use Coulomb-blockade spectroscopy in an InAs nanowire\nsegment with epitaxial aluminum, which forms a proximity-induced\nsuperconducting Coulomb island (a Majorana island) that is isolated from\nnormal-metal leads by tunnel barriers, to measure the splitting of\nnear-zero-energy Majorana modes. We observe exponential suppression of energy\nsplitting with increasing wire length. For short devices of a few hundred\nnanometers, sub-gap state energies oscillate as the magnetic field is varied,\nas is expected for hybridized Majorana modes. Splitting decreases by a factor\nof about ten for each half micrometer of increased wire length. For devices\nlonger than about one micrometer, transport in strong magnetic fields occurs\nthrough a zero-energy state that is energetically isolated from a continuum,\nyielding uniformly spaced Coulomb-blockade conductance peaks, consistent with\nteleportation via Majorana modes. Our results help explain the\ntrivial-to-topological transition in finite systems and to quantify the scaling\nof topological protection with end-mode separation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 10:44:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-18"}

Each node is assigned a local\nopen-loop optimal control problem only relying on the information of\nneighboring nodes, in which the cost function is designed by penalizing on the\nerrors between predicted and assumed trajectories. Together with this\npenalization, an equality based terminal constraint is proposed to ensure\nstability, which enforces the terminal states of each node in the predictive\nhorizon equal to the average of its neighboring states. By using the sum of\nlocal cost functions as a Lyapunov candidate, it is proved that asymptotic\nstability of such a DMPC can be achieved through an explicit sufficient\ncondition on the weights of the cost functions. Simulations with passenger cars\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of proposed DMPC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 11:34:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2016 15:14:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-19"}

A substantial part of the paper is devoted to establishing an\nimproved upper bound on the consistency strength of $S^*$. The assessment of\n$S^*$ as a foundation of category theory is framed by the following general\ndesiderata (R) and (S).

The separations and relative\nmagnitudes of all detected stars were measured. For 12 candidate companions to\n10 host stars, previous astrometric measurements were used to evaluate how\nlikely the companions are to be physically associated. Results. We provide\nmeasurements of 499 candidate companions within 20 arcseconds of our sample of\n101 planet host stars. 51 candidates are located within 5 arcseconds of a host\nstar, and we provide the first published measurements for 27 of these.\nCalibrations for the plate scale and colour performance of the Two Colour\nInstrument are presented. Conclusions. We find that the overall multiplicity\nrate of the host stars is 38 +17 -13%, consistent with the rate among\nsolar-type stars in our sensitivity range, suggesting that planet formation\ndoes not preferentially occur in long period binaries compared to a random\nsample of field stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 14:13:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 09:46:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

A non-uniform Helium\ndistribution can however lead to biases when measuring key cluster parameters.\nThis has motivated one-dimensional models that evolve the ICM composition\nassuming that the effects of magnetic fields can be parameterized or ignored.\nSuch models for non-isothermal clusters show that Helium can sediment in the\ncluster core leading to a peak in concentration offset from the cluster center.\nThe resulting profiles have recently been shown to be linearly unstable when\nthe weakly-collisional character of the magnetized plasma is considered. In\nthis paper, we present a modified version of the MHD code Athena, which makes\nit possible to evolve a weakly-collisional plasma subject to a gravitational\nfield and stratified in both temperature and composition. We thoroughly test\nour implementation and confirm excellent agreement against several analytical\nresults. In order to isolate the effects of composition, in this initial study\nwe focus our attention on isothermal plasmas. We show that plasma\ninstabilities, feeding off gradients in composition, can induce turbulent\nmixing and saturate by re-arranging magnetic field lines and alleviating the\ncomposition gradient. Composition profiles that increase with radius lead to\ninstabilities that saturate by driving the average magnetic field inclination\nto roughly $45^{\\circ}$. We speculate that this effect may alleviate the core\ninsulation observed in homogeneous settings, with potential consequences for\nthe associated cooling flow problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Mar 2016 21:01:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 10:14:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-04"}
