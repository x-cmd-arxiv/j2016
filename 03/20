To this end, we\ndecrease the thermal diffusivity $\\kappa$ along two paths in parameter space.\nIf the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ is decreased proportionally with $\\kappa$\n(fixing the Prandtl number $P_r = \\nu/\\kappa$), we find that U increases but\nasymptotes toward a constant value, as found by Featherstone & Hindman (2016).\nHowever, if $\\nu$ is held fixed while decreasing $\\kappa$ (increasing $P_r$),\nwe find that U systematically decreases. We attribute this to an enhancement of\nthe thermal content of downflow plumes, which allows them to carry the solar\nluminosity with slower flow speeds. We contrast this with the case of\nRayleigh-Benard convection which is not subject to this luminosity constraint.\nThis dramatic difference in behavior for the two paths in parameter space\n(fixed $P_r$ or fixed $\\nu$) persists whether the heat transport by unresolved,\nnear-surface convection is modeled as a thermal conduction or as a fixed flux.\nThe results suggest that if solar convection can operate in a high-$P_r$\nregime, then this might effectively limit the velocity amplitude. Small-scale\nmagnetism is a possible source of enhanced viscosity that may serve to achieve\nthis high-$P_r$ regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2016 16:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

In this work, we consider 2N resonators\nof different frequencies, which are coupled to a three-level quantum system\n(qutrit).

In addition, by employing the qutrit-resonator\ndispersive interaction, the intermediate higher-energy level of the qutrit is\nvirtually excited and thus decoherence from this level is suppressed. This\neffective Hamiltonian can be applied to implement quantum operations with\nphotonic qubits distributed in different resonators.

Despite several deep structural results, even the smallest\ncase of leaking one bit of information present at one of two players is not\nwell understood. Brody et al.\\ gave a 2-round protocol enabling the two players\nto succeed with probability $1/3$ and showed the hardness result that no\nprotocol can give a success probability of more than~$3/8$.\n  In this work, we show that neither bound is tight. Our new hardness result,\nobtained by a different application of the concavity method used also in the\nprevious work, states that a success probability better than 0.3672 is not\npossible. Using both theoretical and numerical approaches, we improve the lower\nbound to $0.3384$, that is, give a protocol leading to this success\nprobability. To ease the design of new protocols, we prove an equivalent\nformulation of the cryptogenography problem as solitaire vector splitting game.\nVia an automated game tree search, we find good strategies for this game. We\nthen translate the splits that occurred in this strategy into inequalities\nrelating position values and use an LP solver to find an optimal solution for\nthese inequalities. This gives slightly better game values, but more\nimportantly, it gives a more compact representation of the protocol and a way\nto easily verify the claimed quality of the protocol.\n  These improved bounds, as well as the large sizes and depths of the improved\nprotocols we find, suggests that finding good protocols for the\ncryptogenography problem as well as understanding their structure are harder\nthan what the simple problem formulation suggests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2016 17:02:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-22"}

The latter effect is\ninduced by the reduction of the coupling by the dielectric membrane. In strong\nsalt solutions where the repulsive image-charge effects dominate the attractive\ntrans-cis coupling, the DNA molecule encounters a translocation barrier of ~10\nkBT.

Conventional Lagrangian\napproaches convert the lone rate constraint to a linear rate penalty scaled by\na multiplier in the objective, resulting in a simpler unconstrained\nformulation. However, the search for the \"optimal\" multiplier, one that results\nin a distortion-minimizing solution among all Lagrangian solutions that satisfy\nthe original rate constraint, remains an elusive open problem in the general\nsetting. To address this problem, we propose a computation-efficient search\nstrategy to identify this optimal multiplier numerically. Specifically, we\nfirst formulate a general rate allocation problem where each data unit can be\ndependently coded at different quantization parameters (QP) using a previous\nunit as predictor, or left uncoded at the encoder and subsequently interpolated\nat the decoder using neighboring coded units.

Unfortunately, it is not possible\nto generate ASTs for student pro- grams with syntax errors and therefore the\nprevious feedback techniques are not applicable in repairing syntax errors.\n  We present a technique for providing feedback on syntax errors that uses\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model syntactically valid token sequences.\nOur approach is inspired from the recent work on learning language models from\nBig Code (large code corpus). For a given programming assignment, we first\nlearn an RNN to model all valid token sequences using the set of syntactically\ncorrect student submissions. Then, for a student submission with syntax errors,\nwe query the learnt RNN model with the prefix to- ken sequence to predict token\nsequences that can fix the error by either replacing or inserting the predicted\ntoken sequence at the error location.

However, speculative\nnew physics ideas to solve this problem have not manifested themselves yet at\nhigh-energy colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. For this\nreason, the role of naturalness as a guide to theory model-building is being\nseverely questioned. Most attacks suggest that one should not resort to\narguments involving gravity, which is a much less understood quantum field\ntheory. Another line of attack is against the assumption that there exists a\nmultitude of additional heavy states specifically charged under the Standard\nModel gauge symmetries. Nevertheless, if we give ground on both of these\nassaults on naturalness, what remains is a naturalness concern over the\nprospect of numerous additional spin-zero scalar states in nature. The\nproliferation of heavy scalars generically destabilizes the Higgs boson mass,\nraising it to the highest and most remote scalar mass values in nature, thus\nstraining the legitimacy of the Standard Model. The copious use of extra\nscalars in theory model building, from explaining flavor physics to providing\nan inflationary potential and more, and the generic expectation of extra scalar\nbosons in nature argues for the proliferation instability problem being the\ncentral concern for naturalness of the Standard Model.

Yet, when their field amplitude becomes comparable to the\nelectron binding energies of matter, the nonlinear motion of these electrons\nemits new dipole radiation whose amplitude, frequency and phase differ from the\nincoming fields. Such high fields are typically achieved with ultra-short,\nfemtosecond (1fs = 10-15 sec.) laser pulses containing very broad frequency\nspectra. Here, the matter not only couples incoming and outgoing fields but\nalso causes different spectral components to interact and mix through a\nconvolution process. In this contribution, we describe how frequency domain\nnonlinear optics overcomes the shortcomings arising from this convolution in\nconventional time domain nonlinear optics1. We generate light fields with\npreviously inaccessible properties because the uncontrolled coupling of\namplitudes and phases is turned off. For example, arbitrary phase functions are\ntransferred linearly to the second harmonic frequency while maintaining the\nexact shape of the input power spectrum squared.\n  This nonlinear control over output amplitudes and phases opens up new avenues\nfor applications based on manipulation of coherent light fields.

The standard model of magnetic configuration of CTTS predicts that\ncoronal magnetic flux tubes connect the stellar atmosphere to the inner region\nof the disk. However, differential rotation may disrupt these long loops. The\nresults from Hydrodynamic modeling of X-ray flares observed in CTTS confirming\nthe star-disk connection hypothesis are still controversial. Some authors\nsuggest the presence of the accretion disk prevent the stellar corona to extent\nbeyond the co-rotation radius, while others simply are not confident with the\nmethods used to derive loop lengths. We use independent procedures to determine\nthe length of flaring loops in stars of the Orion Nebula Cluster previously\nanalyzed using Hydrodynamic models.

In contrast, by building a\nhierarchy of nested subgraphs, the Multiscale Laplacian Graph kernels (MLG\nkernels) that we define in this paper can account for structure at a range of\ndifferent scales. At the heart of the MLG construction is another new graph\nkernel, called the Feature Space Laplacian Graph kernel (FLG kernel), which has\nthe property that it can lift a base kernel defined on the vertices of two\ngraphs to a kernel between the graphs. The MLG kernel applies such FLG kernels\nto subgraphs recursively. To make the MLG kernel computationally feasible, we\nalso introduce a randomized projection procedure, similar to the Nystr\\\"om\nmethod, but for RKHS operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Mar 2016 06:33:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 May 2016 07:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-31"}

IAMs have been criticized for\ncontroversial discount rate assumptions, arbitrary climate damage functions,\nand the inadequate handling of potentially catastrophic climate outcomes. We\nreview these external shortcomings for prominent IAMs before turning our focus\non an internal modeling fallacy: the widespread misapplication of the Constant\nElasticity of Substitution (CES) function for the technology transitions\nmodeled by IAMs. Applying CES, an economic modeling approach, on technical\nfactor inputs over long periods where an entire factor (the greenhouse gas\nemitting fossil fuel inputs) must be substituted creates artifacts that fail to\nmatch the S-curve patterns observed historically. A policy critical result, the\nmonotonically increasing cost of carbon, a universal feature of IAMs, is called\ninto question by showing that it is unrealistic as it is an artifact of the\nmodeling approach and not representative of the technical substitutability\npotential nor of the expected cost of the technologies. We demonstrate this\nfirst through a simple but representative example of CES application on the\nenergy system and with a sectoral discussion of the actual fossil substitution\ncosts. We propose a methodological modification using dynamically varying\nelasticity of substitution as a plausible alternative to model the energy\ntransition in line with the historical observations and technical realities\nwithin the existing modeling systems.

Since the Q-values depend\nupon the electron temperature of the source plasma, this has allowed a\ndetermination of this temperature from the pattern of element-abundance\nenhancements and a verification of the expected inverse-time dependence of the\npower of A/Q for diffusive transport of ions from the SEP events, with\nscattering mean free paths found to be between 0.2 and 1 AU. SEP events derived\nfrom plasma of different temperatures map into different regions in typical\ncross-plots of abundances, spreading the distributions. In comparisons of SEP\nevents with temperatures above 2 MK, impulsive events show much broader\nnon-thermal variation of abundances than do gradual events. The extensive shock\nwaves accelerating ions in gradual events may average over much of an active\nregion where numerous but smaller magnetic reconnections, \"nanojets\", produce\nsuprathermal seed ions, thus averaging over varying abundances, while an\nimpulsive SEP event only samples one local region of abundance variations.\nEvidence for a reference He/O abundance ratio of 91, rather than 57, is also\nfound for the hotter plasma.
