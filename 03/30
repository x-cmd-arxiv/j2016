The need for a predictive theory\napplicable where no data is available is an incentive to develop a fully\nmicroscopic approach to fission dynamics. In this work, we calculate the\npre-neutron emission charge and mass distributions of the fission fragments\nformed in the neutron-induced fission of 239Pu using a microscopic method based\non nuclear energy density functional (EDF) method, where large amplitude\ncollective motion is treated adiabatically using the time dependent generator\ncoordinate method (TDGCM) under the Gaussian overlap approximation (GOA).\nFission fragment distributions are extracted from the flux of the collective\nwave packet through the scission line. We find that the main characteristics of\nthe fission charge and mass distributions can be well reproduced by existing\nenergy functionals even in two-dimensional collective spaces. Theory and\nexperiment agree typically within 2 mass units for the position of the\nasymmetric peak. As expected, calculations are sensitive to the structure of\nthe initial state and the prescription for the collective inertia. We emphasize\nthat results are also sensitive to the continuity of the collective landscape\nnear scission. Our analysis confirms that the adiabatic approximation provides\nan effective scheme to compute fission fragment yields. It also suggests that,\nat least in the framework of nuclear DFT, three-dimensional collective spaces\nmay be a prerequisite to reach 10% accuracy in predicting pre-neutron emission\nfission fragment yields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2016 16:03:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

To model such environments, we introduce a\nBayesian congestion game, in which players have private information about\nincidents, and each player chooses her route on a network of parallel links.\nThe links are prone to incidents that occur with an ex-ante known probability.\nThe demand is comprised of two player populations: one with access to high\naccuracy incident information and another with low accuracy information, i.e.\nthe populations differ only by their access to information. The common\nknowledge includes: (i) the demand and route cost functions, (ii) the fraction\nof highly-informed players, (iii) the incident probability, and (iv) the\nmarginal type distributions induced by the information structure of the game.\nWe present a full characterization of the Bayesian Wardrop Equilibrium of this\ngame under the assumption that low information players receive no additional\ninformation beyond common knowledge. We also compute the cost to individual\nplayers and the social cost as a function of the fraction of highly-informed\nplayers when they receive perfectly accurate information.

Secondly, there exists another\n(lower or equal) threshold above which a further increase in the fraction of\nhighly-informed players does not reduce the expected social costs.

We study their high-energy signatures, focusing on\nthe role of pair-enriched bubbles produced by young magnetars, rapidly-rotating\nneutron stars, and magnetized white dwarfs. (i) First, we study the nebular\nproperties and the conditions allowing for escape of high-energy gamma-rays and\nradio waves, showing that their escape is possible for nebulae with ages of\n>10-100 yr. In the rapidly-rotating neutron star scenario, we find that radio\nemission from the quasi-steady nebula itself may be bright enough to be\ndetected especially at sub-mm frequencies, which is relevant as a possible\ncounterpart of pulsar-driven SNe and FRBs. (ii) Second, we consider the fate of\nbursting emission in the nebulae. We suggest that an impulsive burst may lead\nto a highly relativistic flow, which would interact with the nebula. If the\nshocked nebula is still relativistic, pre-existing non-thermal particles in the\nnebula can be significantly boosted by the forward shock, leading to\nshort-duration (maybe millisecond or longer) high-energy gamma-ray flashes.\nPossible dissipation at the reverse shock may also lead to gamma-ray emission.\n(iii) After such flares, interactions with the baryonic ejecta may lead to\nafterglow emission with a duration of days to weeks. In the magnetar scenario,\nthis burst-in-bubble model leads to the expectation that nearby (<10-100 Mpc)\nhigh-energy gamma-ray flashes may be detected by HAWC and CTA, and the\nsubsequent afterglow emission may be seen by radio telescopes such as VLA.

A path to\ndetermine macroscopic ICM properties opened up with the discovery of \"cold\nfronts\". These were observed as sharp discontinuities in surface brightness and\ntemperature in the ICM, with the property that the brighter (and denser) side\nof the discontinuity is the colder one. The high spatial resolution of the\nChandra X-ray Observatory revealed two puzzles about the cold fronts. First,\nthey should be subject to Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilites, yet in many cases they\nappear relatively smooth and undisturbed. Second, the width of the interface\nbetween the two gas phases is typically narrower than the mean free path of the\nparticles in the plasma, indicating negligible thermal conduction. From the\ntime of their discovery, it was realized that these special characteristics of\ncold fronts may be used to probe the physical properties of the cluster plasma.\nIn this review, we will discuss the recent simulations of cold front formation\nand evolution in galaxy clusters, with a focus on those which have attempted to\nuse these features to constrain the physics of the ICM. In particular, we will\nfocus on the effects of magnetic fields, viscosity, and thermal conductivity on\nthe stability properties and long-term evolution of cold fronts.

This familiar orbital pole motion\n- if detected and measured - can reveal the shape of the underlying\ngravitational potential, the quantity only crudely gauged in the Galaxy so far.\nHere we demonstrate that the debris poles of stellar tidal streams show a very\nsimilar straying and swinging behavior, and give analytic expressions to link\nthe amplitude and the frequency of the pole evolution to the flattening of the\ndark matter distribution.

We also investigate the effect of mass loss on the pulsations of our\nmodels. We approximated solar metallicity WR stars by models of mass-losing\nhelium stars, and we characterized the properties of convection in the envelope\nadopting the standard MLT. Our results show the occurrence of sub-surface\nconvective regions in all studied models. Small surface velocity amplitudes are\npredicted for models with masses below 10Msun. For models with M>10Msun, the\nsurface velocity amplitudes are of the order of 10km/s. Moreover we find the\noccurrence of pulsations for stars in the mass range 9-14Msun, while mass loss\nappears to stabilize the more massive WR stars. We confront our results with\nobservationally derived line variabilities of 17 WN stars. The data suggest\nvariability to occur for stars above 10Msun, which is increasing linearly with\nmass above this value, in agreement with our results. We further find some of\nour models to be unstable to radial pulsations, and predict local magnetic\nfields of the order of hundreds of Gauss in WR stars more massive than 10Msun.\nOur study relates the surface velocity fluctuations induced by sub-surface\nconvection to the formation of clumping in the inner part of the wind. From\nthis mechanism, we expect a stronger variability in more massive WR stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2016 20:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

We aim at testing chromatic line-profile\ntomography as a new tool to investigate exoplanetary atmospheres.

The effect of\nconcentration and disorder are addressed using complete statistical samplings\nof coupled substituted configurations in super-cells containing up to 80 atoms.\nVibrational/thermal effects on the crossover are addressed within the\nquasiharmonic approximation. The effect of disorder seems quite small, while\nincreasing iron concentration results in considerable increase in crossover\npressure. Our calculated compression curves for iron-free, Fe$^{2+}$-, and\nFe$^{3+}$-bearing bridgmanite compare well with the latest experimental\nmeasurements. The comparison also suggests that in a close system, Fe$^{2+}$\npresent in the sample may transform into Fe$^{3+}$ by introduction of Mg and O\nvacancies with increasing pressure. As in the spin crossover in ferropericlase,\nthis crossover in bridgmanite is accompanied by a clear volume reduction and an\nanomalous softening of the bulk modulus throughout the crossover pressure\nrange. These effects reduce significantly with increasing temperature. Though\nthe concentration of [Fe$^{3+}$]$_{Si}$ in bridgmanite may be small, related\nelastic anomalies may impact the interpretation of radial and lateral velocity\nstructures of the Earth's lower mantle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2016 20:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

The LIGO Scientific Collaboration\nand the Virgo Collaboration have verified that this observation is consistent\nwith General Relativity. This paper expands their analysis to a larger class of\nanomalies, highlighting the inferences that can be drawn on non-standard\ntheoretical physics mechanisms. We find that these events constrain a plethora\nof mechanisms associated with the generation and propagation of gravitational\nwaves, including the activation of scalar fields, gravitational leakage into\nlarge extra dimensions, the variability of Newton's constant, a modified\ndispersion relation, gravitational Lorentz violation and the strong equivalence\nprinciple.

We also show that\nGW150914 constrains inferred properties of exotic compact object alternatives\nto Kerr black holes. We argue, however, that the true potential for GW150914 to\nboth rule out exotic objects and constrain physics beyond General Relativity is\nseverely limited by the lack of understanding of the merger regime in almost\nall relevant modified gravity theories. This event thus significantly raises\nthe bar that these theories have to pass, both in terms of having a sound\ntheoretical underpinning, and being able to solve the equations of motion for\nbinary merger events.

This paper introduces FAST (Free Adaptive Super-resolution via\nTransfer), a framework to accelerate any SR algorithm applied to compressed\nvideos. FAST exploits the temporal correlation between adjacent frames such\nthat SR is only applied to a subset of frames; SR pixels are then transferred\nto the other frames. The transferring process has negligible computation cost\nas it uses information already embedded in the compressed video (e.g., motion\nvectors and residual). Adaptive processing is used to retain accuracy when the\ntemporal correlation is not present (e.g., occlusions). FAST accelerates\nstate-of-the-art SR algorithms by up to 15x with a visual quality loss of\n0.2dB.

Typically these data points lie\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ for some $d\\geq 2$.\n  $k$-means and the first algorithms for it were introduced in the 1950's.\nSince then, hundreds of papers have studied this problem and many algorithms\nhave been proposed for it. The most commonly used algorithm is known as\nLloyd-Forgy, which is also referred to as \"the\" $k$-means algorithm, and\nvarious extensions of it often work very well in practice. However, they may\nproduce solutions whose cost is arbitrarily large compared to the optimum\nsolution. Kanungo et al.

Mach stems are important for interpreting emission-line images\nof shocked gas because a normal shock produces higher postshock temperatures\nand therefore a higher-excitation spectrum than an oblique one does. In this\npaper we summarize the results of a series of numerical simulations and\nlaboratory experiments designed to quantify how Mach stems behave in supersonic\nplasmas that are the norm in astrophysical flows. The experiments test\nanalytical predictions for critical angles where Mach stems should form, and\nquantify how Mach stems grow and decay as intersection angles between the\nincident shock and a surface change. While small Mach stems are destroyed by\nsurface irregularities and subcritical angles, larger ones persist in these\nsituations, and can regrow if the intersection angle changes to become more\nfavorable. The experimental and numerical results show that although Mach stems\noccur only over a limited range of intersection angles and size scales, within\nthese ranges they are relatively robust, and hence are a viable explanation for\nvariable bright knots observed in HST images at the intersections of some bow\nshocks in stellar jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2016 22:24:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

Unlike IA and other\ninterference mitigation techniques, blind IA does not require channel state\ninformation at the transmitter (CSIT). The key insight is that the transmitter\nuses the knowledge of channel coherence intervals and receivers utilize\nreconfigurable antennas to create channel fluctuations exploited by the\ntransmitter. In this work, we present a novel experimental evaluation of a\nreconfigurable antenna system for achieving blind IA. We present a blind IA\ntechnique based on reconfigurable antennas for a 2-user multipleinput\nsingle-output (MISO) broadcast channel implemented on a software defined radio\nplatform where each of the receivers is equipped with a reconfigurable antenna.\nWe further compare this blind IA implementation with traditional TDMA scheme\nfor benchmarking purposes. We show that the achievable rates for blind IA can\nbe realized in practice using measured channels under practical channel\nconditions. Additionally, the average error vector magnitude and bit error rate\n(BER) performances are evaluated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2016 22:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-31"}

Although modern probabilistic inference toolkits make it relatively\neasy to specify large and practically relevant probabilistic models, the silver\nbullet---an efficient and general online inference algorithm for such\nproblems---remains elusive, forcing users to write special-purpose code for\neach application. We propose a novel blackbox algorithm -- a hybrid of particle\nfiltering for state variables and assumed density filtering for parameter\nvariables. It has following advantages: (a) it is efficient due to its online\nnature, and (b) it is applicable to both discrete and continuous parameter\nspaces . On a variety of toy and real models, our system is able to generate\nmore accurate results within a fixed computation budget.

For such a control\nproblem, we derived optimal a priori error estimates that demand the convexity\nof the domain and some compatibility conditions on the data. To relax such\nrestrictions, in this paper, we introduce and analyze an efficient and, under\ncertain assumptions, reliable a posteriori error estimator. We realize the\nfractional Laplacian as the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for a nonuniformly\nelliptic problem posed on a semi--infinite cylinder in one more spatial\ndimension. This extra dimension further motivates the design of an posteriori\nerror indicator. The latter is defined as the sum of three contributions, which\ncome from the discretization of the state and adjoint equations and the control\nvariable. The indicator for the state and adjoint equations relies on an\nanisotropic error estimator in Muckenhoupt weighted Sobolev spaces. The\nanalysis is valid in any dimension. On the basis of the devised a posteriori\nerror estimator, we design a simple adaptive strategy that exhibits optimal\nexperimental rates of convergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Mar 2016 22:44:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-31"}

Let $m_{ij}$ be the mean\nfirst passage time from $i$ to $j$ for an irreducible chain with finite state\nspace $S$ and transition matrix $(p_{ij}; i, j \\in S)$.

The contact\nangle between the lens-shaped droplet and the concave spherical substrate is\nexpressed by the generalized Young's formula. The equator of the spherical\nsubstrate is found to play a crucial role. Neither a droplet with its contact\nline on the upper hemisphere of the substrate nor one with its contact line on\nthe lower hemisphere can transform into each other continuously. On a\nhydrophobic substrate, the contact angle jumps discontinuously to\n$180^{\\circ}$, and the droplet is detached from the substrate to form a\nspherical droplet when the line tension is positive and large. This is similar\nto the drying transition on a flat substrate. On the other hand, on a\nhydrophilic substrate, the contact angle jumps discontinuously to $0^{\\circ}$\nwhen the line tension is positive and large. Then, the droplet spread over the\nwhole inner wall to leave a spherical bubble. Therefore, not only the drying\ntransition but also the wetting transition is induced by positive line tension\non a concave spherical substrate. There also exist stable as well as metastable\ndroplets, whose phase diagrams can be complex.

Of specific interest is the application of a\nfluctuation relation that subsumes the second law of thermodynamics en route to\nderiving the evolution equations for the internal state variables. The modeling\nitself is accomplished in a two-temperature framework that appears naturally by\nconsidering the thermodynamic system to be composed of two weakly interacting\nsubsystems, viz. a kinetic vibrational subsystem corresponding to the atomic\nlattice vibrations and a configurational subsystem of the slower degrees of\nfreedom describing the motion of defects in a plastically deforming metal. When\nexternally driven, the two subsystems, identified with their own temperatures,\nfall out of equilibrium. An apparently physical nature of the present model\nderives upon considering the dislocation density, which characterizes the\nconfigurational subsystem, as a state variable.

With a very simple setup and after only 1000 generations of\nevolution, the player reaches the level of an International Master.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 06:41:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2016 04:53:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 14:32:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 20 Aug 2017 11:25:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-22"}

Uplink and\ndownlink spectral efficiency (SE) expressions are derived for any $N$, and\nthese are achievable using estimated channels and per-user-basis MMSE-SIC\ndetectors. Large-system approximations of the SEs are obtained. This analysis\nshows that MMSE-SIC has similar asymptotic SE as linear MMSE detectors,\nindicating that the SE increase from having multi-antenna users can be\nharvested using linear detectors. We generalize the power scaling laws for\nmassive MIMO to handle arbitrary $N$, and show that one can reduce the\nmultiplication of the pilot power and payload power as $\\frac{1}{M}$ where $M$\nis the number of BS antennas, and still notably increase the SE with $M$ before\nreaching a non-zero asymptotic limit.

We also note that the same improvement can be\nachieved by serving $N$ times more single-antenna users instead, thus the\nadditional user antennas are particular beneficial for SE enhancement when\nthere are few active users in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 06:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-31"}

The CDW\nstabilizes levels lying around 1.5 eV below the Fermi level within the Se-based\nvalence band but having a substantial Nb-Nb bonding character.

While these wave profiles are\nsolutions of the KdV equation for any amplitude, it is shown here that there\nfor both the solitary and the cnoidal waves, there are critical amplitudes for\nwhich the horizontal component of the particle velocity matches the phase\nvelocity of the wave. Solitary or cnoidal solutions of the KdV equation which\nsurpass these amplitudes feature incipient wave breaking as the particle\nvelocity exceeds the phase velocity near the crest of the wave, and the model\nbreaks down due to violation of the kinematic surface boundary condition.\n  The condition for breaking can be conveniently formulated as a convective\nbreaking criterion based on the local Froude number at the wave crest.

Biased Monte Carlo simulations using umbrella sampling\ntechnique shows that the free energy cost to create a CsCl nucleus increases as\nthe composition of the smaller particles are decreased. We find that the\nsystems with comparatively lower free energy cost to form CsCl nucleus exhibit\nmore pronounced pre-crystalline demixing near the liquid/crystal interface. The\nstructural frustration between the CsCl and fcc crystal demands this demixing.\nWe show that closer to the equimolar mixture the entropic penalty for demixing\nis lower and a glass forming system may crystallize spontaneously when seeded\nwith a nucleus. This entropic penalty as a function of composition shows a\nnon-monotonic behavior with a maximum at a composition similar to the well\nknown Kob-Anderson (KA) model. Although the KA model shows the maximum entropic\npenalty and thus maximum frustration against CsCl formation, it also shows a\nstrong tendency towards crystallization into fcc lattice of the larger \"A\"\nparticles which can be explained from the study of the energetics. Thus for\nsystems closer to the equimolar mixture although it is the requirement of\ndemixing which provides their stability against crystallization, for KA model\nit is not demixing but slow dynamics and structural frustration caused by the\nlocally favored structure around the smaller \"B\" particles which make it a good\nglass former.

We use a\ncombination of $(1)$ dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) using the\ncontinuous-time-quantum Monte-Carlo (CTQMC) solver for a two-band Hubbard model\nand $(2)$ analytic arguments from an effective bosonized description to\ninvestigate strange metal features in inelastic neutron scattering studies for\ncuprates.

Extinction of the Landau\nquasiparticle pole in the one-electron propagator in the OSMP mirrors the\nemergence of critical liquid-like features in the dynamical spin response. This\nnovel finding also underpins truly anomalous features in phonon dynamics, which\nwe investigate by coupling half-breathing phonons in the specific context of\ncuprates to such a multi-electronic continuum. We find good understanding of\nvarious anomalies encountered in experimental inelastic neutron scattering\nstudies in the near-optimally doped cuprates.

We\nobserved a transit of the inflated Hot Jupiter HAT-P-32b with MODS at the LBT\nto characterize its atmosphere from 3300 to 10000 AA. A time series of target\nand reference star spectra was binned in two broad-band wavelength channels,\nfrom which differential transit light curves were constructed. These broad-band\nlight curves were used to confirm previous transit parameter determinations. To\nderive the planetary transmission spectrum with a resolution of R ~ 60, we\ncreated a chromatic set of 62 narrow-band light curves with an average\nwavelength width of about 100 AA. The spectrum was corrected for the\nthird-light of a near-by M star, whose spectrum was resolved in the individual\nexposures. Additionally, we undertook a photometric monitoring campaign of the\nhost star to correct for the influence of starspots.

The rotation\nperiods delineate a sequence in the color-period diagram (CPD) of increasing\nperiod with redder color. This sequence represents a cross-section at the\ncluster age of the surface P = P (t, M), suggested in prior work to extend to\nat least solar age. The current Sun is located marginally (approx. one sigma)\nabove M 67 in the CPD, as its relative age leads us to expect, and lies on the\nP = P (t, M) surface to within measurement precision. We therefore conclude\nthat the solar rotation rate is normal, as compared with cluster stars, a fact\nwhich strengthens the solar-stellar connection. The agreement between the M\\,67\nrotation period measurements and prior predictions further implies that\nrotation periods, especially when coupled with appropriate supporting work such\nas spectroscopy, can provide reliable ages via gyrochronology for other similar\nFGK dwarfs from the early main sequence to solar age and likely till the main\nsequence turnoff. The M 67 rotators have a rotational age of 4.2 Gyr, with a\nstandard deviation of 0.7 Gyr, implying that similar field stars can be\nage-dated to precisions of ~17%. The rotational age of the M 67 cluster as a\nwhole is therefore 4.2 Gyr, but with a lower (averaged) uncertainty of 0.2 Gyr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 13:26:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

CVPs\nare a collection of up to $|V|$ paths between a source and a target node in a\ngraph $G = (V,E)$, computed using two shortest path trees, that have\ndistinctive properties relative to other path sets. They have been shown to be\nparticularly useful in geospatial applications, where they are an intuitive and\nefficient means for identifying a set of spatially diverse alternatives to the\nsingle shortest path between the source and target. However, spatial diversity\nis not intrinsic to paths in a graph, and little theory has been developed\noutside of application to describe the nature of these paths and the RPC method\nin general. Here we divorce the RPC method from its typical geospatial\napplications and develop a comprehensive theory of CVPs from an abstract\ngraph-theoretic perspective. Restricting ourselves to properties of the CVPs\nand of the entire set of $k$-best CVPs that can be computed in $O(|E| + |V|\n\\log |V|)$, we are able to then propose, among other things, new and efficient\napproaches to problems such as generating a diverse set of paths and to\ncomputing the $k$ shortest loopless paths between two nodes in a graph. We\nconclude by demonstrating the new theory in practice, first for a typical\napplication of finding alternative routes in road networks and then for a novel\napplication of identifying layer-boundaries in ground-penetrating radar (GPR)\ndata.

It is suggested that while the astrophysical foregrounds are likely to\ndominate between few Hz and 10 kHz, relic gravitons with frequencies exceeding\n100 kHz represent a potentially uncontaminated signal for the next generation\nof high-frequency detectors currently under scrutiny.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 14:36:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 10:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

Not only is the global regularity for\nsmooth initial data an open issue, but the behaviour may also depend on the\npresence or absence of boundaries.\n  For a good understanding, it is crucial to carry out, besides mathematical\nstudies, high-accuracy and well-resolved numerical exploration. Such studies\ncan be very demanding in computational resources, but recently it has been\nshown that very substantial gains can be achieved first, by using Cauchy's\nLagrangian formulation of the Euler equations and second, by taking advantages\nof analyticity results of the Lagrangian trajectories for flows whose initial\nvorticity is H\\\"older-continuous. The latter has been known for about twenty\nyears (Serfati, 1995), but the combination of the two, which makes use of\nrecursion relations among time-Taylor coefficients to obtain constructively the\ntime-Taylor series of the Lagrangian map, has been achieved only recently\n(Frisch and Zheligovsky, 2014; Podvigina {\\em et al.}, 2016 and references\ntherein).\n  Here we extend this methodology to incompressible Euler flow in an\nimpermeable bounded domain whose boundary may be either analytic or have a\nregularity between indefinite differentiability and analyticity.\nNon-constructive regularity results for these cases have already been obtained\nby Glass {\\em et al.} (2012). Using the invariance of the boundary under the\nLagrangian flow, we establish novel recursion relations that include\ncontributions from the boundary. This leads to a constructive proof of\ntime-analyticity of the Lagrangian trajectories with analytic boundaries, which\ncan then be used subsequently for the design of a very high-order\nCauchy--Lagrangian method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 14:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

Here, we present a method to filter\nout the small-scale component of vector fields, in such a way that comparison\nbetween solar and stellar (large-scale) magnetic field vector maps can be\ndirectly made. Our approach extends the technique widely used to decompose the\nradial component of the solar magnetic field to the azimuthal and meridional\ncomponents as well. For that, we self-consistently decompose the\nthree-components of the vector field using spherical harmonics of different $l$\ndegrees. By retaining the low $l$ degrees in the decomposition, we are able to\ncalculate the large-scale magnetic field vector. Using a synoptic map of the\nsolar vector field at Carrington Rotation CR2109, we derive the solar magnetic\nfield vector at a similar resolution level as that from stellar magnetic\nimages. We demonstrate that the large-scale field of the Sun is not purely\nradial, as often assumed -- at CR2109, $83\\%$ of the magnetic energy is in the\nradial component, while $10\\%$ is in the azimuthal and $7\\%$ is in the\nmeridional components. By separating the vector field into poloidal and\ntoroidal components, we show that the solar magnetic energy at CR2109 is mainly\n($>90\\%$) poloidal.

Our formalism can also be used to confront\nsynoptic maps synthesised in numerical simulations of dynamo and magnetic flux\ntransport studies to those derived from stellar observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 14:51:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

It is shown in a\nmathematically concise manner that standard beam contact models based on a\npoint-wise contact force fail to describe a considerable range of\nconfigurations, which are, however, likely to occur in practical applications.\nOn the contrary, the formulation proposed here models beam-to-beam contact by\nmeans of distributed line forces, a procedure that is shown to be applicable\nfor arbitrary geometrical configurations. The proposed formulation is based on\na Gauss-point-to-segment type contact discretization and a penalty\nregularization of the contact constraint. By means of detailed theoretical and\nnumerical investigations, it is shown that this approach is more suitable for\nbeam contact than possible alternatives based on mortar type contact\ndiscretizations or constraint enforcement by means of Lagrange multipliers. The\nproposed formulation is enhanced by a consistently linearized integration\ninterval segmentation avoiding numerical integration across strong\ndiscontinuities. In combination with a smoothed contact force law and the\nemployed C1-continuous beam elements, this procedure drastically reduces the\nnumerical integration error, an essential prerequisite for optimal spatial\nconvergence rates. The resulting line-to-line contact algorithm is supplemented\nby contact contributions of the beam endpoints, which represent boundary minima\nof the underlying minimal distance problem. Finally, a series of numerical test\ncases is analyzed in order to investigate the accuracy and consistency of the\nproposed formulation regarding integration error, spatial convergence behavior\nand resulting contact force distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 14:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-28"}

However, when it comes to\ntracking pedestrians in extremely crowded scenes, we are limited to only few\nworks. This is an important problem which gives rise to several challenges.\nPre-trained object detectors fail to localize targets in crowded sequences.\nThis consequently limits the use of data-association based multi-target\ntracking methods which rely on the outcome of an object detector. Additionally,\nthe small apparent target size makes it challenging to extract features to\ndiscriminate targets from their surroundings. Finally, the large number of\ntargets greatly increases computational complexity which in turn makes it hard\nto extend existing multi-target tracking approaches to high-density crowd\nscenarios. In this paper, we propose a tracker that addresses the\naforementioned problems and is capable of tracking hundreds of people\nefficiently. We formulate online crowd tracking as Binary Quadratic Programing.\nOur formulation employs target's individual information in the form of\nappearance and motion as well as contextual cues in the form of neighborhood\nmotion, spatial proximity and grouping constraints, and solves detection and\ndata association simultaneously. In order to solve the proposed quadratic\noptimization efficiently, where state-of art commercial quadratic programing\nsolvers fail to find the answer in a reasonable amount of time, we propose to\nuse the most recent version of the Modified Frank Wolfe algorithm, which takes\nadvantage of SWAP-steps to speed up the optimization.

It is commonly accepted that the terminal wind speed in a\nmagnetic flux-tube is anti-correlated with its expansion ratio, which motivated\nthe definition of widely-used semi-empirical scaling laws relating one to the\nother. In practice, such scaling laws require ad-hoc corrections. A predictive\nlaw based solely on physical principles is still missing. We test whether the\nflux-tube expansion is the controlling factor of the wind speed at all phases\nof the cycle and at all latitudes using a very large sample of wind-carrying\nopen magnetic flux-tubes. We furthermore search for additional physical\nparameters based on the geometry of the coronal magnetic field which have an\ninfluence on the terminal wind flow speed. We use MHD simulations of the corona\nand wind coupled to a dynamo model to provide a large statistical ensemble of\nopen flux-tubes which we analyse conjointly in order to identify relations of\ndependence between the wind speed and geometrical parameters of the flux-tubes\nwhich are valid globally (for all latitudes and moments of the cycle). Our\nstudy confirms that the terminal speed of the solar wind depends very strongly\non the geometry of the open magnetic flux-tubes through which it flows. The\ntotal flux-tube expansion is more clearly anti-correlated with the wind speed\nfor fast rather than for slow wind flows, and effectively controls the\nlocations of these flows during solar minima. Overall, the actual asymptotic\nwind speeds attained are also strongly dependent on field-line inclination and\nmagnetic field amplitude at the foot-points.

Thermal disorder of the lattice perturbs the strongly coupled\nmodes already at moderately high temperature. This happens because of\nincoherent potential fluctuations of the Madelung term and reduced spin-phonon\ncoupling.

Nevertheless, Lyapunov stability analysis of such systems\nis extremely difficult, because even small perturbations may result in hybrid\ndynamics where the solution involves many nonsmooth transitions between\ndifferent contact states. This paper concerns with Lyapunov stability analysis\nof a planar rigid body with two frictional unilateral contacts under inelastic\nimpacts, for a general class of equilibrium configurations under a constant\nexternal load. The hybrid dynamics of the system under contact transitions and\nimpacts is formulated, and a \\Poincare map at two-contact states is introduced.\nUsing invariance relations, this \\Poincare map is reduced into two\nsemi-analytic scalar functions that entirely encode the dynamic behavior of\nsolutions under any small initial perturbation.
