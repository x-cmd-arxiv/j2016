In such\na large system, node failures take place on a regular basis. When a storage\nnode breaks down, a replacement node is expected to regenerate the redundant\ndata as soon as possible in order to maintain the same level of redundancy.\nPrevious results have been mainly focused on the minimization of network\ntraffic in regeneration. However, in practical networks, where link capacities\nvary in a wide range, minimizing network traffic does not always yield the\nminimum regeneration time. In this paper, we investigate two approaches to the\nproblem of minimizing regeneration time in networks with heterogeneous link\ncapacities. The first approach is to download different amounts of repair data\nfrom the helping nodes according to the link capacities. The second approach\ngeneralizes the conventional star-structured regeneration topology to\ntree-structured topologies so that we can utilize the links between helping\nnodes with bypassing low-capacity links. Simulation results show that the\nflexible tree-structured regeneration scheme that combines the advantages of\nboth approaches can achieve a substantial reduction in the regeneration time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 16:11:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-17"}

For a diffuse vacuum-plasma boundary, the emission from\nthe plasma entrance and exit is asymmetric: increasing and decreasing density\nramps enhance and diminish the radiated energy respectively. Enhancements by\nfactors of 50 are found and simulations show that a 1.66 J, 50 fs driver pulse\ncan generate ~400 \\mu J of THz radiation in a 1.2 mm increasing density ramp.\nWe present a model that attributes this effect to a plasma resonance process in\nthe density ramp. The results from the model match those of the simulations for\nramp lengths less than 600 \\mu m. For longer ramps for which simulations are\ntoo time consuming the model shows that the amount of radiation reaches a\nmaximum at a ramp length determined by collisional absorption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 16:54:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 20:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-13"}

One selects a graph $H\\in{\\cal H}$ and plants in it a balanced\n$k$-coloring (by partitioning the vertex set into $k$ roughly equal parts, and\nremoving all edges within each part). The resulting graph $G$ is given as input\nto a polynomial time algorithm that needs to $k$-color $G$ (any legal\n$k$-coloring would do -- the algorithm is not required to recover the planted\n$k$-coloring). Earlier planted models correspond to the case that ${\\cal H}$ is\nthe class of all $n$-vertex $d$-regular graphs, a member $H\\in{\\cal H}$ is\nchosen at random, and then a balanced $k$-coloring is planted at random. Blum\nand Spencer [1995] designed algorithms for this model when $d=n^{\\delta}$ (for\n$0<\\delta\\le1$), and Alon and Kahale [1997] managed to do so even when $d$ is a\nsufficiently large constant.\n  The new aspect in our framework is that it need not involve randomness.

The\ntime evolution of statistical moments is generally not closed for SHS, in the\nsense that the time derivative of the lower-order moments depends on\nhigher-order moments. Here, we identify an important class of SHS where moment\ndynamics is automatically closed, and hence moments can be computed exactly by\nsolving a system of coupled differential equations. This class is referred to\nas linear time-triggered SHS (TTSHS), where the state evolves according to a\nlinear dynamical system. Stochastic events occur at discrete times and the\nintervals between them are independent random variables that follow a general\nclass of probability distributions. Moreover, whenever the event occurs, the\nstate of the SHS changes randomly based on a probability distribution. Our\napproach relies on embedding a Markov chain based on phase-type processes to\nmodel timing of events, and showing that the resulting system has closed moment\ndynamics. Interestingly, we identify a subclass of linear TTSHS, where the\nfirst and second-order moments depend only on the mean time interval between\nevents and invariant of their higher-order statistics. Finally, we discuss\napplicability of our results to different application areas such as network\ncontrol systems and systems biology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 19:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-17"}

When the chain\nlengths are much smaller than the persistence length, one expects a\n(semiflexible) chain to tumble as a rigid rod. At low Wi, a polymer segment\nshorter than the persistence length does indeed tumble as a rigid rod. However,\nfor higher Wi the chain does not tumble as a rigid rod, even if the polymer\nsegment is shorter than the persistence length. In particular, from time to\ntime the polymer segment may assume a buckled form, a phenomenon commonly known\nas Euler buckling. Using a bead-spring Hamiltonian model for extensible dsDNA\nfragments, we first analyze Euler buckling in terms of the oriented\ndeterministic state (ODS), which is obtained as the steady-state solution of\nthe dynamical equations by turning off the stochastic (thermal) forces at a\nfixed orientation of the chain. The ODS exhibits symmetry breaking at a\ncritical Weissenberg number Wi$_{\\text c}$, analogous to a pitchfork\nbifurcation in dynamical systems. We then follow up the analysis with\nsimulations and demonstrate symmetry breaking in computer experiments,\ncharacterized by a unimodal to bimodal transformation of the probability\ndistribution of the second Rouse mode with increasing Wi. Our simulations\nreveal that shear can cause strong deformation for a chain that is shorter than\nits persistence length, similar to recent experimental observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 19:27:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-08"}

The expectation values are decomposed into the vacuum expectation\nvalues and contributions coming from particles and antiparticles. All these\ncontributions are periodic functions of the magnetic flux with the period equal\nto the flux quantum. Related to the non-invariance of the model under the\nparity and time-reversal transformations, the fermion condensate and the charge\ndensity have indefinite parity with respect to the change of the signs of the\nmagnetic flux and chemical potential. The expectation value of the radial\ncurrent density vanishes. The azimuthal current density is the same for both\nthe irreducible representations of the Clifford algebra.

A planet that is bound to but\nwidely separated from a host star can produce a light curve similar to that of\nan FFP. This tension can be resolved with high-resolution imaging of the\nmicrolensing target to search for the lens flux $F_l$ from a possible host\nstar. Here we investigate the accessible parameter space for each of these\ncomponents --- $\\pi_{\\rm E}$, $\\rho$, and $F_l$ --- considering different\nsatellites for a range of FFP masses, Galactic distances, and source star\nproperties. We find that at the beginning of K2C9, when its projected\nseparation from the Earth (as viewed from the center of its survey field) is\n$\\lesssim$0.2 AU, it will be able to measure $\\pi_{\\rm E}$ for Jupiter-mass FFP\ncandidates at distances larger than $\\sim$2 kpc and to Earth-mass lenses at\n$\\sim$8 kpc. At the end of its campaign, when $D_\\perp = 0.81$ AU, it is\nsensitive to planetary-mass lenses for distances $\\gtrsim$3.5 kpc, and even\nthen only to those with mass $\\gtrsim$M$_{\\rm Jup}$. From lens flux constraints\nwe find that it will be possible to exclude all stellar-mass host stars (down\nto the deuterium-burning limit) for events within $\\sim$2 kpc. Together these\nindicate that the ability to characterize FFPs detected during K2C9 is\noptimized for events occurring toward the beginning of the campaign. $WFIRST$,\non the other hand, will be able to detect and characterize FFPs with masses at\nleast as low as super-Earths throughout the Galaxy during its entire\nmicrolensing survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

Based on basic\nthermodynamic principles, it can be shown that the meridional heat flux, in\ncombination with the meridional temperature gradient, acts to maximize entropy\nproduction of the atmosphere. In fact, maximum entropy production (MEP) has\nbeen successfully used to explain the observed mean state of the atmosphere and\nother components of the climate system.

The structure and heating of coronal loops are investigated since\ndecades. Established scaling laws relate fundamental quantities like the loop\napex temperature, pressure, length, and the coronal heating. Aims. We test such\nscaling laws against a large-scale 3D MHD model of the Solar corona, which\nbecame feasible with nowadays high-performance computing. Methods. We drive an\nactive region simulation a with photospheric observations and found strong\nsimilarities to the observed coronal loops in X-rays and EUV wavelength. A 3D\nreconstruction of stereoscopic observations showed that our model loops have a\nrealistic spatial structure.

Finally, we fit a new scaling law\nthat represents well hot loops and also cooler structures, which was not\npossible before only based on observations. Results. Our model data gives some\nsupport for scaling laws that were established for hot and EUV-emissive coronal\nloops. For the RTV scaling law we find an offset to our model data, which can\nbe explained by 1D considerations of a static loop with a constant heat input\nand conduction. With a fit to our model data we set up a new scaling law for\nthe coronal heat input along magnetic field lines. Conclusions. RTV-like\nscaling laws were fitted to hot loops and therefore do not predict well the\ncoronal heat input for cooler structures that are hardly observable. The basic\ndifferences between 1D and self-consistent 3D modeling account for deviations\nbetween our and earlier scaling laws.

Relative to a Chabrier IMF, for which we show\nthe implied masses to be close to minimal, the inferred masses increase in both\nthe low- and high-metallicity regimes due to the addition of stellar remnants\nand dwarf stars, respectively. The resulting galaxy stellar mass function\n(GSMF) shifts toward higher masses by 0.5 dex, without affecting the high-mass\nslope (and thus the need for effective quenching). The implied low-redshift SFR\ndensity increases by an order of magnitude. However, these results depend\nstrongly on the assumed IMF parametrisation, which is not directly constrained\nby the observations. Varying the low-end IMF slope instead of the high-end IMF\nslope, while maintaining the same dwarf-to-giant ratio, results in a much more\nmodest GSMF shift of 0.2 dex and a 10 per cent increase in the SFR density\nrelative to the Chabrier IMF.

In other materials,\nmost importantly iron based systems with only hole or only electron pockets,\nthe microscopic origin is hotly debated. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)\nhas been shown to be a powerful experimental probe to detect electronic\nexcitations and further allows to deduce some fingerprints of bosonic\ncollective modes.

The first prescription is\nbased on a generalisation of the kinetic mesoscopic virial equation and\nexpresses the pressure exerted on the walls in terms of the average of the\nvirial of the inter-particle forces. In the second approach, the pressure and\nthe surface tension are identified with the volume and area derivatives,\nrespectively, of the partition function associated with the known stationary\nnon-equilibrium distribution of the model. The third method is a mechanical\napproach and is related to the work necessary to deform the system. The\npressure is obtained by comparing the expression of the work in terms of local\nstress and strain with the corresponding expression in terms of microscopic\ndistribution. This is determined from the force balance encoded in the\nBorn-Green-Yvon equation.

We consider rotation rates up to 85\\% of the\ncritical (breakup) rotation rate, which yields an equatorial radius that is up\nto 17\\% larger than the polar radius. This substantial oblateness enhances the\ndisparity between polar and equatorial modes of convection.

We find that the dispersal kernel in\nthe moving state is best described by a mixture exponential distribution,\nindicating the hierarchical nature of the movement. On the other hand, the\nwaiting time appears to be scale-invariant below a certain cut-off and is best\ndescribed by a truncated power-law distribution, suggesting heterogenous\ndynamics in the non-moving state. We explore possible explanations for the\nobserved phenomena, covering factors that can play a role in the generation of\nmobility patterns, such as the context of grazing environment, the intrinsic\ndecision-making mechanism or the energy status of different activities. In\nparticular, we propose a new hypothesis that the underlying movement pattern\ncan be attributed to the most probable observable energy status under the\nmaximum entropy configuration. These results are not only valuable for\nmodelling cattle movement but also provide new insights for understanding the\nunderlying biological basis of grazing behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 00:17:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-18"}

For a\nconnected graph $G$ and a given integer $k$ with $2\\leq k\\leq |V(G)|$, the\n\\emph{$k$-monochromatic vertex-index $mvx_k(G)$} of $G$ is the maximum number\nof colors needed such that for each subset $S\\subseteq V(G)$ of $k$ vertices,\nthere exists a vertex-monochromatic $S$-tree. We show that for a given a\nconnected graph $G$, and a positive integer $L$ with $L\\leq |V(G)|$, to decide\nwhether $mvx_k(G)\\geq L$ is NP-complete for each integer $k$ such that $2\\leq\nk\\leq |V(G)|$. We also obtain some Nordhaus-Gaddum-type results for the\n$k$-monochromatic vertex-index.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 02:31:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Mar 2016 10:34:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-22"}

As the use of\nconfidential patient information from such sources become more common,\nmaintaining privacy of patients is of utmost importance. For a binary disease\noutcome of interest, we show that the techniques of microaggregation\n(equivalent to specimen pooling) and \\underline{Po}oled \\underline{Lo}gistic\n\\underline{R}egression (PoLoR) could be applied for analysis of large and/or\ndistributed data while respecting patient privacy. PoLoR is exactly the same as\nstandard logistic regression, but instead of using individual covariate level,\nthe analysis uses microaggregated covariate level when microaggregation is\nconditional on the outcome status. Aggregate levels of covariates can be passed\nfrom the nodes of the network to the analysis center without revealing\nindividual-level microdata and can be used very easily with standard softwares\nfor estimation of disease odds ratio associated with a set of categorical or\ncontinuous covariates. Microaggregation of covariates allows for consistent\nestimation of the parameters of logistic regression model that can include\nconfounders and transformation of exposure. Additionally, since the microdata\ncan be accessed within nodes, effect modifiers can be accommodated and\nconsistently estimated. For analysis of confidential health data, covariate\nmicroaggregation for logistic regression will provide a practical and\nstraightforward alternative to more complicated existing options.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 02:48:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-18"}

Measurements within and across brain structures,\ndemonstrating the occurrence of bursts of beta/gamma oscillations only during\none specific phase of each theta/alpha cycle, have motivated the need to\nadvance beyond linear and stationary time series models. Here we offer a novel\nmeasure, namely, the \"dual frequency RV-coupling coefficient\", for assessing\ndifferent types of frequency-frequency interactions that subserve information\nflow in the brain. This is a measure of coherence between two complex-valued\nvectors, consisting of the set of Fourier coefficients for two different\nfrequency bands, within or across two brain regions. RV-coupling is expressed\nin terms of instantaneous and lagged components. Furthermore, by using\nnormalized Fourier coefficients (unit modulus), phase-type couplings can also\nbe measured. The dual frequency RV-coupling coefficient is based on previous\nwork: the second order bispectrum, i.e. the dual-frequency coherence (Thomson\n1982; Haykin & Thomson 1998); the RV-coefficient (Escoufier 1973); Gorrostieta\net al (2012); and Pascual-Marqui et al (2011). This paper presents the new\nmeasure, and outlines relevant statistical tests. The novel aspects of the\n\"dual frequency RV-coupling coefficient\" are: (1) it can be applied to two\nmultivariate time series; (2) the method is not limited to single discrete\nfrequencies, and in addition, the frequency bands are treated by means of\nappropriate multivariate statistical methodology; (3) the method makes use of a\nnovel generalization of the RV-coefficient for complex-valued multivariate\ndata; (4) real and imaginary covariance contributions to the RV-coherence are\nobtained, allowing the definition of a \"lagged-coupling\" measure that is\nminimally affected by the low spatial resolution of estimated cortical electric\nneuronal activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 03:02:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2016 00:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-21"}

However, in severely disturbed conditions many of those systems exhibit\nstrongly nonlinear behaviour.

The\ndetermination of the bulk vacuum energy requires a proper scheme to sum up the\ninfinitely many contributions.

The game ends when all the edges have been claimed. If Client's graph\nhas property P by the end of the game, then he wins the game, otherwise Waiter\nis the winner. In this paper we study several Client-Waiter games on the edge\nset of the complete graph, and the H-game on the edge set of the random graph.\nFor the complete graph we consider games where Client tries to build a large\nstar, a long path and a large connected component. We obtain lower and upper\nbounds on the critical bias for these games and compare them with the\ncorresponding Waiter-Client games and with the probabilistic intuition. For the\nH-game on the random graph we show that the known results for the corresponding\nMaker-Breaker game are essentially the same for the Client-Waiter game, and we\nextend those results for the biased games and for trees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 11:07:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-18"}

Group delay functions\nare ill-behaved when the transfer function has zeros that are close to unit\ncircle in the z-domain. The modified group delay function addresses this\nproblem and has been successfully used for formant and monopitch estimation. In\nthis paper, modified group delay functions are used for multipitch estimation\nin concurrent speech. The power spectrum of the speech is first flattened in\norder to annihilate the system characteristics, while retaining the source\ncharacteristics. Group delay analysis on this flattened spectrum picks the\npredominant pitch in the first pass and a comb filter is used to filter out the\nestimated pitch along with its harmonics. The residual spectrum is again\nanalyzed for the next candidate pitch estimate in the second pass. The final\npitch trajectories of the constituent speech utterances are formed using pitch\ngrouping and post processing techniques. The performance of the proposed\nalgorithm was evaluated on standard datasets using two metrics; pitch accuracy\nand standard deviation of fine pitch error.

In this work, we address two questions relevant\nfor the observation of sources characterized by AGN-like variability: what is\nthe most time-efficient way to detect such sources, and what is the\nobservational bias that can be introduced by the choice of the observing\nstrategy when conducting blind surveys of the sky. Different observing\nstrategies are evaluated using simulated light curves and realistic instrument\nresponse functions of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), a future gamma-ray\nobservatory.

Although derived using CTA as an\nexample, our conclusions are conceptually valid for any IACTs facility, and in\ngeneral, to all observatories with small field of view and limited duty cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 12:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-08"}

Computing the size of the network, a\nproblem known as Counting, is particularly challenging because messages\nreceived cannot be tagged to a specific sender. Previous works on Counting in\nAnonymous Dynamic Networks do not provide enough guarantees to be used in\npractice. Indeed, they either compute only an upper bound on the network size\nthat may be as bad as exponential, or guarantee only double-exponential running\ntime, or do not terminate, or guarantee only eventual termination without\nrunning-time guarantees. Faster experimental protocols do not guarantee the\ncorrect count. Recently, we presented the first Counting protocol that computes\nthe exact count with exponential running-time guarantees. The protocol requires\nthe presence of one leader node and knowledge of any upper bound Delta on the\nmaximum number of neighbors that any node will ever have. In the present work,\nwe complement the latter theoretical study evaluating the performance of such\nprotocol in practice. We tested a variety of network topologies that may appear\nin practice, including extremal cases such as trees, paths, and continuously\nchanging topologies. We also tested networks that temporarily are not\nconnected. Our simulations showed that the protocol is polynomial for all the\ninputs tested, paving the way to use it in practical applications where\ntopology changes are predictable. The simulations also provided insight on the\nimpact of topology changes on information dissemination. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first experimental study that shows the possibility of\ncomputing the exact count in polynomial time in a variety of Anonymous Dynamic\nNetworks that are worse than expected in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 12:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-18"}

However, it has been demonstrated that modern GPS\nreceivers are vulnerable to signal spoofing attacks. For example, today it is\npossible to change the course of a ship or force a drone to land in an hostile\narea by simply spoofing GPS signals. Several countermeasures have been proposed\nin the past to detect GPS spoofing attacks. These countermeasures offer\nprotection only against naive attackers. They are incapable of detecting strong\nattackers such as those capable of seamlessly taking over a GPS receiver, which\nis currently receiving legitimate satellite signals, and spoofing them to an\narbitrary location. Also, there is no hardware platform that can be used to\ncompare and evaluate the effectiveness of existing countermeasures in\nreal-world scenarios.

Using a likelihood analysis, we find no\nevidence for flux variability in Cen A's core lightcurve above or below the\nspectral break when considering the entire 8 year period. Interestingly,\nhowever, the first $\\sim3.5$ years of the low energy lightcurve shows evidence\nof flux variability at the $\\sim3.5 \\sigma$ confidence level. To understand the\norigin of this spectral break, we assume that the low energy component below\nthe break feature originates from leptons in Centaurus A's radio jet and we\ninvestigate the possibility that the high energy component above the spectral\nbreak is due to an additional source of very high energy particles near the\ncore of Cen A. We show for the first time that the observed $\\gamma$-ray\nspectrum of an Active Galactic Nucleus is compatible with either a very large\nlocalized enhancement (referred to as a spike) in the dark matter halo profile\nor a population of millisecond pulsars. Our work constitutes the first robust\nindication that new $\\gamma$-ray production mechanisms can explain the emission\nfrom active galaxies and could provide tantalizing first evidence for the\nclustering of heavy dark matter particles around black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 13:12:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jul 2016 14:08:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2017 14:09:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 15:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-16"}

Analyses requiring\nexact comparisons between networks are computationally intractable, so new\nmethodologies are sought. We extend the graphlet-based statistics to directed\nnetworks and demonstrate that they are superior to other measures. We predict a\ncountry's gross domestic product (GDP) solely from its wiring patterns in the\nworld trade network (WTN) that could inform policy makers on benefits of trade\nagreements. Surprisingly, we find that it is not enough for a country to be in\na densely connected core in the WTN to have a high GDP, as was previously\nbelieved. In addition to being in the core, a country must also trade with\nperipheral countries, while only being in the core and not trading with\nperipheral economies makes a country prone to debt. Furthermore, by tracking\nthe dynamics of a country's positioning in the WTN over years, we predict\nsuccess or failure of an emerging economy. We validate our methodology on\nmetabolic networks, yielding insights into preservation of enzyme function from\nthe network wiring patterns rather than sequence data. Overall, our methodology\nenables advanced analyses of directed networked data from any area of science,\nallowing domain-specific interpretation of a directed network's topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 13:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-18"}

The\naggregation module consists of two attention blocks which adaptively aggregate\nthe feature vectors to form a single feature inside the convex hull spanned by\nthem.

As a result, further compiler passes may convert type-safe\nsource into type-unsafe machine code. Type-unsafe idioms in the original source\nand type-unsafe optimizations mean that type information in a stripped binary\nis essentially nonexistent. The problem of recovering high-level types by\nperforming type inference over stripped machine code is called type\nreconstruction, and offers a useful capability in support of reverse\nengineering and decompilation.\n  In this paper, we motivate and develop a novel type system and algorithm for\nmachine-code type inference. The features of this type system were developed by\nsurveying a wide collection of common source- and machine-code idioms, building\na catalog of challenging cases for type reconstruction. We found that these\nidioms place a sophisticated set of requirements on the type system, inducing\nfeatures such as recursively-constrained polymorphic types. Many of the\nfeatures we identify are often seen only in expressive and powerful type\nsystems used by high-level functional languages.\n  Using these type-system features as a guideline, we have developed Retypd: a\nnovel static type-inference algorithm for machine code that supports recursive\ntypes, polymorphism, and subtyping. Retypd yields more accurate inferred types\nthan existing algorithms, while also enabling new capabilities such as\nreconstruction of pointer const annotations with 98% recall.

NDP is one of the most basic\nrouting problems, that has been studied extensively. Despite this, there are\nstill wide gaps in our understanding of its approximability: the best currently\nknown upper bound of $O(\\sqrt n)$ on its approximation ratio is achieved via a\nsimple greedy algorithm, while the best current negative result shows that the\nproblem does not have a better than $\\Omega(\\log^{1/2-\\delta}n)$-approximation\nfor any constant $\\delta$, under standard complexity assumptions. Even for\nplanar graphs no better approximation algorithms are known, and to the best of\nour knowledge, the best negative bound is APX-hardness. Perhaps the biggest\nobstacle to obtaining better approximation algorithms for NDP is that most\ncurrently known approximation algorithms for this type of problems rely on the\nstandard multicommodity flow relaxation, whose integrality gap is $\\Omega(\\sqrt\nn)$ for NDP, even in planar graphs.

Finally, the actual compositeness parameters are calculated in\nterms of resonance pole positions and their experimental branching ratios into\n$B^{(*)}\\overline{B}^*$ by using the method of Ref.[1]. We find the values\n$X=0.66\\pm 0.11$ and $0.51\\pm 0.10$ for the $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$,\nrespectively.

Theoretical analysis of\nreconstruction from the data $Xf$ is usually based on a study of the\ncomposition $X^* D X$, where $D$ is some local operator (usually a derivative).\nIf $X^*$ is chosen appropriately, then $X^* D X$ is a Fourier Integral Operator\n(FIO) with singular symbol. The singularity of the symbol leads to the\nappearance of artifacts (added singularities) that can be as strong as the\noriginal (or, useful) singularities. By choosing $D$ in a special way one can\nreduce the strength of added singularities, but it is impossible to get rid of\nthem completely.\n  In the paper we follow a similar approach, but make two changes. First, we\nreplace $D$ with a nonlocal operator $\\tilde D$ that integrates $Xf$ along a\ncurve in the data space. The result $\\tilde D Xf$ resembles the generalized\nRadon transform $R$ of $f$. The function $\\tilde D Xf$ is defined on pairs\n$(x_0,\\Theta)\\in U\\times S^2$, where $U\\subset\\mathbb R^3$ is an open set\ncontaining the support of $f$, and $S^2$ is the unit sphere in $\\mathbb R^3$.\nSecond, we replace $X^*$ with a backprojection operator $R^*$ that integrates\nwith respect to $\\Theta$ over $S^2$. It turns out that if $\\tilde D$ and $R^*$\nare appropriately selected, then the composition $R^* \\tilde D X$ is an\nelliptic pseudodifferential operator of order zero with principal symbol 1.\nThus, we obtain an approximate reconstruction formula that recovers all the\nsingularities correctly and does not produce artifacts. The advantage of our\napproach is that by inserting $\\tilde D$ we get access to the frequency\nvariable $\\Theta$. In particular, we can incorporate suitable cut-offs in $R^*$\nto eliminate bad directions $\\Theta$, which lead to added singularities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 01:16:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-25"}

Based on the Seiberg-Witten map we obtain the gauge invariant and\nLorentz covariant Aharonov-Bohm phase shift in general case on noncommutative\nspace. We find there are two kinds of contribution: momentum-dependent and\nmomentum-independent corrections. For the momentum-dependent correction, there\nis a cancellation between the magnetic and electric phase shifts, just like the\ncase on the commutative space. However, there is a non-trivial contribution in\nthe momentum-independent correction. This is true for both the time-independent\nand time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effects on the noncommutative space. However,\nfor the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect, there is no overwhelming\nbackground which exists in the time-independent Aharonov-Bohm effect on both\ncommutative and noncommutative space. Therefore, the time-dependent\nAharonov-Bohm can be sensitive to the spatial noncommutativity. \\draftnote{The\nnet correction is proportional to the product of the magnetic fluxes through\nthe fundamental area represented by the noncommutative parameter $\\theta$, and\nthrough the surface enclosed by the trajectory of charged particle.} More\ninterestingly, there is an anti-collinear relation between the logarithms of\nthe magnetic field $B$ and the averaged flux $\\Phi/N$ (N is the number of\nfringes shifted).
