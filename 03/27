Our dataset contains both long and short video sequences,\nand enables the quantitatively evaluation for RGB based tracking and\nregistration methods. To construct ground truth for the RGB sequences, we\nsimultaneously capture Near-Infrared (NIR) image sequences where dense markers\n- visible only in NIR - represent ground truth positions. This allows for\ncomparison with automatically tracked RGB positions and the formation of error\nmetrics. Most previous datasets containing nonrigidly deforming sequences are\nbased on synthetic data. Our capture protocol enables us to acquire real-world\ndeforming objects with realistic photometric effects - such as blur and\nillumination change - as well as occlusion and complex deformations. A public\nevaluation website is constructed to allow for ranking of RGB image based\noptical flow and other dense tracking algorithms, with various statistical\nmeasures. Furthermore, we present an RGB-NIR multispectral optical flow model\nallowing for energy optimization by adoptively combining featured information\nfrom both the RGB and the complementary NIR channels. In our experiments we\nevaluate eight existing RGB based optical flow methods on our new dataset.

The SC-QHA method requires\nfewer phonon calculations than the conventional QHA method, and also\nfacilitates the convenient analysis of the microscopic origins of macroscopic\nthermal phenomena. The superior performance of the SC-QHA method is\nsystematically examined by comparing it with the conventional QHA method and\nexperimental measurements on silicon, diamond, and alumina. It is then used to\nstudy the effects of pressure on the anharmonic lattice properties of diamond\nand alumina. The thermal expansion and thermomechanics of Ca$_3$Ti$_2$O$_7$,\nwhich is a recently discovered important ferroelectric ceramic with a complex\ncrystal structure that is computationally challenging for the conventional QHA\nmethod, are also calculated using the formulated SC-QHA method. The SC-QHA\nmethod can significantly reduce the computational expense for various\nquasiharmonic thermal properties especially when there are a large number of\nstructures to consider or when the solid is structurally complex.

The\nscheduling amounts to selecting transition probabilities for a discrete-time\nMarkov evolution which is designed to be consistent with certain initial and\nfinal marginals. The random evolution is selected to be closest to a prior\nmeasure on paths in the relative entropy sense, i.e., a Schroedinger bridge\nbetween the two marginals. This is an atypical stochastic control problem where\nthe control consists in suitably modifying the transition mechanism. The prior\ncan incorporate cost of traversing edges or allocate equal probability to all\npaths of equal length connecting any two given nodes, i.e., a uniform measure\non paths. This latter choice relies on the so-called Ruelle-Bowen random walk\nand gives rise to a scheduling that tends to utilize all paths as uniformly as\nthe topology allows. Thus, when the Ruelle-Bowen law is taken as prior, the\ntransportation plan tends to lessen congestion and ensure a level of\nrobustness. We show that the Ruelle-Bowen law is itself a Schroedinger bridge\nalbeit with a prior that is not a probability measure. The paradigm of\nSchroedinger bridges as a mechanism for scheduling transport on networks can be\nadapted to graphs that are not strongly connected as well as to weighted\ngraphs. The latter leads to transportation plans that effect a compromise\nbetween robustness and transportation cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2016 17:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-29"}

We find that a protoplanetary disk that includes a dead zone\n(a region of low turbulence) has substantially more material in the inner parts\nof the disk, possibly allowing for in situ formation. For the dead zone to last\nthe entire lifetime of the disk requires the active layer surface density to be\nsufficiently small, <100 g/cm^2. Migration through a dead zone may be very slow\nand thus super-Earth formation followed by migration towards the star through\nthe dead zone is less likely. For fully turbulent disks, there is not enough\nmaterial for in situ formation. However, in this case, super-Earths can form\nfarther out in the disk and migrate inwards on a reasonable timescale. We\nsuggest that both of these formation mechanisms operate in different planetary\nsystems. This can help to explain the observed large range in densities of\nsuper-Earths because the formation location determines the composition.\nFurthermore, we speculate that super-Earths could have formed in the inner\nparts of our solar system and cleared the material in the region inside of\nMercury's orbit. The super-Earths could migrate through the gas disk and fall\ninto the Sun if the disk was sufficiently cool during the final gas disk\naccretion process. While it is definitely possible to meet all of these\nrequirements, we don't expect them to occur in all systems, which may explain\nwhy the solar system is somewhat special in its lack of super-Earths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Mar 2016 21:02:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

Different strategies to determine the collision probabilities, and\nto enforce the Pauli blocking, also produce considerably different results.\nThere is a substantial spread in the predictions for the observables, which is\nmuch smaller at the higher incident energy.

Force chains are a\nprime example and are thought to constrain bulk properties such as mechanical\nstability and acoustic transmission. However, characterizing the dynamic nature\nof mesoscale architectures in granular systems can be challenging. A growing\nbody of work has shown that graph theoretic approaches may provide a useful\nfoundation for tackling these problems. Here, we extend current approaches by\nutilizing multilayer networks as a framework for directly quantifying the\nevolution of mesoscale architecture in a compressed granular system. We examine\na quasi-two-dimensional aggregate of photoelastic disks, subject to biaxial\ncompression through a series of small, quasistatic steps. Treating particles as\nnetwork nodes and inter-particle forces as network edges, we construct a\nmultilayer network by linking together the series of static force networks that\nexist at each strain step. We then extract the inherent mesoscale structure\nfrom the system by using a generalization of community detection methods, and\nwe define quantitative measures to characterize the reconfiguration and\nevolution of this structure throughout compression. By separately considering\nthe network of normal and tangential forces, we find that they display\ndifferent structural evolution. To test the sensitivity of the network model to\nparticle properties, we examine whether the method can distinguish a subsystem\nof low-friction particles within a bath of higher-friction particles.

It\nhas also been the subject of extensive study in the behavioral economics\nliterature. While the simplest models assume that the agents are naive,\nreasoning about the future without taking their bias into account, there is\nconsiderable evidence that people often behave in ways that are sophisticated\nwith respect to present bias, making plans based on the belief that they will\nbe present-biased in the future. For example, committing to a course of action\nto reduce future opportunities for procrastination or overconsumption are\ninstances of sophisticated behavior in everyday life.\n  Models of sophisticated behavior have lacked an underlying formalism that\nallows one to reason over the full space of multi-step tasks that a\nsophisticated agent might face. This has made it correspondingly difficult to\nmake comparative or worst-case statements about the performance of\nsophisticated agents in arbitrary scenarios. In this paper, we incorporate the\nnotion of sophistication into a graph-theoretic model that we used in recent\nwork for modeling naive agents. This new synthesis of two formalisms -\nsophistication and graph-theoretic planning - uncovers a rich structure that\nwasn't apparent in the earlier behavioral economics work on this problem.\n  In particular, our graph-theoretic model makes two kinds of new results\npossible. First, we give tight worst-case bounds on the performance of\nsophisticated agents in arbitrary multi-step tasks relative to the optimal\nplan. Second, the flexibility of our formalism makes it possible to identify\nnew phenomena that had not been seen in prior literature: these include a\nsurprising non-monotonic property in the use of rewards to motivate\nsophisticated agents and a framework for reasoning about commitment devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2016 06:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-29"}

In the latter, we use the Parameterised Post-Newtonian (PPN)\nformalism. We also explore the hypothesis that the electric and magnetic\nproperties of vacuum reflect the spacetime isometries.

In contrast to Ref.[3], the oscillatory versus\nmonotonic spatial forms of the potentials of each atom are found not to be\nrelated to the reversible versus irreversible nature of the excitation transfer\ninvolved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Mar 2016 09:34:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

The characterization result of the present paper\napplies to agendas of formulas of an arbitrary selfextensional logic. This\nnotion comes from AAL, and encompasses a vast class of logics, of which\nclassical, intuitionistic, modal, many-valued and relevance logics are special\ncases.
