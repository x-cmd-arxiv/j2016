However, the RANS\npredictions have large model-form uncertainties for many complex flows.\nQuantification of these large uncertainties originating from the modeled\nReynolds stresses has attracted attention in turbulence modeling community.\nRecently, a physics-based Bayesian framework for quantifying model-form\nuncertainties has been proposed with successful applications to several flows.\nNonetheless, how to specify proper priors without introducing unwarranted,\nartificial information remains challenging to the current form of the\nphysics-based approach. Another recently proposed method based on random matrix\ntheory provides the prior distributions with the maximum entropy, which is an\nalternative for model-form uncertainty quantification in RANS simulations. In\nthis work, we utilize the random matrix theoretic approach to assess and\npossibly improve the specification of priors used in the physics-based\napproach. The numerical results show that, to achieve maximum entropy in the\nprior of Reynolds stresses, the perturbations of shape parameters in\nBarycentric coordinates are normally distributed. Moreover, the perturbations\nof the turbulence kinetic energy should conform to log-normal distributions.\nFinally, it sheds light on how large the variance of each physical variable\nshould be compared with each other to achieve the approximate maximum entropy\nprior. The conclusion can be used as a guidance for specifying proper priors in\nthe physics-based, Bayesian uncertainty quantification framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 16:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

The model comprises two complementary mechanisms:\nOne mechanism accounts for the evolution of the internal link structure of a\nsingle community, and the second mechanism coordinates the growth of multiple\noverlapping communities. The first mechanism is based on the assumption that\neach node establishes links with its neighbors and introduces new nodes to the\ncommunity at different rates. We demonstrate that this simple mechanism gives\nrise to an effective maximal degree within communities. This observation is\nrelated to the anthropological theory known as Dunbar's number, i.e., the\nempirical observation of a maximal number of ties which an average individual\ncan sustain within its social groups. The second mechanism is based on a\nrecently proposed generalization of preferential attachment to community\nstructure, appropriately called structural preferential attachment (SPA). The\ncombination of these two mechanisms into a single model (SPA+) allows us to\nreproduce a number of the global statistics of real networks: The distribution\nof community sizes, of node memberships and of degrees. The SPA+ model also\npredicts (a) three qualitative regimes for the degree distribution within\noverlapping communities and (b) strong correlations between the number of\ncommunities to which a node belongs and its number of connections within each\ncommunity. We present empirical evidence that support our findings in real\ncomplex networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 16:31:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 14:49:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 19:19:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-26"}

Interestingly, structure2vec extracts features by performing a\nsequence of function mappings in a way similar to graphical model inference\nprocedures, such as mean field and belief propagation.

This research evaluates the advantages and disadvantages\nof a kernel written in a higher level language. To do this, the network stack\nsubsystem of the kernel was implemented in Go with the Communicating Sequential\nProcesses (CSP) style. Go is a high-level programming language that supports\nthe CSP style, which recommends splitting large tasks into several smaller ones\nrunning in independent \"threads\".

Transiting planets currently represent the most informative data\nset on the ensemble properties of exoplanets within 1 AU of their star.\nHowever, the transit method is inherently biased due to both geometric and\ndetection-driven effects. In this work, we derive the overall observational\nbiases affecting the most basic transit parameters from first principles. By\nassuming a trapezoidal transit and using conditional probability, we infer the\nexpected distribution of these terms both as a joint distribution and in a\nmarginalized form. These general analytic results provide a baseline against\nwhich to compare trends predicted by mission-tailored injection/recovery\nsimulations and offer a simple way to correct for observational bias. Our\nresults explain why the observed population of transiting planets displays a\nnon-uniform impact parameter distribution, with a bias towards near-equatorial\ngeometries. We also find that the geometric bias towards observed planets\ntransiting near periastron is attenuated by the longer durations which occur\nnear apoastron. Finally, we predict that the observational bias with respect to\nratio-of-radii is super-quadratic, scaling as $(R_P/R_{\\star})^{5/2}$, driven\nby an enhanced geometric transit probability and modestly longer durations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 20:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 15:05:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2016 18:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

The distributive caching, green energy sharing and the on-grid\nenergy backup have improved the reliability and performance of the wireless\nmultimedia downloading process. To minimize the total on-grid power consumption\nof the whole network, while guaranteeing that each user can retrieve the whole\ncontent, the user association scheme is jointly designed with consideration of\nresource allocation, including subchannel assignment, power allocation and\npower flow among nodes, where the user association scheme decides which SN\nserves which user. First, the optimal power allocated to each subchannel and\nthe power flows among nodes are derived analytically. Then, the user\nassociation problem is decoupled from the subchannel assignment problem, and\nthe proposed user association scheme has leveraged the multicasting nature of\nthe content download process. To decide which subchannel is assigned to which\nnode, the number of subchannels assigned to each node is first determined,\naccording to the green energy generating rate and the associated traffic\noffload, and then the corresponding subchannels are selected from the total\nassigned system spectrum.

Our result is best expressed as a set of linear relations, the\n\"generalized Stokes laws\", between the coefficients of a tensorial spherical\nharmonic expansion of the force per unit area and the surface slip. The\ngeneralized friction tensors in these laws are many-body functions of the\ncolloidal configuration and can be obtained to any desired accuracy by solving\na system of linear equations. Quantities derived from the force per unit area -\nforces, torques and stresslets on the colloids and flow, pressure and entropy\nproduction in the fluid - have succinct expressions in terms of the generalized\nStokes laws. Most notably, the active forces and torques have a dissipative,\nlong-ranged, many-body character that can cause phase separation,\ncrystallization, synchronization and a variety of other effects observed in\nactive suspensions.

Towards this\nend, data centers can employ a rich set of resource management knobs, such as\nworkload shifting and dynamic server provisioning. Nonetheless, these knobs may\nnot be readily available in a cloud data center (CDC) that serves cloud\ntenants/users, because workloads in CDCs are managed by tenants themselves who\nare typically charged based on a usage-based or flat-rate pricing and often\nhave no incentive to cooperate with the CDC operator for demand response and\ncost saving. Towards breaking such \"split incentive\" hurdle, a few recent\nstudies have tried market-based mechanisms, such as dynamic pricing, inside\nCDCs. However, such mechanisms often rely on complex designs that are hard to\nimplement and difficult to cope with by tenants. To address this limitation, we\npropose a novel incentive mechanism that is not dynamic, i.e., it keeps pricing\nfor cloud resources unchanged for a long period. While it charges tenants based\non a Usage-based Pricing (UP) as used by today's major cloud operators, it\nrewards tenants proportionally based on the time length that tenants set as\ndeadlines for completing their workloads. This new mechanism is called\nUsage-based Pricing with Monetary Reward (UPMR). We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of UPMR both analytically and empirically. We show that UPMR can\nreduce the CDC operator's energy cost by 12.9% while increasing its profit by\n4.9%, compared to the state-of-the-art approaches used by today's CDC operators\nto charge their tenants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2016 01:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-30"}

Since modern embedded applications become\nmore complex with dynamic behavior changes at run-time, several extensions of\nthe SDF model have been proposed to specify the dynamic behavior changes while\npreserving static analyzability of the SDF model. They assume that an\napplication has a finite number of behaviors (or modes) and each behavior\n(mode) is represented by an SDF graph.

A simple microstructural model is used to predict\nmacroscopic fracture initiation. The simplicity of the model ensures highly\nefficient computations, enabling an comprehensive study: a large range of hard\nphase volume fractions and yield stress ratios, for wide range of applied\nstress states. Each combination of these parameters is analyzed using a large\nset of (random) microstructures. It is observed that only one of the phases\ndominates macroscopic fracture initiation: at low stress triaxiality the soft\nphase is dominant, but above a critical triaxiality the hard phase takes over\nresulting in a strong decrease in ductility. This transition is strongly\ndependent on microstructural parameters. If the hard phase volume fraction is\nsmall, the fracture initiation is dominated by the soft phase even at high\nphase contrast. At higher hard phase volume fraction, the hard phase dominates\nalready at low phase contrast. This simple model thereby reconciles\nexperimental observations from the literature for a specific combination of\nparameters, which may have triggered contradictory statements in the past. A\nmicroscopic analysis reveals that the average phase distribution around\nfracture initiation sites is nearly the same for the two failure mechanisms.\nAlong the tensile direction, regions of the hard phase are found directly next\nto the fracture initiation site. This `band' of hard phase is intersected\nthrough the fracture initiation site by `bands' of the soft phase aligned with\nshear. Clearly, the local mechanical incompatibility is dominant for the\ninitiation of fracture, regardless whether fracture initiates in the soft or in\nthe hard phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2016 11:19:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 19:45:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-06"}

This is not an easy task if\ncombined with cosmological constraints, since the mechanism of moduli\nstabilization fixes both the scale of supersymmetric particles and the scale of\nmoduli, which tend to be of the same order. However, if on the one hand\nsupersymmetric particles with TeV mass are desired in order to address the\nhierarchy problem, on the other hand the cosmological moduli problem requires\nthe moduli to be heavier than 100 TeV. The specific setup of sequestered\ncompactifications makes this hierarchy achievable, at least in principle: as in\nthese models the visible sector is located on a stack of D3-branes at\nsingularities, a physical separation between the visible degrees of freedom and\nthe SUSY-breaking sources takes place. Such decoupling translates into a\nhierarchy between the scale of SUSY-breaking and the spectrum of supersymmetric\nparticles. Moreover, it is interesting to notice that moduli are the\nfour-dimensional manifestation of the existence of extra-dimensions, and then\ntheir presence is a common feature of all string compactifications. Since they\nare gravitationally coupled, they could decay late in the history of the\nuniverse, affecting in a significant way its cosmological evolution. Possible\ndeviations of the cosmological observables from the values predicted by the\nstandard Hot Big Bang Theory constitute an interesting alternative for the\ndiscovery of BSM physics, which is complementary to the particle physics\nsearch. For this reason in addition to SUSY-breaking in sequestered models, I\nalso studied several cosmological scenarios arising from them, such as\nproduction of non-thermal dark matter and dark radiation, reheating from moduli\ndecay and inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2016 11:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-21"}

The local plastic\nresponse is determined by (i) the relative misorientation of the slip systems\nof individual grains, and (ii) the different mechanical properties of the\nphases. The relative importance of these two mechanisms at the meso-scale is\nunclear: is the plastic response dominated by the grain's anisotropy, or is\nthis effect overwhelmed by the mechanical contrast between the two phases? The\nanswer impacts the modeling of such a material at the meso-scale, but also\ngives insights in the resulting fracture mechanisms at that length-scale. Until\nnow, this question has been addressed only for particular crystallographies and\nmechanical properties. In contrast, this paper studies the issue systematically\nusing a large set of phase distributions, crystallographies, and material\nparameters. It is found that the macroscopic and the mesoscopic\n(grain-averaged) plastic response of the two extreme modeling choices (crystal\nplasticity or isotropic plasticity) converge with increasing phase contrast.\nThe effect of the crystallography is completely overwhelmed by the phase\ncontrast when the yield stress of the hard phase is a factor of four higher\ncompared to the soft phase. When this ratio is lower than two, its influence\nmay not be neglected. However, even in this regime, fracture initiation is\ncontrolled by the local arrangement of the phases.

This\narticle addresses a few critical issues including: embedding global motion\nparameters in the matrix decomposition model, i.e., estimation of global motion\nparameters simultaneously with the foreground/background separation task,\nconsidering matrix block-sparsity rather than generic matrix sparsity as\nnatural feature in video processing applications, attenuating background\nghosting effects when foreground is subtracted, and more critically providing\nan extremely efficient algorithm to solve the low-rank/sparse matrix\ndecomposition task. The first aspect is important for background/foreground\nseparation in generic video sequences where the background usually obeys global\ndisplacements originated by the camera motion in the capturing process. The\nsecond aspect exploits the fact that in video processing applications the\nsparse matrix has a very particular structure, where the non-zero matrix\nentries are not randomly distributed but they build small blocks within the\nsparse matrix. The next feature of the proposed approach addresses removal of\nghosting effects originated from foreground silhouettes and the lack of\ninformation in the occluded background regions of the image. Finally, the\nproposed model also tackles algorithmic complexity by introducing an extremely\nefficient \"SVD-free\" technique that can be applied in most\nbackground/foreground separation tasks for conventional video processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2016 13:53:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-21"}

Furthermore, it is\ndemonstrated that the skyrmions' shape is distorted in canted fields which\nallows to determine the sense of magnetisation rotation as enforced by the\ninterfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2016 14:00:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

Aboard this module, the Ptolemy\nmass spectrometer measured a CO/CO2 ratio of 0.07 +/- 0.04 which differs\nsubstantially from the value obtained in the coma by the Rosetta/ROSINA\ninstrument, suggesting a heterogeneity in the comet nucleus. To understand this\ndifference, we investigated the physico-chemical properties of the Abydos\nsubsurface leading to CO/CO2 ratios close to that observed by Ptolemy at the\nsurface of this region. We used a comet nucleus model that takes into account\ndifferent water ice phase changes (amorphous ice, crystalline ice and\nclathrates), as well as diffusion of molecules throughout the pores of the\nmatrix. The input parameters of the model were optimized for the Abydos site\nand the ROSINA CO/CO2 measured ratio is assumed to correspond to the bulk value\nin the nucleus. We find that all considered structures of water ice are able to\nreproduce the Ptolemy observation with a time difference not exceeding ~50\ndays, i.e. lower than ~2% on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's orbital period. The\nsuspected heterogeneity of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's nucleus is also found\npossible only if it is constituted of crystalline ices. If the icy phase is\nmade of amorphous ice or clathrates, the difference between Ptolemy and\nROSINA's measurements would rather originate from the spatial variations in\nillumination on the nucleus surface. An eventual new measurement of the CO/CO2\nratio at Abydos by Ptolemy could be decisive to distinguish between the three\nwater ice structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2016 15:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

Studies have shown that networks, obtained from\nthe analysis of specific frequency components of brain activity, present\npeculiar architectures with unique profiles of region centrality. However, the\nidentification of hubs in networks built from different frequency bands\nsimultaneously is still a challenging problem, remaining largely unexplored.\nHere we identify each frequency component with one layer of a multiplex network\nand face this challenge by exploiting the recent advances in the analysis of\nmultiplex topologies. First, we show that each frequency band carries unique\ntopological information, fundamental to accurately model brain functional\nnetworks. We then demonstrate that hubs in the multiplex network, in general\ndifferent from those ones obtained after discarding or aggregating the measured\nsignals as usual, provide a more accurate map of brain's most important\nfunctional regions, allowing to distinguish between healthy and schizophrenic\npopulations better than conventional network approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2016 15:53:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-19"}
