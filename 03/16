No signal is available if the arm is not\nsampled. An arm-dependent reward is accrued from each sampling. In each time\nstep, each arm changes state according to known transition probabilities which\nin turn depend on whether the arm is sampled or not sampled. Since the state of\nthe arm is never visible and has to be inferred from the current belief and a\npossible binary signal, we call this the hidden Markov bandit. Our interest is\nin a policy to select the arm(s) in each time step that maximizes the infinite\nhorizon discounted reward. Specifically, we seek the use of Whittle's index in\nselecting the arms.

They are characterized by the\ntopological stability of Fermi surface, whether it encloses band crossing\npoint, i.e., Dirac cone like energy node, or not. They are distinguished from\neach other by the degeneracy and momentum space distribution of the nodal\npoints. To realize these intriguing topological quantum states is quite\nchallenging and crucial to both fundamental science and future application.

A phenomenon of quantum-like\ncollapse occurs when one of the stones in an entangled pair is directly in\ncontact with at least one other stone. The player to whom the entangled pair\nbelongs must then remove one of the stones in the pair from the board. The aim\nof the game is still to surround more territory than the opponent and as the\nnumber of stones increases, all the entangled pairs of stones eventually reduce\nto single stones.

In this work, we consider for the first time the\nchallenging problem of fully compositional three-phase flow in 3D unstructured\ngrids, discretized by any combination of tetrahedra, prisms, and hexahedra.

The\nLake Kariba area of Southern Province, Zambia, is part of a multi-country\nelimination effort and presents a particular challenge as it is an\ninterconnected region of variable transmission intensities.\n  Methods In 2012-13, six rounds of mass-screen-and-treat drug campaigns were\ncarried out in the Lake Kariba region. A spatial dynamical model of malaria\ntransmission in the Lake Kariba area, with transmission and climate modeled at\nthe village scale, was calibrated to the 2012-13 prevalence survey data, with\ncase management rates, insecticide-treated net usage, and drug campaign\ncoverage informed by surveillance. The model was used to simulate the effect of\nvarious interventions implemented in 2014-22 on reducing regional transmission,\nachieving elimination by 2022, and maintaining elimination through 2028.\n  Findings The model captured the spatio-temporal trends of decline and rebound\nin malaria prevalence in 2012-13 at the village scale. Simulations predicted\nthat elimination required repeated mass drug administrations coupled with\nsimultaneous increase in net usage. Drug campaigns targeted only at high-burden\nareas were as successful as campaigns covering the entire region.\n  Interpretation Elimination in the Lake Kariba region is possible through\ncoordinating mass drug campaigns with high-coverage vector control. Targeting\nregional hotspots is a viable alternative to global campaigns when human\nmigration within an interconnected area is responsible for maintaining\ntransmission in low-burden areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 17:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

The main disadvantage is the lack of hermicity in the representation\nof quantum states.

Particularly, we propose a transmit\nprecoding (beamforming) specific to BPSK modulation, which has maximum power\nefficiency and capacity in poor channel conditions. To be more specific, in a\nmultiuser scenario, an objective function is formulated based on the weighted\nsum of error probabilities of BPSK modulated users. Convex optimization is used\nto transform and solve this ill-behaved non-convex minimum probability of error\n(MPE) precoding problem. Numerical results confirm significant performance\nimprovement. We then develop a low-complexity user selection algorithm for MPE\nprecoding. Based on line packing principles in Grassmannian manifolds, the\nnumber of supported users is able to exceed the number of transmit antennas,\nand hence the proposed approach is able to support more simultaneous users\ncompared with existing multiuser transmit precoding methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 18:46:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Oct 2016 00:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-10"}

A new observation with VLA showed a\nre-brightening, which is consistent with the AGN picture. Here, using the radio\nsurvey data of Ofek et al., we statistically examine the chance coincidence\nprobability to produce an event like the FRB 150418 transient. We find that the\nprobabilities to produce a variable radio transient with at least the same\nvariability amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio as the FRB 150415 transient,\nwithout and with the VLA point, are $P_1 \\sim 6 \\times 10^{-4}$ and $P_1 \\sim 2\n\\times 10^{-3}$, respectively.

The putative\ncollision suffered by the proto-Earth that created the Moon is a prime example,\nthough most Solar System bodies bear signatures of such collisions. Current\nplanet formation models predict that an epoch of giant impacts may be\ninevitable, and observations of debris around other stars are providing\nmounting evidence that giant impacts feature in the evolution of many planetary\nsystems. This chapter reviews giant impacts, focussing on what we can learn\nabout planet formation by studying debris around other stars. Giant impact\ndebris evolves through mutual collisions and dynamical interactions with\nplanets. General aspects of this evolution are outlined, noting the importance\nof the collision-point geometry. The detectability of the debris is discussed\nusing the example of the Moon-forming impact. Such debris could be detectable\naround another star up to 10Myr post-impact, but model uncertainties could\nreduce detectability to a few 100yr window. Nevertheless the 3% of young stars\nwith debris at levels expected during terrestrial planet formation provide\nvaluable constraints on formation models; implications for super-Earth\nformation are also discussed. Variability recently observed in some bright\ndisks promises to illuminate the evolution during the earliest phases when\nvapour condensates may be optically thick and acutely affected by the\ncollision-point geometry. The outer reaches of planetary systems may also\nexhibit signatures of giant impacts, such as the clumpy debris structures seen\naround some stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

Our analysis accounts for differences in aperture size,\nsolar abundance, and cosmology, and scales all measurements using customised\nradial profiles for the temperature (T), gas density, and iron abundance (Z).\nWe then compare this dataset to groups and clusters in the L-Galaxies galaxy\nevolution model.\n  Our homogenised dataset reveals a tight T-Z relation for clusters, with a\nscatter in Z of only 0.10 dex and a slight negative gradient.

The\ninertial to physical mass ratio, which is related to the frequency of\noscillations in a trapped gas, is found to be unity in the limits of strong and\nweak attraction and falls to $\\approx 0.78$ in the crossover regime. This\nresult is contrasted by one-dimensional mean field theory, which predicts a\ndivergent mass ratio in the weakly attractive limit. By means of an exact\nmapping our results also predict the existence and properties of\ndark-soliton-like excitations in the super Tonks-Girardeau gas.

Our aim is to establish how\ngrouping and cooperation among users affect performance bounds. We consider two\ntypes of grouping. The first type is from \\cite{Zhang2014}, where each user\nbelongs to a group of users having social ties with it. For this type of\nutility system, each user's strategy maximizes its social group utility\nfunction, giving rise to the notion of \\emph{social-aware Nash equilibrium}. We\nprove that this social utility system yields to the bounding results of Vetta\nfor non-cooperative system, thus establishing provable performance guarantees\nfor the social-aware Nash equilibrium. For the second type of grouping, the set\nof users is partitioned into $l$ disjoint groups, where the users within a\ngroup cooperate to maximize their group utility function, giving rise to the\nnotion of \\emph{group Nash equilibrium}. In this case, each group can be viewed\nas a new user with vector-valued actions, and a 1/2 bound for the performance\nof group Nash equilibrium follows from the result of Vetta. But as we show\ntighter bounds involving curvature can be established. By defining the group\ncurvature $c_{k_i}$ associated with group $i$ with $k_i$ users, we show that if\nthe social utility function is nondecreasing and submodular, then any group\nNash equilibrium achieves at least $1/(1+\\max_{1\\leq i\\leq l}c_{k_i})$ of the\noptimal social utility, which is tighter than that for the case without\ngrouping. As a special case, if each user has the same action space, then we\nhave that any group Nash equilibrium achieves at least $1/(1+c_{k^*})$ of the\noptimal social utility, where $k^*$ is the least number of users among the $l$\ngroups.

In this\nstudy, we investigate the impact of an erupting flux rope on surrounding solar\nstructures through large-scale magnetic coupling. We build a realistic\nenvironment of the solar corona on 2011 February 15 using a global\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model and initiate coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in\nactive region (AR) 11158 by inserting Gibson-Low analytical flux ropes. We show\nthat a CME's impact on the surrounding structures depends not only on the\nmagnetic strength of these structures and their distance to the source region,\nbut also on the interaction between the CME with the large-scale magnetic\nfield. Within the CME expansion domain where the flux rope field directly\ninteracts with the solar structures, expansion-induced reconnection often\nmodifies the overlying field, thereby increasing the decay index. This effect\nmay provide a primary coupling mechanism underlying the sympathetic eruptions.\nThe magnitude of the impact is found to depend on the orientation of the\nerupting flux rope, with the largest impacts occurring when the flux rope is\nfavorably oriented for reconnecting with the surrounding regions. Outside the\nCME expansion domain, the influence of the CME is mainly through field line\ncompression or post-eruption relaxation. Based on our numerical experiments, we\ndiscuss a way to quantify the eruption impact, which could be useful for\nforecasting purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 22:08:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-17"}

Unlike other methods for system\nidentification, Turing Learning does not require predefined metrics to quantify\nthe difference between the system and its models. We present two case studies\nwith swarms of simulated robots and prove that the underlying behaviors cannot\nbe inferred by a metric-based system identification method.

By complementing the IRAS spectral coverage with\nPlanck satellite data from 100 to 857 GHz, we provide new constraints on the IR\nspectrum of thermal dust emission in clusters of galaxies. We achieve this by\nusing a stacking approach for a sample of several hundred objects from the\nPlanck cluster sample; this procedure averages out fluctuations from the IR\nsky, allowing us to reach a significant detection of the faint cluster\ncontribution. We also use the large frequency range probed by Planck, together\nwith component-separation techniques, to remove the contamination from both\ncosmic microwave background anisotropies and the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich\neffect (tSZ) signal, which dominate below 353 GHz. By excluding dominant\nspurious signals or systematic effects, averaged detections are reported at\nfrequencies between 353 and 5000 GHz. We confirm the presence of dust in\nclusters of galaxies at low and intermediate redshifts, yielding an SED with a\nshape similar to that of the Milky Way.

This paper focuses on current challenges of altmetrics. Heterogeneity,\ndata quality and particular dependencies are identified as the three major\nissues and discussed in detail with a particular emphasis on past developments\nin bibliometrics. The heterogeneity of altmetrics mirrors the diversity of the\ntypes of underlying acts, most of which take place on social media platforms.\nThis heterogeneity has made it difficult to establish a common definition or\nconceptual framework. Data quality issues become apparent in the lack of\naccuracy, consistency and replicability of various altmetrics, which is largely\naffected by the dynamic nature of social media events. It is further\nhighlighted that altmetrics are shaped by technical possibilities and depend\nparticularly on the availability of APIs and DOIs, are strongly dependent on\ndata providers and aggregators, and potentially influenced by technical\naffordances of underlying platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 02:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-17"}

Quantum linear systems\nare a class of systems whose dynamics, which are described by the laws of\nquantum mechanics, take the specific form of a set of linear quantum stochastic\ndifferential equations (QSDEs). Such systems commonly arise in the area of\nquantum optics and related disciplines. Systems whose dynamics can be described\nor approximated by linear QSDEs include interconnections of optical cavities,\nbeam-spitters, phase-shifters, optical parametric amplifiers, optical\nsqueezers, and cavity quantum electrodynamic systems. With advances in quantum\ntechnology, the feedback control of such quantum systems is generating new\nchallenges in the field of control theory. Potential applications of such\nquantum feedback control systems include quantum computing, quantum error\ncorrection, quantum communications, gravity wave detection, metrology, atom\nlasers, and superconducting quantum circuits.\n  A recently emerging approach to the feedback control of quantum linear\nsystems involves the use of a controller which itself is a quantum linear\nsystem. This approach to quantum feedback control, referred to as coherent\nquantum feedback control, has the advantage that it does not destroy quantum\ninformation, is fast, and has the potential for efficient implementation. This\npaper discusses recent results concerning the synthesis of H-infinity optimal\ncontrollers for linear quantum systems in the coherent control case. An\nimportant issue which arises both in the modelling of linear quantum systems\nand in the synthesis of linear coherent quantum controllers is the issue of\nphysical realizability. This issue relates to the property of whether a given\nset of QSDEs corresponds to a physical quantum system satisfying the laws of\nquantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 03:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-17"}

To improve this state of\nthe art, we propose to revise the formalism used in IR to design proper\nmeasures for comparing expert rankings.

We study the interactions among the database, the spectrum licensee,\nand unlicensed users by modelling the system as a three-stage sequential\ndecision process. In Stage I, the database and the licensee negotiate regarding\nthe commission for the licensee to use the spectrum market platform. In Stage\nII, the database and the licensee compete for selling information or channels\nto unlicensed users. In Stage III, unlicensed users determine whether they\nshould buy exclusive usage right of licensed channels from the licensee or\ninformation regarding unlicensed channels from the database. Analyzing such a\nthree-stage model is challenging due to the co-existence of both positive and\nnegative network externalities in the information market. Despite of this, we\nare able to characterize how the network externalities affect the equilibrium\nbehaviors of all parties involved.

The influence of virtual particles is prominent in the\nultrastrong-coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), which has\nrecently been realized in several condensed-matter systems.

In this paper, using matrix product\noperators, we extend our analysis of the Schwinger model at zero temperature to\nshow the feasibility of this approach also at finite temperature. This is an\nimportant step on the way to deal with the sign problem of QCD. We analyze in\ndetail the chiral symmetry breaking in the massless and massive cases and show\nthat the method works very well and gives good control over a broad range of\ntemperatures, essentially from zero to infinite temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 09:35:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

In contrast to the classical random walk there is no\nconnection between the behaviour of persistence and the scaling of variance. In\nparticular, we find that for a two-state quantum walks persistence follows an\ninverse power-law where the exponent is determined solely by the coin\nparameter. Moreover, for a one-parameter family of three-state quantum walks\ncontaining the Grover walk the scaling of persistence is given by two\ncontributions. The first is the inverse power-law. The second contribution to\nthe asymptotic behaviour of persistence is an exponential decay coming from the\ntrapping nature of the studied family of quantum walks. In contrast to the\ntwo-state walks both the exponent of the inverse power-law and the decay\nconstant of the exponential decay depend also on the initial coin state and its\ncoherence. Hence, one can achieve various regimes of persistence by altering\nthe initial condition, ranging from purely exponential decay to purely inverse\npower-law behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 09:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-17"}

Even more surprising\nis the fragmentation of the degrees of freedom themselves, leading to\ncoexisting and a priori independent ground states. This puzzling phenomenon was\nrecently put forward in the context of spin ice, in which the magnetic moment\nfield can fragment, resulting in a dual ground state consisting of a\nfluctuating spin liquid, a so-called Coulomb phase, on top of a magnetic\nmonopole crystal.

Experimentally, this fragmentation manifests itself via the\nsuperposition of magnetic Bragg peaks, characteristic of the ordered phase, and\na pinch point pattern, characteristic of the Coulomb phase.

We measure the abundance of peaks\nidentified in aperture mass maps, as a function of their signal-to-noise ratio,\nin the signal-to-noise range $0<\\mathcal S / \\mathcal N<4$. To predict the peak\ncounts as a function of cosmological parameters we use a suite of $N$-body\nsimulations spanning 158 models with varying $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and $\\sigma_8$,\nfixing $w = -1$, $\\Omega_{\\rm b} = 0.04$, $h = 0.7$ and $n_s=1$, to which we\nhave applied the DES SV mask and redshift distribution. In our fiducial\nanalysis we measure $\\sigma_{8}(\\Omega_{\\rm m}/0.3)^{0.6}=0.77 \\pm 0.07$, after\nmarginalising over the shear multiplicative bias and the error on the mean\nredshift of the galaxy sample. We introduce models of intrinsic alignments,\nblending, and source contamination by cluster members. These models indicate\nthat peaks with $\\mathcal S / \\mathcal N>4$ would require significant\ncorrections, which is why we do not include them in our analysis. We compare\nour results to the cosmological constraints from the two point analysis on the\nSV field and find them to be in good agreement in both the central value and\nits uncertainty. We discuss prospects for future peak statistics analysis with\nupcoming DES data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 11:26:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

The results provide evidence for\nanisotropic magnetodielectric (MDE) coupling in this compound. Ac\nsusceptibility exhibits a strong frequency dependence for H parallel c with\nchanges of this feature with the application of external dc magnetic field.

However, its performance is limited by the adiabatic theorem of\nquantum mechanics. In this scenario, shortcuts to adiabaticity, such as\nprovided by the superadiabatic theory, constitute a valuable tool to speed up\nthe adiabatic quantum behavior. In this dissertation we introduce two different\nmodels to perform universal superadiabatic quantum computing, which are based\non the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity by counter-diabatic Hamiltonians. The\nfirst model is based on the use of superadiabatic quantum teleportation,\nintroduced in this dissertation, as a primitive to quantum computing. Thus, we\nprovide the counter-diabatic driving for arbitrary $n$-qubit gates. In\naddition, our approach maps the counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for an arbitrary\n$n$-qubit {\\it gate} teleportation into the implementation of a rotated\ncounter-diabatic Hamiltonian for an $n$-qubit {\\it state} teleportation. In the\nsecond model we use the concept of controlled superadiabatic evolutions to show\nhow we can implement arbitrary $n$-controlled quantum gates. Remarkably, this\ntask can be performed by simple time-independent counter-diabatic Hamiltonians.\nThese two models can be used to design different sets of universal quantum\ngates. We show that the use of the quantum speed limit suggests that the\nsuperadiabatic time evolution is compatible with arbitrarily small time\nintervals, where this arbitrariness is constrained to the energetic cost\nnecessary to perform the superadiabatic evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 12:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-17"}

From the standpoint of a particular agent -\nhaving to choose a strategy, the choice of the paradigm is crucial: the most\nadequate strategy depends on the assumptions made on the other agents.\n  In this paper, we focus on two-player games and their application to the\nautomated synthesis of reliable controllers for reactive systems - a field at\nthe crossroads between computer science and mathematics. In this setting, the\nreactive system to control is a player, and its environment is its opponent,\nusually assumed to be fully antagonistic or fully stochastic.

We demonstrate necking to be an intrinsic flow\ninstability that arises as an inevitable consequence of the constitutive\nbehaviour of essentially any material (with a possible rare exception, which we\noutline). We derive criteria for the onset of necking that are reportable\nsimply in terms of characteristic signatures in the shapes of the\nexperimentally measured rheological response functions, and should therefore\napply universally to all materials. As evidence of their generality, we\nnumerically show them to hold in six popular constitutive models of polymers\nand soft glasses. Two distinct modes of necking instability are predicted. The\nfirst is relatively gentle, and sets in when the tensile stress signal first\ncurves down as a function of the time $t$ (or accumulated strain\n$\\epsilon=\\dot\\varepsilon t$) since the inception of the flow. The second is\nmore violent, and sets in when a carefully defined `elastic derivative' of the\ntensile force first slopes down as a function of $t$ (or $\\dot\\varepsilon$). In\nthe limit of fast flow $\\dot\\varepsilon\\tau\\to\\infty$, where $\\tau$ is the\nmaterial's characteristic stress relaxation time, this second mode reduces to\nthe Consid\\'ere criterion for necking in solids.

For motion control of robots in a highly\ncluttered environment, however, this sampling can easily be trapped in a local\nminimum unless the sample size is very large, since the global optimality of\nlocal minima depends on the degree of uncertainty. Thus, a homology-embedded\nsampling-based planner that identifies many (potentially) local-minimum\ntrajectories in different homology classes is developed to aid the sampling\nprocess. In combination with a receding-horizon fashion of the optimal control\nthe proposed method produces a dynamically feasible and collision-free motion\nplans without being trapped in a local minimum. Numerical examples on a\nsynthetic toy problem and on quadrotor control in a complex obstacle field\ndemonstrate the validity of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 13:49:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Aug 2018 10:21:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-01"}

Our first\nmain result is that the relation between the excitonic couplings and the\nspectral shift in a two-dimensional structure is different (larger shift for\nthe same nearest neighbour coupling) from that in a one-dimensional structure,\nwhich leads to an estimation of dipolar coupling in two-dimensional lattices.\nWe next investigate the mechanisms of homogeneous broadening - population\nrelaxation and pure dephasing - and evaluate their relative importance in\nlinear and two-dimensional aggregates.

In self-assembled QDs, on the other hand, the influence of Auger\nrecombination on the optical properties is in general neglected, assuming that\nit is masked by other processes such as spin and charge fluctuations. Here, we\nuse time-resolved resonance fluorescence to analyze the Auger recombination and\nits influence on the optical properties of a single self-assembled QD. From\nexcitation-power dependent measurements, we find a long Auger recombination\ntime of about 500 ns and a quenching of the trion transition by about 80\npercent.

The\nclassification is based on a categorical duality for quantum group actions\nrecently developed by De Commer and the authors in the spirit of Woronowicz's\nTannaka--Krein duality theorem. The duality establishes a correspondence\nbetween the actions of a compact quantum group $H$ on unital C$^*$-algebras and\nthe module categories over its representation category Rep $H$. This is further\nrefined to a correspondence between the braided-commutative Yetter--Drinfeld\n$H$-algebras and the tensor functors from Rep $H$. Combined with the more\nanalytical theory of Poisson boundaries, this leads to a classification of\ndimension-preserving fiber functors on the representation category of any\ncoamenable compact quantum group in terms of its maximal Kac quantum subgroup,\nwhich is the maximal torus for the $q$-deformation of $G$ if $q\\ne1$. Together\nwith earlier results on autoequivalences of the categories Rep $G_q$, this\nallows us to classify up to isomorphism a large class of quantum groups of\n$G$-type for compact connected simple Lie groups $G$. In the case of $G=SU(n)$\nthis class exhausts all non-Kac quantum groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 15:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}
