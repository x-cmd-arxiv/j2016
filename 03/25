The interconnection graph is studied by means of a\ncollection of simpler graphs, each of which is associated to an eigenvalue of\nthe system matrix of individual dynamics. It is reported that the\ninterconnection graph is connected if and only if no member of this collection\nis disconnected. Moreover, to better understand the relative behavior of\ndistant units, pairwise observability which concerns with the synchronization\nof a certain pair of individual systems in the array is studied. This milder\nversion of observability is shown to be closely related to certain connectivity\nproperties of the interconnection graph as well.

Leave-one-out\ncross-validatory (LOOCV) model assessment is the gold standard for estimating\npredictive p-values that can flag such divergent regions. However, actual LOOCV\nis time-consuming because one needs to rerun a Markov chain Monte Carlo\nanalysis for each posterior distribution in which an observation is held out as\na test case. This paper introduces a new method, called integrated importance\nsampling (iIS), for estimating LOOCV predictive p-values with only Markov chain\nsamples drawn from the posterior based on a full data set. The key step in iIS\nis that we integrate away the latent variables associated the test observation\nwith respect to their conditional distribution \\textit{without} reference to\nthe actual observation. By following the general theory for importance\nsampling, the formula used by iIS can be proved to be equivalent to the LOOCV\npredictive p-value. We compare iIS and other three existing methods in the\nliterature with two disease mapping datasets. Our empirical results show that\nthe predictive p-values estimated with iIS are almost identical to the\npredictive p-values estimated with actual LOOCV, and outperform those given by\nthe existing three methods, namely, the posterior predictive checking, the\nordinary importance sampling, and the ghosting method by Marshall and\nSpiegelhalter (2003).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2016 17:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Jan 2022 07:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

We expand these four disorder functions in spherical harmonics\nand draw the expansion coefficients randomly from a four-dimensional, zero-mean\ngaussian distribution. Different strengths and classes of disorder are realized\nby specifying the $4 \\times 4$ covariance matrix. For each instantiation of the\ndisorder, we solve for the energy spectrum via exact diagonalization. Then we\ncompute the disorder-averaged density of states, $\\rho(E)$, by averaging over\n200,000 different instantiations. Disorder broadens the Landau-level delta\nfunctions of the clean density of states into peaks that decay and merge\ntogether. If the spin-dependent term is dominant, these peaks split due to the\nbreaking of the degeneracy between time-reversed partner states. Increasing\ndisorder strength pushes states closer and closer to zero energy (the Dirac\npoint), resulting in a low-energy density of states that becomes nonzero for\nsufficient disorder, typically approaching an energy-independent saturation\nvalue, for most classes of disorder. But for purely spin-dependent disorder\nwith ${\\bf V}$ either entirely out-of-surface or entirely in-surface, we\nidentify intriguing disorder-induced features in the vicinity of the Dirac\npoint.

In this paper, we look at two untouched\naspects of social storage systems. One aspect involves modelling social storage\nas an endogenous social network, where agents themselves decide with whom they\nwant to build data backup relation. The second aspect involves studying the\nstability of social storage systems, which would help reduce maintenance costs\nand further, help build efficient as well as contented networks.\n  We have a four fold contribution that covers the above two aspects. We,\nfirst, model the social storage system as a strategic network formation game.\nWe define the utility of each agent in the network under two different\nframeworks. Second, we propose the concept of bilateral stability which refines\nthe pairwise stability concept defined by Jackson et. al. 1996, by requiring\nmutual consent for both addition and deletion of links, as compared to mutual\nconsent just for link addition. Mutual consent for link deletion is especially\nimportant in the social storage setting. Third, we prove necessary and the\nsufficient conditions for bilateral stability of social storage networks. For\nsymmetric social storage networks, we prove that there exists a unique\nneighborhood size, independent of the number of agents (for all non-trivial\ncases), where no pair of agents has any incentive to increase or decrease their\nneighborhood size. We call this neighborhood size as the stability point.\nFourth, given the number of agents and other parameters, we discuss which\nbilaterally stable networks would evolve and also discuss which of these stable\nnetworks are efficient --- that is, stable networks with maximum sum of\nutilities of all agents.

Some\nvendors recently proposed enlarging the bandwidth up to 35.2~MHz (so-called\ne-VDSL) as one possible solution to increase the 100 Mbit/s coverage. However,\nas we show in the paper, the bandwidth advantage is illusory as an \"ideal MOV\"\nis not implementable with today's technology, and alien-FEXT practically\ndestroys the envisaged data-rate increase. Therefore, we introduce the Sub-band\nVectoring (SBV) technique, as one practical solution, which turns out to be\nnear optimal in terms of achievable data-rate, as well as incremental for those\nCountries where the NRA adopts sub-loop unbundling regulation. SBV adopts a\nnovel frequency division multiplexing approach, which imposes one fairness\ncondition to equalize data-rate values and overall bandwidth per operator at\ndifferent distances.

In the\nlimit in which the spherical Jeans equation is assumed to be valid for a given\ntracer stellar population, we study the solution of this equation having the\nDark Matter mass profile as an output rather than as a trial parametric input.\nWithin our new formulation, we address to what level dwarf spheroidal galaxies\nfeature a reliable mass estimator.

We\nperform three dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations to show that\nstream collisions can contribute significant optical and ultraviolet light to\nthe flares produced by TDEs, and can sometimes explain the majority of the\nobserved emission. Our simulations focus on the region near the radiation\npressure dominated shock produced by a collision and track how the kinetic\nenergy of the stream is dissipated by the associated shock. When the mass flow\nrate of the stream $\\dot{M}$ is a significant fraction of the Eddington\naccretion rate, $\\gtrsim2\\%$ of the initial kinetic energy is converted to\nradiation directly as a result of the collision. In this regime, the collision\nredistributes the specific kinetic energy into the downstream gas and more than\n$16\\%$ of the mass can become unbound. The fraction of unbound gas decreases\nrapidly as $\\dot{M}$ drops significantly below the Eddington limit, with no\nunbound gas being produced when $\\dot{M}$ drops to $1\\%$ of Eddington; we find\nhowever that the radiative efficiency increases slightly to $\\lesssim 8\\%$ in\nthese low $\\dot{M}$ cases.

Motivated by connections to\nInternet advertising, several variants of this problem have been studied since\nthe seminal work of Mehta, Saberi, Vazirani, and Vazirani (FOCS 2005). However,\nthis entire body of work focuses on a single budget for every advertising\ncampaign, whereas in order to fully represent the actual agenda of an\nadvertiser, an advertising budget should be expressible over multiple tiers of\nuser-attribute granularity. A simple example is an advertising campaign that is\nconstrained by an overall budget but is also accompanied by a set of\nsub-budgets for each target demographic. In such a contract scheme, an\nadvertiser can specify their true user-targeting goals, allowing the publisher\nto fulfill them through relevant allocations.\n  In this paper, we give a complete characterization of the ADWORDS problem for\ngeneral advertising budgets. In the most general setting, we show that, unlike\nin the single-budget ADWORDS problem, obtaining a constant competitive ratio is\nimpossible and give asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds. However for\nour main result, we observe that in many real-world scenarios (as in the above\nexample), multi-tier budgets have a laminar structure, since most relevant\nconsumer or product classifications are hierarchical. For laminar budgets, we\nobtain a competitive ratio of e/(e-1) in the small bids case, which matches the\nbest known ADWORDS result for single budgets. Our algorithm has a primal-dual\nstructure and generalizes the primal-dual analysis for single- budget ADWORDS\nfirst given by Buchbinder, Jain, and Naor (ESA 2007).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2016 22:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-28"}

The\nauthors belong to the latter group. This document was written as a long\nintroduction to further development of geometric tools in financial\napplications such as risk or portfolio analysis. Indeed, risk and portfolio\nanalysis essentially rely on covariance matrices. Besides that the Gaussian\nassumption is known to be inaccurate, covariance matrices are difficult to\nestimate from empirical data. To filter noise from the empirical estimate,\nMantegna proposed using hierarchical clustering. In this work, we first show\nthat this procedure is statistically consistent. Then, we propose to use\nclustering with a much broader application than the filtering of empirical\ncovariance matrices from the estimate correlation coefficients. To be able to\ndo that, we need to obtain distances between the financial time series that\nincorporate all the available information in these cross-dependent random\nprocesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 05:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-28"}

In\nparticular, we focus on whether and how the extinction properties are affected\nby properties of CS dust grains, adopting various dust grain models. We {\\bf\nconfirm} that behaviors of the (effective) extinction laws are highly dependent\non the properties of CS grains.

We find that\nthe criterion for this behavior is given by a ratio of albedos in the $B$ and\n$V$ bands.

If such structures are illuminated by aperiodic time-harmonic incident\nwaves as, e.g., Gaussian beams, the resulting surface scattering problem must\nbe formulated in an unbounded layer including the periodic surface structure.\nAn obvious recipe to avoid the need to discretize this problem in an unbounded\ndomain is to set up an equivalent system of quasiperiodic scattering problems\nin a single (bounded) periodicity cell via the Floquet-Bloch transform. The\nsolution to the original surface scattering problem then equals the inverse\nFloquet-Bloch transform applied to the family of solutions to the quasiperiodic\nproblems, which simply requires to integrate these solutions in the\nquasiperiodicity parameter. A numerical scheme derived from this representation\nhence completely avoids the need to tackle differential equations on unbounded\ndomains. In this paper, we provide rigorous convergence analysis and error\nbounds for such a scheme when applied to a two-dimensional model problem,\nrelying upon a quadrature-based approximation to the inverse Floquet-Bloch\ntransform and finite element approximations to quasiperiodic scattering\nproblems. Our analysis essentially relies upon regularity results for the\nfamily of solutions to the quasiperiodic scattering problems in suitable mixed\nSobolev spaces. We illustrate our error bounds as well as efficiency of the\nnumerical scheme via several numerical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 09:52:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 May 2016 10:50:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-05"}

In all the experiments it is observed that the proposed algorithm\nfor hybridization of EM and K-Means techniques is consistently taking less\nexecution time with acceptable Clustering Fitness value and less SSE than the\nstandard EM algorithm. It is also observed that the proposed algorithm is\nproducing better clustering results than the Cluster package of Purdue\nUniversity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 11:09:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-28"}

Statistical emulators are\ncomputationally cheap approximations of such simulators. They can be built to\nreplace simulators for various purposes, such as the propagation of\nuncertainties from inputs to outputs or the calibration of some internal\nparameters against observations. However, when the input space is of high\ndimension, the construction of an emulator can become prohibitively expensive.\nIn this paper, we introduce a joint framework merging emulation with dimension\nreduction in order to overcome this hurdle. The gradient-based kernel dimension\nreduction technique is chosen due to its ability to drastically decrease\ndimensionality with little loss in information. The Gaussian process emulation\ntechnique is combined with this dimension reduction approach. Our proposed\napproach provides an answer to the dimension reduction issue in emulation for a\nwide range of simulation problems that cannot be tackled using existing\nmethods. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed framework is demonstrated\ntheoretically, and compared with other methods on an elliptic partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) problem. We finally present a realistic application\nto tsunami modeling. The uncertainties in the bathymetry (seafloor elevation)\nare modeled as high-dimensional realizations of a spatial process using a\ngeostatistical approach. Our dimension-reduced emulation enables us to compute\nthe impact of these uncertainties on resulting possible tsunami wave heights\nnear-shore and on-shore. We observe a significant increase in the spread of\nuncertainties in the tsunami heights due to the contribution of the bathymetry\nuncertainties. These results highlight the need to include the effect of\nuncertainties in the bathymetry in tsunami early warnings and risk assessments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 11:59:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 12:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-25"}

We estimate the\nmasses of the SMBHs from their host bulge stellar masses and obtain Eddington\nratios for each AGN. Compared with a representative control sample drawn at the\nsame redshift and stellar mass, the AGN luminosities and Eddington ratios of\nour binary AGNs are similar to those of single AGNs. The U-Y color maps\nindicate that clumpy star forming regions could significantly affect the X-ray\ndetection of binary AGNs, e.g., the hardness ratio. Considering the weak X-ray\nemission in AGNs triggered in merger systems, we suggest that samples of X-ray\nselected AGNs may be biased against gas-rich mergers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 14:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

Similar methods are used to compute usual growth polynomials and\nconjugacy growth polynomials for finite symmetric groups and alternating\ngroups, with respect to various generating sets of transpositions. Computations\nsuggest a class of finite graphs, that we call partition-complete, which\ngeneralizes the class of semi-hamiltonian graphs, and which is of independent\ninterest. The coefficients of a series related to the finitary alternating\ngroup satisfy congruence relations analogous to Ramanujan congruences for the\npartition function. They follow from partly conjectural \"generalized Ramanujan\ncongruences\", as we call them, for which we give numerical evidence in Appendix\nC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 15:40:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 14:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-16"}

One of the drawbacks of the use of\nbiasing is the potential introduction of large weight factors. We discuss a\ngeneral strategy, composite biasing, to suppress the appearance of large weight\nfactors. We use this composite biasing approach for two different problems\nfaced by current state-of-the-art Monte Carlo radiative transfer codes: the\ngeneration of photon packages from multiple components, and the penetration of\nradiation through high optical depth barriers. In both cases, the\nimplementation of the relevant algorithms is trivial and does not interfere\nwith any other optimisation techniques. Through simple test models, we\ndemonstrate the general applicability, accuracy and efficiency of the composite\nbiasing approach. In particular, for the penetration of high optical depths,\nthe gain in efficiency is spectacular for the specific problems that we\nconsider: in simulations with composite path length stretching, high accuracy\nresults are obtained even for simulations with modest numbers of photon\npackages, while simulations without biasing cannot reach convergence, even with\na huge number of photon packages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 15:49:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}

The objective of this study is to\nunravel such interactions based on the potentiometric mapping in the riverbank.\nWe had 60 stop sites along the riverbank for groundwater and river water level\nobservations, and chemical measurements (TDS, EC, temp, and pH). Three river\nwater gauge were also analyzed to see the fluctuations.\n  We identified three types of hydrodynamic relationships with fairly low flow\ngradients: effluent flow at Segmen I (Kranggan - Batuceper) with 0.2-0.25\ngradient, perched flow at Segmen II (Batuceper-Kalibaru) with gradient\n0.2-0.25, and influent flow at Segmen III (Kalibaru-Tanjungburung) with\ngradient 0.15-0.20. Such low flow gradient is controlled by the moderate to low\nmorphological slope in the area. The gaining and losing stream model were also\nsupported by the river water fluctuation data. TDS and EC readings increased\nmore than 40$\\%$ from upstream to downstream. At some points the both\nmeasurements were two times higher than the permissible limits, along with the\ndrops of pH values at those areas.\n  This study shows the very close interaction between Cisadane river water and\ngroundwater in the riverbank.
