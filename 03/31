We performed a series of cosmological\nhydrodynamic N-body simulations featuring adiabatic gas physics and different\nlevels of non-Gaussian initial conditions within the $\\Lambda$CDM framework. We\nfocus on the T-M, S-M, Y-M and Yx-M scalings relating the total cluster mass\nwith temperature, entropy and SZ cluster integrated pressure that reflect the\nthermodynamical state of the intra-cluster medium. Our results show that PNG\nhave an impact on cluster scalings laws. The mass power-law indexes of the\nscalings are almost unaffected by the existence of PNG but the amplitude and\nredshift evolution of their normalizations are clearly affected. The effect is\nstronger for the evolution of the Y-M and Yx-M normalizations, which change by\nas much as 22% and 16% when $f_{NL}$ varies from -500 to 500, respectively.\nThese results are consistent with the view that positive/negative $f_{NL}$\naffect cluster profiles due to an increase/decrease of cluster concentrations.\nAt low values of $f_{NL}$, as suggested by present Planck constraints on a\nscale invariant $f_{NL}$, the impact on the scalings normalizations is only a\nfew percent, which is small when compared with the effect of additional gas\nphysics and other cosmological effects such as dark energy.

That\nresult, then, brings up the question of whether there is an acceptable\nprogramming system (numbering) for which some non-constructivity of the first\ntheorem disappears. The third theorem shows this is the case, but for a subtle\nreason explained in the text. This latter theorem has a number of corollaries,\nregarding its acceptable programming system, and providing some surprises and\nsubtleties about proving its program properties (including universality, and\nthe presence of the composition control structure). The next two theorems\nprovide acceptable systems with contrasting surprises regarding proving\nuniversality in them. Finally the next and last theorem (the most difficult to\nprove in the paper) provides an acceptable system with some positive and\nnegative surprises regarding verification of its true program properties: the\nexistence of the control structure composition is provable for it, but anything\nabout true I/O-program equivalence for syntactically unequal programs is not\nprovable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 18:20:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 12:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-14"}

The main conclusions are as follows. 1) Larger, more\ncapable computing and data facilities are needed to support HEP science goals\nin all three frontiers: Energy, Intensity, and Cosmic. The expected scale of\nthe demand at the 2025 timescale is at least two orders of magnitude -- and in\nsome cases greater -- than that available currently. 2) The growth rate of data\nproduced by simulations is overwhelming the current ability, of both facilities\nand researchers, to store and analyze it. Additional resources and new\ntechniques for data analysis are urgently needed. 3) Data rates and volumes\nfrom HEP experimental facilities are also straining the ability to store and\nanalyze large and complex data volumes. Appropriately configured\nleadership-class facilities can play a transformational role in enabling\nscientific discovery from these datasets. 4) A close integration of HPC\nsimulation and data analysis will aid greatly in interpreting results from HEP\nexperiments. Such an integration will minimize data movement and facilitate\ninterdependent workflows. 5) Long-range planning between HEP and ASCR will be\nrequired to meet HEP's research needs. To best use ASCR HPC resources the\nexperimental HEP program needs a) an established long-term plan for access to\nASCR computational and data resources, b) an ability to map workflows onto HPC\nresources, c) the ability for ASCR facilities to accommodate workflows run by\ncollaborations that can have thousands of individual members, d) to transition\ncodes to the next-generation HPC platforms that will be available at ASCR\nfacilities, e) to build up and train a workforce capable of developing and\nusing simulations and analysis to support HEP scientific research on\nnext-generation systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 18:34:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 20:52:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}

The most popular current method works by exploring a dense\ngrid of possible directions to individual sources, and identifying the single\ndirection with the maximum probability of having produced multiple detected\nneutrinos. This method has numerous strengths, but it is computationally\nintensive and, because it focuses on the single best location for a point\nsource, additional point sources are not included in the evidence.

The validity of the surrogacy condition is often\ncontroversial.

In this paper, we demonstrate that one particular\ngroomer called soft drop actually makes precision jet substructure easier. In\nparticular, we derive a factorization formula for a large class of soft drop\njet substructure observables, including jet mass. The essential observation\nthat allows for this factorization is that, without the soft wide-angle\nradiation groomed by soft drop, all singular contributions are collinear. The\nsimplicity and universality of the collinear limit in QCD allows us to show\nthat to all orders, the normalized differential cross section has no\ncontributions from non-global logarithms. It is also independent of process, up\nto the relative fraction of quark and gluon jets. In fact, soft drop allows us\nto define this fraction precisely. The factorization theorem also explains why\nsoft drop observables are less sensitive to hadronization than their ungroomed\ncounterparts. Using the factorization theorem, we resum the soft drop jet mass\nto next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. This requires calculating some\nclustering effects that are closely related to corresponding effects found in\njet veto calculations.

To do so, one of the most popular methods\nconsists in combining the UV with the emission from the dust itself in the IR.\nYet, different studies have derived different estimators, showing that no such\nhybrid estimator is truly universal. In this paper we aim at understanding and\nquantifying what physical processes drive the variations between different\nhybrid estimators. Doing so, we aim at deriving new universal UV+IR hybrid\nestimators to correct the UV for dust attenuation, taking into account the\nintrinsic physical properties of galaxies. We use the CIGALE code to model the\nspatially-resolved FUV to FIR SED of eight nearby star-forming galaxies drawn\nfrom the KINGFISH sample. This allows us to determine their local physical\nproperties, and in particular their UV attenuation, average SFR, average\nspecific SFR (sSFR), and their stellar mass. We then examine how hybrid\nestimators depend on said properties. We find that hybrid UV+IR estimators\nstrongly depend on the stellar mass surface density (in particular at 70 and\n100 micron) and on the sSFR (in particular at 24 micron and the TIR).\nConsequently, the IR scaling coefficients for UV obscuration can vary by almost\nan order of magnitude. This result contrasts with other groups who found\nrelatively constant coefficients with small deviations. We exploit these\nvariations to construct a new class of hybrid estimators based on observed UV\nto near-IR colours and near-IR luminosity densities per unit area.

In their formalism, they limited the\nlarge-scale density environment to be those of the global mean density. We\nimprove on their formulation by allowing variation in the density environment\nas well as the relative velocities. This leads to a new type of coupling\nbetween large-scale and small-scale modes.

For instance, a bounded t-structure gives rise to an\nabelian subcategory of T, while a bounded co-t-structure gives rise to a\nso-called silting subcategory.\n  This brief survey will emphasise three philosophical points. First, bounded\nt-structures are akin to the canonical example of \"soft\" truncation of\ncomplexes in the derived category. Secondly, bounded co-t-structures are akin\nto the canonical example of \"hard\" truncation of complexes in the homotopy\ncategory.\n  Thirdly, a triangulated category T may be skewed towards t-structures or\nco-t-structures, in the sense that one type of structure is more useful than\nthe other for studying T. In particular, we think of derived categories as\nskewed towards t-structures, and of homotopy categories as skewed towards\nco-t-structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 20:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-01"}

Although the\nunmatched expressiveness of the many layers can be highly desirable at test\ntime, training very deep networks comes with its own set of challenges. The\ngradients can vanish, the forward flow often diminishes, and the training time\ncan be painfully slow. To address these problems, we propose stochastic depth,\na training procedure that enables the seemingly contradictory setup to train\nshort networks and use deep networks at test time. We start with very deep\nnetworks but during training, for each mini-batch, randomly drop a subset of\nlayers and bypass them with the identity function. This simple approach\ncomplements the recent success of residual networks. It reduces training time\nsubstantially and improves the test error significantly on almost all data sets\nthat we used for evaluation. With stochastic depth we can increase the depth of\nresidual networks even beyond 1200 layers and still yield meaningful\nimprovements in test error (4.91% on CIFAR-10).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 20:58:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 18:42:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 23:24:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-01"}

Among different watermarking techniques,\nthe wavelet transform has been used more because of its good ability in\nmodeling the human visual system. Recently, Shearlet transform as an extension\nof Wavelet transform which is based on multi-resolution and multi-directional\nanalysis is introduced. The most important feature of this transform is the\nappropriate representation of image edges. In this paper a hybrid scheme using\nDiscrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Discrete Shearlet Transform (DST) is\npresented. In this way, the host image is decomposed using DWT, and then its\nlow frequency sub-band is decomposed by DST. After that, the bidiagonal\nsingular value decomposition (BSVD) is applied on the selected sub-band from\nShearlet transform and the gray-scale watermark image is embedded into its\nbidiagonal singular values. The proposed method is examined on the images with\ndifferent textures and resistance is evaluated against various attacks like\nimage processing and geometric attacks. The results show good transparency and\nhigh robustness in proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 22:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-02"}

To understand\nthis pattern, we simulated the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of\ninfluenza in a host metapopulation representing the temperate north, tropics,\nand temperate south. Although seasonality and air traffic are frequently used\nto explain global migratory patterns of influenza, we find that other factors\nmay have a comparable or greater impact. Notably, a region's basic reproductive\nnumber ($R_0$) strongly affects the antigenic evolution of its viral population\nand the probability that its strains will spread and fix globally: a 17-28%\nhigher $R_0$ in one region can explain the observed patterns. Seasonality, in\ncontrast, increases the probability that a tropical (less seasonal) population\nwill export evolutionarily successful strains but alone does not predict that\nthese strains will be antigenically advanced. The relative sizes of different\nhost populations, their birth and death rates, and the region in which H3N2\nfirst appears affect influenza's phylogeography in different but relatively\nminor ways. These results suggest general principles that dictate the spatial\ndynamics of antigenically evolving pathogens and offer predictions for how\nchanges in human ecology might affect influenza evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 22:05:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 02:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

Suppose\n(X,Y) denotes a risk vector pertaining to two components in some system. A\nrelevant measurement of risk contagion would be to quantify the amount of\ninfluence of high values of Y on X. This can be measured in a variety of ways.\nIn this paper, we study two such measures: the quantity E[max(X-t,0)|Y > t]\ncalled Marginal Mean Excess (MME) as well as the related quantity E[X|Y > t]\ncalled Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES). Both quantities are indicators of\nrisk contagion and useful in various applications ranging from finance,\ninsurance and systemic risk to environmental and climate risk. We work under\nthe assumptions of multivariate regular variation, hidden regular variation and\nasymptotic tail independence for the risk vector (X,Y). Many broad and useful\nmodel classes satisfy these assumptions. We present several examples and derive\nthe asymptotic behavior of both MME and MES as the threshold t tends to\ninfinity. We observe that although we assume asymptotic tail independence in\nthe models, MME and MES converge to 1 under very general conditions; this\nreflects that the underlying weak dependence in the model still remains\nsignificant. Besides the consistency of the empirical estimators, we introduce\nan extrapolation method based on extreme value theory to estimate both MME and\nMES for high thresholds t where little data are available.

The case where a parasite may infect\nmany hosts, widespread parasitism, has until recently gained little traction.\nThis is due in part to the computational complexity involved in reconstructing\nthe coevolutionary histories where parasites may infect only a single host,\nwhich is NP-Hard. Allowing parasites to inhabit more than one host has been\nseen to only further compound this computationally intractable problem.\nRecently however, well-established algorithms for estimating the problem\ninstance where a parasite may infect only a single host have been extended to\nhandle widespread parasites. Although this has offered significant progress, it\nhas been noted that these algorithms poorly handle parasites that inhabit\nphylogenetically distant hosts.\n  In this work we extend these previous algorithms to handle cases where\nparasites inhabit phylogenetically distant hosts using an additional\nevolutionary event which we call spread. Our new framework is shown to infer\nsignificantly more congruent coevolutionary histories compared to existing\nmethods over both synthetic and biological data sets. We then apply the newly\nproposed algorithm, which we call WiSPA (WideSpread Parasitism Analyser), to\nthe well studied coevolutionary system of Primates and Enterobius (pinworms),\nwhere existing methods have been unable to reconcile the widespread parasitism\npresent without permitting additional divergence events. Using WiSPA and the\nnew biological event, spread, we provide the first statistically significant\ncoevolutionary hypothesis for this system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Mar 2016 23:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-01"}

As an application of these results, we\nfocus on three specific theories of SMG (chameleon, symmetron and dilaton\nmodels). Using the formulae to calculate their PPN parameters and cosmological\nconstant, we derive the constraints on the model parameters by combining the\nobservations on solar system and cosmological scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 04:32:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 01:12:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 01:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-14"}

The equilibrium ionic profiles close to the membrane are governed by\nthe well-known Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation. We analyze the effect of\ndifferent boundary conditions, imposed by the membrane, on the ionic profiles\nand the corresponding osmotic pressure. The discussion is separated into the\nsingle membrane case and that of two interacting membranes. For one membrane\nsetup, we show the different solutions of the PB equation and discuss the\ninterplay between constant-charge and constant-potential boundary conditions. A\nmodification of the PB theory is presented to treat the extremely high\ncounter-ion concentration in the vicinity of a charge membrane. For two\nequally-charged membranes, we analyze the different pressure regimes for the\nconstant-charge boundary condition, and discuss the difference in the osmotic\npressure for various boundary conditions. The non-equal charged membranes is\nreviewed as well, and the crossover from repulsion to attraction is calculated\nanalytically. We then examine the charge-regulation boundary condition and\ndiscuss its effects on the ionic profiles and the osmotic pressure for two\nequally-charged membranes. In the last section, we briefly review the van der\nWaals (vdW) interactions and their effect on the free energy between two planar\nmembranes. We explain the simple Hamaker pair-wise summation procedure, and\nintroduce the more rigorous Lifshitz theory. The latter is a key ingredient in\nthe DLVO theory, which combines repulsive electrostatic with attractive vdW\ninteractions, and offers a simple explanation for colloidal or membrane\nstability. Finally, the chapter ends by a short account of the limitations of\nthe approximations inherent in the PB theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 04:35:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 05:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-05"}

In the first stage, various distortions are classified into a few\ntypes, and individual quality scorers targeting at a specific distortion type\nare developed. These scorers offer complementary performance in face of a\ndatabase consisting of heterogeneous distortion types. In the second stage,\nscores from multiple quality scorers are fused to achieve the best overall\nperformance, where the fuser is designed based on the parallel boosting idea\nborrowed from machine learning. Extensive experimental results are conducted to\ncompare the performance of the proposed PBSIQA system with those of existing\nstereo image quality assessment (SIQA) metrics. The developed quality metric\ncan serve as an objective function to optimize the performance of a 3D content\ndelivery system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 06:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20"}

The ISP allocates the cache storage to various content\nproviders so as to maximize the bandwidth savings provided by the cache: the\nmain novelty lies in the fact that, to protect business-critical information,\nISPs only need to measure the aggregated miss rates of the individual CPs and\ndo not need to be aware of the objects that are requested, as in classic\ncaching.

A fundamental issue is the evaluation of the\nquality of a risk estimation. On the one hand, a backtesting procedure is\ndesirable for assessing the accuracy of such an estimation and this can be\nnaturally achieved by elicitable risk measures. For the same objective, an\nalternative approach has been introduced by Davis (2016) through the so-called\nconsistency property. On the other hand, a risk estimation should be less\nsensitive with respect to small changes in the available data set and exhibit\nqualitative robustness. A new risk measure, the Lambda value at risk (Lambda\nVaR), has been recently proposed by Frittelli et al. (2014), as a\ngeneralization of VaR with the ability to discriminate the risk among P&L\ndistributions with different tail behaviour. In this article, we show that\nLambda VaR also satisfies the properties of robustness, elicitability and\nconsistency under some conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 08:51:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 10:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

In this paper, we report\nthe results of a computational study of the dynamics of the CND. The results\nlead us to question two paradigms that are prevalent in previous research on\nthe Galactic Centre. The first is that the disc's inner cavity is maintained by\nthe interaction of the central stellar cluster's strong winds with the disc's\ninner rim, and second, that the presence of unstable clumps in the disc implies\nthat the CND is a transient feature. Our simulations show that, in the absence\nof a magnetic field, the interaction of the wind with the inner disc rim\nactually leads to a filling of the inner cavity within a few orbital\ntime-scales, contrary to previous expectations. However, including the effects\nof magnetic fields stabilizes the inner disc rim against rapid inward\nmigration. Furthermore, this interaction causes instabilities that continuously\ncreate clumps that are individually unstable against tidal shearing. Thus the\noccurrence of such unstable clumps does not necessarily mean that the disc is\nitself a transient phenomenon. The next steps in this investigation are to\nexplore the effect of the magnetorotational instability on the disc evolution\nand to test whether the results presented here persist for longer time-scales\nthan those considered here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 11:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

Aims: In this work, we discuss why ACOs are\ninactive, whereas JFCs show gas-driven dust activity, although both belong to\nthe same class of primitive solar system bodies. Methods: We hypothesize that\nACOs and JFCs have formed under the same physical conditions, namely by the\ngravitational collapse of ensembles of ice and dust aggregates. We use the\nmemory effect of dust-aggregate layers under gravitational compression to\ndiscuss under which conditions the gas-driven dust activity of these bodies is\npossible. Results: Owing to their smaller sizes, JFCs can sustain gas-driven\ndust activity much longer than the bigger ACOs, whose sub-surface regions\npossess an increased tensile strength, due to gravitational compression of the\nmaterial. The increased tensile strength leads to the passivation against dust\nactivity after a relatively short time of activity. Conclusions: The\ngravitational-collapse model of the formation of planetesimals, together with\nthe gravitational compression of the sub-surface material simultaneously,\nexplains the inactivity of ACOs and the gas-driven dust activity of JFCs.

Aims: Our\nmain aim is to determine carbon-to-nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios for\nevolved giants in the open clusters Collinder 261 and Melotte 66 and to compare\nthe results with predictions of theoretical models. Methods: High-resolution\nspectra were analysed using a differential model atmosphere method. Abundances\nof carbon were derived using the C_2 Swan (0,1) band head at 5635.5 A. The\nwavelength interval 7940-8130 A, which contains CN features, was analysed to\ndetermine nitrogen abundances and carbon isotope ratios. The oxygen abundances\nwere determined from the [O_I] line at 6300 A. Results: The mean values of the\nelemental abundances in Collinder 261, as determined from seven stars, are:\n[C/Fe]=-0.23 +- 0.02 (s.d.), [N/Fe]=0.18 +- 0.09, [O/Fe]=-0.03 +- 0.07. The\nmean 12^C/13^C ratio is 11 +- 2, considering four red clump stars and 18 for\none star above the clump. The mean C/N ratios are 1.60 +- 0.30 and 1.74,\nrespectively. For the five stars in Melotte 66 we obtained: [C/Fe]=-0.21 +-\n0.07 (s.d.), [N/Fe]=0.17 +- 0.07, [O/Fe]=0.16 +- 0.04. The 12^C/13^C and C/N\nratios are 8 +- 2 and 1.67 +- 0.21, respectively. Conclusions: The 12^C/13^C\nand C/N ratios of stars in the investigated open clusters were compared with\nthe ratios predicted by stellar evolution models. The mean values of 12^C/13^C\nratios in Collinder 261 and Melotte 66 agree well with models of\nthermohaline-induced extra-mixing for the corresponding stellar turn-off masses\nof about 1.1 - 1.2 Msun.

Mobile phones---the fastest growing\ntechnology in the world that now reaches around 80\\% of humanity---can enable\nuniversal Internet access if it can resolve coverage problems that have\nhistorically plagued previous cellular architectures (2G, 3G, and 4G). These\nconventional architectures have not been able to sustain universal service\nprovisioning since these architectures depend on having enough users per cell\nfor their economic viability and thus are not well suited to rural areas (which\nare by definition sparsely populated).

Based on this, the mean-field equations are derived by\nmeans of a virtual time-inhomogeneous M(t)/M(t)/1/K queue whose arrival and\nservice rates are determined by the mean-field computation. Secondly, the\nmartingale limit is employed to investigate the limiting behavior of the\nempirical process, the fixed point is proved to be unique so that it can be\ncomputed by means of a nonlinear birth-death process, the asymptotic\nindependence of this system is discussed simply, and specifically, these lead\nto numerical computation of the steady-state probability of the problematic\n(empty or full) stations.

We build a full spectral-timing reprocessing\nmodel to simulate the UV/optical lightcurves of NGC 5548. We show that disc\nreprocessing of the observed hard X-ray lightcurve produces optical lightcurves\nwith too much fast variability as well as too short a lag time. Supressing the\nfast variability requires an intervening structure preventing the hard X-rays\nfrom illuminating the disc.

The outer edge of the puffed-up Comptonised disc region emits FUV\nflux, and can illuminate the outer thin blackbody disc but while this gives\nreprocessed variable emission which is much closer to the observed UV and\noptical lightcurves, the light travel lags are still too short to match the\ndata.

The aim of this study is to\nanalyse weekly data in order to compare them with the TV series broadcasting.\nSince medical observations in our sample are distributed over many years, in\norder to compare them as best as we can with the television programming, Grey's\nAnatomy series was chosen. This medical drama has been in the top 10 of most\nviewed TV series since 12 years and it is broadcast all over the world, so that\nit can be considered a universal and homogeneous phenomenon.

We ignore accretion onto cores in the\ncurrent study. We discuss the different behaviours predicted by the isothermal\nand adiabatic cases, and by our choice of index for the size-linewidth\nrelation, and suggest a means of parameterising the magnetic energy term in the\nvirial equation.

We hypothesise a 'starless core desert' in this\nquadrant of the virial plane, which may result from cores initially forming as\npressure-confined objects. We conclude that a virially-bound and\npressure-confined core will not necessarily evolve to become gravitationally\nbound, and thus cannot be considered prestellar.

Previous work has pointed out that the convergence is not\nideal if the backward integration only accounts for the gravitational\nperturbations from the Solar System planets. It improves when the thermal\nradiation force known as the Yarkovsky effect it is accounted for. This\nargument can be used to estimate the spin obliquities of the Karin cluster\nmembers. Here we take advantage of the fast growing membership of the Karin\ncluster and show that the obliquity distribution of diameter $D\\simeq 1-2$ km\nKarin asteroids is bimodal, as expected if the YORP effect acted to move\nobliquities toward the extreme values ($0^\\circ$ or $180^\\circ$).

Most structural decomposition methods can\nbe characterized through hypergraph games that are variations of the Robber and\nCops graph game that characterizes the notion of treewidth. In particular,\ndecomposition trees somehow correspond to monotone winning strategies, where\nthe escape space of the robber on the hypergraph is shrunk monotonically by the\ncops. In fact, unlike the treewidth case, there are hypergraphs where monotonic\nstrategies do not exist, while the robber can be captured by means of more\ncomplex non-monotonic strategies. However, these powerful strategies do not\ncorrespond in general to valid decompositions. The paper provides a general way\nto exploit the power of non-monotonic strategies, by allowing a \"disciplined\"\nform of non-monotonicity, characteristic of cops playing in a greedy way. It is\nshown that deciding the existence of a (non-monotone) greedy winning strategy\n(and compute one, if any) is tractable. Moreover, despite their\nnon-monotonicity, such strategies always induce valid decomposition trees,\nwhich can be computed efficiently based on them. As a consequence, greedy\nstrategies allow us to define new islands of tractability for the considered\nproblems properly including all previously known classes of tractable\ninstances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 14:57:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 21:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

To decide whether two\nVSAs, collected in different nights, refer to the same observed object we can\nattempt to compute an orbit with the observations of both arcs: this is called\nthe linkage problem. Since the number of orbit computations to be performed is\nvery large, we need efficient methods of orbit determination. Using the first\nintegrals of Kepler's motion we can write algebraic equations for the linkage\nproblem, which can be put in polynomial form. The equations introduced in\n(Gronchi et al. 2015) can be reduced to a univariate polynomial of degree 9:\nthe unknown is the topocentric distance $\\rho$ of the observed body at the mean\nepoch of one of the VSAs. Using elimination theory we show an optimal property\nof this polynomial: it has the least degree among the univariate polynomials in\nthe same variable that are consequence of the algebraic conservation laws and\nare obtained without squaring operations, that can be used to bring these\nalgebraic equations in polynomial form.

This algorithm has the same computational\ncomplexity as the classical method by Gauss, but uses more information,\ntherefore we expect that it can produce more accurate results.

While the\nprotein diffusion, recruitment and segregation govern the polarization process,\nwe show that the free actin mass balance, driven by diffusion, and the\npolymerized actin retrograde flow, regulated by the active stress, are\nsufficient ingredients to account for the motile bistability. The length and\nvelocity of the cell are predicted on the basis of the parameters of the\nsubstrate and of the cell itself. The key physical ingredient of the theory is\nthe exchange among actin phases at the edges of the cell, that plays a central\nrole both in kinematics and in dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 09:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}
