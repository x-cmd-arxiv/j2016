Driven by the increased application of pulse-coupled oscillators\nin achieving synchronization, desynchronization of pulse-coupled oscillators is\nalso receiving more attention. In this paper, we propose a phase\ndesynchronization algorithm by rigorously analyzing the dynamics of\npulse-coupled oscillators and carefully designing the pulse based interaction\nfunction. A systematic proof for convergence to phase desynchronization is also\ngiven. Different from many existing results which can only achieve equal\nseparation of firing time instants, the proposed approach can achieve equal\nseparation of phases, which is more difficult to achieve due to phase jumps in\npulse-coupled oscillators. Furthermore, the new strategy can guarantee\nachievement of desynchronization even when some nodes have identical initial\nphases, a situation which fails most existing desynchronization approaches.\nNumerical simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of\nthe theoretical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 16:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-11"}

We also show that the resulting upper bounds\nmay be computed as generalized eigenvalue problems, as is also the case for\nsum-of-squares densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 16:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 08:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-03"}

With the pioneering work of Gerhard Jaeger in the late 1970s and early\n1980s, the focus switched to set theories, furnishing ordinal-theoretic proof\ntheory with a uniform and elegant framework. More recently it was shown that\nthese tools can even sometimes be adapted to the context of strong axioms such\nas the powerset axiom, where one does not attain complete cut elimination but\ncan nevertheless extract witnessing information and characterize the strength\nof the theory in terms of provable heights of the cumulative hierarchy. Here\nthis technology is applied to intuitionistic Kripke-Platek set theories IKP(P)\nand IKP(E), where the operation of powerset and exponentiation, respectively,\nis allowed as a primitive in the separation and collection schemata. In\nparticular, IKP(P) proves the powerset axiom whereas IKP(E) proves the\nexponentiation axiom. The latter expresses that given any sets A and B, the\ncollection of all functions from A to B is a set, too. While IKP(P) can be\ndealt with in a similar vein as its classical cousin, the treatment of IKP(E)\nposed considerable obstacles. One of them was that in the infinitary system the\nlevels of terms become a moving target as they cannot be assigned a fixed level\nin the formal cumulative hierarchy solely based on their syntactic structure.\nAs adumbrated in an earlier paper, the results of this paper are an important\ntool in showing that several intuitionistic set theories with the collection\naxiom possess the existence property, i.e., if they prove an existential\ntheorem then a witness can be provably described in the theory, one example\nbeing intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with bounded separation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 18:09:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-11"}

This quantum gate also constitutes a simple-to-implement\ntool for quantum metrology, sensing and simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 19:28:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jun 2016 18:06:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-30"}

We find that the phase lag between two broad energy bands\nsystematically increases for $5$ - $10$ QPO cycles, after which the QPO becomes\ndecoherent, the phase lag resets and the pattern repeats. This shows that the\nband with the higher QPO frequency is running away from the other band on short\ntimescales, providing strong evidence that the energy dependence of the QPO\nfrequency is intrinsic. We also find that the faster the QPO decoheres, the\nfaster the phase lag increases, suggesting that the intrinsic frequency\ndifference contributes to the decoherence of the QPO. We interpret our results\nwithin a simple geometric QPO model, where different radii in the inner\naccretion flow experience Lense-Thirring precession at different frequencies,\ncausing the decoherence of the oscillation.

Assuming low frequencies, only one mode is considered in each guide.\nThe propagation in the two waveguides can be very different, thanks e.g. to the\npresence of constrictions. The model is a discrete, periodic one, based upon\n4th-order impedance matrices and their diagonalization. All the calculation is\nanalytical, thanks to the partition of the matrices in 2nd-order matrices, and\nallows the treatment of a very wide types of problems. Several aspects are\ninvestigated: the local or non-local character of the reaction of one guide to\nthe other; the definition of a coupling coefficient; the effect of finite size\nwhen a lattice with n cells in inserted into an infinite guide; the\nrelationship between the Insertion Loss and the dispersion.

Any\nadditional metaphysical speculation, such as to whether quantum indeterminism,\ni.e., intrinsic randomness, implicates the reality of experimenter \"freedom\",\n\"free will\", or \"free choice\", is redundant in relation to the predictive\nsuccess of orthodox quantum mechanics. Accordingly, super-indeterminism views\nas redundant also, from a technical standpoint, whether an affirmative or a\nnegative answer is claimed in reference to universal indeterminism as a\nnecessary precondition for experimenter freedom.

In this work, we present a comprehensive study of\nthe upper critical field $H_{c2}$ of nematic superconductors within\nGinzburg-Landau (GL) theory. Contrary to typical GL theories which have an\nemergent U(1) rotational symmetry obscuring the discrete symmetry of the\ncrystal, the theory of two-component superconductors in trigonal crystals\nreflects the true $D_{3d}$ crystal symmetry. This has direct implications for\nthe upper critical field. First, $H_{c2}$ of trigonal superconductors exhibits\na sixfold anisotropy in the basal plane. Second, when the degeneracy of the two\ncomponents is lifted by, e.g., uniaxial strain, $H_{c2}$ exhibits a twofold\nanisotropy with characteristic angle and temperature dependence. Our thorough\nstudy shows that measurement of the upper critical field is a direct method of\ndetecting nematic superconductivity, which is directly applicable to\nrecently-discovered trigonal superconductors Cu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$,\nSr$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$, Nb$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$, and Tl$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 20:22:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Mar 2016 19:25:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 13:57:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 18:41:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-15"}

Although the new modes all possess the same - typically\nspacelike - characteristic curves, the spin-1 modes are parabolic while the\nspin-0 modes are hyperbolic. The joint system, which remains coupled by\nnon-derivative terms, cannot be solved as a simple Cauchy problem from a single\nnon-characteristic surface. We also illustrate the generality of the algorithm\nwith other cases where derivative constraints reduce the number of propagating\ndegrees of freedom or order of the equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 20:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-18"}

In order to eliminate the\nexternal momentum divergences, one has to dress the bare vertices of the\nscattering diagrams by considering renormalised propagator and vertex loop\ncorrections to the bare vertices. Finally, we investigate scattering diagrams\nin the context of a scalar toy model which is inspired by a\n$\\mathit{ghost-free}$ and $\\mathit{singularity-free}$ infinite-derivative\ntheory of gravity, where we conclude that infinite derivatives can eliminate\nthe external momentum divergences of scattering diagrams and make the\nscattering diagrams convergent in the ultraviolet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2016 21:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 May 2016 18:37:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2016 11:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-09"}

The rigid elliptical cylinder case is\nimportant to be considered as a first-order approximation of the behavior of a\nfluid particle suspended in air, because of the significant acoustic impedance\nmismatch at the particle's boundary. Based on the partial-wave series expansion\nmethod in cylindrical coordinates, non-dimensional acoustic radiation force and\ntorque functions are derived and defined in terms of the scattering\ncoefficients of the elliptic cylinder. A coupled system of linear equations is\nobtained after applying the Neumann boundary condition for an immovable surface\nin a non-viscous fluid, and solved numerically by matrix inversion after\nperforming a single numerical integration procedure.

The\ntwo primary issues that complicate nanoparticle scanning laser image\ncorrelation (SLIC) based velocimetry are (1) the use of diffusion dominated\nnanoparticles as flow tracers, which introduce a random decorrelating error\ninto the velocity estimate, and (2) the effects of the scanning laser image\nacquisition, which introduces a bias error. To date, no study has quantified\nthese errors or demonstrated a means to deal with them in SLIC velocimetry. In\nthis work, we build upon the robust phase correlation (RPC) and existing\nmethods of SLIC to quantify and mitigate these errors. First, we implement an\nensemble RPC instead of using an ensemble standard cross correlation, and\ndevelop an SLIC optimal filter that maximizes the correlation strength in order\nto reliably and accurately detect the correlation peak representing the most\nprobable average displacement of the nanoparticles. Secondly, we developed an\nanalytical model of the SLIC measurement bias error due to image scanning of\ndiffusion dominated tracer particles.

The decomposition\nsplits the gauge field into a restricted Abelian part and a coloured part in a\nway that preserves gauge covariance. The restricted part of the gauge field can\nbe divided into a Maxwell term and a topological term. Previously, we showed\nthat by a particular choice of this decomposition we could fully describe the\nconfining potential using only the restricted gauge field. We proposed that\nvarious topological objects (a form of magnetic monopole) could arise in the\nrestricted field which would drive confinement. Our mechanism does not\nexplicitly refer to a dual Meissner effect, nor does it use centre vortices. We\ndid not need to gauge fix or introduce any new dynamical fields.\n  We show that if we do gauge fix as well as performing the Abelian\ndecomposition then it is possible to ensure that the topological part of the\nrestricted field fully accounts for the confining potential. Our relationship\nis exact: there is no approximation or model involved. This isolates the\nobjects responsible for confinement from non-confining contributions to the\ngauge field, allowing a direct search for our proposed topological objects.\nUsing numerical studies in SU(2), we confirm that our proposed monopoles are\npresent in the field, and the winding number associated with these monopoles is\na key factor driving quark confinement.\n  In SU(2), our monopoles are described by two parameters. We show that it is\npossible to re-parametrise the Yang Mills action and the functional integration\nmeasure in terms of these variables (plus the necessary additional parameters).\nWe can thus treat the monopoles as dynamical variables in the functional\nintegral.

Our model can be viewed\nas a two-channel generalization of the independent boson model with asymmetric\natom-phonon coupling. This allows us to take advantage of the exact\nnon-perturbative solution of the independent boson model in the stronger\nchannel while treating the weaker one perturbatively. In the low-energy limit,\nthe exact solution can be viewed as a resummation (exponentiation) of the most\ndivergent diagrams in the perturbative expansion.

The nature of this\ninteraction not only encourages low estimation bias but also enables accurate\n(and fast) quantification of Frequentist mean square error quantification of\nthe estimated nonstationarity. These quadratic estimates are interesting, in\ntheir own right, as they detect and estimate nonstationarity by probing\ncorrelation among Fourier frequencies, the absence of which is the\ncharacterizing feature of weak stationarity (by Bochner's Theorem). Moreover,\nthis generalized quadratic estimate can be computed with a Fourier\ncharacterization that runs in $\\mathcal O(n\\log n)$ time when observing the\nfield on a uniform grid of size $n$ in $\\Bbb R^d $. Finally, the work presented\nhere partially addresses two other problems associated with the statistical\ntheory of nonstationarity: 1) estimating the phase of a spatially varying\nmodulated stationary random field and 2) identifying a larger class of\nnonstationary random fields which admit an extension of the quadratic estimator\nof gravitational lensing that extends the same attractive statistical\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2016 00:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-14"}

However, there is a fundamental\nlimit on the maximum attainable ion energy, which is determined by the group\nvelocity of the laser. The tightly focused laser pulses have group velocities\nsmaller than the vacuum light speed, and, since they offer the high intensity\nneeded for the RPA regime, it is plausible that group velocity effects would\nmanifest themselves in the experiments involving tightly focused pulses and\nthin foils. However, in this case, finite spot size effects are important, and\nanother limiting factor, the transverse expansion of the target, may dominate\nover the group velocity effect. As the laser pulse diffracts after passing the\nfocus, the target expands accordingly due to the transverse intensity profile\nof the laser. Due to this expansion, the areal density of the target decreases,\nmaking it transparent for radiation and effectively terminating the\nacceleration. The off-normal incidence of the laser on the target, due either\nto the experimental setup, or to the deformation of the target, will also lead\nto establishing a limit on maximum ion energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2016 07:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

A crucial property of his framework is that it decouples\nthe meaning of a message from the mechanistic details from the actual\ncommunication process itself, which opened the way to solve long-standing\ncommunication problems. Here we argue that a similar impact could be expected\nby applying information theory in the context of complexity science to answer\nlong-standing, cross-domain questions about the nature of complex systems. This\nhappens by decoupling the domain-specific model details (e.g., neuronal\nnetworks, ecosystems, flocks of birds) from the cross-domain phenomena that\ncharacterize complex systems (e.g., criticality, robustness, tipping points).\nThis goes beyond using information theory as a non-linear correlation measure,\nnamely it allows describing a complex system entirely in terms of the storage,\ntransfer, and modification of informational bits. After all, a phenomenon that\ndoes not depend on model details should best be studied in a framework that\nstrips away all such details. We highlight the first successes of\ninformation-theoretic descriptions in the recent complexity literature, and\nemphasize that this type of research is still in its infancy. Finally we sketch\nhow such an information-theoretic description may even lead to a new type of\nuniversality among complex systems, with a potentially tremendous impact.

More specifically, we\ninsist on generalizing the two-dimensional notion of $p$-angulations to higher\ndimensions. To do so, we consider families of triangulations built out of\nsimplices with colored faces. Those simplices can be glued to form new building\nblocks, called bubbles which are pseudo-manifolds with boundaries. Bubbles can\nin turn be glued together to form triangulations. The main challenge is to\nclassify the triangulations built from a given set of bubbles with respect to\ntheir numbers of bubbles and simplices of codimension two. While the colored\ntriangulations which maximize the number of simplices of codimension two at\nfixed number of simplices are series-parallel objects called melonic\ntriangulations, this is not always true anymore when restricting attention to\ncolored triangulations built from specific bubbles. This opens up the\npossibility of new universality classes of colored triangulations. We present\nthree existing strategies to find those universality classes. The first two\nstrategies consist in building new bubbles from old ones for which the problem\ncan be solved. The third strategy is a bijection between those colored\ntriangulations and stuffed, edge-colored maps, which are some sort of hypermaps\nwhose hyperedges are replaced with edge-colored maps. We then show that the\npresent approach can lead to enumeration results and identification of\nuniversality classes, by working out the example of quartic tensor models.

Here we focus on the impact of massive star\nformation on the surrounding low metallicity ISM in 30 Doradus in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud. A low metal abundance, as is the case of some galaxies of the\nearly universe, results in less ultra-violet shielding for the formation of the\nmolecular gas necessary for star formation to proceed. The half-solar\nmetallicity gas in this region is strongly irradiated by the super star cluster\nR136, making it an ideal laboratory to study the structure of the ISM in an\nextreme environment. Our spatially resolved study investigates the gas heating\nand cooling mechanisms, particularly in the photo-dissociation regions where\nthe chemistry and thermal balance are regulated by far-ultraviolet photons (6\neV< h\\nu <13.6 eV).\n  We present Herschel observations of far-infrared fine-structure lines\nobtained with PACS and SPIRE/FTS. We have combined atomic fine-structure lines\nfrom Herschel and Spitzer observations with ground-based CO data to provide\ndiagnostics on the properties and the structure of the gas by modeling it with\nthe Meudon PDR code. We derive the spatial distribution of the radiation field,\nthe pressure, the size, and the filling factor of the photodissociated gas and\nmolecular clouds. We find a range of pressure of ~ 10^5 - 1.7x10^6 cm^{-3} K\nand a range of incident radiation field G_UV ~ 10^2 - 2.5x10^4 through PDR\nmodeling. Assuming a plane-parallel geometry and a uniform medium, we find a\ntotal extinction of 1-3 mag , which correspond to a PDR cloud size of 0.2 to\n3pc, with small CO depth scale of 0.06 to 0.5pc. We also determine the three\ndimensional structure of the gas. (Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2016 09:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

A main goal is to demonstrate that\nthe eigenstates of the single-site reduced density matrix have structures that\nare characteristic for the various quantum phases of this system. Since the\nHamiltonian conserves only the global particle number but not the number of\nbosons and molecules individually, these eigenstates, referred to as optimal\nmodes, can be nontrivial linear combinations of bare eigenstates of the\nmolecular and boson particle number. We numerically analyze the optimal modes\nand their weights, the latter giving the importance of the corresponding state,\nin the ground state of the Bose-Bose resonance model. We find that the\nsingle-site von Neumann entropy is sensitive to the location of the phase\nboundaries. We explain the structure of the optimal modes and their weight\nspectra using perturbation theory and via a comparison to results for the\nsingle-component Bose-Hubbard model. We further study the dynamical evolution\nof the optimal modes and of the single-site entanglement entropy in two quantum\nquenches that cross phase boundaries of the model and show that these\nquantities are thermal in the steady state.

This quantity represents the average\ncolor Lorentz force a struck quark experiences in a deep inelastic electron\nscattering event off a neutron due to its interaction with the hadronizing\nremnants. This color force was determined from a linear combination of the\nthird moments of the spin structure functions $g_1$ and $g_2$ on $^{3}$He after\nnuclear corrections had been applied to these moments. The kinematics included\ntwo average $Q^{2}$ bins of $3.2$ GeV$^{2}$ and $4.3$ GeV$^{2}$, and\nBjorken-$x$ $0.25 \\leq x \\leq 0.90$ covering the DIS and resonance regions.

The present study is concerned with\nthis stationary regime called \"treadmilling\".\n  The principal ingredients of our model are: a nonstandard choice of the\nreference configuration, which allows us to cope with the continually evolving\nmaterial structure; and a driving force and a kinetic law for\naccretion/ablation that involves the difference in chemical potential, strain\nenergy and the radial stress. By combining these ingredients we arrive at an\nalgebraic system which governs the stationary treadmilling state. We establish\nthe conditions under which this system has a solution and we show that this\nsolution is unique. Moreover, by an asymptotic analysis we show that for small\nbeads the thickness of the solid is proportional to the radius of the support\nand is strongly affected by the stiffness of the solid, whereas for large beads\nthe stiffness of the solid is essentially irrelevant, the thickness being\nproportional to a characteristic length that depends on the parameters that\ngovern diffusion and accretion kinetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2016 14:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

This is further\nconfirmed by the behavior of the fermion density at finite temperature, which\nis studied analytically (at low temperature), as well as numerically for the\nsu$(1|1)$ elliptic chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2016 15:44:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

We train a generative convolutional neural network which predicts a\nsaliency map for a frame, given the fixation map of the previous frame.\nSaliency estimation in this scenario is highly important since in the near\nfuture 3D video content will be easily acquired and yet hard to display. This\ncan be explained, on the one hand, by the dramatic improvement of 3D-capable\nacquisition equipment. On the other hand, despite the considerable progress in\n3D display technologies, most of the 3D displays are still expensive and\nrequire wearing special glasses. To evaluate the performance of our approach,\nwe present a new comprehensive database of eye-fixation ground-truth for RGBD\nvideos.

Although the meaning of this axis -- identified with a \"niche\"\ndimension -- has remained a mystery, it is assumed to lie at the basis of the\nhighly non-trivial structure of food webs. With this in mind, most trophic\nnetwork modelling has for decades been based on assigning species a niche value\nby hand. However, we argue here that intervality should not be considered the\ncause but rather a consequence of food-web structure. First, analysing a set of\n$46$ empirical food webs, we find that they also exhibit {\\it predator}\nintervality: the predators of any given species are as likely to be contiguous\nas the prey are, but in a different ordering. Furthermore, this property is not\nexclusive of trophic networks: several networks of genes, neurons, metabolites,\ncellular machines, airports, and words are found to be approximately as\ninterval as food webs. We go on to show that a simple model of food-web\nassembly which does not make use of a niche axis can nevertheless generate\nsignificant intervality. Therefore, the niche dimension (in the sense used for\nfood-web modelling) could in fact be the consequence of other, more fundamental\nstructural traits, such as trophic coherence. We conclude that a new approach\nto food-web modelling is required for a deeper understanding of ecosystem\nassembly, structure and function, and propose that certain topological features\nthought to be specific of food webs are in fact common to many complex\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Mar 2016 10:53:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

Thus, it appears necessary to\nstudy the concepts introduced by a standard spectroscopy of quasars, studied\nhere, with those deducted from $\\Lambda$-CDM.A visible absorption of a sharp\nand saturated spectral line in a gas requires a long path without perturbations\nas collisions or cosmological redshift. Spectra of absorbed, saturated lines of\nquasars obeying Karlsson's law mainly result from interactions of natural,\nthermal light radiated by quasar with relatively cold, low presure atomic\nhydrogen. These lines are produced by three processes: a) A conventional\nabsorption in a relatively cold gas produces a set of lines; b) These lines are\nmultiplied by absorption after fundamental 3K or 4K redshifts, where K is\nKarlsson's constant: Spectra show that redshifts 3K (or 4K) exactly bring\nabsorbed Lyman beta (or gamma) line on Lyman alpha: redshift almost disappears,\nand gas lines are intensely absorbed in the absence of alpha absorption; c)\nRedshifts occur in regions where light at alpha frequency is poorly absorbed\ndue to permanent redshift, except when excitation of hydrogen to 2P level is\nsufficient for a superradiant flash emission at alpha frequency. This causes an\nintense absorption of high radiance rays from quasar, so the absorption of a\nline at current Lyman alpha frequency. Lightning and pumping produce relaxation\noscillations that write many absorption lines. Redshifts by H atoms in 2P\nlevels are due to parametric interactions composed of Impulsive Stimulated\nRaman Scatterings (ISRS): excited hydrogen atoms catalyze energy exchanges\nbetween observed ray and background cold thermal radiation, in agreement with\nthermodynamics.
