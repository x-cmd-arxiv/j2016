To overcome the\ndrawback of sampling-based methods that huge computation resources are required\nand the shortcoming of initial contingency selection practices that the\ndependencies in sequences of outages are omitted, this paper proposes a novel\nrisk assessment approach by searching on Markovian Tree. The Markovian tree\nmodel is reformulated from the quasi-dynamic multi-timescale simulation model\nproposed recently to ensure reasonable modeling and simulation of cascading\noutages. Then a tree search scheme is established to avoid duplicated\nsimulations on same cascade paths, significantly saving computation time. To\naccelerate the convergence of risk assessment, a risk estimation index is\nproposed to guide the search for states with major contributions to the risk,\nand the risk assessment is realized based on the risk estimation index with a\nforward tree search and backward update algorithm. The effectiveness of the\nproposed method is illustrated on a 4-node power system, and its convergence\nprofile as well as efficiency is demonstrated on the RTS-96 test system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2016 16:20:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2016 01:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Similar to other biometric technologies, speaker\nverification is vulnerable to spoofing attacks where an attacker masquerades as\na particular target speaker via impersonation, replay, text-to-speech (TTS) or\nvoice conversion (VC) techniques to gain illegitimate access to the system. We\nfocus on TTS and VC that represent the most flexible, high-end spoofing\nattacks. Most of the prior studies on synthesized or converted speech detection\nreport their findings using high-quality clean recordings. Meanwhile, the\nperformance of spoofing detectors in the presence of additive noise, an\nimportant consideration in practical ASV implementations, remains largely\nunknown. To this end, we analyze the suitability of state-of-the-art synthetic\nspeech detectors under additive noise with a special focus on front-end\nfeatures. Our comparison includes eight acoustic feature sets, five related to\nspectral magnitude and three to spectral phase information. Our extensive\nexperiments on ASVSpoof 2015 corpus reveal several important findings. Firstly,\nall the countermeasures break down even at relatively high signal-to-noise\nratios (SNRs) and fail to generalize to noisy conditions. Secondly, speech\nenhancement is not found helpful.

Fourthly, concerning the compared\nfeatures, the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and subband spectral\ncentroid magnitude coefficients (SCMCs) perform the best on average though the\nwinner method depends on SNR and noise type.

This poster describes our experiences of applying Rice\nUniversity's HPCToolkit and hardware performance counters to gain insight into\nan MPI+OpenMP code that performs Reverse Time Migration (RTM) on a cluster of\nmulticore processors. The tools provided us with insights into the\neffectiveness of the domain decomposition strategy, the use of threaded\nparallelism, and functional unit utilization in individual cores. By applying\ninsights obtained from the tools, we were able to improve the performance of\nthe RTM code by roughly 30 percent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2016 22:38:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-15"}

A non-linear analog of the PCA, called the Principal Geodesic Analysis\n(PGA) suited for data lying on Riemannian manifolds was reported in literature\na decade ago. Since the objective function in PGA is highly non-linear and hard\nto solve efficiently in general, researchers have proposed a linear\napproximation. Though this linear approximation is easy to compute, it lacks\naccuracy especially when the data exhibits a large variance. Recently, an\nalternative called exact PGA was proposed which tries to solve the optimization\nwithout any linearization.

In\nline with reliability theory, \"infant\" will refer here to the time interval\nfollowing birth during which the mortality (or failure) rate decreases. This\ndefinition provides a systems science perspective in which birth constitutes a\nsudden transition which falls within the field of application of the \"Transient\nShock\" (TS) conjecture put forward in Richmond et al. (2016c). This conjecture\nprovides predictions about the timing and shape of the death rate peak. (i) It\nsays that there will be a death rate spike whenever external conditions change\nabruptly and drastically. (ii) It predicts that after a steep rising there will\nbe a much longer hyperbolic relaxation process. These predictions can be tested\nby considering living organisms for which birth is a multi-step process. Thus,\nfor fish there are three states: egg, yolk-sac phase, young adult. The TS\nconjecture predicts a mortality spike at the end of the yolk-sac phase, and\nthis timing is indeed confirmed by observation. Secondly, the hyperbolic nature\nof the relaxation process can be tested using high accuracy Swiss statistics\nwhich give postnatal death rates from one hour after birth up to the age of 10\nyears. It turns out that since the 19th century despite a great overall\nreduction in infant mortality, the shape of the age-specific death rate has\nremained basically unchanged. This hyperbolic pattern is not specific to\nhumans. It can also be found in small primates as recorded in the archives of\nzoological gardens.

In the present study, we examine and analyze Climate\nChange conversations in Qatar's Twittersphere, and sense public awareness\ntowards this global and shared problem in general, and its various related\ntopics in particular. Such topics include but are not limited to politics,\neconomy, disasters, energy and sandstorms. To address this concern, we collect\nand analyze a large dataset of 109 million tweets posted by 98K distinct users\nliving in Qatar -- one of the largest emitters of CO2 worldwide. We use a\ntaxonomy of climate change topics created as part of the United Nations Pulse\nproject to capture the climate change discourse in more than 36K tweets. We\nalso examine which topics people refer to when they discuss climate change, and\nperform different analysis to understand the temporal dynamics of public\ninterest toward these topics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2016 08:39:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-15"}

The energy transfer is determined by a non-conservation\nlaw resulting from a diffusion of dark matter in an environment of dark energy.\nThe relativistic invariance defines the diffusion in a unique way. The system\ncan contain baryonic matter and radiation which do not interact with the dark\nsector. We treat the Friedman equation and the conservation laws as a closed\ndynamical system. The dynamics of the model is examined using the dynamical\nsystems methods for demonstration how solutions depend on initial conditions.\nWe also fit the model parameters using astronomical observation: SNIa, $H(z)$,\nBAO and Alcock-Paczynski test. We show that the model with diffuse DM-DE is\nconsistent with the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Mar 2016 15:24:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2016 09:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-22"}

In the $\\beta\\rightarrow0$ limit, the integrals localize to the zero\nmodes. This allows us to perform the index computations exactly because of\nsupersymmetric localization, and we will show how the geometry of target space\nenters the physics of sigma models resulting in the relationship between the\nsupersymmetric model and the geometry of the target space in the form of\ntopological invariants.
