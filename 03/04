Opacity models\nuse line broadening approximations that are untested at stellar interior\nconditions. Moreover, calculations of atomic spectra of the sun, indicate a\nlarge discrepancy in the K-shell line widths between several atomic codes and\nthe OP. In this work, the atomic code STAR is used to study the sensitivity of\nsolar opacities to line-broadening. Variations in the solar opacity profile,\ndue to an increase of the Stark widths resulting from discrepancies with OP,\nare compared, in light of the solar opacity problem, with the required opacity\nvariations of the present day sun, as imposed by helioseismic and neutrino\nobservations. The resulting variation profile, is much larger than the\ndiscrepancy between different atomic codes, agrees qualitatively with the\nmissing opacity profile, recovers about half of the missing opacity nearby the\nconvection boundary and has a little effect in the internal regions. Since it\nis hard to estimate quantitatively the uncertainty in the Stark widths, we show\nthat an increase of all line widths by a factor of about 100 recovers\nquantitatively the missing opacity. These results emphasize the possibility\nthat photoexcitation processes are not modeled properly, and more specifically,\nhighlight the need for a better theoretical characterization of the line\nbroadening phenomena at stellar interior conditions and of the uncertainty due\nto the way it is implemented by atomic codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 16:16:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 17:42:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

They are also found in one\nS-type Mira ($\\chi$ Cyg), as well as in two semiregular variables (X Her and RS\nCnc) that are known to show axial symmetry. In the other objects, the profiles\nare simpler and similar to those of other molecular lines. The composite\nstructure appears in the objects in which SiO emission is thought to come from\nthe very inner circumstellar layers, prior to dust formation. The central\nspectral feature is found to be systematically composed of a number of narrow\nspikes, except for X Her and RS Cnc, in which it shows a smooth shape that is\nvery similar to that observed in CO emission. These spikes show a significant\n(and mostly chaotic) time variation, while in all cases the smooth components\nremain constant within the uncertainties. The profile shape could come from the\nsuperposition of standard wide profiles and a group of weak maser spikes.\nAlternatively, we speculate that the very similar profiles detected in objects\nthat are axisymmetric may be indicative of the systematic presence of a\nsignificant axial symmetry in the very inner circumstellar shells around AGB\nstars; the presence of such symmetry would be independent of the probable weak\nmaser effects in the central spikes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 16:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

The underlying mechanism is\nthat the stress induced by the acoustic waves exceeds the strength of the snow\nlayers. We compare field measurements to a numerical simulation of acoustic\nwave propagation in a porous material. The simulation consists of an acoustic\ndomain for the air above the snowpack and a poroelastic domain for the dry\nsnowpack. The two domains are connected by a wave field decomposition and open\npore boundary conditions.

One air pressure\nmeasurement above the snowpack was used to calibrate the pressure amplitude of\nthe source in the simulation. Additional field measurements of air pressure and\nacceleration measurements inside the snowpack were compared to individual field\nvariables of the simulation.

Both classes were introduced---with Brownian-time-type\nkernel formulations---by Allouba in a series of articles starting in 2006,\nwhere he presented class (2) in its rigorous stochastic integral equations\nform. He proved existence, uniqueness, and sharp spatio-temporal H\\\"older\nregularity for the above two classes of equations in $d=1,2,3$.

Three actions govern the particles' dynamics: generation, walking,\nand absorption. Labeled vertices generate new particles that compete against\nrival particles for edge domination. Active particles randomly walk in the\nnetwork until they are absorbed by either a rival vertex or an edge currently\ndominated by rival particles. The result from the model evolution consists of\nsets of edges arranged by the label dominance. Each set tends to form a\nconnected subnetwork to represent a data class. Although the intrinsic dynamics\nof the model is a stochastic one, we prove there exists a deterministic version\nwith largely reduced computational complexity; specifically, with linear\ngrowth. Furthermore, the edge domination process corresponds to an unfolding\nmap in such way that edges \"stretch\" and \"shrink\" according to the vertex-edge\ndynamics. Consequently, the unfolding effect summarizes the relevant\nrelationships between vertices and the uncovered data classes. The proposed\nmodel captures important details of connectivity patterns over the vertex-edge\ndynamics evolution, in contrast to previous approaches which focused on only\nvertex or only edge dynamics.

With the aim of deriving\nconstraints on the 3-D spatial distribution of the emissivity, as well as on\nthe structure of both ordered and random magnetic fields (MFs), we present here\na scheme to model maps of the emission and polarization in SNRs.\n  We first generalize the classical treatment of the synchrotron emission to\nthe case in which the MF is composed by an ordered MF plus an isotropic random\ncomponent, with arbitrary relative strengths. In the case of a power-law\nparticle energy distribution, we derive analytic formulae that formally\nresemble those for the classical case. We also treat the case of a shock\ncompression of a fully random upstream field and we predict that the\npolarization fraction in this case should be higher than typically measured in\nSNRs. We implement the above treatment into a code, which simulates the\nobserved polarized emission of an emitting shell, taking into account also the\neffect of the internal Faraday rotation.\n  Finally, we show simulated maps for different orientations with respect to\nthe observer, levels of the turbulent MF component, Faraday rotation levels,\ndistributions of the emissivity (either barrel-shaped or limited to polar\ncaps), and geometries for the ordered MF component (either tangential to the\nshell, or radial). Their analysis allows us to outline properties useful for\nthe interpretation of radio intensity and polarization maps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 17:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

In reality,\noutbreaks can display sub-exponential (i.e., polynomial) growth in the first\nfew disease generations, owing to clustering in contact patterns, spatial\neffects, inhomogeneous mixing, reactive behavior changes, or other mechanisms.\nHere, we introduce the generalized growth model to characterize the early\ngrowth profile of outbreaks and estimate the effective reproduction number,\nwith no need for explicit assumptions about the shape of epidemic growth. We\ndemonstrate this phenomenologic approach using analytical results and\nsimulations from mechanistic models, and provide validation against a range of\nempirical disease datasets.

The fundamental bottleneck towards\nenormous spectral and energy efficiency benefits in multiuser MIMO networks\nlies in a huge demand for accurate channel state information at the transmitter\n(CSIT). This has become increasingly difficult to satisfy due to the increasing\nnumber of antennas and access points in next generation wireless networks\nrelying on dense heterogeneous networks and transmitters equipped with a large\nnumber of antennas. CSIT inaccuracy results in a multi-user interference\nproblem that is the primary bottleneck of MIMO wireless networks. Looking\nbackward, the problem has been to strive to apply techniques designed for\nperfect CSIT to scenarios with imperfect CSIT. In this paper, we depart from\nthis conventional approach and introduce the readers to a promising strategy\nbased on rate-splitting. Rate-splitting relies on the transmission of common\nand private messages and is shown to provide significant benefits in terms of\nspectral and energy efficiencies, reliability and CSI feedback overhead\nreduction over conventional strategies used in LTE-A and exclusively relying on\nprivate message transmissions. Open problems, impact on standard specifications\nand operational challenges are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 18:50:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The\ncausal relationships between these factors are often not obvious, however, and\nthe roles of different physical processes in producing the extreme\nprecipitation event can be difficult to disentangle. Here, we examine the\nlarge-scale forcings and convective heating feedback in the precipitation\nevents which caused the 2010 Pakistan flood within the Column Quasi-Geostrophic\nframework. A cloud-revolving model (CRM) is forced with the large-scale\nforcings (other than large-scale vertical motion) computed from the\nquasi-geostrophic omega equation with input data from a reanalysis data set,\nand the large-scale vertical motion is diagnosed interactively with the\nsimulated convection.\n  Numerical results show that the positive feedback of convective heating to\nlarge-scale dynamics is essential in amplifying the precipitation intensity to\nthe observed values. Orographic lifting is the most important dynamic forcing\nin both events, while differential potential vorticity advection also\ncontributes to the triggering of the first event. Horizontal moisture advection\nmodulates the extreme events mainly by setting the environmental humidity,\nwhich modulates the amplitude of the convection's response to the dynamic\nforcings. When the CRM is replaced by either a single-column model (SCM) with\nparameterized convection or a dry model with a reduced effective static\nstability, the model results show substantial discrepancies compared with\nreanalysis data. The reasons for these discrepancies are examined, and the\nimplications for global models and theoretical models are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 18:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

Each of these enormously different astronomical\ninterpretations is supported by some of the observed unusual characteristics.\nIn order to finally classify and understand this object we took a three-pronged\napproach, through time-domain, high angular resolution, and multi-frequency\nradio studies. First, our deep time-domain observations with the Arecibo\ntelescope failed to uncover the putative pulsar powering the proposed PWN. We\nconclude with ~70% certainty that HESS J1943+213 does not host a pulsar.\nSecond, long-baseline interferometry of the source with e-MERLIN at 1.5- and 5-\nGHz, shows only a core, a point source at ~ 1 - 100 milli-arcsecond resolution.\nIts 2013 flux density is about one-third lower than detected in 2011\nobservations with similar resolution. This radio variability of the core\nstrengthens the HBL object hypothesis. More evidence against the PWN scenario\ncomes, third, from the radio spectrum we compiled. The extended structure\nfollows a power-law behavior with spectral index alpha = -0.54 +- 0.04 while\nthe core component is flat spectrum (alpha = -0.03 +- 0.03). In contrast, the\nradio synchrotron emission of PWNe predicts a single power-law distribution.\nOverall we rule out the PWN hypothesis and conclude the source is a BL Lac\nobject. The consistently high fraction (70%) of the flux density from the\nextended structure then leads us to conclude that HESS J1943+213 must be a\nnon-classical HBL object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 19:07:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

For the bright solar twin HD 45184, we found $T_{\\rm{eff}} = 5864\n\\pm 9$ K, log $g = 4.45 \\pm 0.03$ dex, $v_{t} = 1.11 \\pm 0.02$ $\\rm{km\\\n{s}}^{-1}$, and [Fe/H]$ = 0.04 \\pm 0.01$ dex, which are in good agreement with\nprevious works.

We confirm earlier work showing that the majority of black hole hosts\nhave significantly higher velocity dispersions sigma than local galaxies of\nsimilar stellar mass. We use Monte-Carlo simulations to illustrate the effect\non black hole scaling relations if this bias arises from the requirement that\nthe black hole sphere of influence must be resolved to measure black hole\nmasses with spatially resolved kinematics. We find that this selection effect\nartificially increases the normalization of the Mbh-sigma relation by a factor\nof at least ~3; the bias for the Mbh-Mstar relation is even larger. Our Monte\nCarlo simulations and analysis of the residuals from scaling relations both\nindicate that sigma is more fundamental than Mstar or effective radius. In\nparticular, the Mbh-Mstar relation is mostly a consequence of the Mbh-sigma and\nsigma-Mstar relations, and is heavily biased by up to a factor of 50 at small\nmasses. This helps resolve the discrepancy between dynamically-based black\nhole-galaxy scaling relations versus those of active galaxies. Our simulations\nalso disfavour broad distributions of black hole masses at fixed sigma.\nCorrecting for this bias suggests that the calibration factor used to estimate\nblack hole masses in active galaxies should be reduced to values of fvir~1.\nBlack hole mass densities should also be proportionally smaller, perhaps\nimplying significantly higher radiative efficiencies/black hole spins.

Drake et al. (2006) proposed a mechanism for accelerating electrons\nin contracting magnetic islands formed by kinetic reconnection in multi-layered\ncurrent sheets. We apply these ideas to sunward-moving flux ropes (2.5D\nmagnetic islands) formed during fast reconnection in a simulated eruptive\nflare. A simple analytic model is used to calculate the energy gain of\nparticles orbiting the field lines of the contracting magnetic islands in our\nultrahigh-resolution 2.5D numerical simulation. We find that the estimated\nenergy gains in a single island range up to a factor of five. This is higher\nthan that found by Drake et al. for islands in the terrestrial magnetosphere\nand at the heliopause, due to strong plasma compression that occurs at the\nflare current sheet. In order to increase their energy by two orders of\nmagnitude and plausibly account for the observed high-energy flare emission,\nthe electrons must visit multiple contracting islands. This mechanism should\nproduce sporadic emission because island formation is intermittent. Moreover, a\nlarge number of particles could be accelerated in each\nmagnetohydrodynamic-scale island, which may explain the inferred rates of\nenergetic-electron production in flares. We conclude that island contraction in\nthe flare current sheet is a promising candidate for electron acceleration in\nsolar eruptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Mar 2016 22:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-23"}

The peripheral rings display coherent features: their\neigenstates can be separated in the two classes of superradiant and subradiant\nstates. Both are important to optimize transfer efficiency. In the absence of\ndisorder, superradiant states have an enhanced coupling strength to the RC,\nwhile the subradiant ones are basically decoupled from it. Static on-site\ndisorder induces a coupling between subradiant and superradiant states,\ncreating an indirect coupling to the RC. The problem of finding the optimal\ntransfer conditions, as a function of both the RC energy and the disorder\nstrength, is very complex even in the simplest network, namely a three-level\nsystem. In this paper we analyze such trimeric structure choosing as initial\ncondition a subradiant state, rather than the more common choice of an\nexcitation localized on a site. We show that, while the optimal disorder is of\nthe order of the superradiant coupling, the optimal detuning between the\ninitial state and the RC energy strongly depends on system parameters: when the\nsuperradiant coupling is much larger than the energy gap between the\nsuperradiant and the subradiant levels, optimal transfer occurs if the RC\nenergy is at resonance with the subradiant initial state, whereas we find an\noptimal RC energy at resonance with a virtual dressed state when the\nsuperradiant coupling is smaller than or comparable with the gap.

However, when used \\emph{as is}, a nontrivial\nsequential data structure, such as a linked list, a search tree, or a hash\ntable, may expose incorrect behavior: lost updates, inconsistent responses,\netc. To ensure correctness, portions of the sequential code operating on the\nshared data must be \"protected\" from data races using synchronization\nprimitives and, thus, certain schedules of the steps of concurrent operations\nmust be rejected. But can we ensure that we do not \"overuse\" synchronization,\ni.e., that we reject a concurrent schedule only if it violates correctness?\n  In this paper, we treat this question formally by introducing the notion of a\n\\emph{concurrency-optimal} implementation. A program's concurrency is defined\nhere as its ability to accept concurrent schedules, i.e., interleavings of\nsteps of its sequential implementation. An implementation is\nconcurrency-optimal if it accepts all interleavings that do not violate the\nprogram's correctness. We explore the concurrency properties of \\emph{search}\ndata structures which can be represented in the form of directed acyclic graphs\nexporting insert, delete and search operations.

However, so far, most of the attention has been on\nmoving nodes; little is known about the possibility of chaos in the case of\nstationary nodes. We address this question by considering stationary states,\nwhich provide the simplest examples of wave functions with stationary nodes. We\nprovide examples of stationary wave functions for which there is chaos, as\ndemonstrated by numerical computations, for one particle moving in 3 spatial\ndimensions and for two and three entangled particles in two dimensions. Our\nconclusion is that the motion of the nodes is not necessary for the generation\nof chaos. What is important is the overall complexity of the wave function.\nThat is, if the wave function, or rather its phase, has complex spatial\nvariations, it will lead to complex Bohmian trajectories and hence to chaos.\nAnother aspect of our work concerns the average Lyapunov exponent, which\nquantifies the overall amount of chaos. Since it is very hard to evaluate the\naverage Lyapunov exponent analytically, which is often computed numerically, it\nis useful to have simple quantities that agree well with the average Lyapunov\nexponent. We investigate possible correlations with quantities such as the\nparticipation ratio and different measures of entanglement, for different\nsystems and different families of stationary wave functions. We find that these\nquantities often tend to correlate to the amount of chaos.

Our approach does not depend on batch statistics,\nbut rather uses a data-independent parametric estimate of mean and\nstandard-deviation in every layer thus being computationally faster compared\nwith BN.

We compare the observational characteristics derived\nfrom the 900 ksec Chandra observation to radiative transfer computations in\npressure equilibrium using the radiative transfer code TITAN. We explore\ndifferent values of the ionization parameter xi of the incident flux and adjust\nthe hydrogen-equivalent column density, N_H0 of the warm absorber to match the\nobserved soft X-ray continuum. We derive theoretical column densities for a\nbroad range of ionic species of iron and neon and an AMD that we compare to the\nobservations. We find an extension of the degeneracy between xi and N_H0 for\nthe constant pressure models previously discussed for NGC 3783. Including the\nionic column densities of iron and neon in the comparison between observations\nand data we conclude that a range of ionization parameters between 4000 and\n8000 ergs cm/s is preferred. For the first time, we present theoretical AMD for\na constant pressure wind in NGC 3783 that correctly reproduces the observed\nlevel and is in approximate agreement with the observational appearance of an\ninstability region. Using a variety of observational indicators, we confirm\nthat the X-ray outflow of NGC 3783 can be described as an RPC medium in\npressure equilibrium. The observed AMD agrees with a uniformly hot or a\nuniformly cold thermal state. The measured ionic column densities suggest that\nthe wind tends to the uniformly cold thermal state. The occurrence of thermal\ninstability in the warm absorber model may depend on the computational method\nand the spatial scale on which the radiative transfer is solved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 13:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-07"}

An extremely rich disk wind absorption spectrum is detected, similar to\nthat observed at lower sensitivity in 2007. The very high resolution of the\nthird-order spectrum reveals four components to the disk wind in the Fe K band\nalone; the fastest has a blue-shift of v = 0.03c. Broadened re-emission from\nthe wind is also detected in the first-order spectrum, giving rise to clear\naccretion disk P Cygni profiles.

This particular choice allows the possibility of forming\ntriangles using only discretized wave-vectors when the scaling between two\nconsecutive dodecahedra is equal to the golden ratio, and the icosahedron\nbetween the two dodecahedra is the dual of the inner dodecahedron.\nAlternatively, the same discretization can be described as a logarithmically\nspaced (with a scaling equal to the golden ratio), nested\ndodecahedron-icosahedron compounds. A wave-vector which points from the origin\nto a vertex of such a mesh, can always find two other discretized wave-vectors\nthat are also on the vertices of the mesh (which is not true for an arbitrary\nmesh). Thus, the nested polyhedra grid can be thought of as a reduction (or\ndecimation) of the Fourier space using a particular set of self-similar triads\naranged approximately in a spherical form. For each vertex (i.e. discretized\nwave-vector) in this space, there are either 9 or 15 pairs of vertices (i.e.\nwave-vectors) with which the initial vertex can interact to form a triangle.\nThis allows the reduction of the convolution integral in the Navier-Stokes\nequation to a sum over 9 or 15 interaction pairs. Transforming the equation in\nFourier space, to a network of interacting nodes, that can be constructed as a\nnumerical model, which evolves each component of the velocity vector on each\nnode of the network. Such a model gives the usual Kolmogorov spectrum. Since\nthe scaling is logarithmic, and the number of nodes for each scale is constant,\na very large inertial range can be considered with a much lower number of\ndegrees of freedom. Incidentally, by assuming isotropy and a certain relation\nbetween the phases, the model can be used to systematically derive three\ndimensional shell models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 15:36:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 16:15:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 May 2017 10:11:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

With the H$^{13}$CO$^+$ data, we intend to better\nunderstand the distribution of the quiescent gaseous component of the region.\nMethods: The SiO observations in the J=2-1 v=0 transition and H$^{13}$CO$^+$\nJ=1-0 observations were performed by the Plateau de Bure Interferometer,\ncombined with IRAM 30 m single-dish observations, in order to get the missing\nshort-spacing information. We complement this new high-resolution observation\nwith earlier CO and H$_2$ data. Results: The SiO observations do not trace the\npreviously in CO and H$_2$ identified outflows well. Although we identify\nregions of highly increased SiO abundance indicative of shock interaction,\nthere are hardly any bipolar structures in the data. The southern part of the\nregion, which exhibits strong H$_2$ emission, shows almost no SiO. The CO and\nSiO data show only weak similarities, and the main SiO emission lies between\nthe two dominating dust clumps of the region. Conclusions: Most SiO emission is\nlikely to be a result of high-velocity shocks due to protostellar jets.\nHowever, this does not explain all the emission features and additional\neffects; for example, colliding gas flows at the interface of the two main\nregions may play an important role in the origin of the emission. The present\nSiO data show that several different effects can influence SiO emission, which\nmakes the interpretation of SiO data more difficult than often assumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 10:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

Moreover, these inaccurate stresses\noften lead to unphysical oscillations in the history of integrated surface\nforces such as the coefficient of lift. While the errors in the surface\nstresses and forces do not necessarily affect the convergence of the velocity\nfield, it is desirable, especially in fluid-structure interaction problems, to\nobtain smooth and convergent stress distributions on the surface. To this end,\nwe show that the equation for the surface stresses is an integral equation of\nthe first kind whose ill-posedness is the source of spurious oscillations in\nthe stresses. We also demonstrate that for sufficiently smooth delta functions,\nthe oscillations may be filtered out to obtain physically accurate surface\nstresses. The filtering is applied as a post-processing procedure, so that the\nconvergence of the velocity field is unaffected. We demonstrate the efficacy of\nthe method by computing stresses and forces that converge to the physical\nstresses and forces for several test problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 04:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}
