The\nmixing time is related to a geometric parameter called conductance which is a\nmeasure of edge-expansion. Bounds on conductance are typically obtained by a\ntechnique called \"canonical paths\" where the idea is to find a set of paths,\none between every source-destination pair, such that no edge is heavily\ncongested. However, the canonical paths approach cannot always show rapid\nmixing of a rapidly mixing chain. This drawback disappears if we allow the flow\nbetween a pair of states to be spread along multiple paths. We prove that for a\nlarge class of Markov chains canonical paths does capture rapid mixing.\nAllowing multiple paths to route the flow still does help a great deal in\nproofs, as illustrated by a result of Morris & Sinclair (FOCS'99) on the rapid\nmixing of a Markov chain for sampling 0/1 knapsack solutions.\n  A different approach to prove rapid mixing is \"Coupling\". Path Coupling is a\nvariant discovered by Bubley & Dyer (FOCS'97) that often tremendously reduces\nthe complexity of designing good Couplings. We present several applications of\nPath Coupling in proofs of rapid mixing. These invariably lead to much better\nbounds on mixing time than known using conductance, and moreover Coupling based\nproofs are typically simpler. This motivates the question of whether Coupling\ncan be made to work whenever the chain is rapidly mixing. This question was\nanswered in the negative by Kumar & Ramesh (FOCS'99), who showed that no\nCoupling strategy can prove the rapid mixing of the Jerrum-Sinclair chain for\nsampling perfect and near-perfect matchings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 16:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-07"}

The H_2 system\nconsists of two components (A and B) with column densities log N^A(H_2) =\n17.94+/-0.01 and log N^B(H_2) = 15.16+/-0.02. The spectrum exhibits the lines\nof HD molecules (log N^A(HD) = 13.87+/-0.06) and the neutral species C I and Cl\nI associated with the H_2 absorption system. For the molecular hydrogen lines\nnear the quasar's Ly_beta and O VI emission lines, we detect a nonzero residual\nflux, ~3% of the total flux, caused by the effect of partial coverage of the\nquasar's broad-line region by an H_2 cloud. The uniqueness of the system being\ninvestigated is manifested in a high abundance of the neutral species H_2 and C\nI at the lowest H I column density, log N(H I) = 19.18+/-0.15, among the high\nredshift systems. The N(HD)/2N(H_2) ratio for component A has turned out to be\nalso unusually high, (4.26+/-0.60)x10^{-5}. We have investigated the physical\nconditions in components A and B. Component A represents the optically thick\ncase; the gas has a low number density (n~30 cm^{-3}) and a temperature T~140\nK. In component B, the medium is optically thin with n<100 cm^{-3} and T<100 K.\nThe ultraviolet (UV) background intensity in the clouds exceeds the mean\nintensity in our Galaxy by almost an order of magnitude. A high gas ionization\nfraction, n(H+)/n(H)~10^{-2}, which can be the result of partial shielding of\nthe system from hard UV radiation, is needed to describe the high HD and C I\ncolumn densities. Using our simulations with the PDR Meudon code, we can\nreconstruct the observed column densities of the species within the model with\na constant density n(H)=40 cm^{-3}. A high H_2 formation rate (higher than the\nmean Galactic value by a factor of 10-40) and high gas ionization fraction and\nUV background intensity are needed in this case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 16:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-07"}

Actually what all happens in that scenario is that in such a\nuniverse, whose evolutionary behaviour is described by a single scale factor,\nwhich may be time dependent but is otherwise independent of spatial\ncoordinates, the light signals in a finite time might not be covering all the\navailable space. Further, the flatness problem, as it is posed, is not even\nfalsifiable. The usual argument offered in the literature is that the present\ndensity of the universe is very close to the critical density value and that\nthe universe must be flat since otherwise in past at $\\sim10^{-35}$ second\n(near the epoch of inflation) there will be extremely low departures of density\nfrom the critical density value (of the order $\\sim10^{-53}$), requiring a sort\nof fine tuning.

But it requires extra overhead to balance\nthe key- tree in order to achieve logarithmic re-keying cost. The main\nchallenging issue in dynamic and secure multimedia multicast communication is\nto design a centralized group key management scheme with minimal computational,\ncommunicational and storages complexities without breaching security issues.\nSeveral authors have proposed different centralized group key management\nschemes, wherein one of them proposes reducing communicational complexity but\nincreases computational and storage costs however another proposes decreasing\nthe computational and storage costs which eventually breaches forward and\nbackward secrecy.

Among the physically best motivated ideas, it has\nbeen suggested that this discrepancy can be alleviated if the stars observed\ntoday had undergone photospheric depletion of lithium. The cause of this\ndepletion is investigated by accurately tracing the behaviour of the lithium\nabundances as a function of effective temperature. Globular clusters are ideal\nlaboratories for such an abundance analysis as the relative stellar parameters\nof their stars can be precisely determined. We performed a homogeneous chemical\nabundance analysis of 144 stars in the metal-poor globular cluster M30, ranging\nfrom the cluster turnoff point to the tip of the red giant branch. NLTE\nabundances for Li, Ca, and Fe were derived where possible. Stellar parameters\nwere derived by matching isochrones to the observed V vs V-I colour-magnitude\ndiagram. Independent effective temperatures were obtained from automated\nprofile fitting of the Balmer lines and by applying colour-T_eff calibrations\nto the broadband photometry.

The symmetries guarantee that there are two gravitational\npropagating physical degrees of freedom (and no explicit\nrefoliation-invariance). The simplest such system has a geometric\ninterpretation as a geodesic model in infinite dimensional conformal\nsuperspace. An approximate solution to the equations of motion corresponds to a\nstatic Bianchi IX spatial ansatz. The unique coupling to electromagnetism\nforces its propagation equations to be hyperbolic, enabling us to \\\"build\" a\nstandard space-time causal structure. There are, however, deviations from the\nstandard Maxwell equations when space-time anisotropies become too large.\nRegarding quantization, with the geometric interpretation and the lack of\nrefoliation invariance, the path integral treatment of the symmetries becomes\nmuch less involved than the similar approaches to GR.

With this distinction, one can make sense of superpositions\nas interference between alternative paths in the relational configuration space\nof the entire Universe. But the full use of relationalism brings us to a\ntimeless picture of Nature, as it does in the canonical approach (which\nculminates in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation). After a discussion of Parmenides\nand the Eleatics' rejection of time, I show that there is middle ground between\ntheir view of absolute timelessness and a view of physics taking place in\ntimeless configuration space. In this middle ground, even though change does\nnot fundamentally exist, the illusion of change can be recovered in a way not\npermitted by Parmenides. It is recovered through a particular density\ndistribution over configuration space which gives rise to 'records'.\nIncidentally, this distribution seems to have the potential to dissolve further\naspects of the measurement problem that can still be argued to haunt the\napplication of decoherence to Many-Worlds quantum mechanics.

String-like beam\nresonators possess conventionally 10 times smaller $Q\\cdot f$ products;\nhowever, on account of their much larger $Q$-to-mass ratio and reduced mode\ndensity, they remain a canonical choice for precision force, mass, and charge\nsensing, and have recently enabled Heisenberg-limited position measurements at\ncryogenic temperatures.

Due to eclipses and\nvariable absorption, the quiescent low-mass X-ray binary X5 provides less\nstringent constraints, leading to a radius of $R=9.6^{+0.9}_{-1.1}$ km,\nassuming a hydrogen atmosphere and a mass of $M=1.4$ M$_{\\odot}$. When combined\nwith all other existing spectroscopic radius measurements, these measurements\nstrongly favor radii in the 9.9-11.2 km range for a ~1.5 M$_{\\odot}$ neutron\nstar and point to a dense matter equation of state that is somewhat softer than\nthe nucleonic ones that are consistent with laboratory experiments at low\ndensities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 21:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

In specific,\nthe hybrid precoding may require matrix operations with a scale of antenna\nsize, which is generally large in mmWave communication. Moreover, the channel\nestimation is also rather time consuming due to the large number of antennas at\nboth Tx/Rx sides. In this paper, a low-complexity hybrid precoding and channel\nestimation approach is proposed. In the channel estimation phase, a\nhierarchical multi-beam search scheme is proposed to fast acquire $N_{\\rm{S}}$\n(the number of streams) multipath components (MPCs)/clusters with the highest\npowers. In the hybrid precoding phase, the analog and digital precodings are\ndecoupled. The analog precoding is designed to steer along the $N_{\\rm{S}}$\nacquired MPCs/clusters at both Tx/Rx sides, shaping an equivalent\n$N_{\\rm{S}}\\times N_{\\rm{S}}$ baseband channel, while the digital precoding\nperforms operations in the baseband with the reduced-scale channel. Performance\nevaluations show that, compared with a state-of-the-art scheme, while achieving\na close or even better performance when the number of radio-frequency (RF)\nchains or streams is small, both the computational complexity of the hybrid\nprecoding and the time complexity of the channel estimation are greatly\nreduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Mar 2016 21:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-08"}

First, to assess\nthe applicability of SAL to this kind of data, and second, to analyze the role\nof external object identification algorithms (OIA) and the effects of\nobservational uncertainties on the resulting scores.\n  As a feature based method, SAL requires external OIA. A comparison of three\ndifferent algorithms shows that the threshold level, which is a fundamental\npart of all studied algorithms, induces high sensitivity and unstable behavior\nof object dependent SAL scores (i.e. even very small changes in parameter\nvalues can lead to large changes in the resulting scores).

The mathematical\nstructure of these indicators connects the sensitivity of the SAL scores to\nparameter changes with the effect of observational uncertainties.\n  Finally, the discriminating power of SAL is studied.

Rotation, enhanced diffusion, convection\novershoot, and magnetic fields are used to reconcile the new abundances with\nhelioseismology. The \\textbf{too} low-helium \\textbf{subsurface abundance} in\nenhanced diffusion models can be improved by the mixing caused by rotation and\nmagnetic fields.

We consider settings where the nonlinear---and\npossibly non-smooth---objective part is endowed with a proximity operator, and\nthe constraint set is equipped with a self-concordant barrier. Our approach\nrelies on the following two main ideas. First, we re-parameterize the\noptimality condition as an auxiliary problem, such that a good initial point is\navailable; by doing so, a family of alternative paths towards the optimum is\ngenerated. Second, we combine the proximal operator with path-following ideas\nto design a single-phase, proximal, path-following algorithm. Our method has\nseveral advantages. First, it allows handling non-smooth objectives via\nproximal operators; this avoids lifting the problem dimension in order to\naccommodate non-smooth components in optimization. Second, it consists of only\na \\emph{single phase}: While the overall convergence rate of classical\npath-following schemes for self-concordant objectives does not suffer from the\ninitialization phase, proximal path-following schemes undergo slow convergence,\nin order to obtain a good starting point \\cite{TranDinh2013e}.

While the smaller bond angle and the distance\nbetween the CrAs chains also affect the superconductivity due to their\nstructural connections with the angle. We find that the larger value of the\ndifference between the larger and samller angles, which is associated with the\nextent of the non-centrosymmetry of the lattice structure, is in favor of\nsuperconductivity. These results are expected to shed a new light on the\nunderlying mechanism of the superconductivity in these Q1D superconductors and\nalso to provide new perspective in understanding other non-centrosymmetric\nsuperconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2016 07:01:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 13:33:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-19"}

We incorporate realistic observing constraints like the\ndiurnal cycle, telescope pointing limitations, available observing time, and\nthe rising/setting of the target at the observatory location. We use\nsimulations to demonstrate that our proposed algorithms outperform the default\ngreedy observing schedule used by many observatories. Our algorithms are\napplicable for follow--up of other transient sources with large positional\nuncertainties, like Fermi--detected GRBs, and can easily be adapted for\nscheduling radio or space--based X--ray followup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2016 07:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

Tracking live fish in an open aquatic environment\nposts challenges that are different from general pedestrian or vehicle tracking\nin surveillance applications. In many rough habitats fish are monitored by\ncameras installed on moving platforms, where tracking is even more challenging\ndue to inapplicability of background models. In this paper, a novel tracking\nalgorithm based on the deformable multiple kernels (DMK) is proposed to address\nthese challenges. Inspired by the deformable part model (DPM) technique, a set\nof kernels is defined to represent the holistic object and several parts that\nare arranged in a deformable configuration.

Kernel motion is efficiently estimated by the mean-shift algorithm on\ncolor and texture features to realize tracking. Furthermore, the HOG-feature\ndeformation costs are adopted as soft constraints on kernel positions to\nmaintain the part configuration.

In this\npaper, we generalize the Newtonian theory of stationary axisymmetric resistive\ntori of Tripathy, Prasanna $\\&$ Das (1990) by including the fully general\nrelativistic features. If we are to obtain the steady state configuration, we\nhave to take into account the finite resistivity for the magnetofluid in order\nto avoid the piling up of the field lines anywhere in the accretion discs. The\nefficient value of conductivity must be much smaller than the classical\nconductivity to be astrophysically interesting. The accreting plasma in the\npresence of an external dipole magnetic field gives rise to a current in the\nazimuthal direction. The azimuthal current produced due to the motion of the\nmagnetofluid modifies the magnetic field structure inside the disc and\ngenerates a poloidal magnetic field for the disc.

Volumetric\nmodulated arc therapy (VMAT) is increasingly being examined for CSI, as it\noffers both better dose homogeneity and better dose conformance while also\noffering a possibility to create field junctions which are more robust towards\nsmall shifts in patient position during the treatment.\n  Materials and Methods: A VMAT treatment plan with three isocenters was made\nfor a test case patient. Three groups of overlapping arc field pairs were used;\none for the cranial and two for the spinal part. In order to assure a ramp-like\ndose profile in the field overlap region, the upper spinal part was optimised\nfirst, with dose prescription explicitely enforcing a ramp-like dose profile.\nThe cranial and lower spinal part were done afterwards, taking into account the\ndose contribution of the upper spinal fields.\n  Results: Using simple geometrical reasoning, we demonstrated that hot- and\ncold spots which arise from small displacement of one treatment field relative\nto the other treatment field can be reduced by taking two precautions: (a)\nwidening the field overlap region, and (b) reducing the field gradient across\nthe overlap region. The function with the smallest maximal gradient is a linear\nramp. We present a treatment planning technique which yields the desired dose\nprofile of the two contributing fields, and minimises dosimetric dependence on\nminor positional errors in patient set-up.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2016 11:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-30"}

For the\nspin transfer torque (STT) vector we find that its in-plane component is\ngenerally larger than the out-of-plane component, and we identify a\nlongitudinal spin current component, which, however, does not contribute to the\ntorque. Our results suggest that the torque-current relationship in magnetic\nSTM junctions follows the power law rather than a linear function.\nConsequently, we show that the ratio between the STT and the spin-polarized\ncharge current is not constant, and more importantly, it can be tuned by the\nbias voltage, tip-sample distance and magnetization rotation. We find that the\nSTT efficiency can be enhanced by about a factor of seven by selecting a proper\nbias voltage. Thus, we demonstrate the possible enhancement of the STT\nefficiency in magnetic STM junctions, which can be exploited in technological\napplications.

However, the lack of analytical\nsolutions has hindered the interpretation of the available data. In this paper,\nwe investigate the generation of X-ray time lags in Compton scattering coronae\nusing a new mathematical approach based on analysis of the Fourier-transformed\ntransport equation. By solving this equation, we obtain the Fourier transform\nof the radiation Green's function, which allows us to calculate the exact\ndependence of the time lags on the Fourier frequency, for both homogeneous and\ninhomogeneous coronal clouds.

The\nprevious attempt on the TIM problem is mainly based on its equivalence to the\nindex coding problem, but so far only a few index coding problems have been\nsolved. In contrast, in this paper, we present an algorithmic approach to\ninvestigate the achievable degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) by recasting the TIM\nproblem as an LRMC problem. Unfortunately, the resulting LRMC problem is known\nto be NP-hard, and the main contribution of this paper is to propose a\nRiemannian pursuit (RP) framework to detect the rank of the matrix to be\nrecovered by iteratively increasing the rank. This algorithm solves a sequence\nof fixed-rank matrix completion problems. To address the convergence issues in\nthe existing fixed-rank optimization methods, the quotient manifold geometry of\nthe search space of fixed-rank matrices is exploited via Riemannian\noptimization. By further exploiting the structure of the low-rank matrix\nvarieties, i.e., the closure of the set of fixed- rank matrices, we develop an\nefficient rank increasing strategy to find good initial points in the procedure\nof rank pursuit. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RP algorithm\nachieves a faster convergence rate and higher achievable DoFs for the TIM\nproblem compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2016 14:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-08"}

We then show that the function\n$S_1(\\omega)$ studied by P\\'{o}lya has $g(s)$ as its Fourier transform, where\n$\\xi(s)=g(s)\\zeta(s)$.

The associated relativistic nonlinear wave equation\nis related to recently advanced nonlinear extensions of the Schroedinger,\nDirac, and Klein-Gordon equations inspired on the non-extensive generalized\nthermostatistics. This is a theoretical framework that has been applied in\nrecent years to several problems in nuclear and particle physics, gravitational\nphysics, and quantum field theory. The nonlinear Proca equation investigated\nhere has a power-law nonlinearity characterized by a real parameter $q$\n(formally corresponding to the Tsallis entropic parameter) in such a way that\nthe standard linear Proca wave equation is recovered in the limit $q\n\\rightarrow 1$. We derive the nonlinear Proca equation from a Lagrangian that,\nbesides the usual vectorial field $\\Psi^{\\mu}(\\vec{x},t)$, involves an\nadditional field $\\Phi^{\\mu}(\\vec{x},t)$. We obtain exact time dependent\nsoliton-like solutions for these fields having the form of a $q$-plane wave,\nand show that both field equations lead to the relativistic energy-momentum\nrelation $E^{2} = p^{2}c^{2} + m^{2}c^{4}$ for all values of $q$. This suggests\nthat the present nonlinear theory constitutes a new field theoretical\nrepresentation of particle dynamics. In the limit of massless particles the\npresent $q$-generalized Proca theory reduces to Maxwell electromagnetism, and\nthe $q$-plane waves yield localized, transverse solutions of Maxwell equations.\nPhysical consequences and possible applications are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Mar 2016 05:37:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}
