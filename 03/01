Gamma rays\ntrace nuclear processes most directly, as they originate from nuclear\ntransitions following radioactive decays or high-energy collisions with\nexcitation of nuclei. Additionally, the unique gamma-ray signature from the\nannihilation of positrons falls into this astronomical window and is discussed\nhere: Cosmic positrons are often produced from beta-decays, thus also of\nnuclear physics origins. The nuclear reactions leading to radioactive isotopes\noccur inside stars and stellar explosions, which therefore constitute the main\nobjects of such studies. In recent years, both thermonuclear and core-collapse\nsupernova radioactivities have been measured, and complement conventional\nsupernova observations with measurements of their prime energy sources. The\ndiffuse radioactive afterglow of massive-star nucleosynthesis in gamma rays is\nnow being analysed towards how massive stars feed back their energy and ejecta\ninto interstellar gas. Large interstellar cavities and superbubbles have been\nrecognised to be the dominating structures where new massive-star ejecta are\ninjected, from 26Al gamma-ray spectroscopy. Finally, the puzzling\nbulge-dominated intensity distribution of positron annihilation gamma rays is\nmeasured in greater detail, but still not understood; a recent microquasar\nflare provided evidence that such objects may be prime sources for positrons in\ninterstellar space, rather than distributed nucleosynthesis. We also briefly\ndiscuss the status and prospects for astronomy with telescopes for the\nnuclear-radiation energy window.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 16:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-12"}

The patterning system is thus said to encode\npositional information, a concept that was formalized recently in the framework\nof information theory. Here we introduce a toy model of patterning in one\nspatial dimension, which can be seen as an extension of Wolpert's paradigmatic\n\"French Flag\" model, to patterning by several interacting, spatially coupled\ngenes subject to intrinsic and extrinsic noise. Our model, a variant of an\nIsing spin system, allows us to systematically explore expression patterns that\noptimally encode positional information. We find that optimal patterning\nsystems use positional cues, as in the French Flag model, together with\ngene-gene interactions to generate combinatorial codes for position which we\ncall \"Counter\" patterns. Counter patterns can also be stabilized against noise\nand variations in system size or morphogen dosage by longer-range spatial\ninteractions of the type invoked in the Turing model.

In recent years CNNs have\noutperformed traditional approaches in many computer vision tasks such as\nobject detection, image classification and face recognition. CNNs are\nvulnerable to overfitting, and a lot of research focuses on finding\nregularization methods to overcome it. One approach is designing task specific\nmodels based on prior knowledge.\n  Several works have shown that properties of natural images can be easily\ncaptured using complex numbers. Motivated by these works, we present a\nvariation of the CNN model with complex valued input and weights. We construct\nthe complex model as a generalization of the real model. Lack of order over the\ncomplex field raises several difficulties both in the definition and in the\ntraining of the network.

It is sensitive to phase structure, and we suggest\nit serves as a regularized model for problems where such structure is\nimportant. This suggestion is verified empirically by comparing the performance\nof a complex and a real network in the problem of cell detection.

Calculations\nshow that both effects could be detected for the very-hot exoplanet WASP-12 b\nusing the method of precise transit timing over a timespan of the order of 10\nyr. We acquired new precise light curves for 29 transits of WASP-12 b,\nspannning 4 observing seasons from November 2012 to February 2016. New\nmid-transit times, together with literature ones, were used to refine the\ntransit ephemeris and analyse the timing residuals. We find that the transit\ntimes of WASP-12 b do not follow a linear ephemeris with a 5 sigma confidence\nlevel. They may be approximated with a quadratic ephemeris that gives a rate of\nchange in the orbital period of -2.56 +/- 0.40 x 10^{-2} s/yr. The tidal\nquality parameter of the host star was found to be equal to 2.5 x 10^5 that is\ncomparable to theoretical predictions for Sun-like stars. We also consider a\nmodel, in which the observed timing residuals are interpreted as a result of\nthe apsidal precession. We find, however, that this model is statistically less\nprobable than the orbital decay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 17:25:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-16"}

However, most online routing applications still provide\nshortest distance or shortest travel-time routes only, neglecting individual\npreferences as well as the current situation. Both aspects are of particular\nimportance in a multimodal setting as attractivity of some transportation modes\nsuch as biking crucially depends on personal characteristics and exogenous\nfactors like the weather. This paper introduces the FAVourite rOUte\nRecommendation (FAVOUR) approach to provide personalized, situation-aware route\nproposals based on three steps: first, at the initialization stage, the user\nprovides limited information (home location, work place, mobility options,\nsociodemographics) used to select one out of a small number of initial\nprofiles. Second, based on this information, a stated preference survey is\ndesigned in order to sharpen the profile. In this step a mass preference prior\nis used to encode the prior knowledge on preferences from the class identified\nin step one. And third, subsequently the profile is continuously updated during\nusage of the routing services. The last two steps use Bayesian learning\ntechniques in order to incorporate information from all contributing\nindividuals. The FAVOUR approach is presented in detail and tested on a small\nnumber of survey participants. The experimental results on this real-world\ndataset show that FAVOUR generates better-quality recommendations w.r.t.\nalternative learning algorithms from the literature. In particular the\ndefinition of the mass preference prior for initialization of step two is shown\nto provide better predictions than a number of alternatives from the\nliterature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 18:16:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

The\nrelation is remarkably tight, with almost all galaxies being located within a\nperpendicular distance of +- 0.1 dex from the best fit line.

The campaign led to the\nproduction of a global map of the illuminated portion of 67P/CG nucleus. During\nthis prelanding phase the comet's heliocentric distance decreased from 3.62 to\n2.93 AU while Rosetta was orbiting around the nucleus at distances between 100\nto 10 km. VIRTIS-M, the Visible and InfraRed Thermal Imaging Spectrometer -\nMapping channel (Coradini et al. 2007) onboard the orbiter, has acquired\n0.25-5.1 micron hyperspectral data of the entire illuminated surface, e.g. the\nnorth hemisphere and the equatorial regions, with spatial resolution between\n2.5 and 25 m/pixel. I/F spectra have been corrected for thermal emission\nremoval in the 3.5-5.1 micron range and for surface's photometric response.

Indeed, throughout the investigated period,\nthe nucleus surface shows a significant increase of the single scattering\nalbedo along with a decrease of the 0.5-0.8 and 1.0-2.5 micron spectral slopes,\nindicating a flattening of the reflectance. We attribute the origin of this\neffect to the partial removal of the dust layer caused by the increased\ncontribution of water sublimation to the gaseous activity as comet crossed the\nfrost-line.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 19:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

The principal technique behind the 5G-SDWN\nframework is the separation of the control and data planes, from the deep core\nentities to edge wireless access points (APs). This separation allows the\nabstraction of resources as transmission parameters of each user over the\n5G-SDWN. In this user-centric and service-oriented environment, resource\nmanagement plays a critical role to achieve efficiency and reliability.\nHowever, it is natural to wonder if 5G-SDWN can be leveraged to enable\nconverged multi-layer resource management over the portfolio of resources, and\nreciprocally, if CML resource management can effectively provide performance\nenhancement and reliability for 5G-SDWN.

As a case study, we consider pig trade in\nGermany, where trade actors (agricultural premises) form a complex network. The\ncentral question is how infectious diseases can potentially spread within the\nsystem of trade contacts. We address this question by analyzing the underlying\nnetwork of animal movements.\n  Methodology/Findings: The considered pig trade dataset spans several years\nand is analyzed with respect to its potential to spread infectious diseases.\nFocusing on measurements of network-topological properties, we avoid the usage\nof external parameters, since these properties are independent of specific\npathogens. They are on the contrary of great importance for understanding any\ngeneral spreading process on this particular network. We analyze the system\nusing different network models, which include varying amounts of information:\n(i) static network, (ii) network as a time series of uncorrelated snapshots,\n(iii) temporal network, where causality is explicitly taken into account.\n  Findings: Our approach provides a general framework for a\ntopological-temporal characterization of livestock trade networks. We find that\na static network view captures many relevant aspects of the trade system, and\npremises can be classified into two clearly defined risk classes. Moreover, our\nresults allow for an efficient allocation strategy for intervention measures\nusing centrality measures. Data on trade volume does barely alter the results\nand is therefore of secondary importance.

Targeted at robotics applications, it is implemented entirely in C++ and\ndesigned from the ground up to easily integrate with systems that support any\nof several major vision and robotics libraries including OpenCV, ROS, ViSP and\nEigen. It implements more methods, is faster, and more precise than other\nexisting systems. Further, the theoretical basis for its design is a new way to\nconceptualize registration based trackers that decomposes them into three\nconstituent sub modules - Search Method (SM), Appearance Model (AM) and State\nSpace Model (SSM).\n  In the process, we integrate many important advances published after Baker \\&\nMatthews' landmark work in 2004. In addition to being a practical solution for\nfast and high precision tracking, MTF can also serve as a useful research tool\nby allowing existing and new methods for any of the sub modules to be studied\nbetter. When a new method is introduced for one of these, the breakdown can\nhelp to experimentally find the combination of methods for the others that is\noptimum for it. By extensive use of generic programming, MTF makes it easy to\nplug in a new method for any of the sub modules so that it can not only be\ntested comprehensively with existing methods but also become immediately\navailable for deployment in any project that uses the framework. With 16 AMs,\n11 SMs and 13 SSMs implemented already, MTF provides over 2000 distinct single\nlayer trackers. It also allows two or more of these to be combined together in\nseveral ways to create a practically unlimited variety of novel multi layer\ntrackers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 20:39:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2016 18:19:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 16:50:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 18 May 2018 02:15:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-21"}

Our goal is to\ndetermine the general properties of the circumnuclear dusty environments.\n  Methods: We used the MIR interferometric data of a sample of AGNs provided by\nthe instrument MIDI/VLTI and followed a statistical approach to compare the\nobserved distribution of the interferometric data with the distributions\ncomputed from clumpy torus models. We mainly tested whether the diversity of\nSeyfert galaxies can be described using the Standard Model idea. In addition to\nline-of-sight (LOS) effects, we performed different realizations of the same\nmodel to include possible variations that are caused by the stochastic nature\nof the dusty models.\n  Results: We find that our entire sample of AGNs, which contains both Seyfert\ntypes, cannot be explained merely by an inclination effect and by including\nrandom variations of the clouds. Instead, we find that each subset of Seyfert\ntype can be explained by different models, where the filling factor at the\ninner radius seems to be the largest difference. For type I objects we find\nthat about two thirds of our objects could also be described using a dusty\ntorus similar to the type II objects. For the remaining third, it was not\npossible to find a good description using models with high filling factors,\nwhile we found good fits with models with low filling factors.\n  Conclusions: Within our model assumptions, we did not find one single set of\nmodel parameters that could simultaneously explain the MIR data of all 21 AGN\nwith LOS effects and random variations alone. We conclude that at least two\ndistinct cloud configurations are required to model the differences in Seyfert\ngalaxies, with volume-filling factors differing by a factor of about 5-10.

The\nmodified GCM is first subjected to extensive testing and validation.

In particular, it is shown that the recursive plasmoid formation can\ntrigger a collisionless reconnection regime if $S \\gtrsim L_{cs} {(\\epsilon_c\nl_k)^{-1}} {(1 + {P_m})^{1/2}}$, where $L_{cs}$ is the half-length of the\nglobal current sheet and $l_k$ is the relevant kinetic length scale.

Such a control strategy determines the electric potentials\nof a set of electrodes located at fixed points in the line segment. The\nparticles move under the electric forces generated by these electrodes and by\nthe interactions between the particles themselves to form a desired pattern\neventually. Due to technology limitations, the particle positions cannot be\nmeasured during the course of control, so that the control is open-loop in\nnature. Such an open-loop control optimally changes the electrode potentials in\ntime in order to create a desired pattern with the highest probability, despite\nthe inherent uncertainty in the initial positions and the dynamical behaviors\nof the particles. Two models are proposed to describe the uncertain dynamics of\nthe particles: a continuous model relying on a set of nonlinear stochastic\ndifferential equations, and a discrete Ising model consisting of a large\ndimensional continuous-time Markov chain. While the first model is more\nmathematically tractable, the second one more precisely describes particles at\nthe nanometer scale. The control design procedure begins with the continuous\nmodel and identifies the structure of its stable equilibria, which is used\nlater to propose a piecewise constant structure for the control and to\ndemonstrate that the optimal value of each piece is independently obtained from\na certain static optimization problem. It is shown next that the design\nprocedure can be applied to the discrete model with only minor modifications.

Many\nnatural zero-sum games have exponentially many strategies, but highly\nstructured payoffs. For example, in the well-studied Colonel Blotto game\n(introduced by Borel in 1921), players must divide a pool of troops among a set\nof battlefields with the goal of winning (i.e., having more troops in) a\nmajority. The Colonel Blotto game is commonly used for analyzing a wide range\nof applications from the U.S presidential election, to innovative technology\ncompetitions, to advertisement, to sports. However, because of the size of the\nstrategy space, standard methods for computing equilibria of zero-sum games\nfail to be computationally feasible. Indeed, despite its importance, only a few\nsolutions for special variants of the problem are known.\n  In this paper we show how to compute equilibria of Colonel Blotto games.\n  Moreover, our approach takes the form of a general reduction: to find a Nash\nequilibrium of a zero-sum game, it suffices to design a separation oracle for\nthe strategy polytope of any bilinear game that is payoff-equivalent. We then\napply this technique to obtain the first polytime algorithms for a variety of\ngames. In addition to Colonel Blotto, we also show how to compute equilibria in\nan infinite-strategy variant called the General Lotto game; this involves\nshowing how to prune the strategy space to a finite subset before applying our\nreduction. We also consider the class of dueling games, first introduced by\nImmorlica et al. (2011).

Generally, the size of the filter is equal to the size $ H\\times W\n$ of the input patch. We argue that the representation ability of equal-size\nstrategy is not strong enough. To overcome the drawback, we propose to use\nsubpatch filter whose spatial size $ h\\times w $ is smaller than $ H\\times W $.\nThe proposed subpatch filter consists of two subsequent filters. The first one\nis a linear filter of spatial size $ h\\times w $ and is aimed at extracting\nfeatures from spatial domain. The second one is of spatial size $ 1\\times 1 $\nand is used for strengthening the connection between different input feature\nchannels and for reducing the number of parameters.

The blueshifted absorption profile of H$\\beta$ shows a variation of\nmore than 5$\\sigma$ at a high velocity portion ($>3000\\ \\mathrm{km\\ s}^{-1}$)\nof the trough. We perform a detailed analysis for the physical conditions of\nthe absorber using Balmer lines as well as metastable He I and optical Fe II\nabsorptions ($\\lambda 4233$ from b$^4$P$_{5/2}$ level and $\\lambda 5169$ from\na$^6$S$_{5/2}$) at the same velocity.

With the\ndeployment of deep packet inspection (DPI) in telecom networks, it is possible\nfor the telco operators to obtain user online preference. However, DPI has its\nlimitations and user preference derived only from DPI faces sparsity and cold\nstart problems. To better infer the user preference, social correlation in\ntelco users network derived from Call Detailed Records (CDRs) with regard to\nonline preference is investigated. Though widely verified in several online\nsocial networks, social correlation between online preference of users in\nmobile telco networks, where the CDRs derived relationship are of less social\nproperties and user mobile internet surfing activities are not visible to\nneighbourhood, has not been explored at a large scale. Based on a real world\ntelecom dataset including CDRs and preference of more than $550K$ users for\nseveral months, we verified that correlation does exist between online\npreference in such \\textit{ambiguous} social network. Furthermore, we found\nthat the stronger ties that users build, the more similarity between their\npreference may have. After defining the preference inferring task as a Top-$K$\nrecommendation problem, we incorporated Matrix Factorization Collaborative\nFiltering model with social correlation and tie strength based on call patterns\nto generate Top-$K$ preferred categories for users. The proposed Tie Strength\nAugmented Social Recommendation (TSASoRec) model takes data sparsity and cold\nstart user problems into account, considering both the recorded and missing\nrecorded category entries. The experiment on real dataset shows the proposed\nmodel can better infer user preference, especially for cold start users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 05:20:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 22:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-13"}

However, despite their wide use and success, our\ntheoretical understanding of the expressive properties that drive these\nnetworks is partial at best. On the other hand, we have a much firmer grasp of\nthese issues in the world of arithmetic circuits. Specifically, it is known\nthat convolutional arithmetic circuits possess the property of \"complete depth\nefficiency\", meaning that besides a negligible set, all functions that can be\nimplemented by a deep network of polynomial size, require exponential size in\norder to be implemented (or even approximated) by a shallow network. In this\npaper we describe a construction based on generalized tensor decompositions,\nthat transforms convolutional arithmetic circuits into convolutional rectifier\nnetworks. We then use mathematical tools available from the world of arithmetic\ncircuits to prove new results. First, we show that convolutional rectifier\nnetworks are universal with max pooling but not with average pooling. Second,\nand more importantly, we show that depth efficiency is weaker with\nconvolutional rectifier networks than it is with convolutional arithmetic\ncircuits. This leads us to believe that developing effective methods for\ntraining convolutional arithmetic circuits, thereby fulfilling their expressive\npotential, may give rise to a deep learning architecture that is provably\nsuperior to convolutional rectifier networks but has so far been overlooked by\npractitioners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 06:44:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 12:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-18"}

The high-energy radiation from black-hole binaries may be\ndue to the reprocessing of a lamp located on the black hole axis, emitting\nX-rays. The observed spectrum is made of 3 components: the direct spectrum; the\nthermal bump; and the reflected spectrum made of the Compton hump and the\niron-line complex.\n  Aims. We aim at computing accurately the complete reprocessed spectrum\n(thermal bump + reflected) of black-hole binaries over the entire X-ray band.\nWe also determine the strength of the direct component. Our choice of\nparameters is adapted to a source showing an important thermal component.\n  Methods. We compute in full GR the illumination of a thin disk by a lamp\nalong the rotation axis. We use the ATM21 radiative transfer code to compute\nthe spectrum emitted along the disk. We ray trace this local spectrum to\ndetermine the reprocessed spectrum as observed at infinity. We discuss the\ndependence of the local and ray-traced spectra on the emission angle and spin.\n  Results. We show the importance of the angle dependence of the total disk\nspecific intensity spectrum emitted by the illuminated atmosphere when the\nthermal disk emission if fully taken into account. High spin implies high\ntemperature in the inner regions, so the emitted thermal disk spectrum covers\nthe iron-line complex. As a result we locally observe absorption lines produced\nin the hot disk atmosphere. Absorption lines are narrow and disappear after ray\ntracing the local spectrum.\n  Conclusions. Our results mainly highlight the importance of considering the\nangle dependence of the local spectrum when computing reprocessed spectra, as\nwas already found in a recent study. The main new result of our work is to show\nthe importance of computing the thermal bump of the spectrum, as this feature\ncan change considerably the observed iron-line complex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 08:45:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2016 13:10:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

Current practice when deriving\nconnectivity estimates over time is to use the Fisher transform which aims to\nstabilize the variance of correlation values that fluctuate around varying true\ncorrelation values. It is however unclear how well the stabilization of signal\nvariance performed by the Fisher transform works for each connectivity time\nseries, when the true correlation is assumed to be fluctuating. This is of\nimportance because many subsequent analyses either assume or perform better\nwhen the time series have stable variance or adheres to an approximate Gaussian\ndistribution. In this paper, using simulations and analysis of resting-state\nfMRI data, we analyze the effect of applying different variance stabilization\nstrategies on connectivity time-series. We here focus our investigation on the\nFisher transform, the Box Cox transform and an approach that combines both\ntransforms. Our results show that, if the intention of stabilizing the variance\nis to use metrics on the time series where stable variance or a Gaussian\ndistribution is desired (e.g. clustering), the Fisher transform is not optimal\nand may even skew connectivity time series away from being Gaussian. Further,\nwe show that the suboptimal performance of the Fisher transform can be\nsubstantially improved by including an additional Box-Cox transformation after\nthe dFC time series has been Fisher transformed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 09:51:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2016 13:38:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-14"}

It is known that in the Gaussian noise\nsetting, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) has an expected squared\n$\\ell_2$-estimation error that is on the same order as the Cram\\'er-Rao lower\nbound. Moreover, even though the MLE is an optimal solution to a non-convex\nquadratic optimization problem, it can be found with high probability using\nsemidefinite programming (SDP), provided that the noise power is not too large.\nIn this paper, we study the estimation and convergence performance of a\nrecently-proposed low-complexity alternative to the SDP-based approach, namely,\nthe generalized power method (GPM). Our contribution is twofold. First, we\nbound the rate at which the estimation error decreases in each iteration of the\nGPM and use this bound to show that all iterates---not just the MLE---achieve\nan estimation error that is on the same order as the Cram\\'er-Rao bound. Our\nresult holds under the least restrictive assumption on the noise power and\ngives the best provable bound on the estimation error known to date. It also\nimplies that one can terminate the GPM at any iteration and still obtain an\nestimator that has a theoretical guarantee on its estimation error. Second, we\nshow that under the same assumption on the noise power as that for the\nSDP-based method, the GPM will converge to the MLE at a linear rate with high\nprobability. This answers a question raised in [3] and shows that the GPM is\ncompetitive in terms of both theoretical guarantees and numerical efficiency\nwith the SDP-based method. At the heart of our convergence rate analysis is a\nnew error bound for the non-convex quadratic optimization formulation of the\nphase synchronization problem, which could be of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 10:09:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2016 08:11:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 07:19:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

Among the non-local\ncorrection methods tested, optB88-vdW method works well for the investigated\ncompound. The obtained equilibrium bulk modulus reveals that MF is softer than\nthe well known primary explosives Silver Fulminate (SF), silver azide and lead\nazide. MF exhibits anisotropic compressibility (b>a>c) under pressure,\nconsequently the corresponding elastic moduli decrease in the following order:\nC22>C11>C33. The structural and mechanical properties suggest that MF is more\nsensitive to detonate along c-axis (similar to RDX) due to high compressibility\nof Hg...O non-bonded interactions along that axis. Electronic structure and\noptical properties were calculated including spin-orbit (SO) interactions using\nfull potential linearized augmented plane wave method within recently developed\nTran-Blaha modified Becke-Johnson (TB-mBJ) potential. The calculated TB-mBJ\nelectronic structures of SF and MF show that these compounds are indirect\nbandgap insulators. Also, SO coupling is found to be more pronounced for 4d and\n5d-states of Ag and Hg atoms of SF and MF, respectively. Partial density of\nstates and electron charge density maps were used to describe the nature of\nchemical bonding. Ag-C bond is more directional than Hg-C bond which makes SF\nto be more unstable than MF. The effect of SO coupling on optical properties\nhas also been studied and found to be significant for both of the compounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 10:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-02"}

We develop\n$\\ell_1$-penalized estimators of both regression coefficients and the threshold\nparameter. Our penalized estimators not only select covariates but also\ndiscriminate between a model with homogeneous sparsity and a model with a\nchange point. As a result, it is not necessary to know or pretest whether the\nchange point is present, or where it occurs. Our estimator of the change point\nachieves an oracle property in the sense that its asymptotic distribution is\nthe same as if the unknown active sets of regression coefficients were known.\nImportantly, we establish this oracle property without a perfect covariate\nselection, thereby avoiding the need for the minimum level condition on the\nsignals of active covariates. Dealing with high-dimensional quantile regression\nwith an unknown change point calls for a new proof technique since the quantile\nloss function is non-smooth and furthermore the corresponding objective\nfunction is non-convex with respect to the change point. The technique\ndeveloped in this paper is applicable to a general M-estimation framework with\na change point, which may be of independent interest.

In this paper, we propose an incentive\nmechanism in which the base station (BS) rewards those UTs that share contents\nwith others using D2D communication. We study the cost minimization problem for\nthe BS and the utility maximization problem for each UT. In particular, the BS\ndetermines the rewarding policy to minimize his total cost, while each UT aims\nto maximize his utility by choosing his caching policy. We formulate the\nconflict among UTs and the tension between the BS and the UTs as a Stackelberg\ngame. We show the existence of the equilibrium and propose an iterative\ngradient algorithm (IGA) to obtain the Stackelberg Equilibrium. Extensive\nsimulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed caching\nscheme and comparisons are drawn with several baseline caching schemes with no\nincentives. Numerical results show that the caching scheme under our incentive\nmechanism outperforms other schemes in terms of the BS serving cost and the\nutilities of the UTs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 12:08:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

These events are often coincident\nwith high energy gamma-ray flares and they have attracted considerable\nattention, as they could allow one to probe the magnetic field structure in the\ngamma-ray emitting region of the jet. The flat-spectrum radio quasar 3C279 is\none of the most prominent examples showing this behaviour. Our goal is to study\nthe observed EVPA rotations and to distinguish between a stochastic and a\ndeterministic origin of the polarization variability. We have combined multiple\ndata sets of R-band photometry and optical polarimetry measurements of 3C279,\nyielding exceptionally well-sampled flux density and polarization curves that\ncover a period of 2008-2012. Several large EVPA rotations are identified in the\ndata. We introduce a quantitative measure for the EVPA curve smoothness, which\nis then used to test a set of simple random walk polarization variability\nmodels against the data. 3C279 shows different polarization variation\ncharacteristics during an optical low-flux state and a flaring state. The\npolarization variation during the flaring state, especially the smooth approx.\n360 degrees rotation of the EVPA in mid-2011, is not consistent with the tested\nstochastic processes. We conclude that during the two different optical flux\nstates, two different processes govern the polarization variation, possibly a\nstochastic process during the low-brightness state and a deterministic process\nduring the flaring activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 12:36:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jun 2016 10:32:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

Polarimetric observations of Bok globules frequently show a decrease\nin the degree of polarization towards their central dense regions (polarization\nholes). This behaviour is usually explained with increased disalignment owing\nto high density and temperature, or insufficient angular resolution of a\npossibly complex magnetic field structure.\n  Aims. We investigate whether a significant decrease in polarized emission of\ndense regions in Bok globules is possible under certain physical conditions.\nFor instance, we evaluate the impact of optical depth effects and various\nproperties of the dust phase.\n  Methods. We use radiative transfer modelling to calculate the temperature\nstructure of an analytical Bok globule model and simulate the polarized thermal\nemission of elongated dust grains. For the alignment of the dust grains, we\nconsider a magnetic field and include radiative torque and internal alignment.\n  Results. Besides the usual explanations, selected conditions of the\ntemperature and density distribution, the dust phase and the magnetic field are\nalso able to significantly decrease the polarized emission of dense regions in\nBok globules.

We embed the\n$d$-dimensional joint distribution and the product of the marginals into a\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space and define the $d$-variable Hilbert-Schmidt\nindependence criterion (dHSIC) as the squared distance between the embeddings.\nIn the population case, the value of dHSIC is zero if and only if the $d$\nvariables are jointly independent, as long as the kernel is characteristic.\nBased on an empirical estimate of dHSIC, we define three different\nnon-parametric hypothesis tests: a permutation test, a bootstrap test and a\ntest based on a Gamma approximation. We prove that the permutation test\nachieves the significance level and that the bootstrap test achieves pointwise\nasymptotic significance level as well as pointwise asymptotic consistency\n(i.e., it is able to detect any type of fixed dependence in the large sample\nlimit).

During 1996-2011, that wave was highly stable in\namplitude and waveform, resembling the orbital wave commonly seen in supersoft\nbinaries. The period, however, was found to increase on a timescale\nP/P-dot=3x10^5 years. This suggests a mass transfer rate in quiescence of\n~10^-7 M_sol/yr, in substantial agreement with the accretion rate based on the\nstar's luminosity. This is ~2000x greater than is typical for cataclysmic\nvariables of that orbital period. During the post-eruption quiescence\n(2012-2016), the star continued on its merry but mysterious way - similar\nluminosity, similar P/P-dot (2.4x10^5 years).\n  The orbital signal became vanishingly weak (<0.003 mag) near maximum light of\nthe 2011 eruption. By day 170 of the eruption, near V=11, the orbital signal\nreappeared with an amplitude of 0.005 mag. It then gradually strengthened to\nits normal 0.08 mag amplitude, as the star declined to its \"quiescent\"\nmagnitude of 15.7. During the ~1 year of invisibility and low amplitude, the\norbital signal had increased in period by 0.0054(7)%. This is probably a\nmeasure of the mass ejected in the nova outburst. For a plausible choice of\nbinary parameters, that mass is at least 3x10^-5 M_sol, and probably more. This\nrepresents >300 years of accretion at the pre-outburst rate, but the time\nbetween outbursts was only 45 years. Thus the erupting white dwarf seems to\nhave ejected at least 6x more mass than it accreted. If this eruption is\ntypical, the white dwarf must be eroding, rather than growing, in mass.

We propose a \"semantics workbench\" with fully\nand semi-automatic tools for SCOOP, that can be used to analyse and compare\nprograms with respect to different execution models. We demonstrate its use in\nchecking the consistency of semantics by applying it to a set of representative\nprograms, and highlighting a deadlock-related discrepancy between the principal\nexecution models of the language. Our workbench is based on a modular and\nparameterisable graph transformation semantics implemented in the GROOVE tool.\nWe discuss how graph transformations are leveraged to atomically model\nintricate language abstractions, and how the visual yet algebraic nature of the\nmodel can be used to ascertain soundness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 15:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-24"}

We\ncompare our data to model calculations.\n  Results: One-proton removal cross sections with different final neutron\nnumbers (1pxn) for relativistic 10,12-18C and 10-15B isotopes impinging on a\ncarbon target. Comparing model calculations to the data, we find that EPAX is\nnot able to describe the data satisfactorily. Using ABRABLA07 on the other\nhand, we find that the average excitation energy per abraded nucleon needs to\nbe decreased from 27 MeV to 8.1 MeV. With that decrease ABRABLA07 describes the\ndata surprisingly well.\n  Conclusions: Extending the available data towards light unstable nuclei with\na consistent set of new data have allowed for a systematic investigation of the\nrole of the excitation energy induced in projectile fragmentation. Most\nstriking is the apparent mass dependence of the average excitation energy per\nabraded nucleon. Nevertheless, this parameter, which has been related to\nfinal-state interactions, requires further study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 15:33:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2016 09:31:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}

We compute pre-main-sequence tracks for massive and\nintermediate-mass stars with variable accretion rates and study the evolution\nof stellar radius, effective temperature and ionizing luminosity, starting at\n$2\\,M_\\odot$ with convective or radiative structures. The radiative case shows\na much stronger swelling of the protostar for high accretion rates than the\nconvective case. For radiative structures, the star is very sensitive to the\naccretion rate and reacts quickly to accretion bursts, leading to considerable\nchanges in photospheric properties on timescales as short as 100 - 1000 yr. The\nevolution for convective structures is much less influenced by the\ninstantaneous accretion rate, and produces a monotonically increasing ionizing\nflux that can be many orders of magnitude smaller than in the radiative case.\nFor massive stars, it results in a delay of the HII region expansion by up to\n10,000 yr. In the radiative case, the HII region can potentially be engulfed by\nthe star during the swelling, which never happens in the convective case. We\nconclude that the early stellar structure has a large impact on the radiative\nfeedback during the pre-main-sequence evolution of massive protostars and\nintroduces an important uncertainty that should be taken into account.

We show that both LZ and\nETC complexity measures are able to differentiate between young and old\nsubjects with only 10 data samples while ApEn requires at least 15 data\nsamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 05:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-03-03"}

Because coefficients are typically multiplicative in real space, they\nturn into convolution operators in spectral space, mixing all wavenumbers.\nHowever, in many applications, only the largest scales of the solution are of\ninterest and so the question turns to whether it is possible to build effective\ncoarse-scale models of the coefficients in such a manner that the large scales\nof the solution are left intact. Here we apply the method of numerical\nhomogenization to deterministic linear equations to generate sub-grid-scale\nmodels of coefficients at desired frequency cutoffs. We use the Fourier basis\nto project, filter and compute correctors for the coefficients. The method is\ntested in 1D and 2D scenarios and found to reproduce the coarse scales of the\nsolution to varying degrees of accuracy depending on the cutoff. We relate this\nmethod to mode-elimination Renormalization Group (RG) and discuss the\nconnection between accuracy and the cutoff wavenumber. The tradeoff is governed\nby a form of the uncertainty principle for convolutions, which states that as\nthe convolution operator is squeezed in the spectral domain, it broadens in\nreal space. As a consequence, basis sparsity is a high virtue and the choice of\nthe basis can be critical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Feb 2016 17:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

However, when the total computation\nprocess is large, it is not easy to guarantee the whole system when we have\nscaling effects, unexpected noise, or unaccounted correlations between several\nsubsystems. If we do not trust the measurement basis nor the prepared entangled\nstate, we do need to be worried about such uncertainties. To this end, we\nproposes a \"self-guaranteed\" protocol for verification of quantum computation\nunder the scheme of measurement-based quantum computation where no\nprior-trusted devices (measurement basis nor entangled state) are needed. The\napproach we present enables the implementation of verifiable quantum\ncomputation using the measurement-based model in the context of a particular\ninstance of delegated quantum computation where the server prepares the initial\ncomputational resource and sends it to the client who drives the computation by\nsingle-qubit measurements. Applying self-testing procedures we are able to\nverify the initial resource as well as the operation of the quantum devices,\nand hence the computation itself. The overhead of our protocol scales as the\nsize of the initial resource state to the power of 4 times the natural\nlogarithm of the initial state's size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2016 02:19:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 01:08:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 02:36:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}
