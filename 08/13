The bottom-up approach starts with\nforming an effective Ashcroft-Born-Mayer interatomic potential based on\nBoltzmann inversion of the radial distribution function g(r) and on fitting the\nshort-range part of $g(r)$ by means of a simple power-law approximation. The\npower exponent $\\lambda$ represents a global repulsion steepness parameter. A\nscaling relation between atomic connectivity and packing fraction $Z \\sim\n\\phi^{1+\\lambda}$ is derived. This relation is then implemented in a\nlattice-dynamical model for the high-frequency shear modulus where the\nattractive anharmonic part of the effective interaction is taken into account\nthrough the thermal expansion coefficient which maps the $\\phi$-dependence into\na $T$-dependence. The shear modulus as a function of temperature calculated in\nthis way is then used within the cooperative shear model of the glass\ntransition to yield the viscosity of the supercooled melt as a\ndouble-exponential function of $T$ across the entire Angell plot. The model,\nwhich has only one adjustable parameter (the characteristic atomic volume for\nhigh-frequency cage deformation) is tested against new experimental data of\nZrCu alloys and provides an excellent one-parameter description of the\nviscosity down to the glass transition temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2016 16:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-15"}

Estimates of volatile\nextraction from the asthenosphere beneath ridges typically rely on measurements\nof undegassed lavas combined with simple petrogenetic models of the mean degree\nof melting. Estimated volatile fluxes have large uncertainties; this is partly\ndue to a poor understanding of how volatiles are transported by magma in the\nasthenosphere. Here, we assess the fate of mantle volatiles through numerical\nsimulations of melting and melt transport at mid-ocean ridges. Our simulations\nare based on two-phase, magma/mantle dynamics theory coupled to idealised\nthermodynamic model of mantle melting in the presence of water and carbon\ndioxide. We combine simulation results with catalogued observations of all\nridge segments to estimate a range of likely volatile output from the global\nmid-ocean ridge system. We thus predict global MOR crust production of 66-73\nGt/yr (22-24 km3/yr) and global volatile output of 52-110 Mt/yr, corresponding\nto mantle volatile contents of 100--200~ppm. We find that volatile extraction\nis limited: up to half of deep, volatile-rich melt is not focused to the axis\nbut is rather deposited along the LAB.

Both stability under perturbation as well as asymptotic\nconsistency (i.e., convergence with probability $1$ as the sample size goes to\ninfinity under a fixed probability model) follow from our notion of structural\nconsistency. By formulating structural consistency as a continuity result on\nthe graphon space, we obtain robust results that are completely independent of\nthe data generating mechanism. In particular, our results apply in settings\nwhere observations are not independent, thereby significantly generalizing the\ncommon probabilistic approach where data are assumed to be i.i.d.\n  In order to make precise the notion of structural consistency of graph\npartitioning, we begin by extending the theory of graph limits to include\nvertex colored graphons.

Since most of the elements visible in\nX-rays are formed by type Ia (SNIa) and/or core-collapse (SNcc) supernovae,\nmeasuring their abundances gives us direct information on the nucleosynthesis\nproducts of billions of SNe since the epoch of the star formation peak (z~2-3).\nIn this study, we compare the most accurate average X/Fe abundance ratios\n(compiled in a previous work from XMM-Newton EPIC and RGS observations of 44\ngalaxy clusters, groups, and ellipticals), representative of the chemical\nenrichment in the nearby ICM, to various SNIa and SNcc nucleosynthesis models\nfound in the literature. The use of a SNcc model combined to any favoured\nstandard SNIa model (deflagration or delayed-detonation) fails to reproduce our\nabundance pattern. In particular, the Ca/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios are significantly\nunderestimated by the models. We show that the Ca/Fe ratio can be reproduced\nbetter, either by taking a SNIa delayed-detonation model that matches the\nobservations of the Tycho supernova remnant, or by adding a contribution from\nthe Ca-rich gap transient SNe, whose material should easily mix into the hot\nICM. On the other hand, the Ni/Fe ratio can be reproduced better by assuming\nthat both deflagration and delayed-detonation SNIa contribute in similar\nproportions to the ICM enrichment. In either case, the fraction of SNIa over\nthe total number of SNe (SNIa+SNcc) contributing to the ICM enrichment ranges\nwithin 29-45%. This fraction is found to be systematically higher than the\ncorresponding SNIa/SNe fraction contributing to the enrichment of the\nproto-solar environnement (15-25%). We also discuss and quantify two useful\nconstraints on both SNIa and SNcc that can be inferred from the ICM abundance\nratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2016 19:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-16"}

However, the fundamental question of how\nferroic domains switch, i.e. how the polarization changes from one state to\nanother, is yet to be answered fully. There are contradicting models and a wide\nbody of accumulated data which disagree as to whether the switching requires\ndomain nucleation. Moreover, ferroelectric domains switch under electric fields\nthat are supposedly too weak to form nucleation sites, indicating that the\nlevel of disorder seen in real systems plays an important role. This\nlongstanding so-called Landauer's paradox is the ferroelectric equivalent to\nthe absence of raindrop formation in a dust-free vacuum, leading to\nsupersaturated vapors that cannot exist otherwise, e.g. in spinodal\ndecompositions or inhomogeneous nucleation environments. Here we show that\npolarization switching in ferroelectric-ferroelastic systems comprises domain\ntypes that differ by symmetry, lengthscale and switching energy. These domains\nswitch simultaneously thanks to intermediate-range order of organized pinning\nsites, supporting the previously-unexplained coexistence of\nnucleation-and-growth and nucleation-frustrated mechanisms. Our treatment is\napplicable to other Kolmogorov-Avrami systems with multi-scale phase\ntransitions. Finally, we demonstrate augmented electromechanical coupling based\non the collective motion of pinning sites, which is promising for nano\nelectro-mechanical and low-power switching devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2016 19:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-15"}

In a series of\nrecent papers, we have developed the local, linear theory of these\ninstabilities and addressed their non-linear development with a modified\nversion of Athena. Here, we extend our study by developing a quasi-global\napproach that we use to simulate the mixing of helium as induced by\ngeneralizations of the heat-flux-driven buoyancy instability (HBI) and the\nmagneto-thermal instability (MTI), which feed off thermal and composition\ngradients.

Although MHD waves have been\nobserved in the solar atmosphere, there are a lack of quantitative estimates on\nthe energy transfer and dissipation in the atmosphere. We performed\nsimultaneous Hinode and IRIS observations of a sunspot umbra to derive the\nupward energy fluxes at two different atmospheric layers (photosphere and lower\ntransition region) and estimate the energy dissipation. The observations\nrevealed some properties of the observed periodic oscillations in physical\nquantities, such as their phase relations, temporal behaviors, and power\nspectra, making a conclusion that standing slow-mode waves are dominant at the\nphotosphere with their high-frequency leakage, which is observed as upward\nwaves at the chromosphere and the lower transition region.

The difference between the energy fluxes is larger\nthan the energy required to maintain the chromosphere in the sunspot umbrae,\nsuggesting that the observed waves can make a crucial contribution to the\nheating of the chromosphere in the sunspot umbrae. In contrast, the upward\nenergy flux derived at the lower transition region level is smaller than the\nenergy flux required for heating the corona, implying that we may need another\nheating mechanism.

In optimization, BCU first appears as the\ncoordinate descent method that works well for smooth problems or those with\nseparable nonsmooth terms and/or separable constraints. As nonseparable\nconstraints exist, BCU can be applied under primal-dual settings.\n  In the literature, it has been shown that for weakly convex problems with\nnonseparable linear constraint, BCU with fully Gauss-Seidel updating rule may\nfail to converge and that with fully Jacobian rule can converge sublinearly.\nHowever, empirically the method with Jacobian update is usually slower than\nthat with Gauss-Seidel rule. To maintain their advantages, we propose a hybrid\nJacobian and Gauss-Seidel BCU method for solving linearly constrained\nmulti-block structured convex programming, where the objective may have a\nnonseparable quadratic term and separable nonsmooth terms. At each primal block\nvariable update, the method approximates the augmented Lagrangian function at\nan affine combination of the previous two iterates, and the affinely mixing\nmatrix with desired nice properties can be chosen through solving a\nsemidefinite programming. We show that the hybrid method enjoys the theoretical\nconvergence guarantee as Jacobian BCU. In addition, we numerically demonstrate\nthat the method can perform as well as Gauss-Seidel method and better than a\nrecently proposed randomized primal-dual BCU method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2016 00:30:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Jan 2018 13:48:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-04"}

To account for the observed millisecond pulses caused by scatter\nbroadening, we examine a variety of possible models of electron density\nfluctuations in both the IGM and the host galaxy medium. We find that a\nshort-wave-dominated power-law spectrum of density, which may arise in highly\nsupersonic turbulence with pronounced local dense structures of\nshock-compressed gas in the host interstellar medium (ISM), can produce the\nrequired density enhancements at sufficiently small scales to interpret the\nscattering timescale of FRBs. It implies that an FRB residing in a galaxy with\nefficient star formation in action tends to have a broadened pulse. The scaling\nof the scattering time with dispersion measure (DM) in the host galaxy varies\nin different turbulence and scattering regimes. The host galaxy can be the\nmajor origin of scatter broadening, but contribute to a small fraction of the\ntotal DM. We also find that the sheet-like structure of density in the host ISM\nassociated with folded magnetic fields in a viscosity-dominated regime of\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence cannot give rise to strong scattering.\nFurthermore, valuable insights into the IGM turbulence concerning the detailed\nspatial structure of density and magnetic field can be gained from the observed\nscattering timescale of FRBs.

These schemes above significantly reduce the transmission rate\n$R$, compared with the uncoded caching scheme. However, to implement the new\nschemes, each file should be cut into $F$ pieces, where $F$ increases\nexponentially with the number of users $K$. Such constraint is obviously\ninfeasible in the practical setting, especially when $K$ is large. Thus it is\ndesirable to design caching schemes with constant rate $R$ (independent of $K$)\nas well as small $F$.\n  In this paper we view the centralized coded caching problem in a hypergraph\nperspective and show that designing a feasible placement delivery array is\nequivalent to constructing a linear and (6, 3)-free 3-uniform 3-partite\nhypergraph.

Accurate identification of pathological features requires\ndiagnostic quality CT images with minimal noise and artifact variation. In this\nwork, a novel Fourier-transform based metric for image quality (IQ) estimation\nis presented that correlates to additive CT image noise. In the proposed\nmethod, two windowed CT image subset regions are analyzed together to identify\nthe extent of variation in the corresponding Fourier-domain spectrum. The two\nsquare windows are chosen such that their center pixels coincide and one window\nis a subset of the other. The Fourier-domain spectral difference between these\ntwo sub-sampled windows is then used to isolate spatial regions-of-interest\n(ROI) with low signal variation (ROI-LV) and high signal variation (ROI-HV),\nrespectively. Finally, the spatial variance ($var$), standard deviation\n($std$), coefficient of variance ($cov$) and the fraction of abdominal ROI\npixels in ROI-LV ($\\nu'(q)$), are analyzed with respect to CT image noise. For\nthe phantom CT images, $var$ and $std$ correlate to CT image noise ($|r|>0.76$\n($p\\ll0.001$)), though not as well as $\\nu'(q)$ ($r=0.96$ ($p\\ll0.001$)).\nHowever, for the combined phantom and patient CT images, $var$ and $std$ do not\ncorrelate well with CT image noise ($|r|<0.46$ ($p\\ll0.001$)) as compared to\n$\\nu'(q)$ ($r=0.95$ ($p\\ll0.001$)).

To characterize the\nquantum states of this composite system we consider linear entropy for the\nreduced density matrix of polarization with the intention to exploit its direct\nrelation with the photons degree of polarization. Accordingly, the minimum\ndegree of polarization of X-ray radiation located in the transition region of\nthe accretion disk indicates a high value of the linear entropy for the photons\nemitted on this region, inferring a high degree of entanglement in the\ncomposite system. We emphasize that for an extreme rotating black hole in the\nthermal state, the photons with energies at the thermal peak are maximally\nentangled in polarization and orbital angular momentum, leading to the creation\nof all four Bell states.
