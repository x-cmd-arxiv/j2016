In this paper, we make some concrete\nalgorithmic progress for the above demixing problem.

In both cases, we provide fast algorithms for\nrecovery of the constituents $w$ and $z$ from the observations. Moreover, we\nsupport these algorithms with a rigorous theoretical analysis, and derive\n(nearly) tight upper bounds on the sample complexity of the proposed algorithms\nfor achieving stable recovery of the component signals.

Words are assigned to clusters based on their usage pattern in a\ngiven corpus. The resulting clusters and hierarchical structure can be used in\nconstructing class-based language models and for generating features to be used\nin NLP tasks. Because of its high computational cost, the most-used version of\nBrown clustering is a greedy algorithm that uses a window to restrict its\nsearch space. Like other clustering algorithms, Brown clustering finds a\nsub-optimal, but nonetheless effective, mapping of words to clusters. Because\nof its ability to produce high-quality, human-understandable cluster, Brown\nclustering has seen high uptake the NLP research community where it is used in\nthe preprocessing and feature generation steps.\n  Little research has been done towards improving the quality of Brown\nclusters, despite the greedy and heuristic nature of the algorithm. The\napproaches tried so far have focused on: studying the effect of the\ninitialisation in a similar algorithm; tuning the parameters used to define the\ndesired number of clusters and the behaviour of the algorithm; and including a\nseparate parameter to differentiate the window from the desired number of\nclusters. However, some of these approaches have not yielded significant\nimprovements in cluster quality.\n  In this thesis, a close analysis of the Brown algorithm is provided,\nrevealing important under-specifications and weaknesses in the original\nalgorithm. These have serious effects on cluster quality and reproducibility of\nresearch using Brown clustering. In the second part of the thesis, two\nmodifications are proposed. Finally, a thorough evaluation is performed,\nconsidering both the optimization criterion of Brown clustering and the\nperformance of the resulting class-based language models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2016 16:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-05"}

In this work, we describe property testing algorithms\nfor sparsity that observe a low-dimensional projection of the input.\n  We consider two settings. In the first setting, for a given design matrix A\nin R^{d x m}, we test whether an input vector y in R^d equals Ax for some\nk-sparse unit vector x. Our algorithm projects the input onto O(k \\eps^{-2} log\nm) dimensions, accepts if the property holds, rejects if ||y - Ax|| > \\eps for\nany O(k/\\eps^2)-sparse vector x, and runs in time polynomial in m. Our\nalgorithm is based on the approximate Caratheodory's theorem. Previously known\nalgorithms that solve the problem for arbitrary A with qualitatively similar\nguarantees run in exponential time.\n  In the second setting, the design matrix A is unknown. Given input vectors\ny_1, y_2,...,y_p in R^d whose concatenation as columns forms Y in R^{d x p} ,\nthe goal is to decide whether Y=AX for matrices A in R^{d x m} and X in R^{m x\np} such that each column of X is k-sparse, or whether Y is \"far\" from having\nsuch a decomposition.

Although often\nbeing neglected, this prior knowledge can be systematically exploited to make\nautomated analysis operations sensitive to a desired phenomenon or to evaluate\nextracted content with respect to this prior knowledge. For instance, the\nperformance of processing operators can be greatly enhanced by a more focused\ndetection strategy and the direct information about the ambiguity inherent in\nthe extracted data. We present a new concept for the estimation and propagation\nof uncertainty involved in image analysis operators. This allows using simple\nprocessing operators that are suitable for analyzing large-scale 3D+t\nmicroscopy images without compromising the result quality. On the foundation of\nfuzzy set theory, we transform available prior knowledge into a mathematical\nrepresentation and extensively use it enhance the result quality of various\nprocessing operators. All presented concepts are illustrated on a typical\nbioimage analysis pipeline comprised of seed point detection, segmentation,\nmultiview fusion and tracking. Furthermore, the functionality of the proposed\napproach is validated on a comprehensive simulated 3D+t benchmark data set that\nmimics embryonic development and on large-scale light-sheet microscopy data of\na zebrafish embryo. The general concept introduced in this contribution\nrepresents a new approach to efficiently exploit prior knowledge to improve the\nresult quality of image analysis pipelines.

Yet how\nhuman cooperation is achieved and may persist is still a main puzzle in the\nsocial and biological sciences. Recently, scholars have recognized the\nimportance of social norms as solutions to major local and large-scale\ncollective action problems, from the management of water resources to the\nreduction of smoking in public places to the change in fertility practices. Yet\na well-founded model of the effect of social norms on human cooperation is\nstill lacking. Using statistical physics techniques and integrating findings\nfrom cognitive and behavioral sciences, we present an analytically-tractable\nmodel in which individuals base their decisions to cooperate both on the\neconomic rewards they obtain and on the degree to which their action comply\nwith social norms. Results from this parsimonious model are in agreement with\nwhat has been observed in recent large-scale experiments with humans.

It is also\nknown that AdS3 Einstein gravity has more general black hole solutions than the\nBTZ family which are generically described by two periodic, but otherwise\narbitrary, holomorphic and anti-holomorphic functions.

The consequences of\ndifferentiation on the structure and composition of planets are typically\naddressed considering only the interaction of molten iron with an immiscible\n`rocky' phase. We demonstrate that mixing in a representative system of liquid\nor solid MgO and liquid iron to a single homogeneous liquid occurs at\nsufficiently low temperature to be present in the aftermath of a giant impact.\nApplying the thermodynamic integration technique to density functional theory\nmolecular dynamics simulations, we determine the solvus closure temperature for\nthe Fe-MgO system for pressures up to 400 GPa. Solvus closure occurs at\n$\\sim$4000 K at low pressure, and has a weak positive pressure dependence, such\nthat its gradient with respect to depth is less steep than an adiabatic\ntemperature profile. This predicts a new mode of core-mantle differentiation\nfollowing the most energetic giant impacts, with exsolution of iron from the\nmixture beginning in the outer layers of the planet. We demonstrate that\nhigh-temperature equilibration results in delivery of nominally insoluble\nMg-rich material to the early core. Since MgO is the least soluble major mantle\ncomponent in iron at low temperatures, these results may represent an upper\nbound on temperature for mixing in terrestrial planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2016 19:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-04"}

In this paper, a high-performance\nbelief propagation (BP)-based soft multiple-symbol differential detection\n(MSDD) framework, dubbed BP-MSDD, is proposed with its illustrative application\nin differential space-time block-code (DSTBC)-aided ultra-wideband impulse\nradio (UWB-IR) systems. Firstly, we revisit the signal sampling with the aid of\na trellis structure and decompose the trellis into multiple subtrellises.\nFurthermore, we derive an APP calculation algorithm, in which the\nforward-and-backward message passing mechanism of BP operates on the\nsubtrellises. The proposed BP-MSDD is capable of significantly outperforming\nthe conventional hard-decision MSDDs. However, the computational complexity of\nthe BP-MSDD increases exponentially with the number of MSDD trellis states. To\ncircumvent this excessive complexity for practical implementations, we\nreformulate the BP-MSDD, and additionally propose a Viterbi algorithm\n(VA)-based hard-decision MSDD (VA-HMSDD) and a VA-based soft-decision MSDD\n(VA-SMSDD). Moreover, both the proposed BP-MSDD and VA-SMSDD can be exploited\nin conjunction with soft channel decoding to obtain powerful iterative\ndetection and decoding based receivers.

In this\npaper, we explore a scenario with a new exotic energy density that behaves like\na cosmological constant at early times and then decays quickly at some critical\nredshift $z_c$. An exotic energy density like this is motivated by some\nstring-axiverse-inspired scenarios for dark energy. By increasing the expansion\nrate at early times, the very precisely determined angular scale of the sound\nhorizon at decoupling can be preserved with a larger Hubble constant.

Of special interest is\nthe problem of generating such representations directly from natural language\n(NL) or controlled natural language (CNL). An interesting variation of this\nproblem, and to the best of our knowledge, scarcely explored variation in this\ncontext, is when the input information is inconsistent. In such situations, the\nexisting encodings of word puzzles produce inconsistent representations and\nbreak down. In this paper, we bring the well-known type of paraconsistent\nlogics, called Annotated Predicate Calculus (APC) (Kifer and Lozinskii 1992),\nto bear on the problem. We introduce a new kind of non-monotonic semantics for\nAPC, called consistency preferred stable models and argue that it makes APC\ninto a suitable platform for dealing with inconsistency in word puzzles and,\nmore generally, in NL sentences. We also devise a number of general principles\nto help the user choose among the different representations of NL sentences,\nwhich might seem equivalent but, in fact, behave differently when inconsistent\ninformation is taken into account. These principles can be incorporated into\nexisting CNL translators, such as Attempto Controlled English (ACE) (Fuchs et\nal. 2008) and PENG Light (White and Schwitter 2009).

The most\npopular solution for our dynamic settings is Consistent Hashing. However, the\nload balancing of consistent hashing is no better than a random assignment of\nclients to servers, so with $n$ of each, we expect many servers to be\noverloaded with $\\Theta(\\log n/ \\log\\log n)$ clients.

Infinite energy\nsolutions of this equation preserve a natural Gibbsian invariant measure and\nwhen the potential is double-welled, for example when $V(u) =\n\\tfrac14(1-u^2)^2$, there is a regime such that two small disjoint sets in the\nsystem's phase-space concentrate most of the mass of this measure. This\nsuggests that the solutions to the nonlinear wave equation can be metastable\nover these sets, in the sense that they spend long periods of time in these\nsets and only rarely transition between them. Here we quantify this phenomenon\nby calculating exactly via Transition State Theory (TST) the mean frequency at\nwhich the solutions of the nonlinear wave equation with initial conditions\ndrawn from its invariant measure cross a dividing surface lying in between the\nmetastable sets. Numerical results suggest that the dynamics of the nonlinear\nwave equation is ergodic and rapidly mixing with respect to the Gibbs invariant\nmeasure when the parameter $\\delta$ in small enough. This is a regime in which\nthe dynamics of the nonlinear wave equation displays a metastable behavior that\nis not fundamentally different from that observed in its stochastic counterpart\nin which random noise and damping terms are added to the equation. For larger\n$\\delta$, however, the dynamics either stops being ergodic, or its mixing time\nbecomes larger than the inverse of the TST frequency, indicating that\nsuccessive transitions between the metastable sets are correlated and the\ncoarse-graining to a Markov chain fails.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2016 21:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

The best precision that can be achieved to estimate the location of\na stellar-like object is a topic of permanent interest in the astrometric\ncommunity.\n  Aims. We analyse bounds for the best position estimation of a stellar-like\nobject on a CCD detector array in a Bayesian setting where the position is\nunknown, but where we have access to a prior distribution. In contrast to a\nparametric setting where we estimate a parameter from observations, the\nBayesian approach estimates a random object (i.e., the position is a random\nvariable) from observations that are statistically dependent on the position.\n  Methods. We characterize the Bayesian Cramer-Rao (CR) that bounds the minimum\nmean square error (MMSE) of the best estimator of the position of a point\nsource on a linear CCD-like detector, as a function of the properties of\ndetector, the source, and the background.\n  Results. We quantify and analyse the increase in astrometric performance from\nthe use of a prior distribution of the object position, which is not available\nin the classical parametric setting.

Perhaps surprisingly, very little is known about low-distortion\nembeddings for quasimetric spaces.\n  Random embeddings into ultrametric spaces are arguably one of the most\nsuccessful geometric tools in the context of algorithm design. We extend this\nto the quasimetric case as follows. We show that any $n$-point quasimetric\nspace supported on a graph of treewidth $t$ admits a random embedding into\nquasiultrametric spaces with distortion $O(t \\log^2 n)$, where\nquasiultrametrics are a natural generalization of ultrametrics. This result\nallows us to obtain $t\\log^{O(1)} n$-approximation algorithms for the Directed\nNon-Bipartite Sparsest-Cut and the Directed Multicut problems on $n$-vertex\ngraphs of treewidth $t$, with running time polynomial in both $n$ and $t$.\n  The above results are obtained by considering a generalization of random\npartitions to the quasimetric case, which we refer to as random\nquasipartitions. Using this definition and a construction of [Chuzhoy and\nKhanna 2009] we derive a polynomial lower bound on the distortion of random\nembeddings of general quasimetric spaces into quasiultrametric spaces. Finally,\nwe establish a lower bound for embedding the shortest-path quasimetric of a\ngraph $G$ into graphs that exclude $G$ as a minor.

The information of the\nevent asymmetry allows us to isolate and study the effect of longitudinal\nasymmetry on rapidity distribution of final state particles. In a Monte Carlo\nGlauber model the average rapidity-shift is found to be almost linearly related\nto the asymmetry. Using toy models, as well as Monte Carlo data for Pb-Pb\ncollisions at 2.76 TeV generated with HIJING, two different versions of AMPT\nand DPMJET models, we demonstrate that the effect of asymmetry on final state\nrapidity distribution can be quantitatively related to the average rapidity\nshift via a third-order polynomial with a dominantly linear term.

These have\nbeen suggested to result from dynamics in a superficial thin weather-layer, or\nalternatively be a manifestation of deep interior cylindrical flows. However,\nit is possible that the observed winds are indeed superficial, yet there exists\ndeep flow that is completely decoupled from it. To date, all models linking the\nwind, via the induced density anomalies, to the gravity field, to be measured\nby Juno, consider only flow that is a projection of the observed could-level\nwind. Here we explore the possibility of complex wind dynamics that include\nboth the shallow weather-layer wind, and a deep flow that is decoupled from the\nflow above it. The upper flow is based on the observed cloud-level flow and is\nset to decay with depth. The deep flow is constructed to produce cylindrical\nstructures with variable width and magnitude, thus allowing for a wide range of\npossible scenarios for the unknown deep flow. The combined flow is then related\nto the density anomalies and gravitational moments via a dynamical model. An\nadjoint inverse model is used for optimizing the parameters controlling the\nsetup of the deep and surface-bound flows, so that these flows can be\nreconstructed given a gravity field. We show that the model can be used for\nexamination of various scenarios, including cases in which the deep flow is\ndominating over the surface wind. We discuss extensively the uncertainties\nassociated with the model solution. The flexibility of the adjoint method\nallows for a wide range of dynamical setups, so that when new observations and\nphysical understanding will arise, these constraints could be easily\nimplemented and used to better decipher Jupiter flow dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2016 06:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

It has been used for construction of a local\ncurvilinear frame of reference, in which conservation laws for mass, momentum\nand energy can be reduced to effectively-one-dimensional hyperbolic\nconservation law equations. Its utility in global parameter optimization of\ndevice parameters has been demonstrated. These features suggest that the\nGratton-Vargas model deserves a closer look at its supposed limitations near\nthe singular phase of the DPF. This paper presents a discussion of its\ndevelopment near the device axis, based on the original work of Gratton and\nVargas, with some differences. It is shown that the Gratton-Vargas partial\ndifferential equation has solutions for times after the current singularity,\nwhich exhibit an expanding bounded volume, (which can serve as model of an\nexpanding plasma column) and decreasing dynamic inductance of the discharge, in\nspite of having no built-in hydrodynamics. This enables the model to\nqualitatively reproduce the characteristic shape of the current derivative in\nDPF experiments without reference to any plasma phenomena such as\ninstabilities, anomalous resistance or reflection of hydrodynamic shock wave\nfrom the axis. The axial propagation of the solution exhibits a power-law\ndependence on the dimensionless time starting from the time of singularity,\nwhich is similar to the power-law relations predicted by theory of point\nexplosions in ideal gases and which has also been observed experimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2016 06:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-05"}

Existing works on the problem either ignore the label-label and\ninstance-instance correlations or just assume these correlations are linear and\nunstructured.

Many biological fluids and substances are fibrous, having a preferred\ndirection in their microstructure; for example cervical mucus is formed of\npolymer molecules which create an oriented fibrous network. Moreover,\nsuspensions of elongated motile cells produce a form of active oriented matter.\nTo understand how these effects modify viscous propulsion, we extend Taylor's\nclassical model of small-amplitude zero-Reynolds-number propulsion of a\n'swimming sheet' via the transversely-isotropic fluid model of Ericksen, which\nis linear in strain rate and possesses a distinguished direction. The energetic\ncosts of swimming are significantly altered by all rheological parameters and\nthe initial fibre angle. Propulsion in a passive transversely-isotropic fluid\nproduces an enhanced mean rate of working, independent of the initial fibre\norientation, with an approximately linear dependence of energetic cost on the\nextensional and shear enhancements to the viscosity caused by fibres. In this\nregime the mean swimming velocity is unchanged from the Newtonian case. The\neffect of the constant term in Ericksen's model for the stress, which can be\nidentified as a fibre tension or alternatively a stresslet characterising an\nactive fluid, is also considered. This stress introduces an angular dependence\nand dramatically changes the streamlines and flow field; fibres aligned with\nthe swimming direction increase the energetic demands of the sheet. The\nconstant fibre stress may result in a reversal of the mean swimming velocity\nand a negative mean rate of working if sufficiently large relative to the other\nrheological parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2016 07:58:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 00:03:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

The majority of the ABC methods rely on the choice of\na set of summary statistics to reduce the dimension of the data. However, as\nhas been noted in the ABC literature, the lack of convergence guarantees that\nis induced by the absence of a vector of sufficient summary statistics that\nassures inter-model sufficiency over the set of competing models, hinders the\nuse of the usual ABC methods when applied to Bayesian model selection or\nassessment. In this paper, we present a novel ABC model selection procedure for\ndynamical systems based on a newly appeared multi-level Markov chain Monte\nCarlo method, self-regulating ABC-SubSim, and a hierarchical state-space\nformulation of dynamic models. We show that this formulation makes it possible\nto independently approximate the model evidence required for assessing the\nposterior probability of each of the competing models. We also show that\nABC-SubSim not only provides an estimate of the model evidence as a simple\nby-product but also it gives the posterior probability of each model as a\nfunction of the tolerance level, which allows the ABC model choices made in\nprevious studies to be understood. We illustrate the performance of the\nproposed framework for ABC model updating and model class selection by applying\nit to two problems in Bayesian system identification: a single\ndegree-of-freedom bilinear hysteretic oscillator and a three-story shear\nbuilding with Masing hysteresis, both of which are subject to a seismic\nexcitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2016 08:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-05"}

The first\nproblem treated and solved is its correct definition, with different\ncharacterizations, as a skew-adjoint operator on a star graph, a set of lines\nconnecting at a common vertex representing, for example, a network of branching\nchannels.

Due to a\ncombination of the high-precision measurement requirements of the mission and\nthe predicted proton environment at L2, the effect of non-ionizing radiation\ndamage on the detectors was early identified pre-launch as potentially imposing\na major limitation on the scientific value of the data. In this paper we\ncompare pre-flight radiation-induced Charge Transfer Inefficiency (CTI)\npredictions against in-flight measurements, focusing especially on charge\ninjection diagnostics, as well as correlating these CTI diagnostic results with\nsolar proton event data. We show that L2-directed solar activity has been\nrelatively low since launch, and radiation damage (so far) is less than\noriginally expected. Despite this, there are clear cases of correlation between\nearth-directed solar coronal mass ejection events and abrupt changes in CTI\ndiagnostics over time.

We examine the possible\nreasons for the lower than expected levels of CTI as well as examining the\neffect of controlled payload heating events on the CTI diagnostics.\nRadiation-induced CTI in the CCD serial registers and effects of ionizing\nradiation are also correspondingly lower than expected, however these topics\nare not examined here in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2016 09:16:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

The study is\nperformed within the fully self-consistent quasiparticle\nrandom-phase-approximation (QRPA) method based on the Skyrme functional. Two\nSkyrme forces, one with a large (SV-bas) and one with a small (SkP) nuclear\nincompressibility, are considered. The calculations confirm earlier results\nthat, due to the deformation-induced E0-E2 coupling, the isoscalar E0 resonance\nattains a double-peak structure and significant energy upshift. Our results are\ncompared with available analytic estimations. Unlike earlier studies, we get a\nsmaller energy difference between the lower and upper peaks and thus a stronger\nE0-E2 coupling.

Small-scale\nfeatures, such as Rapid Redshifted and Blueshifted Excursions, appearing as\nhigh speed jets in the wings of the H$\\alpha$ line, are characterized by short\nlifetimes and rapid fading without any descending behavior. To study the\ntheoretical aspects of their stability without considering their formation\nmechanism, we model chromospheric jets as twisted magnetic flux tubes moving\nalong their axis, and use the ideal linear incompressible magnetohydrodynamic\napproximation to derive the governing dispersion equation. Analytical solutions\nof the dispersion equation indicate that this type of jet is unstable to\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI), with a very short (few seconds) instability\ngrowth time at high upflow speeds. The generated vortices and unresolved\nturbulent flows associated with the KHI could be observed as broadening of\nchromospheric spectral lines.

A natural color transfer not\nonly matches the color styles but also prevents after-transfer artifacts due to\nimage compression, noise, and gradient smoothness change. The recently\ndiscovered color homography theorem proves that colors across a change in\nphotometric viewing condition are related by a homography. In this paper, we\npropose a color-homography-based color transfer decomposition which encodes\ncolor transfer as a combination of chromaticity shift and shading adjustment. A\npowerful form of shading adjustment is shown to be a global shading curve by\nwhich the same shading homography can be applied elsewhere. Our experiments\nshow that the proposed color transfer decomposition provides a very close\napproximation to many popular color transfer methods. The advantage of our\napproach is that the learned color transfer can be applied to many other images\n(e.g. other frames in a video), instead of a frame-to-frame basis. We\ndemonstrate two applications for color transfer enhancement and video color\ngrading re-application. This simple model of color transfer is also important\nfor future color transfer algorithm design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2016 11:54:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-05"}

Previous offline integration methods usually\nface two challenges: 1. if most of the candidate saliency models misjudge the\nsaliency on an image, the integration result will lean heavily on those\ninferior candidate models; 2. an unawareness of the ground truth saliency\nlabels brings difficulty in estimating the expertise of each candidate model.\nTo address these problems, in this paper, we propose an arbitrator model (AM)\nfor saliency integration. Firstly, we incorporate the consensus of multiple\nsaliency models and the external knowledge into a reference map to effectively\nrectify the misleading by candidate models. Secondly, our quest for ways of\nestimating the expertise of the saliency models without ground truth labels\ngives rise to two distinct online model-expertise estimation methods. Finally,\nwe derive a Bayesian integration framework to reconcile the saliency models of\nvarying expertise and the reference map. To extensively evaluate the proposed\nAM model, we test twenty-seven state-of-the-art saliency models, covering both\ntraditional and deep learning ones, on various combinations over four datasets.\nThe evaluation results show that the AM model improves the performance\nsubstantially compared to the existing state-of-the-art integration methods,\nregardless of the chosen candidate saliency models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2016 13:54:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2018 12:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-30"}

One of the standard methods is to use query translation from source\nto target language. In this paper, we propose an approach based on word\nembeddings, a method that captures contextual clues for a particular word in\nthe source language and gives those words as translations that occur in a\nsimilar context in the target language. Once we obtain the word embeddings of\nthe source and target language pairs, we learn a projection from source to\ntarget word embeddings, making use of a dictionary with word translation\npairs.We then propose various methods of query translation and aggregation. The\nadvantage of this approach is that it does not require the corpora to be\naligned (which is difficult to obtain for resource-scarce languages), a\ndictionary with word translation pairs is enough to train the word vectors for\ntranslation. We experiment with Forum for Information Retrieval and Evaluation\n(FIRE) 2008 and 2012 datasets for Hindi to English CLIR. The proposed word\nembedding based approach outperforms the basic dictionary based approach by 70%\nand when the word embeddings are combined with the dictionary, the hybrid\napproach beats the baseline dictionary based method by 77%.

Modelling the whole range of\nthe losses using a standard distribution is usually very hard and often\nimpossible due to the specific characteristics of the body and the tail of the\nloss distribution. A possible solution is to combine two distributions in a\nsplicing model: a light-tailed distribution for the body which covers light and\nmoderate losses, and a heavy-tailed distribution for the tail to capture large\nlosses. We propose a splicing model with a mixed Erlang (ME) distribution for\nthe body and a Pareto distribution for the tail. This combines the flexibility\nof the ME distribution with the ability of the Pareto distribution to model\nextreme values. We extend our splicing approach for censored and/or truncated\ndata.

Investigating the complex dynamics of shear flows\nrequires numerical calculations that provide a long time evolution of the\nsystem. To achieve a sufficiently long lifetime in a local numerical model the\nsystem has to be forced externally. However, at present, there exist several\ndifferent forcing methods to sustain large-scale shear flows in local models.\nIn this paper we examine and compare various methods used in the literature in\norder to resolve their respective applicability and limitations.

A linear stability\nanalysis provides reference for the growth rate of the most unstable modes in\nthe system and a detailed analysis of the energetics provides a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the energy exchange during the system's evolution.
