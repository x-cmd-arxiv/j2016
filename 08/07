Therefore, to crack a password an attacker needs\nto guess a hash function input that is mapped to the hashed value, as opposed\nto the password itself. We call a hash function that maps the same number of\ninputs to each bin, as \\textbf{unbiased}. However, cryptographic hash functions\nin use have not been proven to be unbiased (i.e., they may have an unequal\nnumber of inputs mapped to different bins). A cryptographic hash function has\nthe property that it is computationally difficult to find an input mapped to a\nbin. In this work we introduce a structured notion of biased hash functions for\nwhich we analyze the average guesswork under certain types of brute force\nattacks. This work shows that the level of security depends on the set of\nhashed values of valid users as well as the statistical profile of a hash\nfunction, resulting from bias. We examine the average guesswork conditioned on\nthe set of hashed values, and model the statistical profile through the\nempirical distribution of the number of inputs that are mapped to a bin. In\nparticular, we focus on a class of statistical profiles (capturing the bias) ,\nwhich we call type-class statistical profiles, that has an empirical\ndistribution related to the probability of the type classes defined in the\nmethod of types. For such profiles, we show that the average guesswork is\nrelated to basic measures in information theory such as entropy and divergence.\nWe use this to show that the effect of bias on the conditional average\nguesswork is limited compared to other system parameters such as the number of\nvalid users who store their hashed passwords in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2016 17:45:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2016 01:13:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2017 22:13:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 07:29:42 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 3 Mar 2019 21:26:22 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 06:56:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-28"}

By assigning interpretations to\nphenomena, from observers to observed, we may approach a simple description of\nknowledge-based functional systems, with direct practical utility. The focus is\nespecially on the interpretation of concepts, associative knowledge, and\ncontext awareness. The inference seems to be that most if not all of these\nconcepts emerge from purely semantic spacetime properties, which opens the\npossibility for a more generalized understanding of what constitutes a\nlearning, or even `intelligent' system.\n  Some key principles emerge for effective knowledge representation: 1)\nseparation of spacetime scales, 2) the recurrence of four irreducible types of\nassociation, by which intent propagates: aggregation, causation, cooperation,\nand similarity, 3) the need for discrimination of identities (discrete), which\nis assisted by distinguishing timeline simultaneity from sequential events, and\n4) the ability to learn (memory). It is at least plausible that emergent\nknowledge abstraction capabilities have their origin in basic spacetime\nstructures.\n  These notes present a unified view of mostly well-known results; they allow\nus to see information models, knowledge representations, machine learning, and\nsemantic networking (transport and information base) in a common framework. The\nnotion of `smart spaces' thus encompasses artificial systems as well as living\nsystems, across many different scales, e.g. smart cities and organizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2016 08:35:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 10:39:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 16:36:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 11:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

That state was recently termed\n\"type-1.5\" superconductivity. This breakdown of type-1/type-2 dichotomy is\nrather generic near a phase transition between superconducting states with\ndifferent symmetries. The examples include the transitions between $U(1)$ and\n$U(1)\\times U(1)$ states or between $U(1)$ and $U(1)\\times Z_2$ states. The\nlater example is realized in systems that feature transition between s-wave and\n$s+is$ states. The extra fundamental length scales have many physical\nconsequences. In particular in these regimes vortices can attract one another\nat long range but repel at shorter ranges. Such a system can form vortex\nclusters in low magnetic fields. The vortex clustering in the type-1.5 regime\ngives rise to many physical effects, ranging from macroscopic phase separation\nin domains of different broken symmetries, to unusual transport properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2016 12:47:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2017 08:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

In particular, previous calculations\nhave shown that fast rotating neutron stars, when subjected to a quark-hadron\nphase transition in their interiors, could give rise to the backbending\nphenomenon characterized by a spin-up era. In this work, we use an equation of\nstate composed of two phases, containing nucleons (and leptons) and quarks. The\nhadronic phase is described in a relativistic mean field formalism that takes\nmany-body forces into account, and the quark phase is described by the MIT bag\nmodel with a vector interaction. Stationary and axi-symmetric stellar models\nare obtained in a self-consistent way by solving numerically the\nEinstein-Maxwell equations by means of a pseudo-spectral method. As a result,\nwe obtain the interesting backbending phenomenon for fast spinning neutron\nstars. More importantly, we show that a magnetic field, which is assumed to be\naxi-symmetric and poloidal, can also be enhanced due to the phase transition\nfrom normal hadronic matter to quark matter on highly magnetized neutron stars.\nTherefore, in parallel to the spin-up era, classes of neutron stars endowed\nwith strong magnetic fields may go through a \"magnetic-up era\" in their lives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2016 18:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-23"}

Recent\nresults demonstrate that exclusively in metals it is possible to switch\nmagnetization between metastable states by femtosecond circularly polarized\nlaser pulses [6-8]. However, despite the record breaking speed of the\nswitching, the mechanisms in these materials are directly related to strong\noptical absorption and laser-induced heating close to the Curie temperature\n[9-12]. Here we report about ultrafast all-optical photo-magnetic recording in\ntransparent dielectrics. In ferrimagnetic garnet film a single linearly\npolarized femtosecond laser pulse breaks the degeneracy between metastable\nmagnetic states and promotes switching of spins between them. Changing the\npolarization of the laser pulse we deterministically steer the net\nmagnetization in the garnet, write \"0\" and \"1\" magnetic bits at will. This\nmechanism operates at room temperature and allows ever fastest write-read\nmagnetic recording event (< 20 ps) accompanied by unprecedentedly low heat load\n(< 6 J/cm3).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2016 08:27:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}
