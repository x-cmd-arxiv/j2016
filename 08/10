In the\nparallel hybrid RF/FSO relay channel, a source node sends its data to a\ndestination node with the help of multiple relay nodes. Thereby, for a given\nrelay, the source-relay and the relay-destination FSO links are orthogonal with\nrespect to each other due to the narrow beam employed for FSO transmission,\nwhereas, due to the broadcast nature of the RF channel, half-duplex operation\nis required for the RF links if self-interference is to be avoided.

The three program stars turned out to be one inactive Be star, one\nactive, continuously outbursting Be star, and one Be star transiting from a\nnon-outbursting into an outbursting phase, thus forming an excellent sample to\ndistill properties of Be stars in the various phases of their life-cycle.\n  Methods: [abbreviated]\n  Results: The short-term photometric variability of Be stars must be\ndisentangled into a stellar and a circumstellar part. The stellar part is on\nthe whole not different from what is seen in non-Be stars. However, some of the\nobserved phenomena might be to be due to resonant mode coupling, a mechanism\nnot typically considered for B-type stars. Short-term circumstellar variability\ncomes in the form of either a group of relatively well-defined, short-lived\nfrequencies during outbursts, which are called \\v{S}tefl frequencies, and broad\nbumps in the power spectra, indicating aperiodic variability on a time scale\nsimilar to typical low-order $g$-mode pulsation frequencies, rather than true\nperiodicity.\n  Conclusions: From a stellar pulsation perspective, Be stars are rapidly\nrotating SPB stars, that is they pulsate in low order $g$-modes, even if the\nrapid rotation can project the observed frequencies into the traditional\nhigh-order $p$-mode regime above about 4 c/d. However, when a circumstellar\ndisk is present, Be star power spectra are complicated by both cyclic, or\nperiodic, and aperiodic circumstellar phenomena, possibly even dominating the\npower spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2016 17:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

The results for the\nnucleus-to-nucleon production ratio available in the literature so far are\nusually based on the assumption of a very long coherence length (LCL) $l_c\\gg\nR_A$. Since the onset of coherence effects is controlled by the coherence\nlength $l_c$, we estimated its magnitude in various kinematic regions of the DY\nprocess and found that the LCL approximation should not be used at small and\nmedium c.m. collision energies ($\\sqrt{s} \\lesssim 200$ GeV) as well as at\nlarge dilepton invariant masses. In order to obtain realistic predictions, we\ncomputed for the first time the DY cross section using the generalised color\ndipole approach based on the rigorous Green function formalism, which naturally\nincorporates the color transparency and quantum coherence effects and hence\nallows to estimate the nuclear shadowing with no restrictions on the CL. In\naddition to the shadowing effect, we studied a complementary effect of initial\nstate interactions (ISI) that causes an additional suppression at large values\nof the Feynman variable. Numerical results for the nuclear modification factor\naccounting for the ISI effect and the finite $l_c$ are compared to the data\navailable from the fixed-target FNAL measurements and a good agreement has been\nfound. Besides, we present new predictions for the nuclear suppression as a\nfunction of dilepton rapidity and invariant mass in the kinematic regions that\ncan be probed by the RHIC collider as well as by the planned AFTER@LHC and LHCb\nfixed-target experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2016 18:05:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

However, for\nthe stability of skyrmions, it is essential to incorporate the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and the out-of-plane magnetic field\ninto the system. In this work, we explore a system without these interactions.\nFirst, we propose a controlled way for the creation of magnetic skyrmions and\nskyrmioniums imprinted on a ferromagnetic nanotrack via a nanopatterned\nnanodisk with the magnetic vortex state. Then we investigate the detachment of\nthe imprinted spin textures from the underneath of the nanodisk, as well as its\ntransport by the spin-transfer torque imposed by spin-polarized current pulses\napplied in the nanotrack. A prominent feature of the moving imprinted spin\ntexture is that its topological number Q is oscillating around the averaged\nvalue of Q=0 as if it is a resonant state between the skyrmions with Q= +/- 1\nand the bubble with Q=0. We may call it a resonant magnetic soliton (RMS). A\nRMS moves along a straight line since it is free from the skyrmion Hall effect.\nIn our studied device, the same electrodes are employed to realize the\nimprinted spin texture detachment and its transport. In addition, we have\ninvestigated the interaction between the RMS and a magnetic tunnel junction\nsensor, where the passing of the RMS in the nanotrack can be well detected. Our\nresults would be useful for the development of novel spintronic devices based\non moveable spin textures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2016 18:50:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2017 16:17:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-09"}

Fundamentally, the unknown graph encodes\ndirect relationships between signal elements, which we aim to recover from\nobservable indirect relationships generated by a diffusion process on the\ngraph. The fresh look advocated here permeates benefits from convex\noptimization and stationarity of graph signals, in order to identify the graph\nshift operator (a matrix representation of the graph) given only its\neigenvectors. These spectral templates can be obtained, e.g., from the sample\ncovariance of independent graph signals diffused on the sought network. The\nnovel idea is to find a graph shift that, while being consistent with the\nprovided spectral information, endows the network with certain desired\nproperties such as sparsity. To that end we develop efficient inference\nalgorithms stemming from provably-tight convex relaxations of natural nonconvex\ncriteria, particularizing the results for two shifts: the adjacency matrix and\nthe normalized Laplacian.

In this study of air\nquality in the Houston metropolitan area we apply dynamic principal component\nanalysis (DPCA) to a normalized multivariate time series of daily concentration\nmeasurements of five pollutants (O3, CO, NO2, SO2, PM2.5) from January 1, 2009\nthrough December 31, 2011 for each of the 24 hours in a day. The resulting\ndynamic components are examined by hour across days for the 3 year period.\nDiurnal and seasonal patterns are revealed underlining times when DPCA performs\nbest and two principal components (PCs) explain most variability in the\nmultivariate series. DPCA is shown to be superior to static principal component\nanalysis (PCA) in discovery of linear relations among transformed pollutant\nmeasurements. DPCA captures the time-dependent correlation structure of the\nunderlying pollutants recorded at up to 34 monitoring sites in the region. In\nwinter mornings the first principal component (PC1) (mainly CO and NO2)\nexplains up to 70% of variability. Augmenting with the second principal\ncomponent (PC2) (mainly driven by SO2) the explained variability rises to 90%.\nIn the afternoon, O3 gains prominence in the second principal component. The\nseasonal profile of PCs' contribution to variance loses its distinction in the\nafternoon, yet cumulatively PC1 and PC2 still explain up to 65% of variability\nin ambient air data. DPCA provides a strategy for identifying the changing air\nquality profile for the region studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 01:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-11"}

Capable of Turing universal computation, the\naTAM allows algorithmic self-assembly, in which the components can be designed\nso that the rules governing their behaviors force them to inherently execute\nprescribed algorithms as they combine. Adding to its completeness, the aTAM was\nshown to also be intrinsically universal, which means that there exists a\nsingle tile set such that for any arbitrary input aTAM system, that tile set\ncan be configured into a seed structure which will then cause self-assembly\nusing that tile set to simulate the input system, capturing its full dynamics\nmodulo only a scale factor. However, the universal simulator previously given\nmakes use of nondeterminism in terms of tile types placed in several key\nlocations when different assembly sequences are followed, even when simulating\na directed system, meaning one that has exactly one unique terminal assembly.\nThe question then became whether or not that nondeterminism is fundamentally\nrequired. Here, we answer that in the affirmative: the class of directed\nsystems in the aTAM is not intrinsically universal, meaning there is no\nuniversal simulator for directed systems which itself is always directed. This\nprovides insight into the role of nondeterminism in self-assembly, which is\nitself a fundamentally nondeterministic process.

Under Gaussian assumption, the\nMLE converts to a nonlinear least squares (NLS) problem. Efficient solutions to\nNLS exist and they are based on iteratively solving sparse linear systems until\nconvergence. In general, the existing solutions provide only an estimation of\nthe mean state vector, the resulting covariance being computationally too\nexpensive to recover. Nevertheless, in many simultaneous localisation and\nmapping (SLAM) applications, knowing only the mean vector is not enough. Data\nassociation, obtaining reduced state representations, active decisions and next\nbest view are only a few of the applications that require fast state covariance\nrecovery. Furthermore, computer vision and robotic applications are in general\nperformed online. In this case, the state is updated and recomputed every step\nand its size is continuously growing, therefore, the estimation process may\nbecome highly computationally demanding. This paper introduces a general\nframework for incremental MLE called SLAM++, which fully benefits from the\nincremental nature of the online applications, and provides efficient\nestimation of both the mean and the covariance of the estimate. Based on that,\nwe propose a strategy for maintaining a sparse and scalable state\nrepresentation for large scale mapping, which uses information theory measures\nto integrate only informative and non-redundant contributions to the state\nrepresentation. SLAM++ differs from existing implementations by performing all\nthe matrix operations by blocks. This led to extremely fast matrix manipulation\nand arithmetic operations. Even though this paper tests SLAM++ efficiency on\nSLAM problems, its applicability remains general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 04:13:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-11"}

The Long Term\nEvolution (LTE)/LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) technology is a major candidate for\nprovisioning of MTC applications. However, due to the diverse characteristics\nof payload size, transmission periodicity, power efficiency, and quality of\nservice (QoS) requirement, MTC poses huge challenges to LTE/LTE-A technologies.\nIn particular, efficient management of massive random access is one of the most\ncritical challenges. In case of massive random access attempts, the probability\nof preamble collision drastically increases, thus the performance of LTE/LTE-A\nrandom access degrades sharply. In this context, this article reviews the\ncurrent state-of-the-art proposals to control massive random access of MTC\ndevices in LTE/LTE-A networks. The proposals are compared in terms of five\nmajor metrics, namely, access delay, access success rate, power efficiency, QoS\nguarantee, and the effect on Human-Type Communications (HTC). To this end, we\npropose a novel collision resolution random access model for massive MTC over\nLTE/LTE-A. Our proposed model basically resolves the preamble collisions\ninstead of avoidance, and targets to manage massive and bursty access attempts.\nSimulations of our proposed model show huge improvements in random access\nsuccess rate compared to the standard slotted-Aloha-based models. The new model\ncan also coexist with existing LTE/LTE-A Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol,\nand ensure high reliability and time-efficient network access.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 04:37:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-11"}

A second, the central star of the\nnewly identified PN Pa5, has a rare O(He) spectral type and a periodic\nvariability consistent with an evolved companion, where the orbital axis is\nalmost aligned with the line of sight. The third PN, NGC~6826 has a fast\nrotating central star, something that can only be achieved in a merger.

This paper proposes a new dynamic portfolio strategy based on\nthe time-varying structures of MST networks in Chinese stock markets, where the\nmarket condition is further considered when using the optimal portfolios for\ninvestment. A portfolio strategy comprises two stages: selecting the portfolios\nby choosing central and peripheral stocks in the selection horizon using five\ntopological parameters, i.e., degree, betweenness centrality, distance on\ndegree criterion, distance on correlation criterion and distance on distance\ncriterion, then using the portfolios for investment in the investment horizon.\nThe optimal portfolio is chosen by comparing central and peripheral portfolios\nunder different combinations of market conditions in the selection and\ninvestment horizons. Market conditions in our paper are identified by the\nratios of the number of trading days with rising index or the sum of the\namplitudes of the trading days with rising index to the total number of trading\ndays. We find that central portfolios outperform peripheral portfolios when the\nmarket is under a drawup condition, or when the market is stable or drawup in\nthe selection horizon and is under a stable condition in the investment\nhorizon.

Two possible models are considered. In both models, a polymer chain is\nformed by tethered beads where non-consecutive backbone beads attract each\nother via a square-well potential representing the tendency of the chain to\nfold. In addition, smaller hard spheres are attached to each non-terminal\nbackbone bead along the direction normal to the chain to mimic the steric\nhindrance of side chains in real proteins. The two models, however, differ in\nthe way bending rigidity is enforced. In the first model, partial overlap\nbetween consecutive beads is allowed. This reduces the possible bending angle\nbetween consecutive bonds thus producing an effective entropic stiffness that\ncompetes with a short-range attraction, and leads to a formation of secondary\nstructures characteristic of proteins. We discuss the low-temperature phase\ndiagram as a function of increasing interpenetration, and find a transition\nfrom a planar, beta-like structure, to helical shape. In the second model, an\nenergetic stiffness is explicitly introduced by imposing an infinitely large\nenergy penalty for bending above a critical angle between consecutive bonds,\nand no penalty below it. The low-temperature phase of this model does not show\nany sign of protein-like secondary structures. At intermediate temperatures,\nhowever, where the chain is still in the coil conformation but stiffness is\nsignificant, we find the two models to predict a quite similar dependence of\nthe persistence length as a function of the stiffness. This behaviour is\nrationalized in terms of a simple geometrical mapping between the two models.\nFinally, we discuss the effect of shrinking side chains to zero, and find the\nabove mapping to still hold true.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 09:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

The\nrotation period and velocity of the star (Prot and Vsini) and the sky-projected\norbital obliquity of the system (lambda) can then be determined. If one has\nthree or more observations of the same spot, the true orbital obliquity (psi)\ncan be measured. We are performing this analysis for a number of cool stars\norbited by transiting planets. We present our results so far and compile a\ncatalogue of lambda and psi measurements from spot crossing events.

Under a range of conditions, particularly under\npopulation sub-division, selection favours sex being allocated to offspring\nnon-randomly, generating non-binomial variances of offspring group sex ratios.\nDetecting non-binomial sex allocation is complicated by stochastic\ndevelopmental mortality, as offspring sex can often only be identified on\nmaturity with the sex of non-maturing offspring remaining unknown. We show that\ncurrent approaches for detecting non-binomiality have limited ability to detect\nnon-binomial sex allocation when developmental mortality has occurred. We\npresent a new procedure using an explicit model of sex allocation and mortality\nand develop a Bayesian model selection approach (available as an R package). We\nuse the double and multiplicative binomial distributions to model over- and\nunder-dispersed sex allocation and show how to calculate Bayes factors for\ncomparing these alternative models to the null hypothesis of binomial sex\nallocation. The ability to detect non-binomial sex allocation is greatly\nincreased, particularly in cases where mortality is common. The use of Bayesian\nmethods allows for the quantification of the evidence in favour of each\nhypothesis, and our modelling approach provides an improved descriptive\ncapability over existing approaches. We use a simulation study to demonstrate\nsubstantial improvements in power for detecting non-binomial sex allocation in\nsituations where current methods fail, and we illustrate the approach in real\nscenarios using empirically obtained datasets on the sexual composition of\ngroups of gregarious parasitoid wasps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 09:19:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-11"}

Of great interest are 2D materials that host single quantum\nemitters. h-BN, with a band gap of 5.95 eV, has been shown to host single\nquantum emitters which are stable at room temperature in the UV and visible\nspectral range. In this paper we investigate correlations between h-BN\nstructural features and emitter location from bulk down to the monolayer at\nroom temperature. We demonstrate that chemical etching and ion irradiation can\ngenerate emitters in h-BN. We analyze the emitters' spectral features and show\nthat they are dominated by the interaction of their electronic transition with\na single Raman active mode of h-BN. Photodynamics analysis reveals diverse\nrates between the electronic states of the emitter. The emitters show excellent\nphoto stability even under ambient conditions and in monolayers. Comparing the\nexcitation polarization between different emitters unveils a connection between\ndefect orientation and the h-BN hexagonal structure. The sharp spectral\nfeatures, color diversity, room-temperature stability, long-lived metastable\nstates, ease of fabrication, proximity of the emitters to the environment,\noutstanding chemical stability, and biocompatibility of h-BN provide a\ncompletely new class of systems that can be used for sensing and quantum\nphotonics applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 10:17:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 07:07:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-07"}

Yet the\ndynamics of how diversity emerges in populations are not well understood. We\nuse rigorous runtime analysis to gain insight into population dynamics and GA\nperformance for the ($\\mu$+1) GA and the $\\text{Jump}_k$ test function. We show\nthat the interplay of crossover and mutation may serve as a catalyst leading to\na sudden burst of diversity. This leads to improvements of the expected\noptimisation time of order $\\Omega(n/\\log n)$ compared to mutation-only\nalgorithms like (1+1) EA. Moreover, increasing the mutation rate by an\narbitrarily small constant factor can facilitate the generation of diversity,\nleading to speedups of order $\\Omega(n)$. We also compare seven commonly used\ndiversity mechanisms and evaluate their impact on runtime bounds for the\n($\\mu$+1) GA. All previous results in this context only hold for\nunrealistically low crossover probability $p_c=O(k/n)$, while we give analyses\nfor the setting of constant $p_c < 1$ in all but one case.\n  For the typical case of constant $k > 2$ and constant $p_c$, we can compare\nthe resulting expected runtimes for different diversity mechanisms assuming an\noptimal choice of $\\mu$: $O(n^{k-1})$ for duplicate elimination/minim.,\n$O(n^2\\log n)$ for maximising the convex hull, $O(n\\log n)$ for deterministic\ncrowding (assuming $p_c = k/n$), $O(n\\log n)$ for maximising Hamming distance,\n$O(n\\log n)$ for fitness sharing, $O(n\\log n)$ for single-receiver island\nmodel.\n  This proves a sizeable advantage of all variants of the ($\\mu$+1) GA compared\nto (1+1) EA, which requires time $\\Theta(n^k)$.

Recently, Biesheuvel \\textit{et al.}\n\\cite{Biesheuvel2016} presented a theoretical lineshape model for such\ntransitions which not only considers linestrengths and Doppler broadening, but\nalso the finite sample size and population redistribution by blackbody\nradiation, which are important in view of the long storage and probe times\nachievable in ion traps. Here, we employ the rate equation model developed by\nBiesheuvel \\textit{et al.} to theoretically study the Doppler-broadened\nhyperfine structure of the $(v,L):(0,3)\\rightarrow(4,2)$ rovibrational\ntransition in HD$^+$ at 1442~nm. We observe prominent yet hitherto unrecognized\nghost features in the simulated spectrum, whose positions depend on the Doppler\nwidth, transition rates, and saturation levels of the hyperfine components\naddressed by the laser. We explain the origin and behavior of such features,\nand we provide a simple quantitative guideline to assess whether ghost features\nmay appear. As such ghost features may be common to saturated Doppler-broadened\nspectra of rotational and vibrational transitions in trapped ions composed of\npartly overlapping lines, our work illustrates the necessity to use lineshape\nmodels that take into account all the relevant physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 11:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

Since the method of images leads to a divergent Poincare'\nseries, one needs a regularization which we achieve by using the Appell\nrespectively the Epstein zeta function. The solution depends on a new positive\nconstant which is completely fixed by the mass of the star and the spatial\nvolume of the universe. The physical interpretation is that a stable or\nmetastable equilibrium requires a topological dark energy which fills the whole\nuniverse with positive energy density and negative pressure. The properties of\nthe gravitational field are discussed in detail. In particular, its anisotropy\nis made explicit by deriving an exact multipole expansion which shows that in\nthis case Birkhoff's theorem does not hold. While the monopole describes the\nNewtonian potential, there is no dipole but always a non-vanishing quadrupole\nwhich leads to a repulsive force experienced by a planet at rest. Finally, we\nput forward the conjecture that black holes exist in a toroidal universe and\nthat their gravitational field is in the weak-field limit well approximated by\nthe first-order field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 11:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-11"}

The finite\nblocklength problem is posed equivalently as a nonconvex optimization problem\nand using a lift-and-project-like method, a close but tractable LP relaxation\nof this problem is derived. Lower bounds on the original problem are obtained\nby the construction of feasible points for the dual of the LP relaxation. A\nparticular application of this approach leads to new converses which recover\nand improve on the converses of Kostina and Verdu for finite blocklength lossy\njoint source-channel coding and lossy source coding. For finite blocklength\nchannel coding, the LP relaxation recovers the converse of Polyanskiy, Poor and\nVerdu and leads to a new improvement on the converse of Wolfowitz, showing\nthereby that our LP relaxation is asymptotically tight with increasing\nblocklengths for channel coding, lossless source coding and joint\nsource-channel coding with the excess distortion probability as the loss\ncriterion. Using a duality based argument, a new converse is derived for finite\nblocklength joint source-channel coding for a class of source-channel pairs.\nEmploying this converse, the LP relaxation is also shown to be tight for all\nblocklengths for the minimization of the expected average symbol-wise Hamming\ndistortion of a $q$-ary uniform source over a $q$-ary symmetric memoryless\nchannel for any $q \\in N$.

Here, we use $N$-body ray-tracing simulations of\nCMB lensing maps to examine two higher-order statistics: the lensing\nconvergence one-point probability distribution function (PDF) and peak counts.\nWe show that these statistics contain significant information not captured by\nthe two-point function, and provide specific forecasts for the ongoing\nStage-III Advanced Atacama Cosmology Telescope (AdvACT) experiment. Considering\nonly the temperature-based reconstruction estimator, we forecast 9$\\sigma$\n(PDF) and 6$\\sigma$ (peaks) detections of these statistics with AdvACT. Our\nsimulation pipeline fully accounts for the non-Gaussianity of the lensing\nreconstruction noise, which is significant and cannot be neglected. Combining\nthe power spectrum, PDF, and peak counts for AdvACT will tighten cosmological\nconstraints in the $\\Omega_m$-$\\sigma_8$ plane by $\\approx 30\\%$, compared to\nusing the power spectrum alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 13:39:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 21:18:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

Our goal is to maximize\nthe system energy efficiency (EE) of the SC while guaranteeing the quality of\nservice of each MU as well as small cell users (SUs). Specifically, given the\nminimum data rate requirement and the bandwidth provided by the MC, the SC\njointly optimizes MU selection, bandwidth allocation, and power allocation\nwhile guaranteeing its own minimum required system data rate. The problem is\nchallenging due to the binary MU selection variables and the fractional- form\nobjective function. We first show that the bandwidth of an MU is shared with at\nmost one SU in the SC. Then, for a given MU selection, the optimal bandwidth\nand power allocation is obtained by exploiting the fractional programming. To\nperform MU selection, we first introduce the concept of the trading EE to\ncharacterize the data rate obtained as well as the power consumed for serving\nan MU. We then reveal a sufficient and necessary condition for serving an MU\nwithout considering the total power constraint and the minimum data rate\nconstraint: the trading EE of the MU should be higher than the system EE of the\nSC. Based on this insight, we propose a low complexity MU selection method and\nalso investigate the optimality condition.

A\nphenomenological aspect that makes glass formation a conceptually formidable\nproblem is that structural and dynamic correlations in glass-forming liquids\nare too subtle to be captured at the level of conventional two-point functions.\nAs a consequence, a host of theoretical techniques, such as quenched amorphous\nconfigurations of particles, have been devised and employed in simulations and\ncolloid experiments to gain insights into the mechanisms responsible for these\nelusive correlations. Very often, though, the analysis of spatio-temporal\ncorrelations is performed in the context of a single theoretical framework, and\ncritical comparisons of microscopic predictions of competing theories are\nthereby lacking. Here, we address this issue by analysing the distribution of\nlocalized excitations, which are building blocks of relaxation as per the\nDynamical Facilitation (DF) theory, in the presence of an amorphous wall, a\nconstruct motivated by the Random First-Order Transition theory (RFOT). We\nobserve that spatial profiles of the concentration of excitations exhibit\ncomplex features such as non-monotonicity and oscillations. Moreover, the\nsmoothly varying part of the concentration profile yields a length scale\n$\\xi_c$, which we compare with a previously computed length scale $\\xi_{dyn}$.\nOur results suggest a method to assess the role of dynamical facilitation in\ngoverning structural relaxation in glass-forming liquids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 14:47:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-11"}

A wide variety of important planetary\nclimate problems involve nondilute condensible substances. These include\nplanets near or undergoing a water vapor runaway and planets near the outer\nedge of the conventional habitable zone, for which CO2 is the condensible.\nStandard representations of convection in climate models rely on several\napproximations appropriate only to the dilute limit, while nondilute convection\ndiffers in fundamental ways from dilute convection. In this paper, a simple\nparameterization of convection valid in the nondilute as well as dilute limits\nis derived and used to discuss the basic character of nondilute convection.

In the feature space,\nproximal physical geometry has the look and feel of either Euclidean,\nRiemannian, or non-Euclidean geometry, since we freely work with the relations\nbetween points in the feature space. The focus in these new forms of geometry\nis the relation between individual regions with their own distinctive features\nsuch as shape, area, perimeter and diameter and the relation between nonempty\nsets of regions. The axioms for physical geometry as well as the axioms for\nproximal physical geometry are given and illustrated. Results for parallel\nclasses of regions, descriptive fibre bundles and BreMiller-Sloyer sheaves are\ngiven. In addition, a region-based Borsuk-Ulam Theorem as well as a Wired\nFriend Theorem are given in the context of both forms of physical geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 13:50:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2016 17:55:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 12:06:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 12:29:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-21"}

We are the first to show that\nexosomes derived from poly(I:C) stimulated cells induce in vivo macrophage\nM1-like polarization within murine lymph nodes. These TLR-exosomes demonstrate\nenhanced trafficking to the node and preferentially recruit neutrophils as\ncompared to control-exosomes.

The gravity\ngradients contain useful position information which can be extracted by\nmatching the observations with a precise gravity model. The extended Kalman\nfilter is investigated as the principal estimator. The stochastic model of\norbital motion, the measurement equation and the model configuration are\ndiscussed for the filter design. An augmented state filter is also developed to\ndeal with unknown significant measurement biases. Simulations are conducted to\nanalyze the effects of initial errors, data-sampling periods, orbital heights,\nattitude and gradiometer noise levels, and measurement biases. Results show\nthat the filter performs well with additive white noise observation errors.\nDegraded observability for the along-track position is found for the augmented\nstate filter. Real flight data from the GOCE satellite are used to test the\nalgorithm.

The receiver is assumed to be employed with a known\nnumber of antennas. In a data frame transmitted by most multiple input multiple\noutput (MIMO) systems, some pilot or training data is inserted for symbol\ntiming synchronization and estimation of the channel. Our goal is to perform\nMIMO transmit antenna classification using this pilot data. More specifically,\nthe problem of determining the transmission system is cast as a multiple\nhypothesis testing problem where the number of hypotheses is equal to the\nmaximum number of transmit antennas. Under the assumption of receiver having\nthe exact knowledge of pilot data used for timing synchronization and channel\nestimation, we consider maximum likelihood (ML) and correlation test statistics\nto classify the MIMO transmit system. When only probabilistic knowledge of\npilot data is available at the receiver, a hybrid-maximum likelihood (HML)\nbased test statistic is constructed using the expectation-maximization (EM)\nalgorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithms is illustrated via\nsimulations and comparative merits of different techniques in terms of the\ncomputational complexity and performance are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2016 16:38:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}
