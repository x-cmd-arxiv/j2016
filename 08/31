In this work, we propose a method that\nestimates the poses of multiple persons in an image in which a person can be\noccluded by another person or might be truncated. To this end, we consider\nmulti-person pose estimation as a joint-to-person association problem. We\nconstruct a fully connected graph from a set of detected joint candidates in an\nimage and resolve the joint-to-person association and outlier detection using\ninteger linear programming. Since solving joint-to-person association jointly\nfor all persons in an image is an NP-hard problem and even approximations are\nexpensive, we solve the problem locally for each person. On the challenging\nMPII Human Pose Dataset for multiple persons, our approach achieves the\naccuracy of a state-of-the-art method, but it is 6,000 to 19,000 times faster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 16:00:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2016 09:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-01"}

In a second\napproach we use the shock normal and the flux rope axis orientations, as well\nas the impact parameter, to provide statistical information across the\nspacecraft trajectory. The study of different 3D shock models shows that the\nobservations are compatible with a shock symmetric around the Sun-apex line as\nwell as with an asymmetry up to an aspect ratio around 3.

In particular, the stable\nmatching between subproblems and solutions, which achieves an equilibrium\nbetween their mutual preferences, implicitly strikes a balance between the\nconvergence and diversity. Nevertheless, the original stable matching model has\na high risk of matching a solution with a unfavorable subproblem which finally\nleads to an imbalanced selection result. In this paper, we propose an adaptive\ntwo-level stable matching-based selection for decomposition multi-objective\noptimization.

Due to the existence of\ntradeoffs it can be evolutionarily advantageous to evolve the division of labor\nwhereby the cells can suppress their contributions to some of the activities\nthrough the activation of regulatory genes, which in its turn inflicts a cost\nin terms of fitness. Our simulation results show that cell differentiation is\nmore likely as the number of tradeoffs is increased but the outcome also\ndepends on their strength. We observe the existence of critical values for the\nminimum number of tradeoffs and their strength beyond that maximum cell\ndifferentiation can be attained. Remarkably, we observe the occurrence of a\nmaximum tradeoff strength beyond that the population is no longer viable\nimposing an upper tolerable level of constraint at the system. This tolerance\nis reduced as the number of tradeoffs grows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 19:40:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-06"}

The abundance patterns of these\nCEMP-s/r stars, which show both Ba and Eu enrichment, are particularly puzzling\nsince the s and the r processes require neutron densities that are more than\nten orders of magnitude apart, and hence are thought to occur in very different\nstellar sites with very different physical conditions.

With respect to the classical s process resulting from neutron\ndensities on the lowest side of this range, neutron densities on the highest\nside result in abundance patterns that show an increased production of heavy\ns-process and r-process elements but similar abundances of the light s-process\nelements. Such high values of n may occur in the thermal pulses of asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) stars due to proton ingestion episodes. Comparison to the\nsurface abundances of 20 CEMP-s/r stars show that our modelled i-process\nabundances successfully reproduce observed abundance patterns that could not be\npreviously explained by s-process nucleosynthesis.

It has become\nclear that current networking standards fall short of coping with the complex\nchallenge of surviving failures. The need to address this challenge has become\na focal point of networking research. In particular, the concept of\n\\textbf{\\emph{tunable survivability}} offers major performance improvements\nover traditional approaches. Indeed, while the traditional approach aims at\nproviding full (100\\%) protection against network failures through disjoint\npaths, it was realized that this requirement is too restrictive in practice.\nTunable survivability provides a quantitative measure for specifying the\ndesired level (0\\%-100\\%) of survivability and offers flexibility in the choice\nof the routing paths. Previous work focused on the simpler class of\n\"bottleneck\" criteria, such as bandwidth. In this study, we focus on the\nimportant and much more complex class of \\emph{additive} criteria, such as\ndelay and cost. First, we establish some (in part, counter-intuitive)\nproperties of the optimal solution. Then, we establish efficient algorithmic\nschemes for optimizing the level of survivability under additive end-to-end QoS\nbounds. Subsequently, through extensive simulations, we show that, at the price\nof \\emph{negligible} reduction in the level of survivability, a major\nimprovement (up to a factor of $2$) is obtained in terms of end-to-end QoS\nperformance. Finally, we exploit the above findings in the context of a network\ndesign problem, in which, for a given investment budget, we aim to improve the\nsurvivability of the network links.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 21:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-01"}

A language $L,$ over an at least 2-symbol alphabet,\nis in RoughP, if the following hold: (1) there exists a bijective encoding\n$\\alpha$ of strings, such that both $\\alpha$ and its inverse are computable in\npolynomial time; (2) there is a polynomial time algorithm $\\cal A$, which is an\nerrorless heuristic for $L,$ with exponentially vanishing failure rate relative\nto the $\\alpha$-spheres $S^{(\\alpha)}_n=\\{\\alpha(x)\\,|\\;\\, |x|=n\\}$.

In an\nanti-de Sitter space, we construct a pair of maximally entangled but separated\nblack holes. Due to the vacuum decay of the anti-de Sitter background toward a\ndeeper vacuum, these two parts can be trapped by bubbles. If these bubbles are\nreasonably large, then within the scrambling time, there should appear an\nEinstein-Rosen bridge between the two black holes. Now by tracing more details\non the bubble dynamics, one can identify parameters such that one of the two\nbubbles either monotonically shrinks or expands. Because of the change of\nvacuum energy, one side of the black hole would evaporate completely. Due to\nthe shrinking of the apparent horizon, a signal of one side of the\nEinstein-Rosen bridge can be viewed from the opposite side. We analytically and\nnumerically demonstrate that within a reasonable semi-classical parameter\nregime, such process can happen. Bubbles are a non-perturbative effect, which\nis the crucial reason that allows the transmission of information between the\ntwo black holes through the Einstein-Rosen bridge, even though the probability\nis highly suppressed. Therefore, the ER=EPR conjecture cannot be generic in its\npresent form and its validity maybe restricted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2016 00:23:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Jun 2017 13:05:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2017 17:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-26"}

By removing whole\nfilters in the network together with their connecting feature maps, the\ncomputation costs are reduced significantly. In contrast to pruning weights,\nthis approach does not result in sparse connectivity patterns. Hence, it does\nnot need the support of sparse convolution libraries and can work with existing\nefficient BLAS libraries for dense matrix multiplications. We show that even\nsimple filter pruning techniques can reduce inference costs for VGG-16 by up to\n34% and ResNet-110 by up to 38% on CIFAR10 while regaining close to the\noriginal accuracy by retraining the networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2016 02:29:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2016 02:12:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 17:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-13"}

To be\neffective in these meetings, participants need to have an engaged mental state.\nThe mental state of participants however, is hidden from other participants,\nand thereby difficult to evaluate. Mental state is understood as an inner\nprocess of thinking and feeling, that is formed of a conglomerate of mental\nrepresentations and propositional attitudes. There is a need to create\ntransparency of these hidden states to understand, evaluate and influence them.\nFacilitators need to evaluate the meeting situation and adjust for higher\nengagement and productivity. This paper presents a framework that defines a\nspectrum of engagement states and an array of classifiers aimed to detect the\nengagement state of participants in real time. The Engagement Framework\nintegrates multi-modal information from 2D and 3D imaging and sound. Engagement\nis detected and evaluated at participants and aggregated at group level.

We find that for models with $>15$ image\nsystems, the image plane rms does not decrease significantly when more systems\nare added; however the rms values quoted in the literature may be misleading as\nto the ability of a model to predict new multiple images. The mass is well\nconstrained near the Einstein radius in all cases, and systematic error drops\nto $<2\\%$ for models using $>10$ image systems. Magnification errors are\nsmallest along the straight portions of the critical curve, and the value of\nthe magnification is systematically lower near curved portions.

To address this issue, we consider the problem of reconciling\nmortality rate forecasts from the viewpoint of grouped time-series forecasting\nmethods (Hyndman et al., 2011). A bottom-up method and an optimal combination\nmethod are applied to produce point forecasts of infant mortality rates that\nare aggregated appropriately across the different levels of a hierarchy. We\nextend these two methods by considering the reconciliation of interval\nforecasts through a bootstrap procedure. Using the regional infant mortality\nrates in Australia, we investigate the one-step-ahead to 20-step-ahead point\nand interval forecast accuracies among the independent and these two grouped\ntime-series forecasting methods.

One way to leverage full-duplex in a network\nsetting is to enable three-node full-duplex, where a full- duplex access point\n(AP) transmits data to one node yet simultaneously receives data from another\nnode. Such three-node full-duplex communication however introduces inter-client\ninterference, directly impacting the full-duplex gain. It hence may not always\nbe beneficial to enable three-node full-duplex transmissions. In this paper, we\npresent a distributed full-duplex medium access control (MAC) protocol that\nallows an AP to adaptively switch between full-duplex and half-duplex modes. We\nformulate a model that determines the probabilities of full-duplex and\nhalf-duplex access so as to maximize the expected network throughput. A MAC\nprotocol is further proposed to enable the AP and clients to contend for either\nfull-duplex or half-duplex transmissions based on their assigned probabilities\nin a distributed way.

It is chal- lenging to construct a reliable numerical algorithm\nto accurately capture the non-equilibrium physical effect in different regimes.\nIn this paper, a well-balanced unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for all flow\nregimes under gravitational field will be developed, which can be used for the\nstudy of non-equilibrium gravitational gas system. The well-balanced scheme\nhere is defined as a method to evolve an isolated gravitational system under\nany initial condition to an isothermal hydrostatic equilibrium state and to\nkeep such a solution. To preserve such a property is important for a numerical\nscheme, which can be used for the study of slowly evolving gravitational\nsystem, such as the formation of star and galaxy. Based on the Boltzmann model\nwith external forcing term, an analytic time evolving (or scale-dependent)\nsolution is constructed to provide the corresponding dynamics in the cell size\nand time step scale, which is subsequently used in the construction of UGKS. As\na result, with the varia- tion of the ratio between the numerical time step and\nlocal particle collision time, the UGKS is able to recover flow physics in\ndifferent regimes and provides a continuum spectrum of gas dynamics. For the\nfirst time, the flow physics of a gravitational system in the transition regime\ncan be studied using the UGKS, and the non-equilibrium phenomena in such a\ngrav- itational system can be clearly identified. Many numerical examples will\nbe used to validate the scheme. New physical observation, such as the\ncorrelation between the gravitational field and the heat flux in the transition\nregime, will be presented. The current method provides an indispensable tool\nfor the study of non-equilibrium gravitational system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2016 05:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

Considering a subset of close plant species defined according\nto their chloroplasts, the phylogenetic tree that can be inferred by their core\ngenes is not necessarily well supported, due to the possible occurrence of\nproblematic genes (i.e., homoplasy, incomplete lineage sorting, horizontal gene\ntransfers, etc.) which may blur the phylogenetic signal. However, a trustworthy\nphylogenetic tree can still be obtained provided such a number of blurring\ngenes is reduced. The problem is thus to determine the largest subset of core\ngenes that produces the best-supported tree. To discard problematic genes and\ndue to the overwhelming number of possible combinations, this article focuses\non how to extract the largest subset of sequences in order to obtain the most\nsupported species tree. Due to computational complexity, a distributed Binary\nParticle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) is proposed in sequential and distributed\nfashions. Obtained results from both versions of the BPSO are compared with\nthose computed using an hybrid approach embedding both genetic algorithms and\nstatistical tests.

We assume that 20-30 $M_\\oplus$ giant planet cores are formed in\nthe region where viscous heating dominates and migrate outward under the action\nof a strong corotation torque. In the case where gas accretion is neglected, we\nfind evidence for strong dynamical torques in accreting discs with accretion\nrates ${\\dot M}\\gtrsim 7\\times 10^{-8} \\;M_\\odot/yr$. Their main effect is to\nincrease outward migration rates by a factor of $\\sim 2$ typically.

The representation for the\nfundamental matrix $Z^{(\\alpha)}$ relates fractional random walks with normal\nrandom walks. We show that the fractional transition matrix elements exhibit\nfor large cubic $n$-dimensional lattices a power law decay of an\n$n$-dimensional infinite space Riesz fractional derivative type indicating\nemergence of L\\'evy flights. As a further footprint of L\\'evy flights in the\n$n$-dimensional space, the fractional transition matrix and fractional return\nprobabilities are dominated for large times $t$ by slowly relaxing long-wave\nmodes leading to a characteristic $t^{-\\frac{n}{\\alpha}}$-decay. It can be\nconcluded that, due to long range moves of fractional random walk, a small\nworld property is emerging increasing the efficiency to explore the lattice\nwhen instead of a normal random walk a fractional random walk is chosen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2016 08:19:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

W43 is a highly luminous galactic massive star forming\nregion at a distance of 5.5 kpc and the MM1 part hosts a very massive dense\ncore (1000 M$_{\\odot}$ within 0.05 pc). We present new Herschel HIFI maps of\nthe W43 MM1 region covering the main low-energy water lines at 557, 987, and\n1113 GHz, their H$_2^{18}$O counterparts, and other lines such as\n$^{13}$CO(10-9) and C$^{18}$O(9-8) which trace warm gas. These water lines are,\nwith the exception of line wings, observed in absorption. Herschel SPIRE and\nJCMT 450 $\\mu$m data have been used to make a model of the continuum emission\nat these wavelengths. Analysis of the maps, and in particular the optical depth\nmaps of each line and feature, shows that a velocity gradient, possibly due to\nrotation, is present in both the envelope and the protostellar core. Velocities\nincrease in both components from SW to NE, following the general source\norientation. While the H$_2$O lines trace essentially the cool envelope, we\nshow that the envelope cannot account for the H$_2^{18}$O absorption, which\ntraces motions close to the protostar. The core has rapid infall, 2.9 kms, as\nmanifested by the H$_2^{18}$O absorption features which are systematically\nred-shifted with respect to the $^{13}$CO(10-9) emission line which also traces\nthe inner material with the same angular resolution.

Several heuristic based approaches with diverse proposals\nfor taming the scale and complexity of web service composition, have been\nproposed in literature. In this paper, we present a new approach for efficient\nservice composition based on abstraction refinement. Instead of considering\nindividual services during composition, we propose several abstractions to form\nservice groups and the composition is done on these abstract services.\nAbstraction reduces the search space significantly and thereby can be done\nreasonably fast. While this can expedite solution construction to a great\nextent, this also entails a possibility that it may fail to generate any\nsolution satisfying the QoS constraints, though the individual services\nconstruct a valid solution. Hence, we propose to refine an abstraction to\ngenerate the composite solution with desired QoS values. A QoS satisfying\nsolution, if one exists, can be constructed with multiple iterations of\nabstraction refinement. While in the worst case, this approach may end up\nexploring the complete composition graph constructed on individual services, on\nan average, the solution can be achieved on the abstract graph.

Hard X-ray spectra of black hole binaries (BHB) are produced by\nComptonization of soft seed photons by hot electrons near the black hole. The\nslope of the resulting ray spectra is governed by two main parameters: the\nelectron temperature and the optical depth of the emitting plasma. Given the\nextreme brightness of V404~Cyg during the 2015 outburst, we aim to constrain\nthe source spectral properties using an unprecedented time resolution in hard\nX-rays, and to monitor their evolution over the outburst. Methods. We have\nextracted and analyzed 602 X-ray spectra of V404 Cyg obtained by the IBIS/ISGRI\ninstrument on-board INTEGRAL during the 2015 June outburst, using effective\nintegration times ranging between 8 and 176000 seconds. We have fit the\nresulting spectra in the 20-200 keV energy range. Results. We find that while\nthe light curve and soft X-ray spectra of V404 Cyg are remarkably different\nfrom those of other BHBs, the spectral evolution of V404~Cyg in hard X-rays and\nthe relations between the spectral parameters are consistent with those\nobserved in other BHBs. We identify a hard branch} where the electron\ntemperature is anti-correlated with the hard X-ray flux, and a soft flaring\nbranch where the relation reverses. In addition, we find that during long X-ray\nplateaus detected at intermediate fluxes, the thermal Comptonization models\nfail to describe the spectra. However, the statistics improve if we allow the\nabsorption to vary freely in the fits to these spectra. Conclusions. We\nconclude that the hard branch in V404 Cyg is analogous to the canonical hard\nstate of BHBs. V404~Cyg never seems to enter the canonical soft state, although\nthe soft flaring branch bears resemblance to the BHB intermediate state and\nultra-luminous state.

For\nthe first $\\sim$10 kyrs after the fall-back episode with accreted mass $10^{-3}\nM_\\odot$, the observed NS magnetic field appears dipolar, which is insensitive\nto the initial magnetic topology. In framework of the Ruderman & Sutherland\n(1975) vacuum gap model during this interval, non-thermal radiation is strongly\nsuppressed.

The efficiency of the first\ntwo stages can be enhanced when small-scale magnetic structure is present.

It responds to an applied external magnetic\nfield by changes in elastic properties, which can be exploited for various\napplications like dampers, vibration absorbers, or actuators. Under appropriate\nconditions, the stress-strain behavior of a ferrogel can display a fascinating\nfeature: superelasticity, the capability to reversibly deform by a huge amount\nwhile barely altering the applied load. In a previous work, using numerical\nsimulations, we investigated this behavior assuming that the magnetic moments\ncarried by the embedded particles can freely reorient to minimize their\nmagnetic interaction energy. Here, we extend the analysis to ferrogels where\nrestoring torques by the surrounding matrix hinder rotations towards a\nmagnetically favored configuration. For example, the particles can be\nchemically cross-linked into the polymer matrix and the magnetic moments can be\nfixed to the particle axes. We demonstrate that these systems still feature a\nsuperelastic regime. As before, the nonlinear stress-strain behavior can be\nreversibly tailored during operation by external magnetic fields. Yet, the\ndifferent coupling of the magnetic moments causes different types of response\nto external stimuli. For instance, an external magnetic field applied parallel\nto the stretching axis hardly affects the superelastic regime but stiffens the\nsystem beyond it. Other smart materials featuring superelasticity, e.g.\nmetallic shape-memory alloys, have already found widespread applications.

This paper is devoted to exploring the scaling in classical shape\nindexes with mathematical methods. Two typical regular fractals, Koch's island\nand Vicsek's figure, are employed to illustrate the property of scale\ndependence of many shape indexes. A set of formula are derived from the\ngeometric measure relation to associate fractal dimension for boundary lines\nwith shape indexes. Based on the ideas of fractals, two main problems are\nsolved in this work. First, several different correlated shape indexes such as\ncircularity ratios and compactness ratios are normalized and unified by\nsubstituting Feret's diameter for the major axis of urban figure. Second, three\nlevels of scaling in shape indexes are revealed, and shape indexes are\nclassified into three groups. The significance of this study lies in two\naspects.

The model allows for a tunably small and\npositive value of the cosmological constant. The gravitino mass parameter and\nthe dilaton Vacuum Expectation Value are separately tunable.\n  In a second part we analyze the quantum consistency of these models. Recent\nwork on anomalies in supergravity theories with Fayet-Iliopoulos terms was\nextended, such that their results can be interpreted from a field-theoretic\npoint of view. We show that for certain values of the parameters the anomaly\ncancellation conditions are inconsistent with a TeV gravitino mass.\n  In the third part the above model is used as a hidden sector for\nsupersymmetry breaking. In its minimal version, the model leads to tachyonic\nscalar soft masses. This problem can however be circumvented by the\nintroduction of an extra Pol\\'onyi-like hidden sector field, or by allowing for\nnon-canonical kinetic terms for the Standard Model fields, while maintaining\nthe desirable features of the model. The resulting low energy spectrum consists\nof very light neutralinos, charginos and gluinos, while the squarks remain\nheavy, with the exception of the stop squark which can be as light as 2 TeV.\n  Finally, we discus possibility that the shift symmetry is identified with\nknown global symmetries of the MSSM. The particular cases where this global\nsymmetry is Baryon minus Lepton number ($B-L$), or $3B-L$, which contain the\nknown R-parity or matter parity of the MSSM, are analyzed in great detail.

If a crystalline optical\npotential is also linearly ramped, light can undergo periodic Bloch\noscillations, a direct outcome of localized Wannier-Stark states and their\nequidistant eigenvalue spectrum. Even though these effects have been\nextensively explored in conservative settings, this is by no means the case in\nnon-Hermitian photonic lattices encompassing both amplification and\nattenuation. Quite recently, Bloch oscillations have been predicted in\nparity-time-symmetric structures involving gain and loss in a balanced fashion.\nWhile in a complex bulk medium, one intuitively expects that light will\ntypically follow the path of highest amplification, in a periodic system this\nbehavior can be substantially altered by the underlying band structure.

We show that these revivals exhibit\nunusual properties like secondary emissions and resonant restoration of PT\nsymmetry. In addition, we present a versatile method for reconstructing the\nreal and imaginary components of the band structure by directly monitoring the\nlight evolution during a cycle of these oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2016 14:13:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-01"}

This\nmicro-machined structure is also used to mitigate the coupling of out-of-band\nradiation to the microwave circuit. At 40 GHz, the detectors have a measured\nefficiency of 90%. In this paper, we describe the development of the 90 GHz\ndetector arrays that will be demonstrated using the Cosmology Large Angular\nScale Surveyor (CLASS) ground-based telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 17:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

Red-giant stars may engulf planets. This may increase the rotation\nrate of their convective envelope, which could lead to strong dynamo-triggered\nmagnetic fields. Aims. We explore the possibility of generating magnetic fields\nin red giants that have gone through the process of a planet engulfment. We\ncompare them with similar models that evolve without any planets. We discuss\nthe impact of stellar wind magnetic braking on the evolution of the surface\nvelocity of the parent star. Methods. With rotating stellar models with and\nwithout planets and an empirical relation between the Rossby number and the\nsurface magnetic field, we deduce the evolution of the surface magnetic field\nalong the red-giant branch. The effects of wind magnetic braking is explored\nusing a relation deduced from MHD simulations. Results. The stellar evolution\nmodel of a 1.7 M$_\\odot$ without planet engulfment and that has a time-averaged\nrotation velocity during the Main-Sequence equal to 100 km s$^{-1}$, shows a\nsurface magnetic field triggered by convection larger than 10 G only at the\nbase of the red giant branch, that means for gravities log $g > 3$. When a\nplanet engulfment occurs, such magnetic field can also appear at much lower\ngravities, i.e. at much higher luminosities along the red giant branch.\nTypically the engulfment of a 15 M$_J$ planet produces a dynamo triggered\nmagnetic field larger than 10 G for gravities between 2.5 and 1.9. We show that\nfor reasonable wind magnetic braking laws, the high surface velocity reached\nafter a planet engulfment may be maintained sufficiently long for being\nobservable. Conclusions. High surface magnetic fields for red giants in the\nupper part of the red giant branch is a strong indication of a planet\nengulfment or of an interaction with a companion. Our theory can be tested by\nobserving fast rotating red giants and check whether they show magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2016 14:52:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 10:53:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

The\nshallow word-level CNNs achieve better error rates than the error rates\nreported in Conneau et al., though the results should be interpreted with some\nconsideration due to the unique pre-processing of Conneau et al. The shallow\nword-level CNN uses more parameters and therefore requires more storage than\nthe deep character-level CNN; however, the shallow word-level CNN computes much\nfaster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2016 15:43:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-05"}

Initially, using the latest\ncosmological data we implement a joint likelihood analysis in order to\nconstrain the cosmological parameters. Then we test the performance of the\nagegraphic dark energy model at the perturbation level and we define its\ndifference from the usual $\\Lambda$CDM model. Within this context, we verify\nthat the growth index of matter fluctuations depends on the choice of the\nconsidered agegraphic dark energy (homogeneous or clustered). In particular,\nassuming a homogeneous agegraphic dark energy we find, for the first time, that\nthe asymptotic value of the growth index is $\\gamma \\approx 5/9$, which is\nclose to that of the usual $\\Lambda$ cosmology, $\\gamma^{(\\Lambda)} \\approx\n6/11$. Finally, if the distribution of dark energy is clustered then we obtain\n$\\gamma \\approx 1/2$ which is $\\sim 8\\%$ smaller than that of the $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2016 14:07:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 19:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

The equations\ndescribe the structure of the electron as well as its motion in external\nfields, interaction with a measuring apparatus inclusive, in a deterministic\nmanner without any jumps. Quantum mechanics is an approximate theory because\nits equations follow from the above equations upon neglecting the self-field of\nthe electron itself. Just this leads to paradoxes, seeming contradictions and\njumps in quantum mechanics. The quantum mechanical wavefunction has a dual\ninterpretation. In some problems the square of its modulus represents a real\ndistribution of the electronic density while in others the same square\ndetermines the probability distribution of coordinates. It is shown why, given\nthe different interpretations of the wavefunction, it satisfies one and the\nsame Dirac or Schr\\\"odinger equation. Description of many-electron systems is\nalso considered in the starting approach as well as in quantum mechanics.\nNeutrinos are discussed in brief.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2016 11:43:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2016 12:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

In order to understand the behaviour of\npatients in response to medical advice on self-care, clinicians often conduct\ncross-sectional surveys. When analysing the survey data, statistical machine\nlearning methods can potentially provide additional insight into the data\neither through deeper understanding of the patterns present or making\ninformation available to clinicians in an intuitive manner. In this study, we\nuse self-organising maps (SOMs) to visualise the responses of patients who\nshare similar responses to survey questions, with the goal of helping\nclinicians understand how patients are managing their treatment and where\naction should be taken. The principle behavioural patterns revealed through\nthis are that: patients who take the correct dose of insulin also tend to take\ntheir injections at the correct time, patients who eat on time also tend to\ncorrectly manage their food portions and patients who check their blood glucose\nwith a monitor also tend to adjust their insulin dosage and carry snacks to\ncounter low blood glucose. The identification of these positive behavioural\npatterns can also help to inform treatment by exploiting their negative\ncorollaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 18:49:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}
