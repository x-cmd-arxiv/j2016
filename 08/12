We first discuss the general trends\nexpected from the changes in the crystal-field splitting and in the hopping\nparameters that are induced by epitaxial strain. We argue that the\nstrain-induced crystal-field splitting generally favors the Mott-insulating\nstate, whereas the strain-induced changes in the hopping parameters favor the\nmetallic state under compressive strain and the insulating state under tensile\nstrain. Thus, the two effects can effectively cancel each other under\ncompressive strain, while they usually cooperate under tensile strain, in this\ncase favoring the insulating state. We then validate these general\nconsiderations by performing electronic structure calculations for several d^1\nand d^2 perovskites, using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and\ndynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). We isolate the individual effects of\nstrain-induced changes in either hopping or crystal-field by performing DMFT\ncalculations where we fix one type of parameter to the corresponding unstrained\nDFT values. These calculations confirm our general considerations for SrVO_3\n(d^1) and LaVO_3 (d^2), whereas the case of LaTiO_3 (d^1) is distinctly\ndifferent, due to the strong effect of the octahedral tilt distortion in the\nunderlying perovskite crystal structure.

In this paper, we present a\nmachine learning based forwarding algorithm to let a forwarding node\ndynamically select the next hop with highest potential bandwidth capacity to\nresume communication based on learning algorithm. Key to this strategy is that\na node only maintains three past status, and then it is able to learn and\npredict the potential bandwidth capacities of its links.

Recently the idea of planet(esimal)\ncollisions releasing splashes of lava droplets, long considered out of favor,\nhas been reconsidered as a possible origin of chondrules by several papers. One\nof the main problems with this idea is the lack of quantitative and simple\nmodels that can be used to test this scenario by directly comparing to the many\nknown observables of chondrules. In Paper I of this series we presented a\nsimple thermal evolution model of a spherically symmetric expanding cloud of\nmolten lava droplets that is assumed to emerge from a collision between two\nplanetesimals. In the present paper, number II of this series, we use this\nmodel to calculate whether or not volatile elements such as Na and K will\nremain abundant in these droplets or whether they will get depleted due to\nevaporation. The high density of the droplet cloud (e.g. small distance between\nadjacent droplets) causes the vapor to quickly reach saturation pressure and\nthus shutting down further evaporation. We show to which extent, and under\nwhich conditions, this keeps the abundances of these elements high, as is seen\nin chondrules. We find that for most parameters of our model (cloud mass,\nexpansion velocity, initial temperature) the volatile elements Mg, Si and Fe\nremain entirely in the chondrules. The Na and K abundances inside the droplets\nwill initially stay mostly at their initial values due to the saturation of the\nvapor pressure, but at some point start to drop due to the cloud expansion.\nHowever, as soon as the temperature starts to decrease, most or all of the\nvapor recondenses again. At the end the Na and K elements retain most of their\ninitial abundances, albeit occasionally somewhat reduced, depending on the\nparameters of the expanding cloud model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2016 17:11:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

We also\ndiscuss how Lorentz symmetry in the kinetic theory of Weyl fermion, seemly\nviolated by the Berry phase term, is realized non-trivially; we provide a\nphysical interpretation for this non-trivial realization, and discuss its\nmathematical foundation in Wigner translation.

Using an approximate analytic\ntreatment, we first show that drifting particles define a track in\nmetallicity--stopping time space whose only substantial dependence is on the\ndisk's angular momentum transport efficiency. Prompt planetesimal formation is\nfeasible for high particle accretion rates (relative to the gas, $\\dot{M}_p /\n\\dot{M} > 3 \\times 10^{-2}$ for $\\alpha = 10^{-2}$), that could only be\nsustained for a limited period of time.

His entropic functional for classical systems was\nextended by Gibbs to the entire phase space of a many-body system, and by von\nNeumann in order to cover quantum systems as well. Finally, it was used by\nShannon within the theory of information. The simplest expression of this\nfunctional corresponds to a discrete set of $W$ microscopic possibilities, and\nis given by $S_{BG}= -k\\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \\ln p_i$ ($k$ is a positive universal\nconstant; {\\it BG} stands for {\\it Boltzmann-Gibbs}).

However,\n{\\it what can we do when ergodicity and similar simple hypotheses are\nviolated?}, which indeed happens in very many natural, artificial and social\ncomplex systems. It was advanced in 1988 the possibility of generalizing BG\nstatistical mechanics through a family of nonadditive entropies, namely\n$S_q=k\\frac{1-\\sum_{i=1}^W p_i^q}{q-1}$, which recovers the additive $S_{BG}$\nentropy in the $q \\to1$ limit.

Recently there has been much progress in understanding the general\nproperties of multilayer networks, our understanding of how to control such\nsystems remains limited. One aspect that makes this endeavor challenging is\nthat each layer can operate at a different timescale, thus we cannot directly\napply standard ideas from structural control theory of individual networks.\nHere we address the problem of controlling multilayer and multi-timescale\nnetworks focusing on two-layer multiplex networks with one-to-one interlayer\ncoupling. We investigate the case when the control signal is applied to the\nnodes of one layer. We develop a theory based on disjoint path covers to\ndetermine the minimum number of inputs ($N_\\T i$) necessary for full control.\nWe show that if both layers operate on the same timescale then the network\nstructure of both layers equally affect controllability. In the presence of\ntimescale separation, controllability is enhanced if the controller interacts\nwith the faster layer: $N_\\T i$ decreases as the timescale difference increases\nup to a critical timescale difference, above which $N_\\T i$ remains constant\nand is completely determined by the faster layer. In contrast, control becomes\nincreasingly difficult if the controller interacts with the layer operating on\nthe slower timescale and increasing timescale separation leads to increased\n$N_\\T i$, again up to a critical value, above which $N_\\T i$ still depends on\nthe structure of both layers. By identifying the underlying mechanisms that\nconnect timescale difference and controllability for a simplified model, we\nprovide insight into disentangling how our ability to control real interacting\ncomplex systems is affected by a variety of sources of complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2016 20:26:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

In this work,\nwe revisit the century-old law and examine the limits of its applicability in\nan example of Er:YAG and Er:YLF dielectric crystals, potential radiation\nconverters for thermophotovoltaic applications. In our experiments, the (80\nat.%) Er:YAG crystal was opaque between 1.45 {\\mu}m and 1.64 {\\mu}m.

The shape of\nthe emissivity spectrum {\\epsilon}({\\lambda}) closely matches that of\nabsorptance {\\alpha}({\\lambda}), suggesting that the Kirchhoff law can\nadequately describe thermal radiation of opaque bodies, even if the requirement\nof thermodynamic equilibrium is not satisfied.

Testing is particularly important for Android apps,\nwhich must run on a multitude of devices and operating system versions.\nUnfortunately, as we confirmed in many interviews with quality assurance\nprofessionals, app testing is today a very human intensive, and therefore\ntedious and error prone, activity. To address this problem, and better support\ntesting of Android apps, we propose a new technique that allows testers to\neasily create platform independent test scripts for an app and automatically\nrun the generated test scripts on multiple devices and operating system\nversions. The technique does so without modifying the app under test or the\nruntime system, by (1) intercepting the interactions of the tester with the app\nand (2) providing the tester with an intuitive way to specify expected results\nthat it then encode as test oracles. We implemented our technique in a tool\nnamed Barista and used the tool to evaluate the practical usefulness and\napplicability of our approach. Our results show that Barista can faithfully\nencode user defined test cases as test scripts with built-in oracles, generates\ntest scripts that can run on multiple platforms, and can outperform a\nstate-of-the-art tool with similar functionality.

One is via a\nrelaxed-constraints based alternating optimization (RAO) realized by efficient\nalternating optimization and relaxing non-convex constraints to convex ones.\nThe other is via an unconstrained alternating optimization with normalization\n(UAON) implemented by introducing the constraints into the iterations with the\nnormalization operation. Second, a separate MSE minimization based precoding is\nproposed by considering the signal and interference terms corresponding to the\nmacro tier and the SCs separately. Simulation results show that the sum-MSE\nbased RAO algorithm provides the best MSE performance among the proposed\nschemes under a number of system configurations. When the number of antennas at\nthe macro-BS is sufficiently large, the MSE of the separate MSE-based precoding\nis found to approach that of RAO and surpass that of UAON. Together, this paper\nprovides a suite of three new precoding techniques that is expected to meet the\nneed in a broad range of HetNet environments with adequate balance between\nperformance and complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2016 23:52:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-15"}

Although private user information remains hidden to the MC, a\ntheoretical analysis shows that under the assumption of convexity of the agents\nutilities, the proposed auction is still able to maximize the social welfare\n(SW), i.e. the aggregate utilities of the agents. In addition, it is shown that\nthe mechanism exhibits the key desirable features of individual rationality and\nweak budget balance, guaranteeing that neither the payoff to any agent nor the\nnet monetary revenue after termination, is negative.

However, the mechanisms\nunderlying this emotional contagion, for example, whether different feelings\nspread in unlikely ways or how the spread of emotions relates to the social\nnetwork, is rarely investigated. Indeed, because of high costs and\nspatio-temporal limitations, explorations of this topic are challenging using\nconventional questionnaires or controlled experiments. Because they are\ncollection points for natural affective responses of massive individuals,\nonline social media sites offer an ideal proxy for tackling this issue from the\nperspective of computational social science. In this paper, based on the\nanalysis of millions of tweets in Weibo, surprisingly, we find that anger is\nmore contagious than joy, indicating that it can spark more angry follow-up\ntweets. Moreover, regarding dissemination in social networks, anger travels\neasily along weaker ties than joy, meaning that it can infiltrate different\ncommunities and break free of local traps because strangers share such content\nmore often. Through a simple diffusion model, we reveal that greater contagion\nand weaker ties function cooperatively to speed up anger's spread. The\ndiffusion of real-world events with different dominant emotions provides\nfurther testimony to the findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst time that quantitative long-term evidence has been presented that reveals\na difference in the mechanism by which joy and anger are disseminated.

Conventional hashing schemes\ntypically feed hand-crafted features into hash functions, which separates the\nprocedures of feature extraction and hash function learning. In this paper, we\npropose a novel algorithm that concurrently performs feature engineering and\nnon-linear supervised hashing function learning. Our technical contributions in\nthis paper are two-folds: 1) deep network optimization is often achieved by\ngradient propagation, which critically requires a smooth objective function.\nThe discrete nature of hash codes makes them not amenable for gradient-based\noptimization. To address this issue, we propose an exponentiated hashing loss\nfunction and its bilinear smooth approximation. Effective gradient calculation\nand propagation are thereby enabled; 2) pre-training is an important trick in\nsupervised deep learning. The impact of pre-training on the hash code quality\nhas never been discussed in current deep hashing literature. We propose a\npre-training scheme inspired by recent advance in deep network based image\nclassification, and experimentally demonstrate its effectiveness. Comprehensive\nquantitative evaluations are conducted on several widely-used image benchmarks.\nOn all benchmarks, our proposed deep hashing algorithm outperforms all\nstate-of-the-art competitors by significant margins. In particular, our\nalgorithm achieves a near-perfect 0.99 in terms of Hamming ranking accuracy\nwith only 12 bits on MNIST, and a new record of 0.74 on the CIFAR10 dataset. In\ncomparison, the best accuracies obtained on CIFAR10 by existing hashing\nalgorithms without or with deep networks are known to be 0.36 and 0.58\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2016 02:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-15"}

One is the halo\noccupation distribution (HOD) model and the other two are extensions of the\nsubhalo abundance matching (SHAM) model by allowing the central and satellite\ngalaxies to have different occupation distributions in the host halos and\nsubhalos. Parameters in all the models are chosen to best describe the\nprojected and redshift-space two-point correlation functions (2PCFs) of the\nsame set of galaxies. All three model predictions agree well with the 3PCF\nmeasurements for the most luminous galaxy sample, while the HOD model better\nperforms in matching the 3PCFs of fainter samples (with luminosity threshold\nbelow $L^*$), which is similar in trend to the case of fitting the 2PCFs. The\ndecomposition of the model 3PCFs into contributions from different types of\ngalaxy triplets shows that on small scales the dependence of the 3PCFs on\ntriangle shape is driven by nonlinear redshift-space distortion (and not by the\nintrinsic halo shape) while on large scales it reflects the filamentary\nstructure. The decomposition also reveals more detailed differences in the\nthree models, which are related to the radial distribution, the mean occupation\nfunction, and the velocity distribution of satellite galaxies inside halos.

Unlike past profiling approaches,\ncausal profiling indicates exactly where programmers should focus their\noptimization efforts, and quantifies their potential impact. Causal profiling\nworks by running performance experiments during program execution. Each\nexperiment calculates the impact of any potential optimization by virtually\nspeeding up code: inserting pauses that slow down all other code running\nconcurrently. The key insight is that this slowdown has the same relative\neffect as running that line faster, thus \"virtually\" speeding it up.\n  We present Coz, a causal profiler, which we evaluate on a range of\nhighly-tuned applications: Memcached, SQLite, and the PARSEC benchmark suite.\nCoz identifies previously unknown optimization opportunities that are both\nsignificant and targeted.

It allows optical\nclocks to be accessible to many precision measurement applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2016 06:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-20"}

In the realm of Banach spaces we obtain results such as the\nfollowing: (1) if $\\mathcal{U}$ is any ultrafilter and $X$ is any Banach space,\nthen the second dual $X^{\\ast\\ast}$ and the ultrapower $(X)_{\\mathcal{U}}$ have\nthe same generalized roundness as $X$, and (2) no Banach space of positive\ngeneralized roundness is uniformly homeomorphic to $c_{0}$ or $\\ell_{p}$, $2 <\np < \\infty$.

Therefore, this paper proposes an unscented Kalman filter\n(UKF)-based method for estimating directions of arrival (DoAs) and times of\narrival (ToA) at ANs as well as performing joint 3D positioning and network\nsynchronization in a network-centric manner. In addition to the proposed\nUKF-based solution, the existing 2D extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based solution\nis extended to cover also realistic 3D positioning scenarios. Building on the\npremises of 5G ultra-dense networks (UDNs), the performance of both methods is\nevaluated and analysed in terms of DoA and ToA estimation as well as\npositioning and clock offset estimation accuracy, using the METIS map-based\nray-tracing channel model and 3D trajectories for vehicles and unmanned aerial\nvehicles (UAVs) through the Madrid grid.

Thereby, we\ndistinguish two scenarios depending on whether or not statistical channel\nknowledge is available. In particular, we derive maximum likelihood (ML) and\nleast sum of square errors (LSSE) estimators which do not require any knowledge\nof the channel statistics. For the case, when statistical channel knowledge is\navailable, the corresponding maximum a posteriori (MAP) and linear minimum mean\nsquare error (LMMSE) estimators are provided. As performance bound, we derive\nthe classical Cramer Rao (CR) lower bound, valid for any unbiased estimator,\nwhich does not exploit statistical channel knowledge, and the Bayesian CR lower\nbound, valid for any unbiased estimator, which exploits statistical channel\nknowledge. Finally, we propose optimal and suboptimal training sequence designs\nfor the considered MC system. Simulation results confirm the analysis and\ncompare the performance of the proposed estimation techniques with the\nrespective CR lower bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2016 10:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

In the simulations, NGC 205 was surrounded by massless particles to\nstatistically sample the distribution of the sub-subhalos expected in a subhalo\nthat has a mass similar to NGC 205. We made Monte Carlo samplings and found\nthat, using a set of reference parameters, the probability of producing a\nthinner distribution of sub-subhalos than the observed NGC 205 + 15 smaller\nsatellites (thus including the 2 counter-rotators, but excluding M32) increased\nfrom <1e-8 for the initial distribution to ~0.01 at pericentre.

We use a deep\nX-shooter spectrum ( lambda = 350-2300 nm, R between 8000 and 18000) detecting\nlines with upper energies from 8000 to 31000 cm-1 . Statistical equilibrium and\nionization models are adopted to derive the jet main physical parameters. We\nderive the physical conditions for the extended high velocity jet (HVC, V about\n-100 km/s) and for the low velocity and compact gas (LVC, V about -20-50 \\kms).\nAt the jet base (< 200 AU) the HVC is mostly neutral (x(e)< 0.1) and very dense\n(n(H) > 5x10^5 cm-3). The LVC gas has the same density and A_V as the HVC, but\nit is a factor of two colder. Iron abundance in the HVC is close to solar,\nwhile it is 3 times subsolar in the LVC, suggesting an origin of the LVC gas\nfrom a dusty disk. We infer a jet mass flux rate > 5x10^{-7} Mo/yr. We find\nthat the relationships between accretion luminosity and line luminosity derived\nfor T Tauri stars cannot be directly extended to class I sources surrounded by\nreflection nebulae since the permitted lines are seen through scattered light.\nAn accretion rate of about 7\\,10^{-6} Mo/yr is instead derived from an\nempirical relationship connecting the mass accretion rate with L([OI])(HVC). In\nconclusion, the HH34 IRS jet shares many properties with jets from active CTTs\nstars. It is however denser as a consequence of the larger mass flux rate.\nThese findings suggest that the acceleration and excitation mechanisms in jets\nare not influenced by evolution and are similar in CTTs and in still embedded\nand highly accreting sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2016 13:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

Assuming a circular orbit, the relative\ndisk sizes are compatible with theoretical predictions for tidal truncation by\na binary system having a mass ratio of $\\sim$0.2, in agreement with the\nreported relative separations of the two protostars from the center of their\ncircumbinary disk. The transition radii of both disks, however, are a factor of\n$\\gtrsim$1.5 smaller than their predicted tidally-truncated radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2016 14:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

Here we define\ninterface quality to be the inverse of the sum in quadrature of roughness and\nintermixing. We find that samples with the top Co/Pt layers grown at 250\ndegrees C exhibit a local maximum in roughness-intermixing and that the\ninterface quality is better for lower or higher deposition temperatures, up to\n400 degrees C, above which the interface quality degrades. Imaging the\nexpansion of magnetic domains in an in-plane field using wide-field Kerr\nmicroscopy, we determine the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction\n(DMI) in films in the deposition temperature range 100 degrees C to 300 degrees\nC. The net DMI is linked to the difference in top and bottom Co interface\nqualities; the net DMI increases as the difference between top and bottom Co\ninterface quality increases. Furthermore, for sufficiently low base pressures,\nthe net DMI increases linearly with the deposition temperature, indicating that\nfine-tuning of the DMI may be achieved via the deposition conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2016 15:31:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

Due to large number and diverse programming\nbackground of students, providing timely and personalised feedback to\nindividual students is a challenging task for any CS1 instructor. The help\nprovided by teaching assistants (typically senior students) is not sufficient\nas it suffers from unintentional bias and, most of the time, not quick enough.\n  In this paper, we present Prutor, a tutoring system platform to conduct\nintroductory programming courses. Prutor is a cloud-based web application that\nprovides instant and useful feedback to students while solving programming\nproblems. Prutor stores, at regular intervals, the snapshots of students'\nattempts to solve programming problems. These intermediate versions of the\nstudent programs provide the instructors (and data analysts) a view of the\nstudents' approach to solving programming problems. Since Prutor is accessible\nthrough any standard web browser, students do not need to worry about\ndependencies external to the programming course, viz. Operating Systems,\nEditors, Compilers, Compiler Options, etc.. This enables the students to focus\non solving only the programming problems. Apart from the code snapshots at\nregular intervals, Prutor also collects other valuable data such as the time\ntaken by the students to solve the problems, the number of compile and\nexecution events, and the errors made. We have used this data in developing\nintelligent tools for giving feedback to students, some of which are described\nbriefly in this paper. This system thus serves as a platform for tutoring as\nwell as data collection for researchers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2016 15:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-03"}

Since cool stars\nare likely to be surrounded by planets, understanding the host star winds and\nmagnetism is a key step towards characterisation of exoplanetary environments.\nAs rotation and activity are intimately related, the spin down of stars leads\nto a decrease in stellar activity with age.
