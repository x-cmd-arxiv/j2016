On the other hand, demand-side's\nactivities could effectively mitigate the supply scarcity and absorb most of\nthese shocks and therefore smooth out the price volatility. In this paper, the\npositive effects of employing demand response programs on the spot market price\nare investigated. A demand-price elasticity based model is used to simulate the\ncustomer reaction function in the presence of a real time pricing. The demand\nachieve by DR program is used to adjust the spot market price by using a price\nregression model. SAS software is used to run the multiple linear regression\nmodel and MATLAB is used to simulate the demand response model. The approach is\napplied on one week data in summer 2014 of Connecticut in New England ISO. It\ncould be concluded from the results of this study that applying DR program\nsmooths out most of the price spikes in the electricity spot market and\nconsiderably reduces the customers' electricity cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 16:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-23"}

Online ranker evaluation focuses on the challenge of efficiently\ndetermining, from implicit user feedback, which ranker out of a finite set of\nrankers is the best. Online ranker evaluation can be modeled by dueling ban-\ndits, a mathematical model for online learning under limited feedback from\npairwise comparisons. Comparisons of pairs of rankers is performed by\ninterleaving their result sets and examining which documents users click on.\nThe dueling bandits model addresses the key issue of which pair of rankers to\ncompare at each iteration, thereby providing a solution to the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off.

The key idea\nunderlying our technique is to look for a maximally suspicious common subgraph\n(MSCS) that is shared between all known instances of a malware family. An MSCS\ndescribes the shared functionality between multiple Android applications in\nterms of inter-component call relations and their semantic metadata (e.g.,\ndata-flow properties). Our approach identifies such maximally suspicious common\nsubgraphs by reducing the problem to maximum satisfiability. Once a semantic\nsignature is learned, our approach uses a combination of static analysis and a\nnew approximate signature matching algorithm to determine whether an Android\napplication matches the semantic signature characterizing a given malware\nfamily.\n  We have implemented our approach in a tool called ASTROID and show that it\nhas a number of advantages over state-of-the-art malware detection techniques.\nFirst, we compare the semantic malware signatures automatically synthesized by\nASTROID with manually-written signatures used in previous work and show that\nthe signatures learned by ASTROID perform better in terms of accuracy as well\nas precision. Second, we compare ASTROID against two state-of-the-art malware\ndetection tools and demonstrate its advantages in terms of interpretability and\naccuracy.

The system was conceived for\napplication to radio, millimeter and sub-millimeter telescope readout systems\nthat have requirements beyond typical off-the-shelf processing systems, such as\ncareful control of interference signals produced by the digital electronics,\nand clocking of all elements in the system from a single precise\nobservatory-derived oscillator. A new generation of telescopes operating at\nthese frequency bands and designed with a vastly increased emphasis on digital\nsignal processing to support their detector multiplexing technology or\nhigh-bandwidth correlators---data rates exceeding a terabyte per second---are\nbecoming common. The ICE system is built around a custom FPGA motherboard that\nmakes use of an Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA and ARM-based co-processor. The system is\nspecialized for specific applications through software, firmware, and custom\nmezzanine daughter boards that interface to the FPGA through the\nindustry-standard FMC specifications. For high density applications, the\nmotherboards are packaged in 16-slot crates with ICE backplanes that implement\na low-cost passive full-mesh network between the motherboards in a crate, allow\nhigh bandwidth interconnection between crates, and enable data offload to a\ncomputer cluster. A Python-based control software library automatically detects\nand operates the hardware in the array. Examples of specific telescope\napplications of the ICE framework are presented, namely the\nfrequency-multiplexed bolometer readout systems used for the SPT and Simons\nArray and the digitizer, F-engine, and networking engine for the CHIME and\nHIRAX radio interferometers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 19:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-23"}

To be consistent with stability\nconstraints, in two of these galaxies, the stellar mass-to-light ratio is a\nfactor of ~1.5-2 lower than the values suggested from galaxy colours. In\ncontrast, MOND fits to the rotation curves are poor in three galaxies, perhaps\nbecause the gas tracer contains noncircular motions.

This symmetry, which is\ndifferent from the usual parity symmetry of the left-right symmetric models,\npersists in the lepton sector even after the gauge symmetry breaks down to\n$SU(3)_C \\times U(1)_{\\rm EM}$. This keeps the lightest right-handed neutrino\nnaturally stable, thereby allowing it to play the role of dark matter (DM) in\nthe Universe. There are several differences between the usual left-right models\nand the model presented here: (i) our model can have two versions, one which\nhas no parity symmetry so that the couplings and masses in the $L$ and $R$\nsectors are unrelated, and another which has parity symmetry so that couplings\nare related; (ii) the $R$-sector fermions are chosen much heavier than the\n$L$-sector ones in both scenarios; and finally (iii) both light and heavy\nneutrinos are Majorana fermions with the light neutrino masses arising from a\npure type-II seesaw mechanism. We discuss the DM relic density, direct and\nindirect detection prospects and associated collider signatures of the model.\nComparing with current collider and direct detection constraints, we find a\nlower bound on the DM mass of order of 1 TeV. We also point out a way to relax\nthe DM unitarity bound in our model for much larger DM masses by an entropy\ndilution mechanism. An additional feature of the model is that the DM can be\nmade very long lived, if desired, by allowing for weak breaking of the above\n$Z_{2}$ symmetry.

Based on our measured interstellar medium (ISM) properties of\nstar-forming galaxies out to a radius of 2.5 Mpc from the cluster centre, we\nfind that the galaxy metallicity decreases as a function of projected\ncluster-centric distance (-0.15+/-0.08 dex/Mpc) in MACS1115+01.

Indeed, at the disc-corona interface, the mixing between the\ncold/metal-rich disc gas (T <~ 10^4 K) and the hot coronal gas (T >~ 10^6 K)\ncan dramatically reduce the cooling time of a portion of the corona and produce\nits condensation and accretion.

Here we investigate the conditions under which a single WD in a\nbinary system might extract energy from its orbit, depositing enough energy\ninto a resonant mode such that it detonates before merger. We show that,\nignoring non-linear effects, in a WD binary in tidal lock at small binary\nseparations, the sustained tidal forcing of a low-order quadrupolar g-mode or a\nharmonic of a low-order quadrupolar p-mode could in principle drive the average\ntemperature of Carbon nuclei in the mode over the runaway fusion threshold. If\ngrowing mode energy is thermalized at a core/atmosphere boundary, rapid Helium\nburning and inward-travelling p-waves may result in core detonation.\nThermalization at a boundary in the core can also result in detonation. If\nenergy can be efficiently transferred from the orbit to modes as the WD binary\npasses through resonances, the WD merger timescale will be shortened by Myr-Gyr\ncompared to expected timescales from GW-emission alone and GW detectors will\nobserve deviations from predicted chirp profiles in resolved WD binaries.\nFuture work in this area should focus on whether tidal locking in WD binaries\nis naturally driven towards low-order mode frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 20:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

Thus, an extensive sample of obliquities for low mass\nplanets can help to indicate the presence of such a population. (...) Some of\nour simulations also produce planetary systems with planets that survive in the\nhabitable zone but have no planets interior to them -- much as in the case of\nour Solar System. This suggests that such a configuration may not be altogether\nrare, but may occur around a few percent of FGK stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 20:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

The number of published approaches to flare\nforecasting using photospheric magnetic field observations has proliferated,\nwith varying claims about how well each works. Because of the different\nanalysis techniques and data sets used, it is essentially impossible to compare\nthe results from the literature. This problem is exacerbated by the low event\nrates of large solar flares. The challenges of forecasting rare events have\nlong been recognized in the meteorology community, but have yet to be fully\nacknowledged by the space weather community. During the interagency workshop on\n\"all clear\" forecasts held in Boulder, CO in 2009, the performance of a number\nof existing algorithms was compared on common data sets, specifically\nline-of-sight magnetic field and continuum intensity images from MDI, with\nconsistent definitions of what constitutes an event. We demonstrate the\nimportance of making such systematic comparisons, and of using standard\nverification statistics to determine what constitutes a good prediction scheme.\nWhen a comparison was made in this fashion, no one method clearly outperformed\nall others, which may in part be due to the strong correlations among the\nparameters used by different methods to characterize an active region. For\nM-class flares and above, the set of methods tends towards a weakly positive\nskill score (as measured with several distinct metrics), with no participating\nmethod proving substantially better than climatological forecasts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 21:33:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

(2015, H15). Motivated by an \"upside-down\"\nscenario for thick disk formation, in which the thickness of the star-forming\ngas layer contracts as the stellar mass of the disk grows, we combine one-zone\nchemical evolution with a simple prescription in which the scale-height of the\nstellar distribution drops linearly from z_h=0.8 kpc to z_h=0.2 kpc over a\ntimescale t_c, remaining constant thereafter. We assume a linear-exponential\nstar-formation history, SFR ~ te^{-t/t_sf}. With a star-formation efficiency\ntimescale of 2 Gyr, an outflow mass-loading factor of 1.5, t_sf=3 Gyr, and\nt_c=2.5 Gyr, the model reproduces the observed locus of inner disk stars in\n[alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] and the metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) measured by\nH15 at |z|=0-0.5 kpc, 0.5-1 kpc, and 1-2 kpc. Substantial changes to model\nparameters lead to disagreement with the H15 data; for example, models with\nt_c=1 Gyr or t_sf=1 Gyr fail to match the observed MDF at high-|z| and low-|z|,\nrespectively. The inferred scale-height evolution, with z_h(t) dropping on a\ntimescale t_c ~ t_sf at large lookback times, favors upside-down formation over\ndynamical heating of an initially thin stellar population as the primary\nmechanism regulating disk thickness. The failure of our short-t_c models\nsuggests that any model in which thick disk formation is a discrete event will\nnot reproduce the continuous dependence of the MDF on |z| found by H15. Our\nscenario for the evolution of the inner disk can be tested by future\nmeasurements of the |z|-distribution and the age-metallicity distribution at\nR=3-5 kpc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2016 00:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

To work with\nlarge datasets, researchers propose PKMeans, which is a parallel k-means on\nMapReduce. However, the existing k-means parallelization methods including\nPKMeans have many limitations. PKMeans can't finish all its iterations in one\nMapReduce job, so it has to repeat cascading MapReduce jobs in a loop until\nconvergence. On the most popular MapReduce platform, Hadoop, every MapReduce\njob introduces significant I/O overheads and extra execution time at stages of\njob start-up and shuffling. Even worse, it has been proved that in the worst\ncase, k-means needs $2^{{\\Omega}(n)}$ MapReduce jobs to converge, where n is\nthe number of data instances, which means huge overheads for large datasets.\nAdditionally, in PKMeans, at most one reducer can be assigned to and update\neach centroid, so PKMeans can only make use of limited number of parallel\nreducers.

The axiomatic formulation of Lehmann, Symanzik and Zimmermann\nis adopted. The analyticity properties of the causal, the retarded and the\nadvanced functions associated with the four point elastic amplitudes are\nstudied. The analog of the Lehmann-Jost-Dyson representation is obtained in\nhigher dimensional field theories. The generalized J-L-D representation is\nutilized to derive the t-plane analyticity property of the amplitude. The\nexistence of an ellipse analogous to the Lehmann ellipse is demonstrated. Thus\na fixed-t dispersion relation can be written down with finite number of\nsubtractions due to the temperedness of the amplitudes. The domain of\nanalyticity of scattering amplitude in $s$ and $t$ variables is extended by\nimposing unitarity constraints. A generalized version of Martin's theorem is\nderived to prove the existence of such a domain in D-dimensional field\ntheories. It is shown that the amplitude can be expanded in a power series in t\nwhich converges for |t|<R; R being s-independent. The positivity properties of\nabsorptive amplitudes are derived to prove the $t$-plane analyticity of\namplitude.

The implementation of their algorithm depends on two\nseparate offline oracles and the distribution dependent regret additionally\nrequires existence of a unique optimal action for the learner. Adopting their\nCPM model, our first contribution is a Phased Exploration with Greedy\nExploitation (PEGE) algorithmic framework for the problem. Different algorithms\nwithin the framework achieve $O(T^{2/3}\\sqrt{\\log T})$ distribution independent\nand $O(\\log^2 T)$ distribution dependent regret respectively. Crucially, our\nframework needs only the simpler \"argmax\" oracle from GCB and the distribution\ndependent regret does not require existence of a unique optimal action. Our\nsecond contribution is another algorithm, PEGE2, which combines gap estimation\nwith a PEGE algorithm, to achieve an $O(\\log T)$ regret bound, matching the GCB\nguarantee but removing the dependence on size of the learner's action space.\nHowever, like GCB, PEGE2 requires access to both offline oracles and the\nexistence of a unique optimal action. Finally, we discuss how our algorithm can\nbe efficiently applied to a CPM problem of practical interest: namely, online\nranking with feedback at the top.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2016 07:14:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

The ability to perform, in a\nprovably correct manner, such a complex task at the servo level can lead to a\nlarge increase in the speed of operation, low energy consumption and high\nquality of response. Planning has been traditionally limited to the high level\ncontroller of a robot. The guidance velocity signal from this stage is usually\nconverted to a control signal using what is known as an electronic speed\ncontroller (ESC). This paper demonstrates the ability of the harmonic potential\nfield (HPF) approach to generate a provably correct, constrained, well behaved\ntrajectory and control signal for a rigid, nonholonomic robot in a stationary,\ncluttered environment. It is shown that the HPF based, servo level planner can\naddress a large number of challenges facing planning in a realistic situation.\nThe suggested approach migrates the rich and provably correct properties of the\nsolution trajectories from an HPF planner to those of the robot. This is\nachieved using a synchronizing control signal whose aim is to align the\nvelocity of the robot in its local coordinates, with that of the gradient of\nthe HPF. The link between the two is made possible by representing the robot\nusing what the paper terms separable form. The context-sensitive and\ngoal-oriented control signal used to steer the robot is demonstrated to be well\nbehaved and robust in the presence of actuator noise, saturation and\nuncertainty in the parameters. The approach is developed, proofs of correctness\nare provided and the capabilities of the scheme are demonstrated using\nsimulation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2016 08:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

Our aim is to treat in generality the problem of depolarizing\nisotropic collisions between singly ionized atoms and neutral hydrogen in its\nground state. Using our numerical code, we computed the collisional\ndepolarization rates of the $p$-levels of ions for large number of values of\nthe effective principal quantum number $n^{*}$ and the Uns\\\"old energy $E_p$.\nThen, genetic programming has been utilized to fit the available depolarization\nrates.

These\nrelationships allow quick calculations of the depolarizing collisional rates of\nany simple ion which is very useful for the solar physics community.

Here, we\nshow that for an even-parity nodal superconducting state which spontaneously\nbreaks time-reversal symmetry, the low-energy excitation spectrum generally\ndoes not belong to any of these categories, instead it has extended Bogoliubov\nFermi surfaces. These Fermi surfaces can be visualized as two-dimensional\nsurfaces generated by \"inflating\" point or line nodes into spheroids or tori,\nrespectively. These inflated nodes are topologically protected from being\ngapped by a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant, which we give in terms of a Pfaffian. We\nalso show that superconducting states possessing these Fermi surfaces can be\nenergetically stable. A crucial ingredient in our theory is that more than one\nband is involved in the pairing, since all candidate materials for even-parity\nsuperconductivity with broken time-reversal symmetry are multiband systems, we\nexpect these $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-protected Fermi surfaces to be ubiquitous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2016 11:10:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2017 16:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

The dominator tree $D$ of $G$ is a tree rooted at $s$, such that a\nvertex $v$ is an ancestor of a vertex $w$ if and only if all paths from $s$ to\n$w$ include $v$. The dominator tree is a central tool in program optimization\nand code generation and has many applications in other diverse areas including\nconstraint programming, circuit testing, biology, and in algorithms for graph\nconnectivity problems. A low-high order of $G$ is a preorder $\\delta$ of $D$\nthat certifies the correctness of $D$ and has further applications in\nconnectivity and path-determination problems. In this paper, we first consider\nhow to maintain efficiently a low-high order of a flow graph incrementally\nunder edge insertions. We present algorithms that run in $O(mn)$ total time for\na sequence of $m$ edge insertions in an initially empty flow graph with $n$\nvertices.These immediately provide the first incremental certifying algorithms\nfor maintaining the dominator tree in $O(mn)$ total time, and also imply\nincremental algorithms for other problems. Hence, we provide a substantial\nimprovement over the $O(m^2)$ simple-minded algorithms, which recompute the\nsolution from scratch after each edge insertion. We also show how to apply\nlow-high orders to obtain a linear-time $2$-approximation algorithm for the\nsmallest $2$-vertex-connected spanning subgraph problem (2VCSS). Finally, we\npresent efficient implementations of our new algorithms for the incremental\nlow-high and 2VCSS problems and conduct an extensive experimental study on\nreal-world graphs taken from a variety of application areas. The experimental\nresults show that our algorithms perform very well in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2016 11:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

However, the regulation\nof gene expression at the level of an individual cell involves reactions\nbetween finite numbers of molecules, and this can result in inherent randomness\nin expression dynamics, which blurs the boundaries between aperiodic\nfluctuations and noisy oscillators. Thus, there is an acute need for an\nobjective statistical method for classifying whether an experimentally derived\nnoisy time series is periodic.

We construct the\nHilbert space $\\mathscr{H}$ of the photon by endowing the vector space of the\nfields $A$ in the temporal-Coulomb gauge with a positive-definite and\nrelativistically invariant inner product. We give an explicit expression for\nthis inner product, identify the Hamiltonian for the photon with the generator\nof time translations in $\\mathscr{H}$, determine the operators representing the\nmomentum and the helicity of the photon, and introduce a chirality operator\nwhose eigenfunctions correspond to fields having a definite sign of energy. We\nalso construct a position operator for the photon whose components commute with\neach other and with the chirality and helicity operators. This allows for the\nconstruction of the localized states of the photon with a definite sign of\nenergy and helicity. We derive an explicit formula for the latter and compute\nthe corresponding electric and magnetic fields. These turn out to diverge not\njust at the point where the photon is localized but on a plane containing this\npoint. We identify the axis normal to this plane with an associated symmetry\naxis, and show that each choice of this axis specifies a particular position\noperator, a corresponding position basis, and a position representation of the\nquantum mechanics of photon. In particular, we examine the position wave\nfunctions determined by such a position basis, elucidate their relationship\nwith the Riemann-Silberstein and Landau-Peierls wave functions, and give an\nexplicit formula for the probability density of the spatial localization of the\nphoton.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2016 12:08:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2017 17:01:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 12:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

Previous\nstudies (Cortes et al., 2012) already proved the ability of GeMS (the Gemini\nMulti-Conjugated AO system) in retrieving CN2 and wind vertical stratification\nusing the telemetry data. To assess the reliability of the GeMS wind speed\nestimates a preliminary study (Neichel et al., 2014) compared wind speed\nretrieved from GeMS with that obtained with the atmospherical model Meso-Nh on\na small sample of nights providing promising results. The latter technique is\nvery reliable for the wind speed vertical stratification.

In order to understand\nthe difference between the simulation results and the conventional ellipsoidal\ncollapse model (EC), we first consider the evolution of individual simulated\nhalos. The major difference between EC and the simulation becomes appreciable\nafter the turn-around epoch. Moreover, it is sensitive to the individual\nevolution history of each halo. Despite such strong dependence on individual\nhalos, the resulting nonsphericity of halos exhibits weak but robust mass\ndependence in a statistical fashion; massive halos are more spherical up to the\nturn-around, but gradually become less spherical by z = 0. This is clearly\ninconsistent with the EC prediction; massive halos are usually more spherical.\nIn addition, at z=0, inner regions of the halos are less spherical than outer\nregions, i.e., the density distribution inside the halos is highly\ninhomogeneous and therefore not self-similar. Since most of previous fitting\nformulae for the PDF of axis ratio of triaxial ellipsoids have been constructed\nunder the self-similarity assumption, they are not accurate. Indeed, we compute\nthe PDF of projected axis ratio a1/a2 directly from the simulation data without\nthe self-similarity assumption, and find that it is very sensitive to the\nassumption. The latter needs to be carefully taken into account in direct\ncomparison with observations, and therefore we provide an empirical fitting\nformula for the PDF of a1/a2. Our preliminary analysis suggests that the\nderived PDF of a1/a2 roughly agrees with the current weak-lensing observations.\nMore importantly, the present results will be useful in future exploration of\nthe non-sphericity of clusters in X-ray and optical observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2016 13:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

Until recently, Doppler radar has been prohibitively\nexpensive for many users. This paper reports results of exploring potential\napplications and accuracy using a recently available, inexpensive (< $600 US)\namateur Doppler radar system to determine drag coefficients for projectiles of\nvarious sizes (4.4 mm to 9 mm diameter) and speeds (M0.3 to M3.0). In many\ncases, drag coefficients can be determined with an accuracy of 1% or better if\nsignal-to-noise ratio is sufficient and projectiles vary little between trials.\nIt is also straightforward to design experiments for determining drag over a\nwide range of velocities. Experimental approaches and limitations are\ndescribed. Overall, the amateur radar system shows greater accuracy, ease of\nuse, and simplicity compared with optical chronographs. Doppler radar has\nadvantages of working well with less accurate projectiles without putting\nequipment at risk of projectile impact downrange. The system can also detect\nphenomena that optical chronographs cannot, such as projectile instability\nresulting in tumbling in flight.

A canonical spherical geometry is\nconsidered consisting of a spherical suspension of colloidal gold nanoparticles\ncharacterized as an arbitrary passive dielectric material which is immersed in\nan arbitrary lossy medium. A relative heating coefficient and a corresponding\noptimal near field excitation are defined taking the skin effect of the\nsurrounding medium into account. For small particle suspensions the optimal\nexcitation is an electric dipole field for which explicit asymptotic\nexpressions are readily obtained. It is then proven that the optimal\npermittivity function yielding a maximal absorption inside the spherical\nsuspension is a conjugate match with respect to the surrounding lossy material.\nFor a surrounding medium consisting of a weak electrolyte solution the optimal\nconjugate match can then readily be realized at a single frequency, e.g., by\ntuning the parameters of a Drude model corresponding to the electrophoretic\nparticle acceleration mechanism. As such, the conjugate match can also be\nregarded to yield an optimal plasmonic resonance. Finally, a convex\noptimization approach is used to investigate the realizability of a passive\nmaterial to approximate the desired conjugate match over a finite bandwidth.\nThe relation of the proposed approach to general Mie theory as well as to the\napproximation of metamaterials are discussed. Numerical examples are included\nto illustrate the ultimate potential of heating in a realistic scenario in the\nmicrowave regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2016 13:54:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2016 18:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

In the dynamic maximum flow problem, the goal is to\nmaximize the flow reaching the sink within a given time horizon $T$, while flow\nrequires a certain travel time to traverse an edge.\n  In our setting, we account for uncertain travel times of flow. We investigate\nmaximum flows over time under the assumption that at most $\\Gamma$ travel times\nmay be prolonged simultaneously due to delay. We develop and study a\nmathematical model for this problem.

We show that\nthis system is highly nonlinear and can be understood through the use of\ndressed photon-orbital states, enabling a unified understanding of the six\nmicrowave resonance lines we observe. Some of these resonances are inter-valley\nspin transitions that arise from a non-adiabatic process in which both the\nvalley and the spin degree of freedom are excited simultaneously. For these\ntransitions, involving a change in valley-orbit state, we find a tenfold\nincrease in sensitivity to electric fields and electrical noise compared to\npure spin transitions, strongly reducing the phase coherence when changes in\nvalley-orbit index are incurred. In contrast to this non-adiabatic transition,\nthe pure spin transitions, whether arising from harmonic or subharmonic\ngeneration, are shown to be adiabatic in the orbital sector.

This state, dubbed as time MPS (tMPS), is a boundary state of tensor\nnetwork (TN) that represents the ground-state simulation after Trotter-Suzuki\ndecomposition. We show that the tMPS exhibits the structure of the continuous\nMPS originally proposed for the field theories. The information of excitations,\ne.g., dynamic correlation length and energy gap, can be accurately calculated\nfrom the tMPS. The non-universal renormalization of velocity of the excitations\nis given by a ratio between the correlations of the ground state and the tMPS.\nWhen the system is at the quantum critical point, the tMPS is found to show the\nlogarithmic scaling law, where the scaling coefficient gives the central charge\nthat characterizes the criticality of the theory. Our work also implies that\nthe spectra of the transfer matrices defined by the ground state and tMPS\nprovide information of the low-lying masses of the theory in the continuous\nlimit. This could help to understand the role of the finiteness of the bond\ndimension as an infra red regulator.

Our goal is to examine these rates in the context of\nbulge building and secular morphological evolution along the Hubble sequence.\nStellar surface density maps of the sample galaxies are derived from SINGS\n3.6um and SDSS i-band images. Corresponding molecular and atomic gas surface\ndensities are derived from published CO(1-0) and HI interferometric\nobservations of the BIMA SONG, THINGS, and VIVA surveys. The mass flow rate\ncalculations utilize a volume-type torque integral to calculate the angular\nmomentum exchange rate between the basic state disk matter and density wave\nmodes. The potential-density phase shift approach yields angular momentum\ntransport rates several times higher than those estimated using the Lynden-Bell\nand Kalnajs (1972) approach. The current approach leads to predictions of\nsignificant mass redistribution induced by the quasi-steady density wave modes,\nenough for the morphological types of disks to evolve substantially within its\nlifetime. This difference with the earlier conclusions of Lynden-Bell and\nKalnajs reflects the dominant role played by collisionless shocks in the\nsecular evolution of galaxies containing extremely non-linear, quasi-steady\ndensity wave modes, thus enabling significant morphological transformation\nalong the Hubble sequence during a Hubble time. We show for the first time\nalso, using observational data, that STELLAR mass accretion/excretion is just\nas important, and oftentimes much more important, than the corresponding\naccretion/excretion processes in the GASEOUS component, with the latter being\nwhat had been emphasized in most of the previous secular evolution studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 20:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}
