Due to\nasynchronous communication, process faults, or network failures, these\nalgorithms are difficult to design and verify. Many algorithms achieve fault\ntolerance by using threshold guards that, for instance, ensure that a process\nwaits until it has received an acknowledgment from a majority of its peers.\nConsequently, domain-specific languages for fault-tolerant distributed systems\noffer language support for threshold guards.\n  We introduce an automated method for model checking of safety and liveness of\nthreshold-guarded distributed algorithms in systems where the number of\nprocesses and the fraction of faulty processes are parameters.

Recently enhancing search\nresults with diversification have received much attention. In this paper, we\nexplore an novel problem of searching for top-k diversified similar nodes in\nattributed networks, with the motivation that modeling diversification in an\nattributed network should consider both the emergence of network links and the\nattribute features of nodes such as user profile information. We formulate this\npractical problem as two optimization problems: the Attributed Coverage\nDiversification (ACD) problem and the r-Dissimilar Attributed Coverage\nDiversification (r-DACD) problem. Based on the submodularity and the\nmonotonicity of ACD, we propose an efficient greedy algorithm achieving a tight\napproximation guarantee of 1-1/e. Unlike the expension based methods only\nconsidering nodes' neighborhood, ACD generalize the definition of\ndiversification to nodes' own features. To capture diversification in\ntopological structure of networks, the r-DACD problem introduce a dissimilarity\nconstraint. We refer to this problem as the Dissimilarity Constrained\nNon-monotone Submodular Maximization (DCNSM) problem. We prove that there is no\nconstant-factor approximation for DCNSM, and also present an efficient greedy\nalgorithms achieving $1/\\rho$ approximation, where $\\rho\\le\\Delta$, $\\Delta$ is\nthe maximum degree of its dissimilarity based graph. To the best of our\nknowledge, it is the first approximation algorithm for the Submodular\nMaximization problem with a distance constraint. The experimental results on\nreal-world attributed network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethods, and confirm that adding dissimilarity constraint can significantly\nenhance the performance of diversification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2016 17:45:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-19"}

Prior to Fourier transform we apply a\nrotational symmetric 50% Tukey window to apodize the data. We derive average as\nwell as position angle dependent power spectra. Anisotropies in the power\ndistribution are defined as the ratio of the spectral power in orthogonal\ndirections. We find strong anisotropies.

Intriguingly, we found that the\nsuppression of the low-frequency optical conductivity and spectral weight\ntransfer appear at a temperature $T^{\\ast}$ much higher than the SDW transition\ntemperature $T_{SDW}$. Since this behavior has the same optical feature and\nenergy scale as the SDW order, we attribute it to SDW fluctuations.\nFurthermore, $T^{\\ast}$ is suppressed with doping, closely following the doping\ndependence of the nematic fluctuations detected by other techniques. These\nresults suggest that the magnetic and nematic orders have an intimate\nrelationship, in favor of the magnetic-fluctuation-driven nematicity scenario\nin iron-based superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2016 02:06:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

Since\ntraffic data is large-scale time-structured data accompanied with noise and\noutliers under partial observations, an efficient modeling method is essential.\nTo this end, this paper proposes an online subspace tracking of a Hankelized\ntime-structured traffic tensor for normal flows based on the Candecomp/PARAFAC\ndecomposition exploiting the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm.

We explore this analogy by devising a simple architecture for a\nbiochemical network that can function as an associative memory.

Our starting point is a master equation in Lindblad\nform, which can be taken as the quantum analogue of the rate equation for a\nclassical continuous-time Markov chain. The quantum jump method is well known\nin the quantum optics community and has also been applied to simulate open\nquantum walks in discrete time. This method however, is well-suited to\ncontinuous-time problems. It is shown here that a continuous-time hitting\nproblem is amenable to analysis via quantum jumps: The hitting time can be\ndefined as the time of the first jump. Using this fact, we derive the\ndistribution of hitting times and explicit exressions for its statistical\nmoments. Simple examples are considered to illustrate the final results. We\nthen show that the hitting statistics obtained via quantum jumps is consistent\nwith a previous definition for a measured walk in discrete time\n[Phys.~Rev.~A~{\\bf 73}, 032341 (2006)] (when generalised to allow for\nnon-unitary evolution and in the limit of small time steps).

Laboratory experiments of rotating\nquasi-Keplerian flows, for which the angular velocity decreases radially but\nthe angular momentum increases, are however laminar at Reynolds numbers\nexceeding one million. This is in apparent contradiction to direct numerical\nsimulations showing that in these experiments turbulence transition is\ntriggered by the axial boundaries.

As another application, we present a unified approach to several\ndimensional inequalities in C*-algebras, which is done through the notion of\norder zero dimension for an (equivariant) *-homomorphism. Finiteness of the\norder zero dimension implies that the dimension of the target algebra can be\nbounded by the dimension of the domain. The dimension can be, among others,\ndecomposition rank, nuclear dimension, or Rokhlin dimension. As a consequence,\nwe obtain new inequalities for these quantities.\n  As a third application we obtain the following result: if a C*-algebra $A$\nabsorbs a strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra $D$, and $\\alpha $ is an action of\na compact group $G$ on $A$ with finite Rokhlin dimension with commuting towers,\nthen $\\alpha $ absorbs any strongly self-absorbing action of $G$ on $% D$. This\nhas a number of interesting consequences, already in the case of the trivial\naction on $D$. For example, we deduce that $D$-stability passes from $A$ to the\ncrossed product. Additionally, in many cases of interest, our result restricts\nthe possible values of the Rokhlin dimension to $0, 1$ and $\\infty$, showing a\nstriking parallel to the behavior of the nuclear dimension for simple\nC*-algebras. We also show that an action of a finite group with finite Rokhlin\ndimension with commuting towers automatically has the Rokhlin property if the\nalgebra is UHF-absorbing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2016 08:35:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 15:58:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 09:57:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-02"}

To improve the efficiency of spectrum utilization,\ngame theory has been applied to study the spectrum sharing in wireless networks\nfor a long time. However, the scale of wireless network in existing studies is\nrelatively small. In this paper, we introduce a novel game and model the\nspectrum sharing problem as an aggregative game for large-scale, heterogeneous,\nand dynamic networks. The massive usage of spectrum also leads to easier\nprivacy divulgence of spectrum users' actions, which calls for privacy and\ntruthfulness guarantees in wireless network. In a large decentralized scenario,\neach user has no priori about other users' decisions, which forms an incomplete\ninformation game. A \"weak mediator\", e.g., the base station or licensed\nspectrum regulator, is introduced and turns this game into a complete one,\nwhich is essential to reach a Nash equilibrium (NE). By utilizing past\nexperience on the channel access, we propose an online learning algorithm to\nimprove the utility of each user, achieving NE over time. Our learning\nalgorithm also provides no regret guarantee to each user. Our mechanism admits\nan approximate ex-post NE.

In this analysis, we present the\nfirst ALICE results on the $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ differential $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and\n$v_{4}$ for $\\pi^{\\pm}$, $\\mathrm{K}^{\\pm}$, p($\\bar p$) from the high\nstatistics 2011 heavy-ion run. We investigate how these $v_{n}$ coefficients\nevolve with particle mass and centrality for the 0--1\\% and 20--30\\% centrality\nranges. These new measurements aim at differentiating between models that use\ndifferent initial conditions, constraining further the value of $\\eta/s$ and\nallowing to decouple the influence of the late hadronic stage from the\nhydrodynamic evolution of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2016 09:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-13"}

In our previous\nstudy, we showed that seismic inversions of integrated quantities could be used\nto constrain microscopic diffusion in the A component. In this study, we\nanalyse the B component in the light of a more regularised inversion. We wish\nto analyse independently the B component of the 16Cyg binary system using the\ninversion of an indicator dedicated to analyse core conditions, denoted tu.\nUsing this independent determination, we wish to analyse any differences\nbetween both stars due to the potential influence of planetary formation on\nstellar structure and/or their respective evolution. First, we recall the\nobservational constraints for 16CygB and the method we used to generate\nreference stellar models. The inversion results were then used to analyse the\ndifferences between the A and B components. The tu indicator for 16CygB shows a\ndisagreement with models including microscopic diffusion and sharing the\nchemical composition previously derived for 16CygA. Small changes in chemical\ncomposition are insufficient to solve the problem but that extra mixing can\naccount for the differences seen between both stars. We use a parametric\napproach to analyse the impact of extra mixing in the form of turbulent\ndiffusion on the behaviour of the tu values. We conclude on the necessity of\nfurther investigations using models with a physically motivated implementation\nof extra mixing including additional constraints to further improve the\naccuracy with which the fundamental parameters of this system are determined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2016 09:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

In this situation, the derivative of\nthe function is small in the local direction of a vector field $\\mathbf{b}$. In\norder to define a discrete representation, a set of surfaces $M_i$ indexed by\nan integer $i$ are chosen such that mapping along the field $\\mathbf{b}$\ninduces a one-to-one relation between the points on surface $M_i$ to those on\n$M_{i+1}$. For simple cases $M_i$ may be surfaces of constant coordinate value.\nOn each surface $M_i$, a function description is constructed using basis\nfunctions defined on a regular structured mesh. The definition of each basis\nfunction is extended from the surface $M$ along the lines of the field\n$\\mathbf{b}$ by multiplying it by a smooth compact support function whose\nargument increases with distance along $\\mathbf{b}$. Function values are\nevaluated by summing contributions associated with each surface $M_i$. This\ndoes not require any special connectivity of the meshes used in the\nneighbouring surfaces $M$, which substantially simplifies the meshing problem\ncompared to attempting to find a space filling anisotropic mesh. We explore the\nnumerical properties of the scheme, and show that it can be used to efficiently\nsolve differential equations for certain anisotropic problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2016 12:19:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

We performed a\nsimulation study focusing on the effect of a binary treatment on a binary\noutcome with three confounders (two of them partially observed).

Twist,\ncharacterizing how the magnetic field lines wind around a main axis, is an\nintrinsic property of MFRs, closely related to the magnetic free energy and\nstableness. So far it is unclear how much amount of twist is carried by MFRs in\nthe solar atmosphere and in heliosphere and what role the twist played in the\neruptions of MFRs. Contrasting to the solar MFRs, there are lots of in-situ\nmeasurements of magnetic clouds (MCs), the large-scale MFRs in interplanetary\nspace, providing some important information of the twist of MFRs. Thus,\nstarting from MCs, we investigate the twist of interplanetary MFRs with the aid\nof a velocity-modified uniform-twist force-free flux rope model. It is found\nthat most of MCs can be roughly fitted by the model and nearly half of them can\nbe fitted fairly well though the derived twist is probably over-estimated by a\nfactor of 2.5. By applying the model to 115 MCs observed at 1 AU, we find that\n(1) the twist angles of interplanetary MFRs generally follow a trend of about\n$0.6\\frac{l}{R}$ radians, where $\\frac{l}{R}$ is the aspect ratio of a MFR,\nwith a cutoff at about $12\\pi$ radians AU$^{-1}$, (2) most of them are\nsignificantly larger than $2.5\\pi$ radians but well bounded by $2\\frac{l}{R}$\nradians, (3) strongly twisted magnetic field lines probably limit the expansion\nand size of MFRs, and (4) the magnetic field lines in the legs wind more\ntightly than those in the leading part of MFRs. These results not only advance\nour understanding of the properties and behavior of interplanetary MFRs, but\nalso shed light on the formation and eruption of MFRs in the solar atmosphere.\nA discussion about the twist and stableness of solar MFRs are therefore given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2016 14:11:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

Recently, one particular type of\ndivergences known as soft theorems was connected to a symmetry principle - the\nantipodal matching of large gauge transformations. However, there is a way to\ndefine an IR finite $S$ matrix in QED and similar theories by dropping the\nassumption of trivial asymptotic dynamics. In the present paper we investigate\nthe role of soft theorems and invariance under large gauge transformations in\nthe context of the finite $S$ matrix. Before doing so, the construction of\nasymptotic dynamics is reviewed and extended. The key results are that\nsubleading soft factors can be included in a natural way in the asymptotic\ndynamics. Once this is done, soft modes decouple from the IR finite $S$ matrix\nand this decoupling, which can be understood as a spontaneously broken\nsymmetry, is equivalent to the invariance under large gauge transformations (or\nin other words to the antipodal matching).

From an algorithmic\nperspective, a characterisation of these classes in terms of uniform\nquasi-wideness, a concept originating in finite model theory, has proved to be\nparticularly useful. Uniform quasi-wideness is used in many fpt-algorithms on\nnowhere dense classes. However, the existing constructions showing the\nequivalence of nowhere denseness and uniform quasi-wideness imply a\nnon-elementary blow up in the parameter dependence of the fpt-algorithms,\nmaking them infeasible in practice.\n  As a first main result of this paper, we use tools from logic, in particular\nfrom a subfield of model theory known as stability theory, to establish\npolynomial bounds for the equivalence of nowhere denseness and uniform\nquasi-wideness.\n  A powerful method in parameterized complexity theory is to compute a problem\nkernel in a pre-computation step, that is, to reduce the input instance in\npolynomial time to a sub-instance of size bounded in the parameter only\n(independently of the input graph size). Our new tools allow us to obtain for\nevery fixed value of $r$ a polynomial kernel for the distance-$r$ dominating\nset problem on nowhere dense classes of graphs. This result is particularly\ninteresting, as it implies that for every class $\\mathcal{C}$ of graphs which\nis closed under subgraphs, the distance-$r$ dominating set problem admits a\nkernel on $\\mathcal{C}$ for every value of $r$ if, and only if, it admits a\npolynomial kernel for every value of $r$ (under the standard assumption of\nparameterized complexity theory that $\\mathrm{FPT} \\neq W[2]$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2016 15:23:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2016 07:34:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2017 09:59:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 12:58:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-06"}

This is a generalization of\nthe random Fourier features for scalar-valued kernels to the operator-valued\ncase. Our general setting is that of operator-valued kernels corresponding to\nRKHS of functions with values in a Hilbert space. We show that in general, for\na given kernel, there are potentially infinitely many random feature maps,\nwhich can be bounded or unbounded. Most importantly, given a kernel, we present\na general, closed form formula for computing a corresponding probability\nmeasure, which is required for the construction of the Fourier features, and\nwhich, unlike the scalar case, is not uniquely and automatically determined by\nthe kernel. We also show that, under appropriate conditions, random bounded\nfeature maps can always be computed. Furthermore, we show the uniform\nconvergence, under the Hilbert-Schmidt norm, of the resulting approximate\nkernel to the exact kernel on any compact subset of Euclidean space. Our\nconvergence requires differentiable kernels, an improvement over the\ntwice-differentiability requirement in previous work in the scalar setting.

Providing electrical\nconsumption information to household and make the consumption information\ntangible is very effective strategy in reducing electrical consumption in\nhouseholds. In Home Displays provide consumers real time information on\nelectrical consumption level and related expenditure, with that strategy\nturning an intangible electric bill into transparent and controllable is\npossible. We interviewed the participants before the start to our study in\norder to have knowledge of their income, environmental attitudes and the\nknowledge level of their electrical consumption conserving activities.\nMonitoring over 3 to 5 months maximal of five households electrical consumption\nand comparing that consumption level with the previous year had been realized.\nHouseholds received advanced real time appliance level feedback. Behavioral\nchange associated electrical consumption reduction levels were identified. It\nis also realized that setting goals via an electrical energy consumption\ndisplay have high potential on reducing the total electricity consumption in\nhouseholds. We found 0, 0, 13.21, 3.42, 1.59 % electricity savings on house 1,\nhouse 2, house 3, house 4 and house 5 correspondingly. It is suggested that\nfurther attention need to be given on potential reduction effect of applying\ndifferent type of monitor designs and implication of special designed\nstimulants that can be used all over the house that can alert households with\ntheir current consumption level. Also, it is suggested to concentrate on time\nperiods in order to analyze and try to reveal specific time periods for\nspecific consumption behaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2016 13:34:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}
