In total, 19 (sub)bands of C$_6$H are presented, all\nprobing the vibrational manifold of the B$^2\\Pi$ electronically excited state.\nThe assignments are guided by electronic spectra available from matrix\nisolation work, isotopic substitution experiments (yielding also spectra for\n$^{13}$C$_6$H and C$_6$D), predictions from ab initio calculations as well as\nrotational fitting and vibrational contour simulations using the available\nground state parameters as obtained from microwave experiments. Besides the\n$0_0^0$ origin band, three non-degenerate stretching vibrations along the\nlinear backbone of the C$_6$H molecule are assigned: the $\\nu_6$ mode\nassociated with the C-C bond vibration and the $\\nu_4$ and $\\nu_3$ modes\nassociated with C$\\equiv$C triple bonds. For the two lowest $\\nu_{11}$ and\n$\\nu_{10}$ bending modes, a Renner-Teller analysis is performed identifying the\n$\\mu^2\\Sigma$($\\nu_{11}$) and both $\\mu^2\\Sigma$($\\nu_{10}$) and\n$\\kappa^2\\Sigma$($\\nu_{10}$) components. In addition, two higher lying bending\nmodes are observed, which are tentatively assigned as $\\mu^2\\Sigma$($\\nu_9$)\nand $\\mu^2\\Sigma$($\\nu_8$) levels. In the excitation region below the first\nnon-degenerate vibration ($\\nu_6$), some $^2\\Pi-^{2}\\Pi$ transitions are\nobserved that are assigned as even combination modes of low-lying bending\nvibrations. The same holds for a $^2\\Pi-^{2}\\Pi$ transition found above the\n$\\nu_6$ level. From these spectroscopic data and the vibronic analysis a\ncomprehensive energy level diagram for the B$^2\\Pi$ state of C$_6$H is derived\nand presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 16:05:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

Specifically, spatial representations are extracted by a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN), which, as analyzed in this paper, is able\nto reduce person-specific biases caused by hand-crafted features (eg, SIFT and\nGabor). To model temporal dependencies, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) are\nstacked on top of these representations, regardless of the lengths of input\nvideos.

Large-scale networks are spatially partitioned into overlapping\nroad sections. The traffic dynamics of each section is given by the switching\nmode model (SMM) using a conservation principle, and the traffic state in each\nsection is estimated by a local agent. In the proposed filter, a consensus term\nis applied to promote inter-agent agreement on overlapping sections. The new\nfilter, termed a (spatially) distributed local Kalman consensus filter (DLKCF),\nis shown to maintain globally asymptotically stable (GAS) mean error dynamics\nwhen all sections switch among observable modes. When a section is\nunobservable, we show that the mean estimate of each state variable in the\nsection is ultimately bounded, which is achieved by exploring the interaction\nbetween the properties of the traffic model and the measurement feedback of the\nfilter. Based on the above results, the boundedness of the mean estimation\nerror of the DLKCF under switching sequences with observable and unobservable\nmodes is established to address the overall performance of the filter.\nNumerical experiments show the ability of the DLKCF to promote consensus,\nincrease estimation accuracy compared to a local filter, and reduce the\ncomputational load compared to a centralized approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 18:00:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 22:19:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-20"}

Drift is change that results from stochasticity in transmission and\nit may occur in the absence of any intrinsic difference between linguistic\nforms; whereas selection is truly an evolutionary force arising from intrinsic\ndifferences -- for example, when one form is preferred by members of the\npopulation. Using large corpora of parsed texts spanning the 12th century to\nthe 21st century, we analyze three examples of grammatical changes in English:\nthe regularization of past-tense verbs, the rise of the periphrastic `do', and\nsyntactic variation in verbal negation.

The strength of drift depends on a word's frequency, and so drift\nprovides an alternative explanation for why some words are more prone to change\nthan others.

Rather than\nregarding CO2 as a costly pollutant, this is accomplished by treating CO2 as a\nfeedstock resource to generate valuable products (carbon nanotubes). The\nexhaust from partial and full oxy-fuel cement plant configurations are coupled\nto the inlet of a C2CNT chamber in which CO2 is transformed by electrolysis in\na molten carbonate electrolyte at a steel cathode and a nickel anode. In this\nhigh yield 4e- per CO2 process, the CO2 is transformed into carbon nanotubes at\nthe cathode, and pure oxygen at the anode that is looped back in improving the\ncement line energy efficiency and rate of production. A partial oxy-fuel\nprocess looping the pure oxygen back in through the plant calcinator has been\ncompared to a full oxy-fuel process in which it is looped back in through the\nplant kiln.

Ionizing\nradiation from faint galaxies likely drives cosmic reionization, and the HFF\ninitiative provides a key opportunity to find such galaxies. Yet, we cannot\nreally assess their ionizing emissivity without a robust measurement of their\nsizes, since this is key to quantifying both their prevalence and the faint-end\nslope to the UV luminosity function. Here we provide the first such size\nconstraints with 2 new techniques. The first utilizes the fact that the\ndetectability of highly-magnified galaxies as a function of shear is very\ndependent on a galaxy's size. Only the most compact galaxies will remain\ndetectable in regions of high shear (vs. a larger detectable size range for low\nshear), a phenomenon we carefully quantify using simulations. Remarkably,\nhowever, no correlation is found between the surface density of faint galaxies\nand the predicted shear, using 87 faint high-magnification mu>10 z~2-8 galaxies\nseen behind the first 4 HFF clusters. This can only be the case if such faint\n(~-15 mag) galaxies have significantly smaller sizes than luminous galaxies. We\nconstrain their half-light radii to be <~30 mas (<160-240 pc). As a 2nd size\nprobe, we rotate and stack 26 faint high-magnification sources along the major\nshear axis. Less elongation is found than even for objects with an intrinsic\nhalf-light radius of 10 mas. Together these results indicate that extremely\nfaint z~2-8 galaxies have near point-source profiles in the HFF dataset\n(half-light radii conservatively <30 mas and likely 5-10 mas). These results\nsuggest smaller completeness corrections and hence much lower volume densities\nfor faint z~2-8 galaxies and shallower faint-end slopes than have been derived\nin many recent studies (by factors of ~2-3 and by dalpha>~0.1-0.3).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 19:59:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 00:48:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2017 10:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

Two classes appear\nto stand out: X-ray and optical TDEs, the latter featuring lower effective\ntemperatures and luminosities. These differences can be explained if the\nradiation detected from the two categories of events originates from different\nlocations. In practice, this location is set by the evolution of the debris\nstream around the black hole and by the energy dissipation associated with it.\nIn this paper, we build an analytical model for the stream evolution, whose\ndynamics is determined by both magnetic stresses and shocks. Without magnetic\nstresses, the stream always circularizes. The ratio of the circularization\ntimescale to the initial stream period is $t_{\\rm ev}/t_{\\rm min} = 8.3 (M_{\\rm\nh}/10^6 M_{\\odot})^{-5/3} \\beta^{-3}$, where $M_{\\rm h}$ is the black hole mass\nand $\\beta$ is the penetration factor. If magnetic stresses are strong, they\ncan lead to the stream ballistic accretion. The boundary between\ncircularization and ballistic accretion corresponds to a critical magnetic\nstresses efficiency $v_{\\rm A}/v_{\\rm c} \\approx 10^{-1}$, largely independent\nof $M_{\\rm h}$ and $\\beta$. However, the main effect of magnetic stresses is to\naccelerate the stream evolution by strengthening self-crossing shocks.\nBallistic accretion therefore necessarily occurs on the stream dynamical\ntimescale. The shock luminosity associated to energy dissipation is\nsub-Eddington but decays as $t^{-5/3}$ only for a slow stream evolution.\nFinally, we find that the stream thickness rapidly increases if the stream is\nunable to cool completely efficiently. A likely outcome is its fast evolution\ninto a thick torus, or even an envelope completely surrounding the black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 00:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

In this paper, we show that, when\n$M\\backslash x_3,x_6$ has no $N$-minor, $M$ has an internally $4$-connected\nproper minor with an $N$-minor that can be obtained from $M$ by removing at\nmost three elements, or by removing elements in a well-described way from a\nspecial substructure of $M$. This is the penultimate step towards obtaining a\nsplitter theorem for the class of internally $4$-connected binary matroids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 23:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-04"}

This data structure is used\nfor applications processing graphs or many-to-many relations as applied in\nstatic analysis of object-oriented systems. When processing such big data sets\nthe memory overhead of the data structure encoding itself is a memory usage\nbottleneck. Motivated by reuse and type-safety, libraries for Java, Scala and\nClojure typically implement immutable multi-maps by nesting sets as the values\nwith the keys of a trie map. Like this, based on our measurements the expected\nbyte overhead for a sparse multi-map per stored entry adds up to around 65B,\nwhich renders it unfeasible to compute with effectively on the JVM.\n  In this paper we propose a general framework for Hash-Array Mapped Tries on\nthe JVM which can store type-heterogeneous keys and values: a Heterogeneous\nHash-Array Mapped Trie (HHAMT). Among other applications, this allows for a\nhighly efficient multi-map encoding by (a) not reserving space for empty value\nsets and (b) inlining the values of singleton sets while maintaining a (c)\ntype-safe API.\n  We detail the necessary encoding and optimizations to mitigate the overhead\nof storing and retrieving heterogeneous data in a hash-trie.

An Euler tour is a closed walk that traverses each edge of the\nhypergraph exactly once; and an Euler family is a family of closed walks that\ncannot be concatenated and that jointly traverse each edge of the hypergraph\nexactly once.

We then devise efficient algorithms to perform sparse coding and\ndictionary learning on the space of infinite-dimensional subspaces. In\nparticular, two solutions are developed to sparsely encode an LDS. In the first\nmethod, we map the subspaces into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and\nachieve our goal through kernel sparse coding. As for the second solution, we\npropose to embed the infinite-dimensional subspaces into the space of symmetric\nmatrices and formulate the sparse coding accordingly in the induced space. For\ndictionary learning, we encode time-series by introducing a novel concept,\nnamely the two-fold LDSs. We then make use of the two-fold LDSs to derive an\nanalytical form for updating atoms of an LDS dictionary, i.e., each atom is an\nLDS itself. Compared to several baselines and state-of-the-art methods, the\nproposed methods yield higher accuracies in various classification tasks\nincluding video classification and tactile recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2016 02:44:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 02:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

This article develops two novel clustering algorithms for\ntime series data that are extensions of a crisp c-shapes algorithm. The two new\nalgorithms are heuristic derivatives of fuzzy c-means (FCM). Fuzzy c-Shapes\nplus (FCS+) replaces the inner product norm in the FCM model with a shape-based\ndistance function. Fuzzy c-Shapes double plus (FCS++) uses the shape-based\ndistance, and also replaces the FCM cluster centers with shape-extracted\nprototypes. Numerical experiments on 48 real time series data sets show that\nthe two new algorithms outperform state-of-the-art shape-based clustering\nalgorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Four external cluster validity\nindices (the Rand index, Adjusted Rand Index, Variation of Information, and\nNormalized Mutual Information) are used to match candidate partitions generated\nby each of the studied algorithms.

Indeed the number, placement\nand properties of the inertial resonators can be designed to open, shift and\nenlarge the band gaps between one or more pairs of consecutive branches in the\nfrequency spectrum.

We demonstrate the approach on two optimisation problems\n(predicting optimal depth-of-win for the KRK endgame, and job-shop scheduling).\nOur results are promising: (a)On each iteration of distribution estimation,\nsamples obtained with an ILP theory have a substantially greater proportion of\ngood solutions than samples without a theory; and (b)On termination of\ndistribution estimation, samples obtained with an ILP theory contain more\nnear-optimal samples than samples without a theory. Taken together, these\nresults suggest that the use of ILP-constructed theories could be a useful\ntechnique for incorporating complex domain-knowledge into estimation\ndistribution procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2016 07:23:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 06:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-14"}

We identify various features related to the stability of\nconferences that might help us separate a top-tier conference from the rest of\nthe lot. While there are many clear cases where expert agreement can be almost\nimmediately achieved as to whether a conference is a top-tier or not, there are\nequally many cases that can result in a conflict even among the experts.\nConfAssist tries to serve as an aid in such cases by increasing the confidence\nof the experts in their decision. An analysis of 110 conferences from 22\nsub-fields of computer science clearly favors our hypothesis as the top-tier\nconferences are found to exhibit much less fluctuations in the stability\nrelated features than the non top-tier ones. We evaluate our hypothesis using\nsystems based on conference categorization. For the evaluation, we conducted\nhuman judgment survey with 28 domain experts. The results are impressive with\n85.18% classification accuracy.

We secondly introduce the dynamics of the system, characterized by\nrandom arrivals and departures of users after a finite service duration, with\nthe service rates and distribution of radio conditions outfitted from the first\npart of the work. When dealing with the dynamics of the system, macro and small\ncells are modeled by multi-class processor sharing queues. Macro and small\ncells are assumed to be operating in the same bandwidth. Consequently, they are\ncoupled due to the mutual interferences generated by each cell to the other.

However, in case the hotspot is located far enough from the macro BS,\nperforming errors in small cell positioning is tolerated (since related results\nshow positive gains) and it is still beneficial in offloading traffic from the\ncongested macrocell.

Narrow-emission line active galactic nuclei (AGN; type-2) have\nbeen selected on the basis of their emission line ratios and/or X-ray\nluminosity. We have looked for X-ray unobscured type-2 AGN. As X-ray spectra\nwere not available for our whole sample, we have checked the reliability of\nusing the X-ray hardness ratio (HR) as a probe of the level of obscuration and\nwe found a very good agreement with full spectral fitting results, with only 2%\nof the sources with apparently unobscured HR turning out to have an obscured\nspectrum. Despite the fact that type-2 AGN are supposed to be absorbed based on\nthe Unified Model, about 60% of them show no sign or very low level of X-ray\nobscuration. After subtraction of contaminants to the sample, that is\nNarrow-Line Seyfert 1 and Compton-thick AGN, the fraction of unobscured Sy2\ndrops to 47%. For these sources, we were able to rule out dust reddening and\nvariability for most of them as an explanation of the absence of optical broad\nemission-lines. The main explanations remaining are the dilution of weak/very\nbroad emission-lines by the host galaxy and the intrinsic absence of the\nbroad-line region (BLR) due to low accretion rates (i.e. True Sy2). However,\nthe number of True Sy2 strongly depends on the method used to verify the\nintrinsic lack of broad lines. Indeed using the optical continuum luminosity to\npredict the BLR properties gives a much larger fraction of True Sy2 (about 90\\%\nof the unobscured Sy2 sample) than the use of the X-ray 2 keV luminosity (about\n20%). Nevertheless the number of AGN we securely detected as True Sy2 is at\nleast three times larger that the previously confirmed number of True Sy2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2016 10:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

Arguably the most important aspect in this domain is updating a\ntracker's models as tracking progresses, also known as incremental (face)\ntracking. While this should result in more accurate localisation, how to do\nthis online and in real time without causing a tracker to drift is still an\nimportant open research question. We address this question in the cascaded\nregression framework, the state-of-the-art approach for facial landmark\nlocalisation. Because incremental learning for cascaded regression is costly,\nwe propose a much more efficient yet equally accurate alternative using\ncontinuous regression. More specifically, we first propose cascaded continuous\nregression (CCR) and show its accuracy is equivalent to the Supervised Descent\nMethod. We then derive the incremental learning updates for CCR (iCCR) and show\nthat it is an order of magnitude faster than standard incremental learning for\ncascaded regression, bringing the time required for the update from seconds\ndown to a fraction of a second, thus enabling real-time tracking.

In a previous study, we found highly\nmisaligned molecular outflows towards the infrared point source IRS. Using\nnear-IR data acquired with Gemini-NIRI at the JHKs-broad-bands and narrow-bands\ncentered at the emission lines of [FeII], H2 1-0 S(1), H2 2-1 S(1), Br-gamma,\nand CO 2-0 (bh), we studied the circumstellar environment of IRS with an\nangular resolution between 0.35\" and 0.45\". The emission in the\nJHKs-broad-bands shows, with great detail, the presence of a cone-like shape\nnebula extending to the north/northeast of the point source, which appears to\nbe attached to it by a jet-like structure. In the three bands the nebula is\nresolved in a twisted-shaped feature composed by two arc-like features and a\nbow shock-like structure seen mainly in the Ks-band, which strongly suggests\nthe presence of a precessing jet. An analysis of proper motions based on our\nGemini observations and UKIDSS data gives additional support to the precession\nscenario. We are presenting one of the best resolved cone-like nebula likely\nrelated to a precessing jet up to date. The analysis of the observed\nnear-infrared lines shows that the H2 is collisionally excited, and the\nspatially coincidence of the [FeII] and H2 emissions in the closer arc-like\nfeature suggests that this region is affected by a J-shock. The second arc-like\nfeature presents H2 emission without [FeII] which suggests the presence of a\nnondisociative C-shock or a less energetic J-shock. The H2 1-0 S(1) continuum\nsubtracted image, reveals several knots and filaments at a larger spatial scale\naround IRS, in perfect matching with the distribution of the red and\nblueshifted molecular outflows discovered in our previous work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2016 12:47:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

However, the SU/PG solution is known\nto suffer from distortion at the boundary transverse to the velocity and the\nremedial measures suggested in fluid dynamics literature are computationally\ndemanding. Therefore, simple alternative schemes are essential. In an earlier\neffort, instead of conventional finite-difference based approach, the numerical\ninstability was analyzed using the Z-transform. By employing the concept of\npole-zero cancellation, stability of the numerical solution was achieved by a\nsimple restatement of the input magnetic flux in terms of associated vector\npotential. This approach, however, is restricted for input fields, which vary\nonly along the direction of the velocity. To overcome this, the present work\nproposes a novel approach in which the input field is restated as a weighted\nelemental average.

The yield behavior is found to be mostly controlled\nby the local nanoparticle-grafted polymer interfacial energy, with the grafted\npolymer-polymer matrix interfacial structure being of little to no relevance.\nIncreasing the attraction between nanoparticle core and the grafted polymer\ninhibits void nucleation and leads to a higher yield stress. In the craze\ngrowth regime, the presence of grafted chain sections of 100 monomers alters\nthe mechanical response of composite samples, giving rise to smaller extension\nratios and higher drawing stresses than for the homopolymer matrix. The\ndominant failure mechanism of composite samples depends strongly on the length\nof the grafted chains, with disentanglement being the dominant mechanism for\nshort chains, while bond breaking is the failure mode for chain lengths greater\nthan 10Ne, where Ne is the entanglement length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2016 14:10:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

We\ndefine the notion of global minimality for a given power spectrum, and\ncharacterize globally minimal systems as those with a fully mixed stationary\nstate. We show that in the case of systems with a cascade realization, the\npower spectrum completely fixes the transfer function, so the system can be\nidentified up to a symplectic transformation. We give a method for constructing\na globally minimal subsystem direct from the power spectrum. Restricting to\npassive systems the analysis simplifies so that identifiability may be\ncompletely understood from the eigenvalues of a particular system matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2016 15:41:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2017 10:05:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 09:48:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-25"}

A reversible logic\ndesign needs resources such as ancilla and garbage qubits to reconfigure\ncircuit functions or gate functions. The removal of garbage qubits and ancilla\nqubits are essential in designing an efficient quantum circuit. In the\nliterature, there are multiple designs that have been proposed for a reversible\nmultiplication operation. A multiplication hardware is essential for the\ncircuit design of quantum algorithms, quantum cryptanalysis, and digital signal\nprocessing (DSP) applications. The existing designs of reversible quantum\ninteger multipliers suffer from redundant garbage qubits. In this work, we\npropose a reversible logic based, garbage-free and ancilla qubit optimized\ndesign of a quantum integer multiplier. The proposed quantum integer multiplier\nutilizes a novel add and rotate methodology that is specially suitable for a\nreversible computing paradigm. The proposed design methodology is the modified\nversion of a conventional shift and add method. The proposed design of the\nquantum integer multiplier incorporates add or no operation based on multiplier\nqubits and followed by a rotate right operation. The proposed design of the\nquantum integer multiplier produces zero garbage qubits and shows an\nimprovement ranging from 60% to 90% in ancilla qubits count over the existing\nwork on reversible quantum integer multipliers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2016 15:42:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-04"}

From a\ntheoretical point of view, supersonic turbulence has been the subject of\ninterest in many analytical theories proposing a strong correlation with the\ncharacteristic mass of the core mass function (CMF) in star forming regions,\nand as a consequence with the stellar IMF. Performing two suites of smoothed\nparticles hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations with different mass resolutions, we\naim at testing the effects of variations in the turbulent properties of a\ndense, star forming molecular cloud on the shape of the system mass function in\ndifferent density regimes. While analytical theories predict a shift of the\npeak of the CMF towards lower masses with increasing velocity dispersion of the\ncloud, we observe in the low-density regime the opposite trend, with high Mach\nnumbers giving rise to a top-heavy mass distribution. For the high-density\nregime we do not find any trend correlating the Mach number with the\ncharacteristic mass of the resulting IMF, implying that the dynamics of\nprotostellar accretion discs and fragmentation on small scales is not strongly\naffected by turbulence driven at the scale of the cloud. Furthermore, we\nsuggest that a significant fraction of dense cores are disrupted by turbulence\nbefore stars can be formed in their interior through gravitational collapse.\nAlthough this particular study has limitations in its numerical resolution, we\nsuggest that our results, along with those from other studies, cast doubt on\nthe turbulent fragmentation models on the IMF that simply map the CMF to the\nIMF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2016 14:46:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-05"}

These\nindeterminacies might permit a close approximation to a property claim or some\nmanner of quasi-property.

While effective\nappropriation of a Peak might proceed without raising some of the familiar\nproblems associated with commercial development (especially lunar mining), the\npossibility of such appropriation nonetheless raises some significant issues\nconcerning justice and the safeguarding of scientific practice on the lunar\nsurface.
