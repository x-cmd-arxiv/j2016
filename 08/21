The background idea that has given\nrise to the use of these algorithms is obviously that the folding process is\npredictable. However, this important assumption is disputable as chaotic\nproperties of such a process have been recently highlighted. In this paper,\nwhich is an extension of a former work accepted to the 2011 International Joint\nConference on Neural Networks (IJCNN11), the topological behavior of a\nwell-known dynamical system used for protein folding prediction is evaluated.\nIt is mathematically established that the folding dynamics in the 2D\nhydrophobic-hydrophilic (HP) square lattice model, simply called \"the 2D model\"\nin this document, is indeed a chaotic dynamical system as defined by Devaney.\nFurthermore, the chaotic behavior of this model is qualitatively and\nquantitatively deepened, by studying other mathematical properties of disorder,\nnamely: the indecomposability, instability, strong transitivity, and constants\nof expansivity and sensitivity.

In the\nliterature, such a problem is known as Robust Principal Component Analysis\n(RPCA), which usually recovers the low rank structure by approximating the rank\nfunction with a nuclear norm and penalizing the error by an $\\ell_1$-norm.\nAlthough RPCA is a convex formulation and can be solved effectively, the\nintroduced norms are not tight approximations, which may cause the solution to\ndeviate from the authentic one.

A novel error analysis is developed in $n$-dimensional space\nusing the Poisson summation formula, which enables the treatment of the kernel\nand particle approximation errors in combined fashion. New consistency integral\nrelations are derived for the particle approximation which correspond to the\ncosine Fourier transform of the classically known consistency conditions for\nthe kernel approximation.

We show that changing the fin's curvature modulates its stiffness.\nModelling the fin as bendable bony rays held together by a membrane, we deduce\nthat fin curvature is manifested as a misalignment of the principal bending\naxes between neighbouring rays. An external force causes neighbouring rays to\nbend and splay apart, and thus stretches the membrane. This coupling between\nbending the rays and stretching the membrane underlies the increase in\nstiffness. Using analysis of a 3D reconstruction of a Mackerel (Scomber\njaponicus) pectoral fin, we calculate the range of stiffnesses this fin is\nexpected to span by changing curvature. The 3D reconstruction shows that, even\nin its geometrically flat state, a functional curvature is embedded within the\nfin microstructure owing to the morphology of individual rays. Since the\nability of a propulsive surface to transmit force to the surrounding fluid is\nlimited by its stiffness, the fin curvature controls the coupling between the\nfish and its surrounding fluid.

They have\nintrinsic regularizing effects, where the number $k$ of iterations plays the\nrole of regularization parameter.

In such\ncontext, the goal is to optimize the Quality of Service (QoS) and cost\nobjectives for the cloud-based services. However, the difficulty lies in the\nfacts that these objectives, e.g., throughput and cost, can be naturally\nconflicted, and the QoS of cloud-based services often interfere due to the\nshared infrastructure in cloud. Consequently, dynamic and effective trade-off\ndecision making of autoscaling in the cloud is necessary, yet challenging. In\nparticular, it is even harder to achieve well-compromised trade-offs, where the\ndecision largely improves the majority of the objectives, while causing\nrelatively small degradations to others. In this paper, we present a\nself-adaptive decision making approach for autoscaling in the cloud. It is\ncapable to adaptively produce autoscaling decisions that lead to\nwell-compromised trade-offs without heavy human intervention. We leverage on\nant colony inspired multi-objective optimization for searching and optimizing\nthe trade-offs decisions, the result is then filtered by compromise-dominance,\na mechanism that extracts the decisions with balanced improvements in the\ntrade-offs.

The extension to the discrete case makes use of\nthe strong relation HPF-based planning has to connectionist artificial\nintelligence (AI). Connectionist AI systems are networks of simple,\ninterconnected processors running in parallel within the confines of the\nenvironment in which the planning action is to be synthesized. It is not hard\nto see that such a paradigm naturally lends itself to planning on weighted\ngraphs where the processors may be seen as the vertices of the graph and the\nrelations among them as its edges. Electrical networks are an effective\nrealization of connectionist AI. The utility of the discrete HPF (DHPF)\napproach is demonstrated in three ways. First, the capability of the DHPF\napproach to generate new, abstract, planning techniques is demonstrated by\nconstructing a novel, efficient, optimal, discrete planning method called the\nM* algorithm. Also, its ability to augment the capabilities of existing\nplanners is demonstrated by suggesting a generic solution to the lower bound\nproblem faced by the A* algorithm. The DHPF approach is shown to be useful in\nsolving specific planning problems in communication. It is demonstrated that\nthe discrete HPF paradigm can support routing on-the-fly while the network is\nstill in a transient state.

This model also accounts for how the ISM and star\nformation are distributed in the bright parts of galaxies, and how HI appears\nto trace the distribution of dark matter in galaxy outskirts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2016 13:09:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

To reduce the amount of\nsending data, an aggregation approach can be applied along the path from\nsensors to the sink. However, as sensor networks are often deployed in\nuntrusted and even hostile environments, sensor nodes are prone to node\ncompromise attacks. Hence, an end-to-end secure aggregation approach is\nrequired to ensure a healthy data reception. In this paper, we propose two\nlayers for secure data aggregation in sensor networks. Firstly, we provide an\nend-to-end encryption scheme that supports operations over cypher-text. It is\nbased on elliptic curve cryptography that exploits a smaller key size, allows\nthe use of higher number of operations on cypher-texts, and prevents the\ndistinction between two identical texts from their cryptograms. Secondly, we\npropose a new watermarking-based authentication that enables sensor nodes to\nensure the identity of other nodes they are communicating with. Our experiments\nshow that our hybrid approach of secure data aggregation enhances the security,\nsignificantly reduces computation and communication overhead, and can be\npractically implemented in on-the-shelf sensor platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2016 13:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-23"}

Light interacting with motion in an optomechanical\nsystem can sense minute fluctuations in displacement, and also impart a force\nvia radiation pressure. Taken together, these two effects mean that two photons\ncan \"sense\" each other's presence in an interaction mediated by motion. It is\naccepted that for an optomechanical system to mediate strong interactions\nbetween single photons, the mechanical system must respond before the photon is\nlost ($\\omega_m > \\kappa$), and the radiation pressure force must generate a\ndisplacement large enough to change the optical properties of the system ($g_0\n> \\kappa$). The challenge of achieving this \"vacuum strong coupling\" has\nprevented experiments from demonstrating single-photon interactions. In this\nwork we show that by adding a coherent feedback channel to a slow mechanical\nsystem ($\\omega_m < \\kappa$) that is weakly nonlinear ($g_0 < \\kappa$), two\nspatially separated single photons can be made to effectively interact with\neach other deterministically through the mechanical motion of a resonator.

Under magnetic\nfield, relativistic fermions acquire Berry phase of {\\pi} in cyclotron motion,\nleading to a zeroth Landau level (LL) at the crossing point. Such\nfield-independent zeroth LL, which distinguishes relativistic fermions from\nconventional electron systems, is hardly probed in transport measurements since\nthe Fermi energy (EF) is usually not right at the band crossing points in most\ntopological materials. Here we report the observation of exotic quantum\ntransport behavior resulting from the zeroth LL in a multiband topological\nsemimetal YbMnBi2 which possesses linear band crossings both at and away from\nthe Fermi level (FL). We show that the Dirac bands with the crossing points\nbeing above or below the FL leads to Shubnikov de-Haas oscillations in the\nin-plane magnetoresistance, whereas the Dirac bands with the crossing points\nbeing at the FL results in unusual angular dependences of the out-of-plane\nmagnetoresistance and in-plane Hall resistivity due to the dependence of the\nzeroth LL's degeneracy on field orientation.

Such a deformation is\nintroduced as a particular type of non-commutativity between phase space\ncoordinates. For the commutative case, it has been shown in the literature [1],\nthat the dust collapse in BD theory leads to the formation of a spacetime\nsingularity which is covered by an event horizon. In comparison to general\nrelativity (GR), the authors concluded that the final state of black holes in\nBD theory is identical to the GR case but differs from GR during the dynamical\nevolution of the collapse process. However, the presence of non-commutative\neffects influences the dynamics of the collapse scenario and consequently a\nnon-singular evolution is developed in the sense that a bounce emerges at a\nminimum radius, after which an expanding phase begins. Such a behavior is\nobserved for positive values of the BD coupling parameter. For large positive\nvalues of the BD coupling parameter, when non-commutative effects are present,\nthe dynamics of collapse process differs from the GR case. Finally, we show\nthat for negative values of the BD coupling parameter, the singularity is\nreplaced by an oscillatory bounce occurring at a finite time, with the\nfrequency of oscillation and amplitude being damped at late times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2016 15:47:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Oct 2016 23:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}
