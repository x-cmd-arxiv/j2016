Variation in UVB exposure as inferred from these features has\nbeen suggested as a proxy for paleoaltitude. While UVB irradiance does increase\nwith altitude above sea level, a number of other factors affect the irradiance\nat any given place and time. In this modeling study we use the TUV atmospheric\nradiative transfer model to investigate dependence of surface-level UVB\nirradiance and relative biological impact on a number of constituents in\nEarth's atmosphere that are variable over long and short time periods. We\nconsider changes in O3 column density, and SO2 and sulfate aerosols due to\nperiods of volcanic activity, including that associated with the formation of\nthe Siberian Traps. We find that UVB irradiance may be highly variable under\nvolcanic conditions and variations in several of these atmospheric constituents\ncan easily mimic or overwhelm changes in UVB irradiance due to changes in\naltitude. On the other hand, we find that relative change with altitude is not\nvery sensitive to different sets of atmospheric conditions. Any paleoaltitude\nproxy based on UVB exposure requires confidence that the samples under\ncomparison were located at roughly the same latitude, under very similar O3 and\nSO2 columns, with similar atmospheric aerosol conditions.

This\nproblem is important in applications such as environmental field estimation,\nrobotic navigation, and target tracking. Its difficulty lies on that limited\noperational resources among the sensors, e.g., shared communication bandwidth\nor battery power, constrain the number of sensors that can be active at each\nmeasurement step. As a result, sensor scheduling algorithms must be employed.\nNotwithstanding, current sensor scheduling algorithms for batch state\nestimation scale poorly with the system size and the time horizon. In addition,\ncurrent sensor scheduling algorithms for Kalman filtering, although they scale\nbetter, provide no performance guarantees or approximation bounds for the\nminimization of the batch state estimation error. In this paper, one of our\nmain contributions is to provide an algorithm that enjoys both the estimation\naccuracy of the batch state scheduling algorithms and the low time complexity\nof the Kalman filtering scheduling algorithms. In particular: 1) our algorithm\nis near-optimal: it achieves a solution up to a multiplicative factor 1/2 from\nthe optimal solution, and this factor is close to the best approximation factor\n1/e one can achieve in polynomial time for this problem; 2) our algorithm has\n(polynomial) time complexity that is not only lower than that of the current\nalgorithms for batch state estimation; it is also lower than, or similar to,\nthat of the current algorithms for Kalman filtering. We achieve these results\nby proving two properties for our batch state estimation error metric, which\nquantifies the square error of the minimum variance linear estimator of the\nbatch state vector: a) it is supermodular in the choice of the sensors; b) it\nhas a sparsity pattern (it involves matrices that are block tri-diagonal) that\nfacilitates its evaluation at each sensor set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2016 17:38:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2016 16:03:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 17:12:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}

Despite the Power Grids dynamics has been\ncontrolled by computer systems and human operators, the static features of this\ntype of network can be studied and analyzed. The topology of the Brazilian\nPower Grid (BPG) was studied in this work. We obtained the spatial structure of\nthe BPG from the ONS (electric systems national operator), consisting of\nhigh-voltage transmission lines, generating stations and substations. The local\nlow-voltage substations and local power delivery as well the dynamic features\nof the network were neglected. We analyze the complex network of the BPG and\nidentify the main topological information, such as the mean degree, the degree\ndistribution, the network size and the clustering coefficient to caracterize\nthe complex network. We also detected the critical locations on the network\nand, therefore, the more susceptible points to lead to a cascading failure and\neven to a blackouts. Surprisely, due to the characteristic of the topology and\nphysical structure of the network, we show that the BPG is resilient against\nrandom failures, since the random removal of links does not affect\nsignificantly the size of the largest cluster. We observe that when a fraction\nof the links are randomly removed, the network may disintegrates into smaller\nand disconnected parts, however, the power grid largest component remains\nconnected. We believe that the even a static study of the network topology can\nhelp to identify the critical situations and also prevent failures and possible\nblackouts on the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2016 17:47:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-29"}

Subsequent stages will focus on measurements\nof rare Higgs processes, as well as searches for new physics processes and\nprecision measurements of new states, e.g. states previously discovered at LHC\nor at CLIC itself. In the 2012 CLIC Conceptual Design Report, a fully optimised\n3 TeV collider was presented, while the proposed lower energy stages were not\nstudied to the same level of detail. This report presents an updated baseline\nstaging scenario for CLIC. The scenario is the result of a comprehensive study\naddressing the performance, cost and power of the CLIC accelerator complex as a\nfunction of centre-of-mass energy and it targets optimal physics output based\non the current physics landscape. The optimised staging scenario foresees three\nmain centre-of-mass energy stages at 380 GeV, 1.5 TeV and 3 TeV for a full CLIC\nprogramme spanning 22 years. For the first stage, an alternative to the CLIC\ndrive beam scheme is presented in which the main linac power is produced using\nX-band klystrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2016 17:50:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 14:00:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 12:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

Phase-sensitive nonlinear spectroscopy techniques are widely\nimplemented to explore these dynamics through demodulation of the complex\noptical signal field into its quadrature components; however, complete\nreconstruction of the optical response requires measuring both the amplitude\nand phase of each quadrature, which is often lost in standard detection\nmethods. Here, we implement a heterodyne-detection scheme to fully reconstruct\nthe amplitude and phase response of spectral hole-burning from InAs/GaAs\ncharged quantum dots. We observe an ultra-narrow absorption profile and a\ncorresponding dispersive lineshape of the phase, which reflect the nanosecond\noptical coherence time of the charged exciton transition. Simultaneously, the\nmeasurements are sensitive to electron spin relaxation dynamics on a\nmillisecond timescale, as this manifests as a magnetic-field dependent delay of\nthe amplitude and phase modulation.

MCMs are defined at the various layers of the hardware-software\nstack, requiring thoroughly verified specifications, compilers, and\nimplementations at the interfaces between layers. Current verification\ntechniques evaluate segments of the system stack in isolation, such as proving\ncompiler mappings from a high-level language (HLL) to an ISA or proving\nvalidity of a microarchitectural implementation of an ISA.\n  This paper makes a case for full-stack MCM verification and provides a\ntoolflow, TriCheck, capable of verifying that the HLL, compiler, ISA, and\nimplementation collectively uphold MCM requirements. The work showcases\nTriCheck's ability to evaluate a proposed ISA MCM in order to ensure that each\nlayer and each mapping is correct and complete. Specifically, we apply TriCheck\nto the open source RISC-V ISA, seeking to verify accurate, efficient, and legal\ncompilations from C11. We uncover under-specifications and potential\ninefficiencies in the current RISC-V ISA documentation and identify possible\nsolutions for each. As an example, we find that a RISC-V-compliant\nmicroarchitecture allows 144 outcomes forbidden by C11 to be observed out of\n1,701 litmus tests examined.

The SLH model is a general\nframework for open quantum systems that interact through bosonic fields, and is\nthe basis for the quantum circuit theory developed in the text. Coherent LQG\ncontrol is discussed in Chapters 3-4, where I demonstrate that coherent\nfeedback outperforms measurement-based feedback for certain linear\nquadratic-Gaussian (LQG) problems, and explain the discrepancy by the former's\nsimultaneous utilization of both light quadratures.

The integrated NDSHA procedure for seismic\ninput definition, which is currently applied to the Italian territory, combines\ndifferent pattern recognition techniques, designed for the space-time\nidentification of strong earthquakes, with algorithms for the realistic\nmodeling of ground motion. Accordingly, a set of deterministic scenarios of\nground motion at bedrock, which refers to the time interval when a strong event\nis likely to occur within the alerted area, is defined both at regional and\nlocal scale.

In this paper, we analyze the cases of strategic play\nby the \" boys \" in the game directly inspired by this problem. We provide an\nO(n^3) algorithm for determining a matching which is not necessarily stable in\nthe Gale-Shapely sense, but it is coalition-stable, in that no player has a\nselfish interest to leave the resulting grand coalition to join any potential\nalternative one which might feasibly form, and is also man-optimal.

Nevertheless, I claim that instability\noccurs more often than not when the planet is as massive as Jupiter and\nharbours a semimajor axis exceeding about 300 au, or has a mass of a\nsuper-Earth and a semimajor axis exceeding about 3000 au. These results hold\nfor orbital pericentres ranging from 100 to at least 400 au. This instability\nscenario might represent a common occurrence, as potentially evidenced by the\nubiquity of metal pollution in white dwarf atmospheres throughout the Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2016 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

The ABC method is called\n\"Likelihood free\" as it avoids explicit evaluation of the Likelihood by using a\nforward model simulation of the data which can include systematics. We\nintroduce astroABC, an open source ABC Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler for\nparameter estimation. A key challenge in astrophysics is the efficient use of\nlarge multi-probe datasets to constrain high dimensional, possibly correlated\nparameter spaces. With this in mind astroABC allows for massive parallelization\nusing MPI, a framework that handles spawning of jobs across multiple nodes. A\nkey new feature of astroABC is the ability to create MPI groups with different\ncommunicators, one for the sampler and several others for the forward model\nsimulation, which speeds up sampling time considerably. For smaller jobs the\nPython multiprocessing option is also available. Other key features include: a\nSequential Monte Carlo sampler, a method for iteratively adapting tolerance\nlevels, local covariance estimate using scikit-learn's KDTree, modules for\nspecifying optimal covariance matrix for a component-wise or multivariate\nnormal perturbation kernel, output and restart files are backed up every\niteration, user defined metric and simulation methods, a module for specifying\nheterogeneous parameter priors including non-standard prior PDFs, a module for\nspecifying a constant, linear, log or exponential tolerance level,\nwell-documented examples and sample scripts.

However, the main differences between the two samples occur in\nthe outer parts of the discs, with the HI-rich galaxies having slightly smaller\nCO discs (relative to the optical radius R25) and steeper CO and metallicity\ngradients than the control galaxies. The ongoing accretion of HI at large radii\nhas thus not led to an appreciable growth of the CO discs in our sample.

First, we consider the Type B higher spin\ntheories, which have been conjectured to be dual to CFTs consisting of the\nsinglet sector of $N$ free fermion fields. In addition to the case of $N$ Dirac\nfermions, we carefully study the projections to Weyl, Majorana, symplectic, and\nMajorana-Weyl fermions in the dimensions where they exist. Second, we explore\ntheories involving elements of both Type A and Type B theories, which we call\nType AB. Their spectrum includes fields of every half-integer spin, and they\nare expected to be related to the $U(N)/O(N)$ singlet sector of the CFT of $N$\nfree complex/real scalar and fermionic fields. Finally, we explore the Type C\ntheories, which have been conjectured to be dual to the CFTs of $p$-form gauge\nfields, where $p=\\frac d 2 -1$. In most cases we find that the free energies at\n$O(N^0)$ either vanish or give contributions proportional to the free-energy of\na single free field in the conjectured dual CFT.

These observations led to the\ndevelopment of a general model that describes emission structures through the\npartitioning of the atmospheric volume with different magnetic loop geometries\nthat exhibit different energetic equilibria. Does the internetwork produce\ntransition-temperature emission? What fraction of network flux connects to the\ncorona? How does quiet sun emission compare with low-activity Sun-like stars?\nIn this work, we revisit the canonical model of the quiet sun, with\nhigh-resolution observations from IRIS and HMI in hand, to address those\nquestions. We use over 900 deep exposures of Si IV 1393A from IRIS along with\nnearly simultaneous HMI magnetograms to quantify the correlation between\ntransition-temperature emission structures and magnetic field concentrations\nthrough a number of novel statistics. Our observational results are coupled\nwith analysis of the Bifrost MHD model and a large-scale potential field model.\nOur results paint a complex portrait of the quiet sun. We measure an emission\nsignature in the distant internetwork that cannot be attributed to network\ncontribution. We find that the dimmest regions of emission are not linked to\nthe local vertical magnetic field. Using the MHD simulation, we categorize the\nemission contribution from cool mid-altitude loops and high-altitude coronal\nloops and discuss the potential emission contribution of spicules. Our results\nprovide new constraints on the coupled solar atmosphere so that we can build on\nour understanding of how dynamic thermal and magnetic structures generate the\nobserved phenomena in the transition region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2016 22:18:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Although a few\nanalytical methods have been briefly investigated for describing pulsed\nsingle-photon sources, these methods apply only to either perfectly ideal or at\nleast extremely idealized sources. Here, we present the first complete picture\nof pulsed single-photon sources by elaborating how to numerically and fully\ncharacterize non-ideal single-photon sources operating in a pulsed regime. In\norder to achieve this result, we make the connection between quantum\nMonte--Carlo simulations, experimental characterizations, and an extended form\nof the quantum regression theorem. We elaborate on how an ideal pulsed\nsingle-photon source is connected to its photocount distribution and its\nmeasured degree of second- and first-order optical coherence. By doing so, we\nprovide a description of the relationship between instantaneous source\ncorrelations and the typical experimental interferometers (Hanbury-Brown and\nTwiss, Hong-Ou-Mandel, and Mach-Zehnder) used to characterize such sources.\nThen, we use these techniques to explore several prototypical quantum systems\nand their non-ideal behaviors. As an example numerical result, we show that for\nthe most popular single-photon source---a resonantly excited two-level\nsystem---its error probability is directly related to its excitation pulse\nlength. We believe that the intuition gained from these representative systems\nand characters can be used to interpret future results with more complicated\nsource Hamiltonians and behaviors.

The model of this problem begins with a medium\nconsisting of a calorically perfect gas with a prescribed energy release per\nunit mass. The energy release is collected into sheet-like sources that are now\nembedded in an inert gas that fills the spaces between them. The release of\nenergy in the first sheet results in a planar blast wave that propagates to the\nnext source, which is triggered after a prescribed delay, generating a new\nblast, and so forth. The resulting wave dynamics as the front passes through\nhundreds of such sources is computationally simulated by numerically solving\nthe governing one-dimensional Euler equations in the lab-fixed reference frame.\nThe average wave speed for each simulation is measured once the wave\npropagation has reached a quasi-periodic solution. Velocities in excess of the\nCJ speed are found as the sources are made increasingly discrete, with the\ndeviation above CJ being as great as $15\\%$. The total energy release, delay\ntime, and whether the sources remain lab-fixed or are convected with the flow\ndo not have a significant influence on the deviation of the average wave speed\naway from CJ. Such continuous waves can also be shown to have a time-averaged\nstructure consistent with the classical ZND structure of a detonation. In the\nlimit of highly discrete sources, temporal averaging of the wave structure\nshows that the effective sonic surface does not correspond to an equilibrium\nstate. The average state of the flow leaving the wave in this case does\neventually reach the equilibrium Hugoniot, but only after the effective sonic\nsurface has been crossed. Thus, the super-CJ waves observed in the limit of\nhighly discretized sources can be understood as weak detonations due to the\nnon-equilibrium state at the effective sonic surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2016 06:42:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

So, The efficiency of DTN routing protocol relies on\nthe intelligent selection of a relay node from a set of encountered nodes.\nAlthough there are plenty of DTN routing schemes proposed in the literature\nbased on different strategies of relay selection, there are not many\nmathematical models proposed to study the behavior of message forwarding in\nDTN. In this paper, we have proposed a novel epidemic model, called as CISER\nmodel, for message propagation in DTN, based on Amoebiasis disease propagation\nin human population. The proposed CISER model is an extension of SIR epidemic\nmodel with additional states to represent the resource constrained behavior of\nnodes in DTN.

This adversarial example phenomenon has been explained as\noriginating from deep networks being \"too linear\" (Goodfellow et al., 2014). We\nshow here that the linear explanation of adversarial examples presents a number\nof limitations: the formal argument is not convincing, linear classifiers do\nnot always suffer from the phenomenon, and when they do their adversarial\nexamples are different from the ones affecting deep networks.\n  We propose a new perspective on the phenomenon. We argue that adversarial\nexamples exist when the classification boundary lies close to the submanifold\nof sampled data, and present a mathematical analysis of this new perspective in\nthe linear case. We define the notion of adversarial strength and show that it\ncan be reduced to the deviation angle between the classifier considered and the\nnearest centroid classifier. Then, we show that the adversarial strength can be\nmade arbitrarily high independently of the classification performance due to a\nmechanism that we call boundary tilting. This result leads us to defining a new\ntaxonomy of adversarial examples. Finally, we show that the adversarial\nstrength observed in practice is directly dependent on the level of\nregularisation used and the strongest adversarial examples, symptomatic of\noverfitting, can be avoided by using a proper level of regularisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2016 10:44:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

The base flow is\nconsidered parallel to the axis of cone at the inlet. The angle of attack is\nzero and hence the base flow is axisymmetric. The favorable pressure gradient\ndevelops in the stream-wise direction due to cone angle. The Reynolds number is\ncalculated based on the cone radius (a) at the inlet and free-stream velocity\n($U_{\\infty}$). The base flow velocity profile is fully non-parallel and\nnon-similar. Linearized Navier-Stokes equations (LNS) are derived for the\ndisturbance flow quantities in the spherical coordinates. The LNS are\ndiscretized using Chebyshev spectral collocation method. The discretized LNS\nalong with the homogeneous boundary conditions forms a general eigenvalues\nproblem. Arnoldi's iterative algorithm is used for the numerical solution of\nthe general eigenvalues problem. The Global temporal modes are computed for the\nrange of Reynolds number from 174 to 1046, semi-cone angles $2^o$, $4^o$, $6^o$\nand azimuthal wave numbers from 0 to 5. It is found that the Global modes are\nmore stable at higher semi-cone angle $\\alpha$, due to the development of\nfavorable pressure gradient. The effect of transverse curvature is reduced at\nhigher semi-cone angles ($\\alpha$). The spatial structure of the eigenmodes\nshow that the flow is convectively unstable. The spatial growth rate ($A_x$)\nincreases with the increase in semi-cone angle ($\\alpha$) from $2^o$ to $6^o$.\nThus, the effect of increase in semi-cone angle ($\\alpha$) is to reduces the\ntemporal growth rate ($\\omega_i$) and to increases the spatial growth rate\n($A_x$) of the Global modes at a given Reynolds number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2016 11:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

Different from feedforward CNNs and RNNs with only single\nfeedback, MPF-RNN propagates the contextual features learned at top layer\nthrough \\textit{multiple} weighted recurrent connections to learn bottom\nfeatures.

With these two novel components, MPF-RNN has\nachieved significant improvement over strong baselines (VGG16 and Res101) on\nfive challenging scene parsing benchmarks, including traditional SiftFlow,\nBarcelona, CamVid, Stanford Background as well as the recently released\nlarge-scale ADE20K.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2016 13:19:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 16:52:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 11:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

Part I:\n  existence and relevance","comments":null,"journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"q-bio.QM q-bio.NC","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  Expecting events in time leads to more efficient behavior. A remarkable early\nfinding in the study of temporal expectancy is the foreperiod effect on\nreaction times; i.e., the influence or reaction time of the time period between\na warning signal and an imperative stimulus to which subjects are instructed to\nrespond as quickly as possible. Recently it has been shown that the phase of\noscillatory activity preceding stimulus presentation is related to behavior.\nHere we connect both of these findings by reporting a novel foreperiod effect\non the inter-trial phase coherence of the electroencephalogram (EEG) triggered\nby stimuli to which subjects are instructed not to respond. Inter-trial phase\ncoherence has been used to describe regularities in phases of groups of trials\ntime locked to an event of interest. We propose a single-trial measure of\ninter-trial phase coherence and prove its soundness. Equipped with this\nmeasure, and using a multivariate decoding method, we demonstrate that the\nforeperiod duration in and audiovisual attention-shifting task modulates\nsingle-trial phase coherence. In principle, this modulation could be an\nartifact of the decoding method used to detect it. We show that this is not the\ncase, since the modulation can also be observed using a simple averaging\nmethod. We show that the strength of this modulation correlates with subject\nbehavior (both error rates and mean-reaction times). We anticipate that the new\nforeperiod effect on inter-trial phase coherence, and the decoding method used\nhere to detect it, will be important tools to understand cognition at the\nsingle-trial level. In Part II of this manuscript, we support this claim, by\nshowing that changes in attention modulate the strength of the new foreperiod\neffect on a trial-by-trial basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2016 18:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}
