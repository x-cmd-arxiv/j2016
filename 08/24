Indeed, the classical setting is\nBoolean: a computation satisfies a specification or does not satisfy it.\nAccordingly, while the synthesized system is correct, there is no guarantee\nabout its quality. In recent years, researchers have considered extensions of\nthe classical Boolean setting to a quantitative one. The logic LTL[F] is a\nmulti-valued logic that augments LTL with quality operators. The satisfaction\nvalue of an LTL[F] formula is a real value in [0,1], where the higher the value\nis, the higher is the quality in which the computation satisfies the\nspecification.\n  Decision problems for LTL become search or optimization problems for LFL[F].\nIn particular, in the synthesis problem, the goal is to generate a transducer\nthat satisfies the specification in the highest possible quality.\n  Previous work considered the worst-case setting, where the goal is to\nmaximize the quality of the computation with the minimal quality. We introduce\nand solve the stochastic setting, where the goal is to generate a transducer\nthat maximizes the expected quality of a computation, subject to a given\ndistribution of the input signals. Thus, rather than being hostile, the\nenvironment is assumed to be probabilistic, which corresponds to many realistic\nsettings. We show that the problem is 2EXPTIME-complete, like classical LTL\nsynthesis, and remains so in two extensions we consider: one that maximizes the\nexpected quality while guaranteeing that the minimal quality is, with\nprobability $1$, above a given threshold, and one that allows assumptions on\nthe environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2016 16:21:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

Despite its simple\nstructure, no analytic solutions to the Chemical Master Equation are known for\nmost systems. Moreover, stochastic simulations are computationally expensive,\nmaking systematic analysis and statistical inference a challenging task.\nConsequently, significant effort has been spent in recent decades on the\ndevelopment of efficient approximation and inference methods. This article\ngives an introduction to basic modelling concepts as well as an overview of\nstate of the art methods. First, we motivate and introduce deterministic and\nstochastic methods for modelling chemical networks, and give an overview of\nsimulation and exact solution methods. Next, we discuss several approximation\nmethods, including the chemical Langevin equation, the system size expansion,\nmoment closure approximations, time-scale separation approximations and hybrid\nmethods. We discuss their various properties and review recent advances and\nremaining challenges for these methods. We present a comparison of several of\nthese methods by means of a numerical case study and highlight some of their\nrespective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss the problem of\ninference from experimental data in the Bayesian framework and review recent\nmethods developed the literature. In summary, this review gives a\nself-contained introduction to modelling, approximations and inference methods\nfor stochastic chemical kinetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2016 17:13:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 13:05:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-13"}

Most of the novel proposals have been in the financial sector.\nHowever, the public ledger is an abstraction that solves several of the\nfundamental problems in the design of secure distributed systems: global time\nin the form of a strict linear order of past events, globally consistent and\nimmutable view of the history, and enforcement of some application-specific\nsafety properties. This paper investigates the applications of public ledgers\nto access control and, more specifically, to group management in distributed\nsystems where entities are represented by their public keys and authorization\nis encoded into signed certificates. It is particularly difficult to handle\nnegative information, such as revocation of certificates or group membership,\nin the distributed setting. The linear order of events and global consistency\nsimplify these problems, but the enforcement of internal constraints in the\nledger implementation often presents problems. We show that different types of\nrevocation require slightly different properties from the ledger. We compare\nthe requirements with Bitcoin, the best known blockchain, and describe an\nefficient ledger design for membership revocation that combines ideas from\nblockchains and from web-PKI monitoring. While we use certificate-based\ngroup-membership management as the case study, the same ideas can be applied\nmore widely to rights revocation in distributed systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2016 18:01:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

We concentrate on disk flares\nwhose impulsive phase are accompanied by a series of more than three peaks\n(pulsations) of HXR emission detected in the RHESSI 50-100 keV channel with\n4-second cadence. 29 such flares observed from February 2002 to June 2015 with\ntime differences between successive peaks of 8-270 s are studied. The main\nobservational result is that sources of HXR pulsations in all flares are not\nstationary, they demonstrate apparent displacements from pulsation to\npulsation. The flares can be subdivided into two groups depending on character\nof dynamics of HXR sources. The group-1 consists of 16 flares (55%) with\nsystematic dynamics of HXR sources from pulsation to pulsation with respect to\na magnetic polarity inversion line (MPIL), which has simple extended trace on\nthe photosphere. The group-2 consists of 13 flares (45%) with more chaotic\ndisplacements of HXR sources with respect to an MPIL having more complicated\nstructure. Based on the observations we conclude that the mechanism of flare\nHXR pulsations is related to successive triggering of energy release in\ndifferent magnetic loops. Group-1 flare regions consist of loops stacked into\nmagnetic arcades extended along MPILs. Group-2 flare regions have more\ncomplicated magnetic structures and loops are arranged more chaotically. We\nalso found that at least 14 (88%) group-1 flares and 11 (85%) group-2 flares\nare accompanied by coronal mass ejections, i.e. the majority of flares studied\nare eruptive events. This gives an indication that eruptive processes play\nimportant role in generation of HXR pulsations. We suggest that an erupting\nflux rope can act as a trigger of energy release. Its successive interaction\nwith different loops can lead to apparent motion of HXR sources and to a series\nof HXR pulsations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2016 18:03:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-25"}

Loss\nreduction through improving fabrication processes has resulted in several\nintegrated micro resonator platforms attaining quality (Q) factors of several\nmillions. However only few studies have investigated design-dependent losses,\nespecially with regard to the resonator coupling section. Here we investigate\ndesign-dependent parasitic losses, described by the coupling ideality, of the\ncommonly employed microresonator design consisting of a microring resonator\nwaveguide side-coupled to a straight bus waveguide. By systematic\ncharacterization of multi-mode high-Q silicon nitride microresonator devices,\nwe show that this design can suffer from low coupling ideality. By performing\nfull 3D simulations to numerically investigate the resonator to bus waveguide\ncoupling, we identify the coupling to higher-order bus waveguide modes as the\ndominant origin of parasitic losses which lead to the low coupling ideality.\nUsing suitably designed bus waveguides, parasitic losses are mitigated, and a\nnearly unity ideality and strong overcoupling (i.e. a ratio of external\ncoupling to internal resonator loss rate > 9) are demonstrated. Moreover we\nfind that different resonator modes can exchange power through the coupler,\nwhich therefore constitutes a mechanism that induces modal coupling, a\nphenomenon known to distort resonator dispersion properties. Our results\ndemonstrate the potential for significant performance improvements of\nintegrated planar microresonators, achievable by optimized coupler designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2016 19:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

The stability of a quasi-two-dimensional condensate,\nwith respect to the tilting angle, is found to be different from a\ntwo-dimensional layer of dipoles, indicating the relevance of the transverse\nextension while characterizing two-dimensional dipolar systems. An anisotropic\nexcitation spectrum exhibiting a highly tunable, rotonlike minimum can arise\nentirely from the dipole-dipole interactions, by tilting the dipoles. At the\nmagic angle and in the absence of contact interactions, the long-wavelength\nexcitations are not phononlike and always unstable. The post-roton-instability\ndynamics, in contrast to phonon instability, in a uniform condensate, is\nfeatured by a transient, defect-free, stripe pattern, which eventually\nundergoes local collapses, and driving the condensate back into the stable\nregime can make them sustained for longer. Hopping between stripes has been\nobserved before it melts into a uniform state in the presence of dissipation.\nFinally, we discuss a class of solutions, in which a quasi-two-dimensional\ncondensate is self-trapped in one direction, as well as a regime of interaction\nparameters, including attractive short-range interactions, at which a\ntwo-dimensional anisotropic soliton can be stabilized, and we show that a\nchromium condensate with a relatively small number of atoms is well suited for\nthis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2016 19:43:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 13:45:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 08:23:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2016 06:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-13"}

For $n=1$, $2$, and $3$ we realize single, double, and\ntriple WSM, respectively, and the monopole charge $n$ determines the integer\ntopological invariant of the WSM. Within the linearized continuum description,\nthe quasiparticle spectrum is then composed of Landau levels (LLs), containing\nexactly $n$ number of chiral zeroth Landau levels (ZLLs), irrespective of the\norientation of the magnetic field. In the presence of strong backscattering,\nfor example, (due to quenched disorder associated with random impurities),\nthese systems generically give rise to longitudinal magnetotransport.\nRestricting ourselves to the quantum limit (and assuming only the subspace of\nthe ZLLs to be partially filled) and mainly accounting for Gaussian impurities,\nwe show that the longitudinal magnetoconductivity (LMC) in all members of the\nWeyl family displays a positive linear-$B$ scaling, when the field is applied\nalong the axis that separates the Weyl nodes. But, in double and triple WSM,\nLMC displays a smooth crossover to a nonlinear $B$-dependence as the field is\ntilted away from such a high-symmetry direction. In addition, due to the\nenhanced density of states, the LL quantization can trigger instabilities\ntoward the formation of translational symmetry breaking density-wave orderings\nfor sufficiently weak interaction (BCS instability), which gaps out the ZLLs.\nConcomitantly as the temperature (magnetic field) is gradually decreased\n(increased) the LMC becomes negative. Thus WSMs with arbitrary monopole charge\n($n$) can host an intriguing interplay of LL quantization, longitudinal\nmagnetotransport (a possible manifestation of one-dimensional chiral or axial\nanomaly), and density-wave ordering, when placed in a strong magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2016 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 19:59:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2016 20:50:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-29"}

To realize this unexplored regime, we simultaneously apply two\ncontinuous quantum non-demolition probes of non-commuting observables to a\nsuperconducting qubit. We implement multiple readout channels by coupling the\nqubit to multiple modes of a cavity. To control the measurement observables, we\nimplement a 'single quadrature' measurement by driving the qubit and applying\ncavity sidebands with a relative phase that sets the observable. Here, we show\nthat the uncertainty principle governs the dynamics of the wavefunction by\nenforcing a lower bound on the measurement-induced disturbance. Consequently,\nas we transition from measuring identical to measuring non-commuting\nobservables, the dynamics make a smooth transition from standard wavefunction\ncollapse to persistent diffusion. Although the evolution of the state differs\nfrom that of a conventional measurement, information about both observables is\nextracted by keeping track of the time ordering of the measurement record,\nenabling quantum state tomography without alternating measurements. Our work\ncreates novel capabilities for quantum control, including rapid state\npurification, adaptive measurement, measurement-based state steering and\ncontinuous quantum error correction.

This is achieved by imposing a single global\nconstraint on the total sum of equivalent plastic strains, providing accurate\ncontrol over all local stress violations. The single constraint essentially\nreplaces a large number of local stress constraints or an approximate\naggregation of them--two common approaches in the literature.

We find that the steep extinction curves derived from\nthe one-parameter formula by Cardelli et al.

Recently, the\n3.3 and 3.4 micrometer features which are commonly respectively attributed to\naromatic and aliphatic C-H stretches have been used to place an upper limit of\n~2\\% on the aliphatic fraction of the UIE carriers (i.e. the number of C atoms\nin aliphatic chains to that in aromatic rings). Here we further explore the\naliphatic versus aromatic content of the UIE carriers by examining the ratio of\nthe observed intensity of the 6.2 micrometer aromatic C-C feature (I6.2) to\nthat of the 6.85 micrometer aliphatic C-H deformation feature (I6.85). To\nderive the intrinsic oscillator strengths of the 6.2 micrometer stretch (A6.2)\nand the 6.85 micrometer deformation (A6.85), we employ density functional\ntheory to compute the vibrational spectra of seven methylated polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbon molecules and their cations. By comparing I6.85/I6.2 with\nA6.85/A6.2, we derive the fraction of C atoms in methyl(ene) aliphatic form to\nbe at most ~10\\%, confirming the earlier finding that the UIE emitters are\npredominantly aromatic. We have also computed the intrinsic strength of the\n7.25 micrometer feature (A7.25), another aliphatic C-H deformation band. We\nfind that A6.85 appreciably exceeds A7.25. This explains why the 6.85\nmicrometer feature is more frequently detected in space than the 7.25\nmicrometer feature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 04:14:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

Finally, we give a lower bound for\nsensitivity of $k$-uniform hypergraph properties, which implies the {\\em\nsensitivity conjecture} of $k$-uniform hypergraph properties for any constant\n$k$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 06:12:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-25"}

An important element in concrete SL is the\npoints-to predicate which denotes a singleton heap. SL with the points-to\npredicate has been shown to be non-recursively enumerable. In this paper, we\ndevelop a first-order SL, called FOASL, with an abstracted version of the\npoints-to predicate.

The emergent ice rules from the\ngeometrically frustrated skyrmion crystals highlight a novel phenomenon in this\nskyrmion system: emergent geometrical frustration.

The question is, thus, whether tools that can\ncalculate impact location may be used to obtain a qualitative understanding of\nthe asteroid impact risk distribution. To answer this question, two impact risk\ndistributions that control for impact effect modelling were generated and\ncompared. The Asteroid Risk Mitigation Optimization and Research (ARMOR) tool,\nin conjunction with the freely available software OrbFit, was used to project\nthe impact probabilities of listed asteroids with a minimum diameter of 30 m\nonto the surface of the Earth representing a random sample (15% of all objects)\nof the hazard list.

Mass and metallicity are the stellar parameters that have the most\ndramatic effects on the habitable zone limits. Conversely, for a given stellar\nmass and metallicity, stellar rotation has only a marginal effect on these\nlimits and does not modify the width of the habitable zone. The evolution of\nthe habitable zone limits is also correlated to the evolution of the stellar\nactivity (through the Rossby number) that depends on the stellar mass\nconsidered. While the magnetic activity has negligible consequence in the case\nof more massive stars, these effects may have a strong impact on the\nhabitability of a planet around M dwarf stars. Thus, stellar activity cannot be\nneglected and may have strong impacts on the development of life during the\nearly stage of the continuously habitable zone phase of low-mass stars.

We also discuss practical ways to guarantee that our\nenergy models are bounded from below, with a minimal impact on their accuracy.\nFinally, we demonstrate our scheme with an application to ferroelastic\nperovskite SrTiO$_{3}$, which features many non-trivial lattice-dynamical\nfeatures (e.g., a phase transition driven by soft phonons, competing structural\ninstabilities, highly anharmonic dynamics) and provides a very demanding test.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 12:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

A graph with\nweighted edges is called stable if the maximum weight of an integral matching\nequals the cost of a minimum fractional weighted vertex cover. If a graph is\nnot stable, it can be stabilized in different ways. Recent papers have\nconsidered the deletion or addition of edges and vertices in order to stabilize\na graph. In this work, we focus on a fine-grained stabilization strategy,\nnamely stabilization of graphs by fractionally increasing edge weights.

Kepler-20b (Rp\n~ 1.9 REarth) has a size beyond this transition radius, however previous mass\nmeasurements were not sufficiently precise to allow definite conclusions to be\ndrawn regarding its composition.

We\napply our algorithm on random and real-world networks, demonstrating,\nremarkably, that the MF optimal external fields (i.e., the external fields\nwhich maximize the MF magnetization) shift from focusing on high-degree\nindividuals at high temperatures to focusing on low-degree individuals at low\ntemperatures. We also establish a number of novel results about the structure\nof steady-states in the ferromagnetic MF Ising model on general graph\ntopologies, which are of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 14:50:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2017 18:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

However, the\npedagogical examples and research work almost exclusively focus on situations\nwhere the fields are time-independent so that one need only deal with purely\nspatial line integrals ({\\it e.g.} $\\oint {\\bf A} \\cdot d{\\bf x}$) and purely\nspatial area integrals ({\\it e.g.} $\\int (\\nabla \\times {\\bf A}) \\cdot d{\\bf a}\n= \\int {\\bf B} \\cdot d{\\bf a}$). Here we address this gap by giving some\nexplicit examples of how Stokes' theorem plays out with time-dependent fields\nin a full 4-dimensional spacetime context. We also discuss some unusual\nfeatures of Stokes' theorem with time-dependent fields related to gauge\ntransformations and non-simply connected topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 00:47:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-21"}

Our solution provides\nin simple and closed analytical forms all Landau Level-wavefunctions without\nthe need to specify a particular vector potential. This we do by proper\nhandling of the so-called pseudomomentum K (or of a quantity that we term\npseudoangular momentum Lz), a method that is crucially different from the old\nwarning argument, but also from standard treatments in textbooks and in\nresearch literature (where the usual Landau wavefunctions are employed -\nlabeled with canonical momenta quantum numbers). Most importantly, we go\nfurther by showing that a similar procedure can be followed in the more\ndifficult case of spatially-nonuniform magnetic fields: in such case we define\nK and Lz as plausible generalizations of the previous ordinary case, namely as\nappropriate line integrals of the inhomogeneous magnetic field - our method\nproviding closed analytical expressions for all stationary state\nwavefunctions.. (see paper) ... also provide explicit Berry's phase\ncalculations and their connection to probability currents and ...issues in\nelementary Quantum Mechanics and Condensed Matter Physics. As an added feature,\nwe also show how the possible presence of an additional electric field can be\ntreated through a further generalization of pseudomomenta and their proper\nhandling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 11:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}
