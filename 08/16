To automatically determine the\norder, we train a regressor to estimate the size of the object given the whole\nimage as input. Furthermore, we use these size estimates to further improve the\nre-localization step of WSOL by assigning weights to object proposals according\nto how close their size matches the estimated object size. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of using size order and size weighting on the challenging PASCAL\nVOC 2007 dataset, where we achieve a significant improvement over existing\nstate-of-the-art WSOL techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2016 16:07:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2016 11:31:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

Our method learns to automatically select the most effective\natlases for a novel patient, and then map the dose from those atlases onto the\nnovel patient. We extend our previous work to include a conditional random\nfield for the optimization of a joint distribution prior that matches the\ncomplementary goals of an accurately spatially distributed dose distribution\nwhile still adhering to the desired dose volume histograms. The resulting\ndistribution can then be used for inverse-planning with a new spatial dose\nobjective, or to create typical dose volume objectives for the canonical\noptimization pipeline. We investigated six treatment sites (633 patients for\ntraining and 113 patients for testing) and evaluated the mean absolute\ndifference (MAD) in all DVHs for the clinical and predicted dose distribution.\nThe results on average are favorable in comparison to our previous approach\n(1.91 vs 2.57).

Bounds on the population\naverage treatment effect are derived under four cases, two under no assumptions\non the data, and two that assume bounded sample variation and monotonicity of\nresponse.

Combined with data augmentation,\nthe proposed model produces state-of-the-art results for environmental sound\nclassification. We show that the improved performance stems from the\ncombination of a deep, high-capacity model and an augmented training set: this\ncombination outperforms both the proposed CNN without augmentation and a\n\"shallow\" dictionary learning model with augmentation. Finally, we examine the\ninfluence of each augmentation on the model's classification accuracy for each\nclass, and observe that the accuracy for each class is influenced differently\nby each augmentation, suggesting that the performance of the model could be\nimproved further by applying class-conditional data augmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2016 18:57:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2016 17:48:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

Digital\ncorrelators have systematic errors due to the quantization losses. The\ncorrelation errors allow substantial abatement based on the assumption that the\nanalog signals are stochastic processes sampled from a statistical distribution\n(usually the Gaussian). The correlation correction technique is named after Van\nVleck who was the first to apply it to two-level clipping quantizers. The\ncorrection is especially important for high correlation levels, e.g. in studies\nof solar radio emissions. We offer a generalized method that for every antenna\npair inputs the quantized signals' covariance and standard deviations, and\noutputs high-precision estimates of the analog correlation. Although\ncorrelation correction methods have been extensively investigated in the past,\nthere are several problems that, as far as we know, have not been published\nyet. We consider a very general quantization scheme with arbitrary set of\ntransition thresholds and output levels, and our correction method is designed\nfor correlations obtained from signals with generally unequal standard\ndeviations. We also provide a method for estimation of the analog standard\ndeviation from the quantized one for subsequent use in the correlation\ncorrection. We apply the correction to the the complex-valued analytic signals,\noverwhelmingly used in modern remote sensing systems with arrays of antennas.\nThe approach is valid not only for analytic signals with the imaginary part\nbeing the Hilbert transform of the real one, but also for more general,\ncircularly symmetric complex processes whose real and imaginary parts may have\narbitrary relationships to each other. This work was motivated by the need for\ngreater precision in analysis of data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2016 19:05:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

Recent measurements that combine rotational tomography, extreme\nultraviolet imaging, and potential-field extrapolation have shown the existence\nof large loops with inverted temperature profiles; i.e., loops for which the\napex temperature is a local minimum, not a maximum. These \"down loops\" appear\nto exist primarily in equatorial quiet regions near solar minimum. We simulate\nboth these and the more prevalent large-scale \"up loops\" by modeling coronal\nheating as a time-steady superposition of: (1) dissipation of incompressible\nAlfven-wave turbulence, and (2) dissipation of compressive waves formed by mode\nconversion from the initial population of Alfven waves. We found that when a\nlarge percentage (> 99%) of the Alfven waves undergo this conversion, heating\nis greatly concentrated at the footpoints and stable \"down loops\" are created.\nIn some cases we found loops with three maxima that are also gravitationally\nstable. Models that agree with the tomographic temperature data exhibit higher\ngas pressures for \"down loops\" than for \"up loops,\" which is consistent with\nobservations.

First, it argues for several visualization methods to\ncritically analyze and understand the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems.\nSecond, it uses these visualizations to introduce the foundations of nonlinear\ndynamics, chaos, fractals, self-similarity and the limits of prediction.\nFinally, it presents Pynamical, an open-source Python package to easily\nvisualize and explore nonlinear dynamical systems' behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2016 21:36:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2016 22:41:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-16"}

TerpreT is similar to a\nprobabilistic programming language: a model is composed of a specification of a\nprogram representation (declarations of random variables) and an interpreter\ndescribing how programs map inputs to outputs (a model connecting unknowns to\nobservations). The inference task is to observe a set of input-output examples\nand infer the underlying program. TerpreT has two main benefits. First, it\nenables rapid exploration of a range of domains, program representations, and\ninterpreter models. Second, it separates the model specification from the\ninference algorithm, allowing like-to-like comparisons between different\napproaches to inference. From a single TerpreT specification we automatically\nperform inference using four different back-ends. These are based on gradient\ndescent, linear program (LP) relaxations for graphical models, discrete\nsatisfiability solving, and the Sketch program synthesis system.\n  We illustrate the value of TerpreT by developing several interpreter models\nand performing an empirical comparison between alternative inference\nalgorithms.

However, in a heterogeneous WPT network with\ndistributed ENs and WDs, some WDs may quickly deplete their batteries due to\nthe lack of timely wireless power supply by the ENs, thus resulting in short\nnetwork operating lifetime. In this paper, we exploit frequency diversity in a\nbroadband WPT network and study the distributed charging control by ENs to\nmaximize network lifetime. In particular, we propose a practical voting-based\ndistributed charging control framework where each WD simply estimates the\nbroadband channel, casts its vote(s) for some strong sub-channel(s) and sends\nto the ENs along with its battery state information, based on which the ENs\nindependently allocate their transmit power over the sub-channels without the\nneed of centralized control. Under this framework, we aim to design\nlifetime-maximizing power allocation and efficient voting-based feedback\nmethods. Towards this end, we first derive the general expression of the\nexpected lifetime of a WPT network and draw the general design principles for\nlifetime-maximizing charging control. Based on the analysis, we then propose a\ndistributed charging control protocol with voting-based feedback, where the\npower allocated to sub-channels at each EN is a function of the weighted sum\nvote received from all WDs. Besides, the number of votes cast by a WD and the\nweight of each vote are related to its current battery state. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed distributed charging control protocol could\nsignificantly increase the network lifetime under stringent transmit power\nconstraint in a broadband WPT network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2016 02:44:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

For example, position bias in\nsearch rankings strongly influences how many clicks a result receives, so that\ndirectly using click data as a training signal in Learning-to-Rank (LTR)\nmethods yields sub-optimal results.

To investigate how radiation forces influence realistic turbulent\nsystems, we have conducted a series of numerical simulations employing the {\\it\nHyperion} radiation hydrodynamics solver, considering the regime that is\noptically thick to ultraviolet (UV) and optically thin to infrared (IR)\nradiation. Our model clouds cover initial surface densities between\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm cl,0} \\sim 10-300~M_{\\odot}~{\\rm pc^{-2}}$, with varying initial\nturbulence. We follow them through turbulent, self-gravitating collapse,\nformation of star clusters, and cloud dispersal by stellar radiation. All our\nmodels display a lognormal distribution of gas surface density $\\Sigma$; for an\ninitial virial parameter $\\alpha_{\\rm vir,0} = 2$, the lognormal standard\ndeviation is $\\sigma_{\\rm ln \\Sigma} = 1-1.5$ and the star formation rate\ncoefficient $\\varepsilon_{\\rm ff,\\bar\\rho} = 0.3-0.5$, both of which are\nsensitive to turbulence but not radiation feedback. The net star formation\nefficiency $\\varepsilon_\\mathrm{final}$ increases with $\\Sigma_{\\rm cl,0}$ and\ndecreases with $\\alpha_{\\rm vir,0}$. We interpret these results via a simple\nconceptual framework, whereby steady star formation increases the radiation\nforce, such that local gas patches at successively higher $\\Sigma$ become\nunbound. Based on this formalism (with fixed $\\sigma_{\\rm ln \\Sigma}$), we\nprovide an analytic upper bound on $\\varepsilon_\\mathrm{final}$, which is in\ngood agreement with our numerical results. The final star formation efficiency\ndepends on the distribution of Eddington ratios in the cloud and is strongly\nincreased by turbulent compression of gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2016 03:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

Many approaches and problem variants have been\nconsidered in the literature, all assuming that edge-existence probabilities\nare fixed. Nevertheless, in real-world graphs, edge probabilities typically\ndepend on external conditions. In metabolic networks a protein can be converted\ninto another protein with some probability depending on the presence of certain\nenzymes. In social influence networks the probability that a tweet of some user\nwill be re-tweeted by her followers depends on whether the tweet contains\nspecific hashtags. In transportation networks the probability that a network\nsegment will work properly or not might depend on external conditions such as\nweather or time of the day. In this paper we overcome this limitation and focus\non conditional reliability, that is assessing reliability when edge-existence\nprobabilities depend on a set of conditions. In particular, we study the\nproblem of determining the k conditions that maximize the reliability between\ntwo nodes. We deeply characterize our problem and show that, even employing\npolynomial-time reliability-estimation methods, it is NP-hard, does not admit\nany PTAS, and the underlying objective function is non-submodular.

However, for an arbitrary cost c,\ngiven a multi-marginal c-cyclically monotone set, the question whether there\nexists an analogous explicit construction to the one from the two-marginal case\nof c-splitting potentials is still open. When the margins are one-dimensional\nand the cost belongs to a certain class, Carlier proved that the two-marginal\nprojections of a c-splitting set are monotone.

In particular, faint warm debris disks may\nbe related to late planet formation near 1 AU. A systematic search of faint\nwarm debris disks is necessary to reveal terrestrial planet formation. Aims:\nFaint warm debris disks show excess emission that peaks at mid-IR wavelengths.\nThus we explore debris disks using the AKARI mid-IR all-sky point source\ncatalog (PSC), a product of the second generation unbiased IR all-sky survey.\nMethods : We investigate IR excess emission for 678 isolated main-sequence\nstars for which there are 18 micron detections in the AKARI mid-IR all-sky\ncatalog by comparing their fluxes with the predicted fluxes of the photospheres\nbased on optical to near-IR fluxes and model spectra. The near-IR fluxes are\nfirst taken from the 2MASS PSC. However, 286 stars with Ks<4.5 in our sample\nhave large flux errors in the 2MASS photometry due to saturation. Thus we have\nmeasured accurate J, H, and Ks band fluxes, applying neutral density (ND)\nfilters for Simultaneous InfraRed Imager for Unbiased Survey (SIRIUS) on IRSF,\nthe \\phi 1.4 m near-IR telescope in South Africa, and improved the flux\naccuracy from 14% to 1.8% on average. Results: We identified 53 debris-disk\ncandidates including eight new detections from our sample of 678 main-sequence\nstars. The detection rate of debris disks for this work is ~8%, which is\ncomparable with those in previous works by Spitzer and Herschel.

Extensive experiments showed that SenTion framework yielded\ndramatic improvements in facial expression recognition and could be employed in\nreal-world applications with low resolution imaging and minimal computational\nresources in real-time, achieving 15-18 fps on a 2.4 GHz CPU with no GPU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2016 05:27:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

The fundamental roadblocks in studying the\ninfrared time-domain have been the overwhelmingly bright sky background (250\ntimes brighter than optical) and the narrow field-of-view of infrared cameras\n(largest is 0.6 sq deg). To begin to address these challenges and open a new\nobservational window in the infrared, we present Palomar Gattini-IR: a 25 sq\ndegree, 300mm aperture, infrared telescope at Palomar Observatory that surveys\nthe entire accessible sky (20,000 sq deg) to a depth of 16.4 AB mag (J band,\n1.25um) every night.

We anticipate the potential for otherwise infeasible\ndiscoveries, including, for example, the elusive electromagnetic counterparts\nto gravitational wave detections. With dedicated hardware in hand, and a F/1.44\ntelescope available commercially and cost-effectively, Palomar Gattini-IR will\nbe on-sky in early 2017 and will survey the entire accessible sky every night\nfor two years.

Each a(ge)nt begins to operate at an arbitrary initial\nlocation, and throughout its work does not acquire any information on either\nthe shape or size of the graph, or the number or whereabouts of other a(ge)nts.\nGraph partitioning occurs spontaneously, as each of the a(ge)nts patrols and\nexpands its own pheromone-marked sub-graph, or region. This graph partitioning\nalgorithm is inspired by molecules hitting the borders of air filled elastic\nballoons: an a(ge)nt that hits a border edge from the interior of its region\nmore frequently than an external a(ge)nt hits the same edge from an adjacent\nvertex in the neighboring region, may conquer that adjacent vertex, expanding\nits region at the expense of the neighbor. Since the rule of patrolling a\nregion ensures that each vertex is visited with a frequency inversely\nproportional to the size of the region, in terms of vertex count, a smaller\nregion will effectively exert higher \"pressure\" at its borders, and conquer\nadjacent vertices from a larger region, thereby increasing the smaller region\nand shrinking the larger. The algorithm, therefore, tends to equalize the sizes\nof the regions patrolled, resembling a set of perfectly elastic physical\nballoons, confined to a closed volume and filled with an equal amount of air.\nThe pheromone based local interactions of agents eventually cause the system to\nevolve into a partition that is close to balanced rather quickly, and if the\ngraph and the number of a(ge)nts remain unchanged, it is guaranteed that the\nsystem settles into a stable and balanced partition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2016 08:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

However, the singular\nvalues have clear physical meanings in many practical problems, and NNM may not\nbe able to faithfully approximate the matrix rank. To alleviate the\nabove-mentioned limitation of NNM, recent studies have suggested that the\nweighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) can achieve a better rank estimation\nthan NNM, which heuristically set the weight being inverse to the singular\nvalues. However, it still lacks a rigorous explanation why WNNM is more\neffective than NMM in various applications. In this paper, we analyze NNM and\nWNNM from the perspective of group sparse representation (GSR). Concretely, an\nadaptive dictionary learning method is devised to connect the rank minimization\nand GSR models. Based on the proposed dictionary, we prove that NNM and WNNM\nare equivalent to L1-norm minimization and the weighted L1-norm minimization in\nGSR, respectively. Inspired by enhancing sparsity of the weighted L1-norm\nminimization in comparison with L1-norm minimization in sparse representation,\nwe thus explain that WNNM is more effective than NMM. By integrating the image\nnonlocal self-similarity (NSS) prior with the WNNM model, we then apply it to\nsolve the image denoising problem. Experimental results demonstrate that WNNM\nis more effective than NNM and outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in\nboth objective and perceptual quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2016 08:31:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 03:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 May 2017 01:39:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 10 May 2019 08:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-13"}

Ab-initio electrostatic calculations reveal that the presence of charges\non the graphite surface weakens the interaction between layers allowing for\nexfoliation at voltages in the same range as those used experimentally.\nMolecular dynamics simulations show that a force applied locally on the edge of\na step produces triangular flakes such as those observed under STM.

Therefore, more structural features should be considered.\nHowever, owing to the remarkably different structural features, the\ncontributions of different features are hard to be given in advance.

This has many applications, in particular in cloud computing.\n  In all currently known FHE schemes, encryptions are associated to some\n(non-negative integer) noise level, and at each evaluation of an AND gate, the\nnoise level increases. This is problematic because decryption can only work if\nthe noise level stays below some maximum level $L$ at every gate of the\ncircuit. To ensure that property, it is possible to perform an operation called\n\\emph{bootstrapping} to reduce the noise level. However, bootstrapping is\ntime-consuming and has been identified as a critical operation. This motivates\na new problem in discrete optimization, that of choosing where in the circuit\nto perform bootstrapping operations so as to control the noise level; the goal\nis to minimize the number of bootstrappings in circuits.\n  In this paper, we formally define the \\emph{bootstrap problem}, we design a\npolynomial-time $L$-approximation algorithm using a novel method of rounding of\na linear program, and we show a matching hardness result:\n$(L-\\epsilon)$-inapproximability for any $\\epsilon>0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2016 09:59:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

For the perspective of Solar-Terrestrial\nrelationship, it will be of great importance to estimate the properties of\npost-shock solar wind simply and accurately. Motivated by this, we performed a\nstatistical analysis of IP shocks during 1998-2008, focusing on the\nsignificantly different responses of two well-used geomagnetic indices (SYMH\nand AL) to the passive of two types of IP shocks. For the IP shocks with\nnorthward IMF (91 cases), the SYMH index keeps on the high level after the\nsudden impulses (SI) for a long time. Meanwhile, the change of AL index is\nrelative small, with an mean value of only -29 nT. However, for the IP shocks\nwith southward IMF (92 cases), the SYMH index suddenly decreases at a certain\nrate after SI, and the change of AL index is much significant, of -316 nT.\nFurthermore, the change rate of SYMH index after SI is found to be linearly\ncorrelated with the post-shock reconnection E-field (E$_{KL}$). Based on these\nfacts, an inversion model of post-shock IMF orientation and E$_{KL}$ is\ndeveloped. The model validity is also confirmed by studying 68 IP shocks in the\nperiod of 2009-2013. The inversion accuracy of IMF orientation is 88.24%, and\nthe inversion efficiency of E$_{KL}$ is as high as 78%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2016 11:31:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

Successful server\nauthentication therefore requires a valid certificate and the server's presence\nat a legitimate geographic location, e.g., on the premises of a data center.\nSALVE prevents server impersonation by remote adversaries with mis-issued\ncertificates or stolen private keys of the legitimate server. We develop a\nprototype implementation and our evaluation in real-world settings shows that\nit incurs minimal impact to the average server throughput. Our solution is\nbackward compatible and can be integrated with existing approaches for\nimproving server authentication in TLS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2016 12:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

However, maintaining observer nodes that can provide their\ninfection time may be costly, and we may have a budget $k$ on the number of\nobserver nodes we can maintain.

All current\nalgorithms are limited by their own success in that, as the dark hole is\nachieved, the FPWS procedure becomes shot-noise limited due to he low intensity\nin the dark hole. This article proposes a FPWS procedure that allows\ndetermination of the optimal DM configuration without relying on information\nobtained when the DM is near the optimal configuration. This article gives\nregression procedures for FPWS that do not assume the DM step size is small,\nwhich should allow two important improvements to the control loop: 1)\nperforming informative FPWS observations with DM configurations that are\nsufficiently distant from the optimal dark hole configuration to mitigate\nshot-noise limitations, and 2) more accurately predicting the DM configuration\nthat will achieve the desired objective in the dark hole control loop. In order\nto treat this more challenging FPWS problem, two different representations are\npresented. The first of these, is called the empirical Green's function (EGF),\nis easy to implement, and has a block-diagonal matrix structure that is\nwell-suited to parallel processing. The other representation, based on an\nexplicit aberration expansion (EAE) requires the regression to estimate a\nsmaller number of parameters than the EGF, but leads to a dense matrix\nstructure.

In a doubly periodic\nrectangle, the mean flow with zero total momentum was therefore believed to be\nunidirectional, with two jets along the short side; while for an aspect ratio\nclose to unity, a vortex dipole was expected. Using direct numerical\nsimulations, we show that in fact neither the box symmetry is respected nor the\nlargest scale is realized: the flow is never purely unidirectional since the\ninverse cascade produces coherent vortices, whose number and relative motion\nare determined by the aspect ratio. This spontaneous symmetry breaking is\nclosely related to the hierarchy of averaging times.

Due to the presence of the intermediate bath sites, the\noverall dynamics acting on the impurity site is non-Markovian.\n  With the help of an optimization scheme for the auxiliary Lindblad\nparameters, an accurate mapping is achieved, which becomes exponentially exact\nupon increasing $N_B$. The basic idea for this scheme was presented previously\nin the context of nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory. In successive\nworks on improved manybody solution strategies for the auxiliary Lindblad\nequation, such as Lanczos exact diagonalization or matrix product states, we\napplied the approach to study the nonequilibrium Kondo regime.\n  In the present paper, we address in detail the mapping procedure itself,\nrather than the many-body solution.

For setups\nwith onsite or nearest-neighbor Lindblad parameters we find that a\nrepresentation adopting two separate bath chains is by far more accurate with\nrespect to other choices based on a single chain or a commonly used star\ngeometry.

Although medical best practice guidelines exist in\nhospital handbooks, they are often lengthy and difficult to apply clinically.\nThe challenges are exaggerated for doctors in rural areas and emergency medical\ntechnicians (EMT) during patient transport.\n  In this paper, we propose the concept of distributed executable medical best\npractice guidance systems to assist adherence to best practice from the time\nthat a patient first presents at a rural hospital, through diagnosis and\nambulance transfer to arrival and treatment at a regional tertiary hospital\ncenter. We codify complex medical knowledge in the form of simplified\ndistributed executable disease automata, from the thin automata at rural\nhospitals to the rich automata in the regional center hospitals. However, a\nmain challenge is how to efficiently and safely synchronize distributed best\npractice models as the communication among medical facilities, devices, and\nprofessionals generates a large number of messages. This complex problem of\npatient diagnosis and transport from rural to center facility is also fraught\nwith many uncertainties and changes resulting in a high degree of dynamism.

This study refutes this. The author mathematically defines the\nstability and rigidity of electoral systems comprised of any quantity of\nelectors and parties. In fact, stability is a function of the quantity of\nelectors - i.e., the number of occupied seats at the table. As the number of\nelectors increases, the properties of an electorate are increasingly well\nresolved, and well described by those of an electorate that is least excessive\n-- that is to say an electorate that is closest to equilibrium. Further,\nelectoral rigidity is a function of the quantity of parties and their\nprobabilities of representation. An absolutely rigid system admits no\nfluctuations -- whatever happens to one elector will happen to all electors. As\nthe quantity of parties increases so does the number of party lines, and with\nit the quantity of alternatives with which to respond to an external stimulus.\nRigidity is significant in a social system that places high value on party\nloyalty. In conclusion, (i) electoral stability is best served by increasing\nthe quantity of electors; (ii) electoral rigidity is best served by decreasing\nthe quantity of parties, and by increasing the representation of some parties\nat the expense of others; and (iii) the less stable a branch of government, the\nmore concern is placed on those who would hold those offices for the people.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2016 05:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-18"}
