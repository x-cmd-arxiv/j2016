End users of these applications range from novice to\nexpert depending on how experienced they are in using them. With repeated usage\n(practice) of an application, a user's think time gradually decreases, known as\nlearning phenomenon. In contrast to the popular notion of constant mean think\ntime of users across all practice sessions, decrease in mean think time over\npractice sessions does occur due to learning. This decrease gives rise to a\ndifferent system workload thereby affecting the application's short-term\nperformance. However, such impact of learning on performance has never been\naccounted for. In this work we propose a model that accounts for human learning\nbehavior in analyzing the transient (short-term) performance of a 3-tier cloud\nbased application. Our approach is based on a closed queueing network model. We\nsolve the model using discrete event simulation. In addition to the overall\nmean System Response Time (SRT), our model solution also generates the mean\nSRTs for various types (novice, intermediate, expert) of requests submitted by\nusers at various levels of their expertise. We demonstrate that our model can\nbe used to evaluate various what-if scenarios to decide the number of VMs we\nneed for each tier-a VM configuration-that would meet the response time SLA.\nThe results show that the lack of accountability of learning may lead to a\nselection of an inappropriate VM configuration. The results further show that\nthe mean SRTs for various types of requests are better measures to consider in\nVM allocation process in comparison to the overall mean SRT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2016 21:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

Given a buggy program that fails some\ntest cases, a typical automatic repair technique tries to modify the program to\nmake all tests pass. However, since the test suites in real world projects are\nusually insufficient, aiming at passing the test suites often leads to\nincorrect patches.\n  In this paper we aim to produce precise patches, that is, any patch we\nproduce has a relatively high probability to be correct. More concretely, we\nfocus on condition synthesis, which was shown to be able to repair more than\nhalf of the defects in existing approaches. Our key insight is threefold.\nFirst, it is important to know what variables in a local context should be used\nin an \"if\" condition, and we propose a sorting method based on the dependency\nrelations between variables. Second, we observe that the API document can be\nused to guide the repair process, and propose document analysis technique to\nfurther filter the variables. Third, it is important to know what predicates\nshould be performed on the set of variables, and we propose to mine a set of\nfrequently used predicates in similar contexts from existing projects.\n  We develop a novel program repair system, ACS, that could generate precise\nconditions at faulty locations. Furthermore, given the generated conditions are\nvery precise, we can perform a repair operation that is previously deemed to be\ntoo overfitting: directly returning the test oracle to repair the defect. Using\nour approach, we successfully repaired 17 defects on four projects of\nDefects4J, which is the largest number of fully automatically repaired defects\nreported on the dataset so far.

Pre-main sequence (PMS)\nstars in nearby young open clusters reveal a large spread in brightness. If the\nspread were considered as a result of a real spread in age, the corresponding\ncluster formation timescale would be about 5 -- 20 Myr. Hence it could be\ninterpreted that star formation in an open cluster is prolonged for up to a few\ntens of Myr. However, difficulties in reddening correction, observational\nerrors, and systematic uncertainties introduced by imperfect evolutionary\nmodels for PMS stars, can result in an artificial age spread. Alternatively, we\ncan utilize Li abundance as a relative age indicator of PMS star to determine\nthe cluster formation timescale. The optical spectra of 134 PMS stars in NGC\n2264 have been obtained with MMT/Hectochelle. The equivalent widths have been\nmeasured for 86 PMS stars with a detectable Li line (3500 < T_eff [K] <= 6500).\nLi abundance under the condition of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) was\nderived using the conventional curve of growth method. After correction for\nnon-LTE effects, we find that the initial Li abundance of NGC 2264 is A(Li) =\n3.2 +/- 0.2. From the distribution of the Li abundances, the underlying age\nspread of the visible PMS stars is estimated to be about 3 -- 4 Myr and this,\ntogether with the presence of embedded populations in NGC 2264, suggests that\nthe cluster formed on a timescale shorter than 5 Myr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2016 10:20:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

However, MIMO radar poses new challenges for both hardware design\nand digital processing. In particular, achieving high azimuth resolution\nrequires a large number of transmit and receive antennas. In addition, the\ndigital processing is performed on samples of the received signal, from each\ntransmitter to each receiver, at its Nyquist rate, which can be prohibitively\nlarge when high resolution is needed. Overcoming the rate bottleneck,\nsub-Nyquist sampling methods have been proposed that break the link between\nradar signal bandwidth and sampling rate. In this work, we extend these methods\nto MIMO configurations and propose a sub-Nyquist MIMO radar (SUMMeR) system\nthat performs both time and spatial compression. We present a\nrange-azimuth-Doppler recovery algorithm from sub-Nyquist samples obtained from\na reduced number of transmitters and receivers, that exploits the sparsity of\nthe recovered targets' parameters. This allows us to achieve reduction in the\nnumber of deployed antennas and the number of samples per receiver, without\ndegrading the time and spatial resolutions. Simulations illustrate the\ndetection performance of SUMMeR for different compression levels and shows that\nboth time and spatial resolution are preserved, with respect to classic Nyquist\nMIMO configurations. We also examine the impact of design parameters, such as\nantennas' locations and carrier frequencies, on the detection performance, and\nprovide guidelines for their choice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2016 10:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

In principle, a gravitational wave\ndetector can distinguish between a merger of binary black hole in f(R) theory\nand the respective merger in general relativity. Moreover, it is possible to\nuse gravitational wave detection to distinguish between f(R) theory and a non\nself-interacting scalar field model in general relativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2016 14:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

Using detailed disk structure and ray tracing models, we\ncalculate the temperature structure and dust mass from modeling the observed\nspectral energy distributions, and include the effect of UV gas heating to\ndetermine the amount of gas required to fit the HD line. The range of gas\nmasses are 1.0-4.7$\\times10^{-2}$ for DM Tau and 2.5-20.4$\\times10^{-2}$ for GM\nAur. These values are larger than those found using CO for GM Aur, while the\nCO-derived gas mass for DM Tau is consistent with the lower end of our mass\nrange. This suggests a CO chemical depletion from the gas phase of up to a\nfactor of five for DM Tau and up to two orders of magnitude for GM Aur. We\ndiscuss how future analysis can narrow the mass ranges further.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2016 14:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

With\nthis theory, an effective electron field theory based on the electron-dislon\ninteraction is obtained, which consists of two types of interactions. One\nclassical-type of interaction is reducible to the well-known deformation\npotential scattering, and the other quantum-type of interaction indicates an\neffective attraction between electrons.
