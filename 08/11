Owing to the preferential formation of stars in stellar clusters, the\nprotoplanetary disks around these stars may potentially be affected by the\ncluster environment. Various works have investigated the influence of stellar\nfly-bys on disks, although many of them consider only the effects due to\nparabolic, coplanar encounters often for equal-mass stars, which is only a very\nspecial case. We perform numerical simulations to study the fate of\nprotoplanetary disks after the impact of parabolic star-disk encounter for the\nless investigated case of inclined up to coplanar, retrograde encounters, which\nis a much more common case. Here, we concentrate on the disk size after such\nencounters because this limits the size of the potentially forming planetary\nsystems. In addition, with the possibilities that ALMA offers, now a direct\ncomparison to observations is possible. Covering a wide range of periastron\ndistances and mass ratios between the mass of the perturber and central star,\nwe find that despite the prograde, coplanar encounters having the strongest\neffect on the disk size, inclined and even the least destructive retrograde\nencounters mostly also have a considerable effect, especially for close\nperiastron passages.

We also determine the final orbital parameters of the\nparticles in the disk such as eccentricities, inclinations, and semi-major\naxes.

In this work, first equivalence of various types of invariant\nsubspaces that are defined for RS systems are investigated.

We use our two formulations\nto produce new accurate estimates for the energy and local moment of the\ntwo-dimensional Hubbard model for U/t = 2, 4, 6. These results compare\nfavourably with the best data available in literature, and help resolve earlier\nuncertainties in the moment for U/t = 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2016 00:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

Employing extensive\nnumerical simulations, we establish that the transitions and dynamical states\nobserved in coevolving voter model networks without clustering are altered by\nreinforcing transitivity in the model. We then use a semi-analytical framework\nin terms of approximate master equations to predict the dynamical behaviors of\nthe model for a variety of parameter settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2016 01:03:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

Besides, crowd-sourced labels need to be\naggregated to estimate the ground truth of the data. Because of the imperfect\npredictive models or human crowdsourcing workers, noisy and conflicting\ninformation is ubiquitous and inevitable. Although state-of-the-art aggregation\nmethods have been proposed to handle label spaces with flat structures, as the\nlabel space is becoming more and more complicated, aggregation under a label\nhierarchical structure becomes necessary but has been largely ignored. These\nlabel hierarchies can be quite informative as they are usually created by\ndomain experts to make sense of highly complex label correlations for many\nreal-world cases like protein functionality interactions or disease\nrelationships.\n  We propose a novel multi-source hierarchical prediction consolidation method\nto effectively exploits the complicated hierarchical label structures to\nresolve the noisy and conflicting information that inherently originates from\nmultiple imperfect sources.

The observation that\ncompressing hard-particle packings towards jamming causes growing\nhyperuniformity has paved the way for the analysis of jamming as an \"inverted\ncritical point\" in which the direct correlation function $c(r)$ diverges. We\nestablish quantitative relationships between various singularities in $c(r)$\nand the total correlation function $h(r)$ that provide a concrete means of\nidentifying features that must be expressed in $c(r)$ if one hopes to reproduce\ndetails in the pair correlation function accurately.

We identify a short-ranged scaling $c(r) \\propto -1/r$ as $r\n\\rightarrow 0$ and show that this, along with the developing delta function at\n$c(D)$, is a consequence of the growing long-rangedness in $c(r)$.

The latter is believed to be associated\nwith mechanisms that include multiple reaction pathways due to enzymatic\nconformational fluctuations. Recent advances in single-molecule fluorescence\nspectroscopy have provided new fundamental insights on the possible mechanisms\nunderlying reactions catalyzed by fluctuating enzymes. Here, we present a\nbottom-up approach to understand enzyme turnover kinetics at physiologically\nrelevant mesoscopic concentrations informed by mechanisms extracted from\nsingle-molecule stochastic trajectories. The stochastic approach, presented\nhere, shows the emergence of dynamic cooperativity in terms of a slowing down\nof the Michaelis-Menten (MM) kinetics resulting in negative cooperativity. For\nfewer enzymes, dynamic cooperativity emerges due to the combined effects of\nenzymatic conformational fluctuations and molecular discreteness. The increase\nin the number of enzymes, however, suppresses the effect of enzymatic\nconformational fluctuations such that dynamic cooperativity emerges solely due\nto the discrete changes in the number of reacting species. These results\nconfirm that the turnover kinetics of fluctuating enzyme based on the\nparallel-pathway MM mechanism switches over to the single-pathway MM mechanism\nwith the increase in the number of enzymes. For large enzyme numbers,\nconvergence to the exact MM equation occurs in the limit of very high substrate\nconcentration as the stochastic kinetics approaches the deterministic\nbehaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2016 06:24:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

The main limiting\nfactors of mmWave systems are blockage (high penetration loss) and deafness\n(misalignment between the beams of the transmitter and receiver). To alleviate\nthese problems, it is imperative to incorporate efficient association and\nrelaying between terminals and access points. Unfortunately, the existing\nassociation techniques are designed for the traditional interference-limited\nnetworks, and thus are highly suboptimal for mmWave communications due to\nnarrow-beam operations and the resulting non-negligible interference-free\nbehavior. This paper introduces a distributed approach that solves the joint\nassociation and relaying problem in mmWave networks considering the load\nbalancing at access points. The problem is posed as a novel stochastic\noptimization problem, which is solved by distributed auction algorithms where\nthe clients and relays act asynchronously to achieve optimal\nclient-relay-access point association. It is shown that the algorithms provably\nconverge to a solution that maximizes the aggregate logarithmic utility within\na desired bound. Numerical results allow to quantify the performance\nenhancements introduced by the relays, and the substantial improvements of the\nnetwork throughput and fairness among the clients by the proposed association\nmethod as compared to standard approaches. It is concluded that mmWave\ncommunications with proper association and relaying mechanisms can support\nextremely high data rates, connection reliability, and fairness among the\nclients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2016 06:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-12"}

The fused lasso estimate is highly nontrivial to compute when\nthe underlying graph is large and has an arbitrary structure. But for a special\ngraph structure, namely, the chain graph, the fused lasso---or simply, 1d fused\nlasso---can be computed in linear time. In this paper, we establish a\nsurprising connection between the total variation of a generic signal defined\nover an arbitrary graph, and the total variation of this signal over a chain\ngraph induced by running depth-first search (DFS) over the nodes of the graph.\nSpecifically, we prove that for any signal, its total variation over the\ninduced chain graph is no more than twice its total variation over the original\ngraph. This connection leads to several interesting theoretical and\ncomputational conclusions. Denoting by $m$ and $n$ the number of edges and\nnodes, respectively, of the graph in question, our result implies that for an\nunderlying signal with total variation $t$ over the graph, the fused lasso\nachieves a mean squared error rate of \\smash{$t^{2/3} n^{-2/3}$}.

To remedy the inefficient low-content equilibrium where all users choose\nto explore a single path (the low-cost path), we propose and analyse two new\nincentive mechanisms that can be used by the social network application, one\nbased on side payments and the other on restricting access to content for users\nthat choose the low cost path.

Indeed, lithium is, on the one hand, easily destroyed\nin stellar interiors, and, on the other hand, produced at some specific stellar\nevolutionary stages that are still not well constrained. The goal of this paper\nis to investigate the lithium stellar content of Milky Way stars in order to\nput constraints on the lithium chemical enrichment in our Galaxy, in particular\nin both the thin and thick discs. Thanks to high-resolution spectra from the\nESO archive and high quality atmospheric parameters, we were able to build a\nmassive and homogeneous catalogue of lithium abundances for 7300 stars derived\nwith an automatic method coupling, a synthetic spectra grid, and a Gauss-Newton\nalgorithm. We validated these lithium abundances with literature values,\nincluding those of the Gaia benchmark stars. In terms of lithium galactic\nevolution, we show that the interstellar lithium abundance increases with\nmetallicity by 1 dex from [M/H]=-1 dex to +0.0 dex. Moreover, we find that this\nlithium ISM abundance decreases by about 0.5 dex at super-solar metalllicity.\nBased on a chemical separation, we also observed that the stellar lithium\ncontent in the thick disc increases rather slightly with metallicity, while the\nthin disc shows a steeper increase. The lithium abundance distribution of\nalpha-rich, metal-rich stars has a peak at A(Li)~3 dex. We conclude that the\nthick disc stars suffered of a low lithium chemical enrichment, showing lithium\nabundances rather close to the Spite plateau while the thin disc stars clearly\nshow an increasing lithium chemical enrichment with the metallicity, probably\nthanks to the contribution of low-mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2016 09:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

Our method is unique in that, unlike other acoustic covert channels, it\ndoesn't require the presence of speakers or audio hardware in the air-gapped\ncomputer.

We have recently investigated the origin of chemical signatures\nobserved in Galactic halo stars by means of a stochastic chemical evolution\nmodel.

In the present paper\nwe discuss how the extremely metal-poor halo star TYC 8442-1036-1, for which we\nhave now obtained detailed abundances from VLT-UVES spectra, fits into the\nframework of our previous work. Methods. We apply a standard 1D LTE analysis to\nthe spectrum of this star. We measure the abundances of 14 chemical elements;\nfor Na, Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni and Zn we compute the abundances\nusing equivalent widths; for C, Sr and Ba we obtain the abundances by means of\nsynthetic spectra generated by MOOG. Results. We find an abundance of [Fe/H]=\n$-$3.5 $\\pm$0.13 dex based on our high resolution spectrum; this points to an\niron content lower by a factor of three (0.5 dex) compared to the one obtained\nby a low resolution spectrum. The star has a [C/Fe] = 0.4 dex, and it is not\ncarbon enhanced like most of the stars at this metallicity. Moreover, this star\nlies in the plane [Ba/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] in a relatively unusual position, shared\nby a few others galactic halo stars that is only marginally explained by our\npast results. Conclusions. The comparison of the model results with the\nchemical abundance characteristics of this group of stars can be improved if we\nconsider in our model the presence of faint supernovae coupled with rotating\nmassive stars. These results seem to imply that rotating massive stars and\nfaint supernovae scenarios are complementary to each other, and are both\nrequired in order to match the observed chemistry of the earliest phases of the\nchemical enrichment of the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2016 13:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

In particular, we aim at\nchallenging problems for which both projection into the constrained domain and\na linear optimization under the inequality constraint are time-consuming, which\nrender both projected gradient methods and conditional gradient methods (a.k.a.\nthe Frank-Wolfe algorithm) expensive. In this paper, we develop projection\nreduced optimization algorithms for both smooth and non-smooth optimization\nwith improved convergence rates under a certain regularity condition of the\nconstraint function. We first present a general theory of optimization with\nonly one projection. Its application to smooth optimization with only one\nprojection yields $O(1/\\epsilon)$ iteration complexity, which improves over the\n$O(1/\\epsilon^2)$ iteration complexity established before for non-smooth\noptimization and can be further reduced under strong convexity. Then we\nintroduce a local error bound condition and develop faster algorithms for\nnon-strongly convex optimization at the price of a logarithmic number of\nprojections. In particular, we achieve an iteration complexity of $\\widetilde\nO(1/\\epsilon^{2(1-\\theta)})$ for non-smooth optimization and $\\widetilde\nO(1/\\epsilon^{1-\\theta})$ for smooth optimization, where $\\theta\\in(0,1]$\nappearing the local error bound condition characterizes the functional local\ngrowth rate around the optimal solutions.

Recent observations and\nreinterpretation of previous observations have revealed the existence of ring\nsystems around 10199 Chariklo and 2060 Chiron. However, the origin of the ring\nsystems around such a minor planet is still an open question. Here, we propose\nthat the tidal disruption of a differentiated object that experiences a close\nencounter with a giant planet could naturally form diverse ring-satellite\nsystems around the Centaurs. During the close encounter, the icy mantle of the\npassing object is preferentially ripped off by the planet's tidal force and the\ndebris is distributed mostly within the Roche limit of the largest remnant\nbody. Assuming the existence of $20-50$wt% silicate core below the icy mantle,\na disk of particles is formed when the objects pass within $0.4-0.8$ of the\nplanet's Roche limit with the relative velocity at infinity $3-6$km s$^{-1}$\nand 8h initial spin period of the body. The resultant ring mass is $0.1-10$% of\nthe central object's mass. Such particle disks are expected to spread radially,\nand materials spreading beyond the Roche limit would accrete into satellite(s).\nOur numerical results suggest that ring formation would be a natural outcome of\nsuch extreme close encounters and Centaurs can naturally have such ring systems\nbecause they cross the orbits of the giant planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2016 15:49:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2016 16:10:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-02"}

According to the wave turbulence theory, the weakly\nnonlinear interaction of gravitational waves leads to the existence of an\nirreversible kinetic regime that dominates the longtime evolution. The\nresulting kinetic equation suggests the existence of an equilibrium wave\nspectrum and the existence of a non-equilibrium Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum\nfor spatio-temporal fluctuations. Evidence of these solutions extracted in the\nfluctuating signal of the recent observations will be discussed in the paper.\nProbably, the present results would be pertinent in the new age of development\nof gravitational astronomy, as well as, in new tests of General Relativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 22:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

Because\nspiral wave dynamics can exhibit a wide spectrum of behaviors, its precise\nquantification can be challenging. Here we present a hybrid geometric and\ninformation-theoretic approach to quantifying spiral wave dynamics. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to numerical\nsimulations of a two-dimensional excitable medium with different numbers and\nspatial patterns of spiral waves. We show that, by defining information flow\nover the excitable medium, hidden coherent structures emerge that effectively\nquantify the information transport underlying spiral wave dynamics. Most\nimportantly, we find that some coherent structures become more clearly defined\nover a longer observation period. These findings validate our approach to\nquantitatively characterize spiral wave dynamics by focusing on information\ntransport. Our approach is computationally efficient and is applicable to many\nexcitable media of interest in distinct physical, chemical and biological\nsystems. Our approach could ultimately contribute to an improved therapy of\nclinical conditions such as seizures and cardiac arrhythmia by identifying\npotential targets of interventional therapies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2016 15:34:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-02"}

Active sources are\ndistributed exterior to the cluster and are represented by the non-singular\nGreen's function for the biharmonic operator. The complex amplitudes of the\nactive sources, which cancel out selected multipole orders of the scattered\nfield, are found by solving an algebraic system of equations. For frequencies\nin the zero-frequency stop band, we find that a small number of active sources\nlocated on a grid is sufficient for cloaking. For higher frequencies, we\nachieve efficient cloaking with the active sources positioned on a circle\nsurrounding the cluster. We demonstrate the cloaking efficiency with several\nnumerical illustrations, considering key frequencies from band diagrams and\ndispersion surfaces for a Kirchhoff plate pinned in a doubly periodic fashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 16:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}
