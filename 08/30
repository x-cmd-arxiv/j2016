We compare changing brightness of the Amazon forest (a region where\nSagan et al.

The first approach begins by generating a pooled\n$M$-estimator of scatter based on all the data, followed by a penalised\n$M$-estimator of scatter for each group, with the penalty term chosen so that\nthe individual scatter matrices are shrunk towards the pooled scatter matrix.\nIn the second approach, we minimize the sum of the individual group\n$M$-estimation cost functions together with an additive joint penalty term\nwhich enforces some similarity between the individual scatter estimators, i.e.\nshrinkage towards a mutual center. In both approaches, we utilize the concept\nof geodesic convexity to prove the existence and uniqueness of the penalized\nsolution under general conditions. We consider three specific penalty functions\nbased on the Euclidean, the Riemannian, and the Kullback-Leibler distances. In\nthe second approach, the distance based penalties are shown to lead to\nestimators of the mutual center that are related to the arithmetic, the\nRiemannian and the harmonic means of positive definite matrices, respectively.\nA penalty based on an ellipticity measure is also considered which is\nparticularly useful for shape matrix estimators. Fixed point equations are\nderived for each penalty function and the benefits of the estimators are\nillustrated in regularized discriminant analysis problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 16:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

Here, we reveal explicit evidence for strong coupling between\nan infrared-active $A_1$ phonon and electronic transitions near the Weyl points\n(Weyl fermions) through the observation of a Fano resonance in the recently\ndiscovered Weyl semimetal TaAs. The resultant asymmetry in the phonon line\nshape, conspicuous at low temperatures, diminishes continuously as the\ntemperature increases. This anomalous behavior originates from the suppression\nof the electronic transitions near the Weyl points due to the decreasing\noccupation of electronic states below the Fermi level ($E_{F}$) with increasing\ntemperature, as well as Pauli blocking caused by thermally excited electrons\nabove $E_{F}$. Our findings not only elucidate the underlying mechanism\ngoverning the tunable Fano resonance, but also open a new route for exploring\nexotic physical phenomena through the properties of phonons in Weyl semimetals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 18:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-04"}

The success of these flux transport dynamo models is largely\ndependent upon a single-cell meridional circulation with a deep equatorward\ncomponent at the base of the Sun's convection zone. However, recent\nobservations suggest that the meridional flow may in fact be very shallow\n(confined to the top 10 % of the Sun) and more complex than previously thought.\nTaken together these observations raise serious concerns on the validity of the\nflux transport paradigm. By accounting for the turbulent pumping of magnetic\nflux as evidenced in magnetohydrodynamic simulations of solar convection, we\ndemonstrate that flux transport dynamo models can generate solar-like magnetic\ncycles even if the meridional flow is shallow. Solar-like periodic reversals is\nrecovered even when meridional circulation is altogether absent, however, in\nthis case the solar surface magnetic field dynamics does not extend all the way\nto the polar regions. Very importantly, our results demonstrate that the\nParker-Yoshimura sign rule for dynamo wave propagation can be circumvented in\nBabcock-Leighton dynamo models by the latitudinal component of turbulent\npumping -- which can generate equatorward propagating sunspot belts in the\nabsence of a deep, equatorward meridional flow. We also show that variations in\nturbulent pumping coefficients can modulate the solar cycle amplitude and\nperiodicity. Our results suggest the viability of an alternate magnetic flux\ntransport paradigm -- mediated via turbulent pumping -- for sustaining\nsolar-stellar dynamo action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 18:20:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

To do this we construct a new choice engagement time model which\ncaptures the impact of user engagement on choice decisions and response times\nassociated with these choice decisions. Response times are the behavioral data\nwe choose because they are easily measured by online applications and reveal\ninformation about user engagement. To test our model we conduct online polls\nwith subject populations that have different levels of engagement and measure\ntheir choice decisions and response times. We have two main empirical findings.\nFirst, choice decisions and response times are correlated, with strong\npreferences having faster response times than weak preferences. Second, low\nuser engagement is manifested through more random choice data and faster\nresponse times.

The recently proposed ensemble transform particle filter\n(ETPF) (S.~Reich, {\\it A non-parametric ensemble transform method for Bayesian\ninference}, SIAM J.~Sci.~Comput., 35, (2013), pp. A2013--A2014) replaces the\nresampling step of a standard particle filter by a linear transformation which\nallows for a hybridization of particle filters with ensemble Kalman filters and\nrenders the resulting hybrid filters applicable to spatially extended systems.\nHowever, the linear transformation step is computationally expensive and leads\nto an underestimation of the ensemble spread for small and moderate ensemble\nsizes. Here we address both of these shortcomings by developing second-order\naccurate extensions of the ETPF. These extensions allow one in particular to\nreplace the exact solution of a linear transport problem by its Sinkhorn\napproximation.

In CCA, the BHAR is recurrently boosted up to 2 dex\ncompared with the disc evolution, which arises as turbulence is subdominant.\nThe CCA BHAR distribution is lognormal with pink noise power spectrum\ncharacteristic of fractal phenomena. The rapid self-similar CCA variability can\nexplain the light curve variability of AGN and HMXBs. An improved criterium to\ntrace thermal instability is proposed. The 3-phase CCA reproduces crucial\nobservations of cospatial multiphase gas in massive galaxies, as Chandra X-ray\nimages, SOAR H$\\alpha$ warm filaments and kinematics, Herschel [C$^+$]\nemission, and ALMA giant molecular associations. CCA plays key role in AGN\nfeedback, AGN unification/obscuration, the evolution of BHs, galaxies, and\nclusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 21:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

At $z = 0.1$ it declines from 0.25 dex at $M_{200, \\rm DMO} \\approx\n10^{11}$ M$_{\\odot}$ to 0.12 dex at $M_{200, \\rm DMO} \\approx 10^{13}$\nM$_{\\odot}$, but the trend is weak above $10^{12}$ M$_{\\odot}$. For $M_{200,\n\\rm DMO} < 10^{12.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$ up to 0.04 dex of the scatter is due to\nscatter in the halo concentration. At fixed halo mass, a larger stellar mass\ncorresponds to a more concentrated halo. This is likely because higher\nconcentrations imply earlier formation times and hence more time for accretion\nand star formation, and/or because feedback is less efficient in haloes with\nhigher binding energies. The maximum circular velocity, $V_{\\rm max, DMO}$, and\nbinding energy are therefore more fundamental properties than halo mass,\nmeaning that they are more accurate predictors of stellar mass, and we provide\nfitting formulae for their relations with stellar mass.

Here, we show that one can extract an\norigin-independent part of $\\gamma$, the so-called inter-cellular Zak phase\n$\\gamma^{\\mathrm{inter}}$, which can be used as a bulk quantity to predict the\nnumber of surface modes as follows: a neutral finite 1D tight-binding system\nhas $n_s = \\gamma^{\\mathrm{inter}}/\\pi$ (mod 2) number of in-gap surface modes\nbelow the Fermi level if there exists a commensurate bulk unit cell that\nrespects inversion symmetry.

Second, we show that the extra charge\naccumulation can be related to the number of surface modes when the unit cell\nis inversion symmetric. This bulk-boundary correspondence using\n$\\gamma^{\\mathrm{inter}}$ reduces to the conventional one using $\\gamma$ when\nthe real-space origin is at the inversion center. Our work thereby clarifies\nthe usage of $\\gamma$ in the bulk-boundary correspondence.

In this paper, joint chance constraints\nare used to solve an AC optimal power flow problem which maintain desired\nlevels of voltage magnitude in distribution grids under high penetrations of\nphotovoltaic systems. A tighter version of Boole's inequality is derived and\nused to provide a new upper bound on the joint chance constraint, and\nsimulation results are shown demonstrating the benefit of the proposed upper\nbound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 21:02:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2016 00:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-09"}

For energetic\nreasons, macroscopic drops of liquid are nearly spherical away from interfaces\nwith solids, and any local deformations due to molecular-scale surface\ninteractions are negligible. Studies of wetting phenomena, therefore, typically\nassume that a liquid on a surface adopts the shape of a spherical cap. The\ndegree of wettability is then captured by the contact angle where the\nliquid-vapor interface meets the solid-liquid interface. As droplet volumes\nshrink to the scale of attoliters, however, surface interactions become\nsignificant, and droplets gradually assume distorted shapes that no longer\ncomply with our conventional, macroscopic conception of a drop. In this regime,\nthe contact angle becomes ambiguous, and it is unclear how to parametrize a\nliquid's affinity for a surface. A scalable metric for quantifying wettability\nis needed, especially given the emergence of technologies exploiting\nliquid-solid interactions at the nanoscale. Here we combine nanoscale\nexperiments with molecular-level simulation to study the breakdown of spherical\ndroplet shapes at small length scales. We demonstrate how measured droplet\ntopographies increasingly reveal non-spherical features as volumes shrink, in\nagreement with theoretical predictions. Ultimately, the nanoscale liquid\nflattens out to form layer-like molecular assemblies, instead of droplets, at\nthe solid surface. For the lack of a consistent contact angle at small scales,\nwe introduce a droplet's adsorption energy density as a new metric for a\nliquid's affinity for a surface. We discover that extrapolating the macroscopic\nidealization of a drop to the nanoscale, though it does not geometrically\nresemble a realistic droplet, can nonetheless recover its adsorption energy if\nline tension is properly included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 21:12:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-27"}

Void population consists mainly of late-type and low surface\nbrightness (LSB) dwarf galaxies whose atomic hydrogen is the main component of\ntheir baryonic matter. Therefore, observations of void galaxy HI are mandatory\nin order to understand their evolution and dynamics.\n  Aims. Our aim was to obtain integrated HI parameters for a fainter part of\nthe nearby Lynx-Cancer void galaxy sample (total of 45 objects) with the Nancay\nRadio Telescope (NRT) and to conduct the comparative analysis of all the 103\nvoid galaxies with known HI data with a sample of similar galaxies residing in\ndenser environments of the Local Volume.\n  Methods. For HI observations we used the NRT with its sensitive\nantenna/receiver system FORT and standard processing. The comparison of the\nvoid and control samples on the parameter M(HI)/L_B is conducted with the\nnon-parametric method `The 2x2 Contingency Table test'.\n  Results. We obtained new HI data for about 40% of the Lynx-Cancer galaxy\nsample. Along with data from the literature, we use these new data for further\nanalysis of 103 void objects. The proxy of the evolutional parameter M(HI)/L_B\nof the void sample is compared with that of 82 galaxies of morphological types\n8--10 residing in the Local Volume (LV) groups and aggregates.\n  Conclusions. At the confidence level of P = 0.988, we conclude that for the\nsame luminosity, these void galaxies are systematically gas-richer, on average\nby ~39%.

Instead of\nexploring different single random sketching techniques, we propose a Monte\nCarlo type integrated SVD algorithm based on multiple random sketches. The\nproposed integration algorithm takes multiple random sketches and then\nintegrates the results obtained from the multiple sketched subspaces. So that\nthe integrated SVD can achieve higher accuracy and lower stochastic variations.\nThe main component of the integration is an optimization problem with a matrix\nStiefel manifold constraint. The optimization problem is solved using\nKolmogorov-Nagumo-type averages. Our theoretical analyses show that the\nsingular vectors can be induced by population averaging and ensure the\nconsistencies between the computed and true subspaces and singular vectors.\nStatistical analysis further proves a strong Law of Large Numbers and gives a\nrate of convergence by the Central Limit Theorem.

Then, the\nequilibrium contact angle of the droplet is determined from the generalized\nYoung's equation. By increasing the droplet volume within the spherical cavity,\nthe droplet morphology changes from spherical with an equilibrium contact angle\nof $180^{\\circ}$ to a lens with a convex meniscus, where the morphological\ncomplete drying transition occurs. By further increasing the droplet volume,\nthe meniscus changes from convex to concave.

For continuous time models in which individuals disperse\nthroughout their lifetime, it has been shown that a balanced dispersal\nstrategy, which results in an ideal free distribution, is evolutionary stable\nin spatially varying but temporally constant environments. Many species,\nhowever, primarily disperse prior to reproduction (natal dispersal) and less\ncommonly between reproductive events (breeding dispersal). As demographic and\ndispersal terms combine in a multiplicative way for models of natal dispersal,\nrather than the additive way for the previously studied models, we develop new\nmathematical methods to study the evolution of natal dispersal for\ncontinuous-time and discrete-time models. A fundamental ecological dichotomy is\nidentified for the non-trivial equilibrium of these models: (i) the per-capita\ngrowth rates for individuals in all patches is equal to zero, or (ii)\nindividuals in some patches experience negative per-capita growth rates, while\nindividuals in other patches experience positive per-capita growth rates. The\nfirst possibility corresponds to an ideal-free distribution, while the second\npossibility corresponds to a \"source-sink\" spatial structure. We prove that\npopulations with a dispersal strategy leading to an ideal-free distribution\ndisplace populations with dispersal strategy leading to a source-sink spatial\nstructure. When there are patches which can not sustain a population,\nideal-free strategies can be achieved by sedentary populations, and we show\nthat these populations can displace populations with any irreducible dispersal\nstrategy. Collectively, these results support that evolution selects for natal\nor breeding dispersal strategies which lead to ideal-free distributions in\nspatially heterogenous, but temporally homogenous, environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 03:36:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2016 20:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

As a consequence we can relate questions pertaining to\nspeedups and convergence rates for distributed SGD to the data distribution\ninstead of the regularity properties of the objective functions. More precisely\nwe show that this rate depends on the spectral norm of the sample covariance\nmatrix. An estimate of this norm can provide practitioners with guidance\ntowards a potential gain in algorithm performance. For example many sparse\ndatasets with low spectral norm prove to be amenable to gains in distributed\nsettings. Towards establishing this data dependence we first study a\ndistributed consensus-based SGD algorithm and show that the rate of convergence\ninvolves the spectral norm of the sample covariance matrix when the underlying\ndata is assumed to be independent and identically distributed (homogenous).\nThis dependence allows us to identify network regimes that prove to be\nbeneficial for datasets with low sample covariance spectral norm. Existing\nconsensus based analyses prove to be sub-optimal in the homogenous setting. Our\nanalysis method also allows us to find data-dependent convergence rates as we\nlimit the amount of communication. Spreading a fixed amount of data across more\nnodes slows convergence; in the asymptotic regime we show that adding more\nmachines can help when minimizing twice-differentiable losses.

A practical way of dealing with large-scale\nnetworks is to reduce their dimension by collapsing the states of nodes\nbelonging to densely and intensively connected clusters into aggregate\nvariables. It will be shown that under suitable conditions, the states of the\nagents in each cluster converge fast toward a local agreement. Local agreements\ncorrespond to aggregate variables which slowly converge to consensus. Existing\nresults concerning the time-scale separation in large networks focus on fixed\nand undirected graphs. The aim of this work is to extend these results to the\nmore general case of time-varying directed topologies. It is noteworthy that in\nthe fixed and undirected graph case the average of the states in each cluster\nis time-invariant when neglecting the interactions between clusters. Therefore,\nthey are good candidates for the aggregate variables. This is no longer\npossible here.

This hypothesis has\nbeen tested previously by measuring the information transfer between brain\nareas, and by taking reduced information transfer as a proxy for decoupling.\nYet, information transfer is a function of the amount of information available\nin the information source-such that transfer decreases even for unchanged\ncoupling when less source information is available. Therefore, we asked whether\nimpaired local information processing leads to a loss of information transfer.\nAn important prediction of this alternative hypothesis is that changes in\nlocally available information (signal entropy) should be at least as pronounced\nas changes in information transfer. We tested this prediction by recording\nlocal field potentials in two ferrets after administration of isoflurane in\nconcentrations of 0.0 %, 0.5 %, and 1.0 %.\n  We found strong decreases in the source entropy under isoflurane in area V1\nand the prefrontal cortex (PFC)-as predicted by our alternative hypothesis. The\ndecrease in source entropy was stronger in PFC. Information transfer between V1\nand PFC was reduced bidirectionally, but with a stronger decrease from PFC to\nV1. This links the stronger decrease in information transfer to the stronger\ndecrease in source entropy, suggesting reduced source entropy reduces\ninformation transfer. This conclusion fits the observation that the synaptic\ntargets of isoflurane are located in local cortical circuits rather than on the\nsynapses formed by interareal axonal projections. Thus, changes in information\ntransfer under isoflurane seem to be a consequence of changes in local\nprocessing more than of decoupling between brain areas. We suggest that source\nentropy changes must be considered whenever interpreting changes in information\ntransfer as decoupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 09:38:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2017 15:11:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 08:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

The goal of this work is to obtain a new\nspectroscopic calibration for a fast estimate of Teff and [Fe/H] for a wide\nrange of stellar spectral types. We used spectra from a joint sample of 708\nstars, compiled from 451 FGK dwarfs and 257 GK-giant stars.

For the latter,\ntechnology developed for gravitational wave detection and successfully tested\nin the LISA/pathfinder mission is being prepared for geodetic measurements.\nThose concepts are recently elaborated in close cooperation between physicists\nand geodesists at the University of Hannover under the umbrella of the\nCollaborative Research Center SFB 1128 Relativistic geodesy and gravimetry with\nquantum sensors (geo-Q). We will give a few examples where geodesy will\npotentially benefit from these novel developments and show future perspectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 11:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-02"}

In wireless systems, the Channel State Information (CSI) is\ncollected at the Base Station (BS), in particular, this paper considers a\npilot-aided channel estimation method (TDD mode). Typically, there are less\navailable pilots than users, hence at each slot the scheduler needs to decide\nan allocation of pilots to users with the goal of maximizing the long-term\naverage throughput. There is an inherent tradeoff in how the limited pilots are\nused: assign a pilot to a user with up-to-date CSI and good channel condition\nfor exploitation, or assign a pilot to a user with outdated CSI for\nexploration. As we show, the arising pilot allocation problem is a restless\nbandit problem and thus its optimal solution is out of reach.

A key question in this context relates to channel\nstate estimation, which allows the transmitter to adapt the code rate to the\nchannel. In this work, we characterize the trade-off between the estimation\nsequence length and data codeword length: shorter channel estimation leaves\nmore time for the actual payload transmission but reduces the estimation\naccuracy and causes more decoding errors. Using lower coding rates can mitigate\nthis effect, but may result in a higher backlog of data at the transmitter. We\nanalyze this trade-off using queueing analysis on top of accurate models of the\nphysical layer, which also account for the finite blocklength of the channel\ncode. Based on a novel closed-form approximation for the error probability\ngiven the rate, we show that finding the optimal rate adaptation strategy\nbecomes a convex problem. The optimal rate adaptation strategy and the optimal\ntraining sequence length, which both depend on the latency and reliability\nconstraints of the application, can improve the delay performance by an order\nof magnitude, compared to suboptimal strategies that do not consider those\nconstraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 13:38:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 21:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-06"}

We review a\nself-consistent framework that we employed in order to discuss the dynamics of\nthe theories of interest. Its merit lies in that we can make the symmetry group\nact internally and thus be effectively separated from coordinate\ntransformations. We investigate under which conditions it is not needed to\nintroduce extra compensating fields to make relativistic as well as\nnonrelativistic theories invariant under local symmetries and more precisely\nunder scale transformations. We clarify the role that torsion plays in this\ncontext. We highlight the difference between Weyl and conformal invariance and\nwe demonstrate that not all conformal theories can be coupled to gravity in a\nWeyl invariant way. Once this minimalistic treatment for gauging symmetries is\nleft aside, new possibilities appear. Namely, if we consider the Poincar\\'e\ngroup, the presence of the extra modes leads to nontrivial particle dynamics.\nWe derive constraints such that the theory is free from pathologies. In the\nsecond part we make clear that even when not gauged, the presence of scale\ninvariance is appealing. First, it makes possible for the dimensionful\nparameters that appear in a theory to be generated dynamically and be sourced\nby the vacuum expectation value of the dilaton. If the Standard Model is\nembedded into a scale-invariant framework, a number of interesting implications\nfor cosmology arise. The inflationary stage of our Universe and its present-day\nacceleration become linked, a connection that might give us insight into the\ndark energy dynamics. We show that in the context of gravitational theories\nwhich are invariant under restricted coordinate transformations, the dilaton\ninstead of being introduced ad hoc, can emerge from the gravitational part of a\ntheory. We discuss the consequences of the nontrivial way this field emerges in\nthe action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 13:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Unlike the\nsingle layer compound Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, which exhibits a robust in-plane magnetic\norder, the energy difference between in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic\norderings in Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$ is much smaller and it is expected that small\nexternal perturbations could induce magnetic transitions. Our results indicate\nthat epitaxial strain yields a spin-flop transition, that is driven by the\ncrossover between the intralayer $J_1$ and interlayer $J_2$ magnetic exchange\ninteractions upon compressive strain. While $J_1$ is essentially insensitive to\nstrain effects, the strength of $J_2$ changes by one order of magnitude for\ntensile strains $\\geq$ 3~\\%. In addition, our study clarifies that the unusual\nin-plane magnetic response observed in Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$ upon the application\nof an external magnetic field originates from the canting of the local magnetic\nmoments due to oxygen vacancies, which tilt the octahedral networks - thereby\nallowing for noncollinear spin configurations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 14:16:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 10:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-20"}

This paper presents WNetKAT, the first network programming language\naccounting for the fact that networks are inherently weighted, and\ncommunications subject to capacity constraints (e.g., in terms of bandwidth)\nand costs (e.g., latency or monetary costs). WNetKAT is based on a syntactic\nand semantic extension of the NetKAT algebra.

For example, WNetKAT\nallows to model flows which need to traverse certain waypoint functions, which\nmay change the traffic rate.

For the first time, it is\npossible to compute tidal dissipation rates within the crust, ocean, and mantle\nin one go.

The model is general: it applies to all icy satellites with a\nthin crust and a shallow ocean. Scaling rules relate the resonances and\ndissipation rate of a subsurface ocean to the ones of a surface ocean. If the\nocean has low viscosity, the westward obliquity tide does not move the crust.\nTherefore, crustal dissipation due to dynamical obliquity tides can differ from\nthe static prediction by up to a factor of two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 15:07:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-23"}

Today, the increasing number of\nprogressively complex systems has led to an urgent need to produce tools that\nsupport the expert-led process of system-security assessment. In this research,\nwe use weighted averages (WAs) and ordered weighted averages (OWAs) with\nevolutionary algorithms (EAs) to create aggregation operators that model parts\nof the assessment process. We show how individual overall ratings for security\ncomponents can be produced from ratings of their characteristics, and how these\nindividual overall ratings can be aggregated to produce overall rankings of\npotential attacks on a system. As well as the identification of salient attacks\nand weak points in a prospective system, the proposed method also highlights\nwhich factors and security components contribute most to a component's\ndifficulty and attack ranking respectively. A real world scenario is used in\nwhich experts were asked to rank a set of technical attacks, and to answer a\nseries of questions about the security components that are the subject of the\nattacks. The work shows how finding good aggregation operators, and identifying\nimportant components and factors of a cyber-security problem can be automated.\nThe resulting operators have the potential for use as decision aids for systems\ndesigners and cyber-security experts, increasing the amount of assessment that\ncan be achieved with the limited resources available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 15:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

Catalysis allows catalytic sets within a molecular reaction network to\ndominate the non catalytic parts of the network by processing most of the\navailable substrate. As a consequence one may consider a 'catalytic fitness' of\nsets of molecular species. The fittest sets emerge as the expressed chemical\nbackbone or sub-network of larger chemical reaction networks employed by\norganisms. However, catalytic fitness depends on the systemic context and the\nstability of systemic dynamics. Unstable reaction networks would easily be\nreshaped or destroyed by fluctuations of the chemical environment. In this\npaper we therefore focus on recognizing systemic stability as an evolutionary\nselection criterion. In fact, instabilities of regulatory systems dynamics\nbecome predictive for associated evolutionary forces driving the emergence\nlarge reaction networks that avoid or control inherent instabilities. Systemic\ninstabilities can be identified and analyzed using relatively simple\nmathematical random networks models of complex regulatory systems. Using a\nstatistical ensemble approach one can identify fundamental causes of instable\ndynamics, infer evolutionary preferred network properties, and predict\nevolutionary emergent control mechanisms and their entanglement with cell\ndifferentiation processes. Surprisingly, what systemic stability tells us here\nis that cells (or other non-linear regulatory systems) never had to learn how\nto differentiate, but rather how to avoid and control differentiation. For\nexample, in this framework we can predict that regulatory systems will\nevolutionary favor networks where the number of catalytic enhancers is not\nlarger than the number of suppressors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 15:23:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

The latter\nnotion includes, e.g., inelastic grains, active or self-propelled particles,\nbubbles in a foam, low-dimensional dynamical systems like driven oscillators,\nor even spatially extended modes like Fourier modes of the velocity field in a\nfluid for instance. We first review methods based on the statistical properties\nof a single unit, starting with elementary mean-field approximations, either\nstatic or dynamic, that describe a unit embedded in a 'self-consistent'\nenvironment. We then discuss how this basic mean-field approach can be extended\nto account for spatial dependences, in the form of space-dependent mean-field\nFokker-Planck equations for example. We also briefly review the use of kinetic\ntheory in the framework of the Boltzmann equation, which is an appropriate\ndescription for dilute systems.

Our main\nfocus rests on exploring the effects of the interaction between ejecta and\ncircumstellar material on the ejecta evolution and the broad-band light curve.\nIn our calculations, we find that a strong reverse shock efficiently\ndecelerates and compresses the ejecta material. This leads to a significant\nbroadening of the optical light curve, a longer rise to maximum and a slower\ndecline in the tail phase. During the interaction, substantial radiative energy\nis generated, which mostly emerges in the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray regime.\nOnly if reprocessing due to radiation-matter interactions is very efficient, a\nsignificant boost in the optical light curve is observed.

Given a directed graph G = (V,A) and a maximal\nheight, we propose a layering approach that minimizes a weighted sum of the\nnumber of reversed arcs, the arc lengths, and the width of the drawing. We call\nthis the Compact Generalized Layering Problem (CGLP). Here, the width of a\ndrawing is defined as the maximum sum of the number of vertices placed on a\nlayer and the number of dummy vertices caused by arcs traversing the layer. The\nCGLP is NP-hard. We present two MIP models for this problem. The first one\n(EXT) is our extension of a natural formulation for directed acyclic graphs as\nsuggested by Healy and Nikolov. The second one (CGL) is a new formulation based\non partial orderings. Our computational experiments on two benchmark sets show\nthat the CGL formulation can be solved much faster than EXT using standard\ncommercial MIP solvers. Moreover, we suggest a variant of CGL, called MML, that\ncan be seen as a heuristic approach. In our experiments, MML clearly improves\non CGL in terms of running time while it does not considerably increase the\naverage arc lengths and widths of the layouts although it solves a slightly\ndifferent problem where the dummy vertices are not taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 22:09:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

CNNs\nrequire large amounts of processing capacity and memory, which can exceed the\nresources of low power mobile and embedded systems. Several designs for\nhardware accelerators have been proposed for CNNs which typically contain large\nnumbers of Multiply Accumulate (MAC) units. One approach to reducing data sizes\nand memory traffic in CNN accelerators is \"weight sharing\", where the full\nrange of values in a trained CNN are put in bins and the bin index is stored\ninstead of the original weight value. In this paper we propose a novel MAC\ncircuit that exploits binning in weight-sharing CNNs. Rather than computing the\nMAC directly we instead count the frequency of each weight and place it in a\nbin. We then compute the accumulated value in a subsequent multiply phase. This\nallows hardware multipliers in the MAC circuit to be replaced with adders and\nselection logic. Experiments show that for the same clock speed our approach\nresults in fewer gates, smaller logic, and reduced power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 13:41:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2017 19:23:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 14:36:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 16:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-17"}
