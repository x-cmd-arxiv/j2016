We say an operator is 'locally\nbounded' if the composition of the operator with each element in the\napproximate identity is bounded. We prove that the perturbation of a regular\nself-adjoint operator by a locally bounded symmetric operator is again regular\nand self-adjoint. We use this result to show that the Kasparov class\nrepresented by an unbounded Kasparov module is stable under locally bounded\nperturbations. As an application, we show that we obtain a converse to the\n'doubling up' procedure of odd unbounded Kasparov modules. Finally, we discuss\nperturbations of unbounded Kasparov modules by unbounded multipliers. In\nparticular, we explicitly construct an unbounded multiplier such that (after\ndoubling up the module) the perturbed operator has compact resolvent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 16:01:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2016 18:51:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2018 14:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-16"}

This review consists of\nthree parts, addressing the following three aspects of optical response: 1) the\nrole of momentum relaxation, 2) $\\Omega/T$ scaling of the optical conductivity\nof a Fermi-liquid metal, and 3) optical conductivity of non-Fermi-liquid\nmetals. In the first part (Sec. II), we analyze the interplay between the\ncontributions to the conductivity from normal and umklapp scattering. In the\nsecond part (Secs. III and IV), we re-visit the Gurzhi formula for the optical\nscattering rate, $1/\\tau(\\Omega,T)\\propto\\Omega^2+4\\pi^2 T^2$, and show that a\nfactor of $4\\pi^2$ is the manifestation of the \"first-Matsubara-frequency\nrule\", which states that $1/\\tau(\\Omega,T)$ must vanish upon analytic\ncontinuation to the first boson Matsubara frequency. However, recent\nexperiments show that the coefficient $b$ in the Gurzhi-like form,\n$1/\\tau(\\Omega,T)\\propto\\Omega^2+b\\pi^2 T^2$, differs significantly from $b=4$\nin most of the cases. We suggest that the discrepancy may be due to the\npresence of elastic scattering, which decreases the value of $b$ below $4$,\nwith $b=1$ corresponding to purely elastic scattering. In the third part (Sec.\nV), we consider the optical conductivity of metals near quantum phase\ntransitions to nematic and spin-density-wave (SDW) states. In the last case, we\nfocus on \"composite\" scattering processes, which give rise to a\nnon-Fermi--liquid behavior of the optical conductivity:\n$\\sigma'(\\Omega,T)\\propto \\Omega^{-1/3}$ at low frequencies and\n$\\sigma'(\\Omega,T)\\propto \\Omega^{-1}$ at higher frequencies.

They can, e.g., be realized with strongly focused trapping light beams\nor the optical near fields of nano-scale waveguides and photonic\nnanostructures. Atoms in such traps often experience strongly spatially varying\nAC Stark shifts which are proportional to the magnetic quantum number of the\nrespective energy level. These inhomogeneous fictitious magnetic fields can\ncause a displacement of the trapping potential that depends on the Zeeman\nstate. Hitherto, this effect was mainly perceived as detrimental. However, it\nalso provides a means to probe and to manipulate the motional state of the\natoms in the trap by driving transitions between Zeeman states. Furthermore, by\napplying additional real or fictitious magnetic fields, the state-dependence of\nthe trapping potential can be controlled. Here, using laser-cooled atoms that\nare confined in a nanofiber-based optical dipole trap, we employ this control\nin order to tune the microwave coupling of motional quantum states. We record\ncorresponding microwave spectra which allow us to infer the trap parameters as\nwell as the temperature of the atoms. Finally, we reduce the mean number of\nmotional quanta in one spatial dimension to $\\langle n\\rangle=0.3 \\pm 0.1$ by\nmicrowave sideband cooling.

This creates a\nstrategic interaction between trackers and users when incentives to maintain\nprivacy and improve accuracy are misaligned. In this paper, we conceptualize\nthis conflict through an N+1-player, augmented Stackelberg game. First a\nmachine learner declares a privacy protection level, and then users respond by\nchoosing their own perturbation amounts. We use the general frameworks of\ndifferential privacy and empirical risk minimization to quantify the utility\ncomponents due to privacy and accuracy, respectively. In equilibrium, each user\nperturbs her data independently, which leads to a high net loss in accuracy. To\nremedy this scenario, we show that the learner improves his utility by\nproactively perturbing the data himself. While other work in this area has\nstudied privacy markets and mechanism design for truthful reporting of user\ninformation, we take a different viewpoint by considering both user and learner\nperturbation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 18:30:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 17:41:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-09"}

One way to characterize the roughness strength is the dependency of\nthe thermal conductivity on the channel width in the form W^{\\beta}. Although\nin the case of electronic transport this dependency is very well studied,\nresulting in W^6 for nanowires and quantum wells and W^4 for nanoribbons, in\nthe case of phonon transport it is not yet clear what this dependence is. In\nthis work, using lattice dynamics and Non-Equilibrium Greens Function\nsimulations, we examine the width dependence of the thermal conductivity of\nultra-narrow graphene nanoribbons under the influence of line edge-roughness.\nWe show that the exponent {\\beta} is in fact not a single well-defined number,\nbut it is different for different parts of the phonon spectrum depending on\nwhether phonon transport is ballistic, diffusive, or localized. The exponent\n{\\beta} takes values {\\beta} < 1 for semi-ballistic phonon transport, values\n{\\beta} >> than 1 for sub-diffusive or localized phonons, and {\\beta} = 1 only\nin the case where the transport is diffusive. The overall W^{\\beta} dependence\nof the thermal conductivity is determined by the width-dependence of the\ndominant phonon modes (usually the acoustic ones). We show that due to the long\nphonon mean-free-paths, the width-dependence of thermal conductivity becomes a\nchannel length dependent property, because the channel length determines\nwhether transport is ballistic, diffusive, or localized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 18:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-09"}

The fidelity of the model,\nobtained by an asymptotic reduction of the Navier-Stokes equations that\nimplicitly enforces a pointwise geostrophic balance, is explored for the first\ntime by comparisons of simulations against the findings of direct numerical\nsimulations and laboratory experiments.

This asymptotic model demonstrates\nexcellent agreement over a range of thermal forcing for Pr ~1 when compared\nwith results from experiments and DNS at maximal values of their attainable\nrotation rates, as measured by the Ekman number (E ~ 10^{-7}); good qualitative\nagreement is achieved for Pr > 1.

Instead vortex pairs are found to be intermittent, varying in both\ntime and strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 18:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

Most code search engines are based on syntactic\ntechniques such as signature matching or keyword extraction. However, these\ntechniques are inaccurate (because they basically rely on documentation) and at\nthe same time do not offer very expressive code query languages. We propose a\nnovel approach that focuses on querying for semantic characteristics of code\nobtained automatically from the code itself. Program units are pre-processed\nusing static analysis techniques, based on abstract interpretation, obtaining\nsafe semantic approximations. A novel, assertion-based code query language is\nused to express desired semantic characteristics of the code as partial\nspecifications. Relevant code is found by comparing such partial specifications\nwith the inferred semantics for program elements. Our approach is fully\nautomatic and does not rely on user annotations or documentation. It is more\npowerful and flexible than signature matching because it is parametric on the\nabstract domain and properties, and does not require type definitions. Also, it\nreasons with relations between properties, such as implication and abstraction,\nrather than just equality. It is also more resilient to syntactic code\ndifferences.

The new H I-selected sample, drawn from our HST COS\nG140L snapshot survey of 61 QSOs, has 20 pLLSs and 10 LLSs. Combined with our\nprevious survey, we have a total of 44 pLLSs and 11 LLSs. We find that the\nmetallicity distribution of the pLLSs is bimodal at z < 1, with a minimum at\n[X/H] = -1. The low-metallicity peak comprises (57 +/- 8)% of the pLLSs and is\ncentered at [X/H] ~ -1.87 (1.3% solar metallicity), while the high-metallicity\npeak is centered at [X/H] ~ -0.32 (48% solar metallicity). Although the sample\nof LLSs is still small, there is some evidence that the metallicity\ndistributions of the LLSs and pLLSs are different, with a far lower fraction of\nvery metal-poor ([X/H] < -1.4) LLSs than pLLSs. The fraction of LLSs with [X/H]\n< -1 is similar to that found in pLLSs (~56%). However, higher H I column\ndensity absorbers (log N(H I) > 19.0) show a much lower fraction of metal-poor\ngas; therefore, the metallicity distribution of gas in and around galaxies\ndepends sensitively on N(H I) at z < 1. We interpret the high-metallicity\n([X/H] > -1) pLLSs and LLSs as arising in outflows, recycling winds, and\ntidally-stripped gas around galaxies. The low-metallicity pLLSs and LLSs imply\nthat the CGM of z < 1 galaxies is also host to a substantial mass of cool,\ndense, low-metallicity gas that may ultimately accrete onto the galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

They\ncan have energy densities comparable to the thermal gas, but do not suffer\ncatastrophic cooling losses. Recent simulations have shown that the momentum\nand energy deposited by CRs moving with respect to the ambient medium can drive\ngalactic winds. However, simulations are hampered by our ignorance of the\ndetails of CR transport. Two key limits previously considered model CR\ntransport as a purely diffusive process (with a constant diffusion coefficient)\nand as an advective streaming process. With a series of GADGET simulations, we\ncompare and contrast the results of these different assumptions. In idealised\nthree-dimensional galaxy formation models, we show that these two cases result\nin significant differences for the galactic wind mass loss rates and star\nformation suppression in dwarf galaxies with halo masses\n$M\\approx10^{10}\\,\\textrm{M}_\\odot$: diffusive CR transport results in more\nthan ten times larger mass loss rates compared to CR streaming models. We\ndemonstrate that this is largely due to the excitation of Alfv\\'en waves during\nthe CR streaming process that drains energy from the CR population to the\nthermal gas, which is subsequently radiated away. By contrast, CR diffusion\nconserves the CR energy in the absence of adiabatic changes and if CRs are\nefficiently scattered by Alfv\\'en waves that are propagating up the CR\ngradient. Moreover, because pressure gradients are preserved by CR streaming,\nbut not diffusion, the two can have a significantly different dynamical\nevolution regardless of this energy exchange. In particular, the constant\ndiffusion coefficients usually assumed can lead to unphysically high CR fluxes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2016 20:25:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 21:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

Traditional\nmethods of converting observed magnitudes to flux densities are not very\naccurate when applied to UV photometry. Common methods for extinction and the\nintegration of pseudo-bolometric fluxes can also lead to inaccurate results.\nThe sources of inaccuracy, though, also apply to other wavelengths. Because of\nthe complicated nature of translating broad-band photometry into monochromatic\nflux densities, comparison between observed photometry and a spectroscopic\nmodel is best done by comparing in the natural units of the observations. We\nrecommend that integrated flux measurements be made using a spectrum or\nspectral energy distribution which is consistent with the multi-band photometry\nrather than converting individual photometric measurements to flux densities,\nlinearly interpolating between the points, and integrating.

Many interesting applications are proposed based on the alignment such\nas measurement of magnetic field strength through the Chandrasekhar-Fermi\nmethod and removal of polarized foreground dust emissions for the detection of\ninflationary polarized emission in the cosmic microwave background radiation.\nHowever, the physical origin of the alignment remains to be explained. To\nunderstand the alignment mechanism, we examine formation of HI clouds triggered\nby shock compression of diffuse warm neutral medium using three-dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations with the effects of optically thin cooling and\nheating. We show that the shock-compressed diffuse interstellar medium of\ndensity n~1 cm^-3 evolves into HI clouds with typical density n~50 cm^-3 via\nthermal instability driven by cooling, which is consistent with previous\nstudies. We apply a machine vision transformation developed by Clark et\nal.(2014) to the resulting column density structures obtained by the\nsimulations in order to measure angle correlation between filamentary\nstructures of HI clouds and magnetic field. We find that the orientation of HI\nfilaments depends on the environmental turbulent velocity field, particularly\non the strength of shear strain in the direction of the magnetic field, which\nis controlled by the angle between the shock propagation direction and upstream\nmagnetic field. When the strain along the magnetic field is weak, filamentary\ncomponents of HI clouds basically lie perpendicular to the magnetic field.\nHowever, the filaments have come to align with the magnetic field, if we\nenhance the turbulent strain along the magnetic field or if we set turbulence\nin the preshock medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 20:02:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 07:34:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

To address this\nchallenge, this paper introduces OptMark, a toolkit for evaluating the quality\nof a query optimizer. OptMark is designed to offer a number of desirable\nproperties. First, it decouples the quality of an optimizer from the quality of\nits underlying execution engine. Second it evaluates independently both the\neffectiveness of an optimizer (i.e., quality of the chosen plans) and its\nefficiency (i.e., optimization time). OptMark includes also a generic\nbenchmarking toolkit that is minimum invasive to the DBMS that wishes to use\nit. Any DBMS can provide a system-specific implementation of a simple API that\nallows OptMark to run and generate benchmark scores for the specific system.\nThis paper discusses the metrics we propose for evaluating an optimizer's\nquality, the benchmark's design and the toolkit's API and functionality.

Stress buildup\nand yielding in a magnetar crust is a global phenomenon: an elastic distortion\nradiating from one plastically deforming zone is shown to dramatically increase\nthe creep rate in distant zones. Runaway creep to dynamical rates is shown to\nbe possible, being enhanced by in situ heating and suppressed by thermal\nconduction and shearing of an embedded magnetic field. A global and\ntime-dependent model of elastic, plastic, magnetic, and thermal evolution is\ndeveloped. Fault-like structures develop naturally, and a range of outburst\ntimescales is observed. Transient events with time profiles similar to giant\nmagnetar flares (millisecond rise, $\\sim$ 0.1 s duration, and decaying\npower-law tails) result from runaway creep that starts in localized\nsub-km-sized patches and spreads across the crust. A one-dimensional model of\nstress relaxation in the vertically stratified crust shows that a modest\nincrease in applied stress allows embedded magnetic shear to escape the star\nover $\\sim$ 3-10 ms, dissipating greater energy if the exterior field is\nalready sheared. Several such zones coupled to each other naturally yield a\nburst of duration $\\sim$ 0.1 s, as is observed over a wide range of burst\nenergies. The collective interaction of many plastic zones forces an\noverstability of global elastic modes of the crust, consistent with QPO\nactivity extending over $\\gtrsim$ 100 s.

In particular, anomaly-based IDS has been widely applied\nto detect abnormal process behaviors that deviate from the majority. However,\nsuch abnormal behavior usually consists of a series of low-level heterogeneous\nevents. The gap between the low-level events and the high-level abnormal\nbehaviors makes it hard to infer which single events are related to the real\nabnormal activities, especially considering that there are massive \"noisy\"\nlow-level events happening in between. Hence, the existing work that focus on\ndetecting single entities/events can hardly achieve high detection accuracy.\nDifferent from previous work, we design and implement GID, an efficient\ngraph-based intrusion detection technique that can identify abnormal event\nsequences from a massive heterogeneous process traces with high accuracy. GID\nfirst builds a compact graph structure to capture the interactions between\ndifferent system entities. The suspiciousness or anomaly score of process paths\nis then measured by leveraging random walk technique to the constructed acyclic\ndirected graph. To eliminate the score bias from the path length, the Box-Cox\npower transformation based approach is introduced to normalize the anomaly\nscores so that the scores of paths of different lengths have the same\ndistribution. The efficiency of suspicious path discovery is further improved\nby the proposed optimization scheme. We fully implement our GID algorithm and\ndeploy it into a real enterprise security system, and it greatly helps detect\nthe advanced threats, and optimize the incident response.

The interface complies with version 2 of the\nSimple Imaging Access Protocol (SIAP), under development by the International\nVirtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA), which defines a standard mechanism for\ndiscovering images through spatial queries. The heart of the KOA service is an\nR-tree-based, database-indexing mechanism prototyped by the Virtual\nAstronomical Observatory (VAO) and further developed by the Montage Image\nMosaic project, designed to provide fast access to large imaging data sets as a\nfirst step in creating wide-area image mosaics. The KOA service uses the\nresults of the spatial R-tree search to create an SQLite data database for\nfurther relational filtering. The service uses a JSON configuration file to\ndescribe the association between instrument parameters and the service query\nparameters, and to make it applicable beyond the Keck instruments.\n  The R-tree program was itself extended to support temporal (in addition to\nspatial) indexing, in response to requests from the planetary science community\nfor a search engine to discover observations of Solar System objects. With this\n3D-indexing scheme, the service performs very fast time and spatial matches\nbetween the target ephemerides, obtained from the JPL SPICE service. Our\nexperiments indicate these matches can be more than 100 times faster than when\nseparating temporal and spatial searches. Images of the tracks of the moving\ntargets, overlaid with the image footprints, are computed with a new\ncommand-line visualization tool, mViewer, released with the Montage\ndistribution.

Theory and Methods: The improvement of the\nperformance of state of the art MRI relaxometry algorithms is challenging\nbecause of a non-negligible bias and still unresolved numerical instabilities.\nHere, R2* mapping reconstructions, including complex-fitting with\nmulti-spectral fat-correction by using single-decay (1D) and double-decay (2D)\nformulation, are studied in order to identify optimal configuration parameters\nand minimize numerical artifacts. The effects of echo number, echo spacing, and\nfat/water relaxation model are evaluated through simulated and in-vivo data. We\nalso explore the stability of such models by analyzing the impact of high\npercentage of fat infiltrations and local transverse relaxation differences\namong biological species. Results: The main limits of the MRI relaxometry are\nthe presence of bias and the occurrence of artifacts which affect its accuracy.\nChemical-shift complex reconstructions R2*-corrected with 1D formulation\nexhibit a large bias in presence of a significant difference in the relaxation\nrates of fat and water and with fat concentration larger than 30%. We find that\nfor fat-dominated tissues or in patients affected by iron overload, MRI\nreconstructions accounting for multi-exponential relaxation time provide\naccurate R2* measurements and are less prone to numerical artifacts.\nConclusions: Complex fitting 2D formulation outperforms the conventional 1D\napproximation in various diagnostic scenarios. Although it still lacks of\nnumerical stability which requires model enhancement and support from\nspectroscopy, it offers promising perspectives for the development of\nrelaxometry as a reliable tool to improve tissue characterization and\nmonitoring of neuromuscular disorders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 22:27:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-10"}

This\ninelastic transition causes the DM to up-scatter in terrestrial experiments\ninto an excited state up to 550 keV heavier than the DM itself. An inelastic\ntransition of this size is highly suppressed by both kinematics and nuclear\nform factors. We extend previous studies of inelastic DM to determine the\npresent bounds on the scattering cross section, and the prospects for\nimprovements in sensitivity. Three scenarios provide illustrative examples:\nnearly pure Higgsino DM; magnetic inelastic DM; and inelastic models with dark\nphoton exchange. We determine the elastic scattering rate as well as verify\nthat exothermic transitions are negligible. Presently, the strongest bounds on\nthe cross section are from xenon at LUX-PandaX (\\delta < 160 keV), iodine at\nPICO (160 < \\delta < 300 keV), and tungsten at CRESST (when \\delta > 300 keV).\nAmusingly, once \\delta > 200 keV, weak scale (and larger) DM - nucleon\nscattering cross sections are allowed. The relative competitiveness of these\nexperiments is governed by the upper bound on the recoil energies employed by\neach experiment, as well as strong sensitivity to the mass of the heaviest\nelement in the detector. Several implications, including sizable recoil\nenergy-dependent annual modulation, and improvements for future experiments are\ndiscussed. We show that the xenon experiments can improve on the PICO results,\nif they were to analyze their existing data over a larger range of recoil\nenergies, i.e., 20-500 keV. We also speculate about several reported events at\nCRESST between 45-100 keV, that could be interpreted as inelastic DM\nscattering.

When the TbMn2O5 is rotated with the field remaining in the ac plane,\nthe associated adiabatic temperature change reaches minimum values of 8 K and\n14 K under 2 T and 5 T, respectively. This giant rotating magnetocaloric effect\nin TbMn2O5 is caused by the colossal anisotropy of the entropy change, the\nenhancement of the magnetization under relatively moderate magnetic fields and\nthe lower magnitude of specific heat. On the other hand, the application of the\ncoherent rotational model demonstrates that the rotating magnetocaloric effect\nexhibited by TbMn2O5 does not originate directly from the magneto-crystalline\nanisotropy. Our results should inspire and open new ways toward the\nimplementation of compact, efficient and embedded magnetocaloric devices for\nlow temperature and space application. Its potential operating temperature\nrange of 2 to 30 K makes it a great candidate for the liquefaction of hydrogen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2016 01:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-10"}

Both the irreducible\nrepresentations of the Clifford algebra are considered. On the ring edges the\nbag (infinite mass) boundary conditions are imposed for the field operator.\nThis leads to the Casimir type effect on the vacuum characteristics. The radial\ncurrent vanishes. The charge and the azimuthal current are decomposed into the\nboundary-free and boundary-induced contributions. Both these contributions are\nodd periodic functions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux\nquantum. An important feature that distinguishes the VEVs of the charge and\ncurrent densities from the VEV of the energy density, is their finiteness on\nthe ring edges. The current density is equal to the charge density for the\nouter edge and has the opposite sign on the inner edge. The VEVs are peaked\nnear the inner edge and, as functions of the field mass, exhibit quite\ndifferent features for two inequivalent representations of the Clifford\nalgebra. We show that, unlike the VEVs in the boundary-free geometry, the\nvacuum charge and the current in the ring are continuous functions of the\nmagnetic flux and vanish for half-odd integer values of the flux in units of\nthe flux quantum. Combining the results for two irreducible representations, we\nalso investigate the induced charge and current in parity and time-reversal\nsymmetric models. The corresponding results are applied to graphene rings with\nthe electronic subsystem described in terms of the effective Dirac theory with\nthe energy gap. If the energy gaps for two valleys of the graphene hexagonal\nlattice are the same, the charge densities corresponding to the separate\nvalleys cancel each other, whereas the azimuthal current is doubled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2016 08:01:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Our discussion of numerous salient experimental data within the\nframework of FCQPT resolves the mystery of the new state of matter.

A\nsingle requirement hardly exists in isolation: it is related to other\nrequirements and to the software development artifacts that implement it. When\na requirements change is introduced, the requirements engineer may have to\nmanually analyze all requirements and architectural elements for a single\nchange. This may result in neglecting the actual impact of a change. We aim at\nimproving change impact analysis in software architecture for requirements\nchanges by using formal semantics of requirements relations, requirements\nchanges and traces between Requirements & Architecture. In our previous work we\npresented a technique for change impact analysis in requirements. The technique\nuses the formal semantics of requirements relations and changes. Its output is\na set of candidate requirements for the impact with proposed changes and a\npropagation path in the requirements model. In this paper we present a\ncomplementary technique which propagates requirements changes to software\narchitecture and finds out which architectural elements are impacted by these\nchanges. The formalization of requirements relations, changes and traces\nbetween R&A is used to determine candidate architectural elements for the\nimpact of requirements changes in the architecture. The tool support is an\nextension of our Tool for Requirements Inferencing and Consistency Checking\n(TRIC). Our approach helps in the elimination of some false positive impacts in\nchange propagation. We illustrate our approach in an industrial example which\nshows that the formal semantics of requirements relations, changes and traces\nenables the identification of candidate architectural elements with the\nreduction of some false positive impacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2016 10:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-10"}

We derive the equilibrium equations for a spherically symmetric\nconfiguration (mass continuity and Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff) in the framework\nof hybrid metric-Palatini theory, and we investigate their solutions\nnumerically for different equations of state of neutron and quark matter, by\nadopting for the scalar field potential a Higgs-type form.

By the time the flow reaches the\ninner edge, the variation in X-rays needs not reflect the true variation of the\nrate at the outer edge. However, if the viscosity fluctuates around a mean\nvalue, one would expect the viscous time scale also to spread around a mean\nvalue. In HMXBs, the size of the viscous Keplerian disk is smaller & thus such\na spread could be lower as compared to the LMXBs. If there is an increasing or\ndecreasing trend in viscosity, the interval between enhanced emission would be\nmodified systematically. In the absence of a full knowledge about the variation\nof mass supply rates at the outer edge, we study ideal circumstances where\nmodulation must take place exactly in orbital time scales when there is an\nellipticity in the orbit. We study a few compact binaries using long term\nRXTE/ASM(1.5-12 keV) & Swift/BAT(15-50keV) data to look for such effects & to\ninfer what these results can tell us about the viscous processes inside the\nrespective disks. We employ three different methods to seek imprints of\nperiodicity on the X-ray variation & found that in all the cases, the location\nof the peak in the power density spectra is consistent with the orbital\nfrequencies. Interestingly, in HMXBs the peaks are sharp with high rms values,\nconsistent with a small Keplerian disk in a wind fed system. However, in LMXBs\nwith larger Keplerian disk, the peaks are spread out with much lower rms\nvalues. X-ray reflections, or superhump phenomena which may also cause such\nX-ray modulations would not be affected by the size of the Keplerian disk. Our\nresult confirms different sizes of Keplerian disks in 2 classes of binaries. If\nthe orbital period of a binary system is not known, it may be obtained with\nreasonable accuracy for HMXBs & with lesser accuracy for LMXBs by our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2016 12:45:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-08"}

We believe that if direct manipulation\ninterfaces were to (a) use general-purpose programs as the representation\nformat, and (b) expose those programs to the user, then experts could customize\nthese systems in powerful new ways and non-experts could enjoy some of the\nbenefits of programmable systems.\n  In recent work, we presented a prototype SVG editor called Sketch-n-Sketch\nthat offered a step towards this vision. In that system, the user wrote a\nprogram in a general-purpose lambda-calculus to generate a graphic design and\ncould then directly manipulate the output to indirectly change design\nparameters (i.e. constant literals) in the program in real-time during the\nmanipulation. Unfortunately, the burden of programming the desired\nrelationships rested entirely on the user.\n  In this paper, we design and implement new features for Sketch-n-Sketch that\nassist in the programming process itself. Like typical direct manipulation\nsystems, our extended Sketch-n-Sketch now provides GUI-based tools for drawing\nshapes, relating shapes to each other, and grouping shapes together. Unlike\ntypical systems, however, each tool carries out the user's intention by\ntransforming their general-purpose program. This novel, semi-automated\nprogramming workflow allows the user to rapidly create high-level, reusable\nabstractions in the program while at the same time retaining direct\nmanipulation capabilities. In future work, our approach may be extended with\nmore graphic design features or realized for other application domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2016 15:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-26"}

This raises\nthe question of what order ? of derivative should be taken and if a single\nvalue actually suffices. This has led to models that combine a finite number of\nthese derivatives each with a different fractional exponent \\alpha_k and\ndifferent weighting value c_k to better model a greater possible range of time\nscales. Ultimately, one wants to look at a situation that combines derivatives\nin a continuous way { the so-called distributional model with parameter\n\\mu(\\alpha).

Novel contributions concern both a systematic analysis of the\ncomputational simulations process and an effective theoretical synthesis of its\noutcome, providing with sound cross-validation. Good practice for generating\nthe indicial-admittance functions via computational fluid dynamics is first\ninvestigated for several Mach numbers, angles of attack and aerofoil profiles.\nConvenient analytical approximations of such indicial functions are then\nobtained by generalising those available for incompressible flow, taking\nadvantage of acoustic wave theory for the non-circulatory airload and\nPrandtl-Glauert's scalability rule for the circulatory airload. An explicit\nparametric formula is newly proposed for modelling the latter as function of\nthe Mach number in the absence of shock waves, while damped harmonic terms are\neffectively introduced for better approximating the former.

We show that the bendover scales as well as the magnetic\nfield ratio have a strong influence on diffusion coefficients whereas the\ninfluence of the dissipation range spectral index is weak. The best agreement\nwith solar wind observations can be found for equal bendover scales and a\nmagnetic field ratio of $\\delta$B/B0 = 0.75.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 21:31:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

It is known that in magnetostatic slab turbulence,\nthe motion of particles across the mean magnetic field is subdiffusive. If a\ntwo-dimensional component is added, diffusion is recovered. It was also shown\nbefore that in two-component turbulence, the slab modes do not explicitly\ncontribute to the perpendicular diffusion coefficient. In the current paper the\nimplicit contribution of slab modes is explored and it is shown that this\ncontribution leads to a reduction of the perpendicular diffusion coefficient.\nThis effect improves the agreement between simulations and analytical theory.\nFurthermore, the obtained results are relevant for investigations of diffusive\nshock acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2016 14:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

Among many surprising properties of QCs is their high catalytic\nactivity. We propose a mechanism explaining this peculiarity based on unusual\ndynamics of atoms at special sites in QCs, namely, localized anharmonic\nvibrations (LAVs) and phasons. In the former case, one deals with a large\namplitude (~ fractions of an angstrom) time-periodic oscillations of a small\ngroup of atoms around their stable positions in the lattice, known also as\ndiscrete breathers, which can be excited in regular crystals as well as in QCs.\nOn the other hand, phasons are a specific property of QCs, which are\nrepresented by very large amplitude (~angstrom) oscillations of atoms be-tween\ntwo quasi-stable positions determined by the geometry of a QC. Large amplitude\natomic motion in LAVs and phasons results in time-periodic driving of adjacent\npotential wells occupied by hydrogen ions (protons or deuterons) in case of\nhydrogenated QCs. This driving may result in the increase of amplitude and\nenergy of zero-point vibrations (ZPV). Based on that, we demonstrate a drastic\nincrease of the D-D or D-H fusion rate with increasing number of modulation\nperiods evaluated in the framework of Schwinger model, which takes into account\nsuppression of the Coulomb barrier due to lattice vibrations. In this context,\nwe present numerical solution of Schrodinger equation for a particle in a\nnon-stationary double well potential, which is driven time-periodically\nimitating the action of a LAV or phason. We show that the rate of tunneling of\nthe particle through the potential barrier separating the wells is enhanced\ndrastically by the driving, and it increases strongly with increasing amplitude\nof the driving. These results support the concept of nuclear catalysis in QCs\nthat can take place at special sites provided by their inherent topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2016 15:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-22"}

Each team has developers with varying experience levels and English\ncommunication skills. In such a diverse development environment it is important\nto maintain the software quality, coding standards, timely delivery of features\nand bug fixes. It is also important to reduce testing effort, minimize side\neffects such as change in functionality, user experience or application\nperformance. Code reviews are intended to control code quality. Unfortunately,\nmany projects lack enforcement of processes and standards because of\napproaching deadlines, live production issues and lack of resource\navailability. This study examines a novel structured, unit testable templated\ncode method to enforce code review standards with an intent to reduce coding\neffort, minimize revisions and eliminate functional and performance side\neffects on the system. The proposed method would also result in unit-testable\ncode that can also be easily rolled back and increase team productivity. The\nbaseline for traditional code review processes using metrics such as code\nreview duration, bug regression rate, revision count was measured. These\nmetrics were then compared with results from the proposed code review process\nthat used structured unit testable templated code. The performance on 2 large\nenterprise level applications spanning over 2 years and 9 feature and\nmaintenance release cycles was evaluated. The structured unit testable\ntemplated code method resulted in a decrease in total code review time,\nrevision count and coding effort. It also decreased the number of live\nproduction issues caused by code churn or side effects of bug fix when compared\nto traditional code review process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2016 05:26:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}
