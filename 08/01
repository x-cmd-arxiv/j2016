Here $B_{0}$ is assumed to be a positive universal\nconstant, $n$ is a constant parameter and $V$ is the volume of the cosmic\nfluid. We get the interesting result that if the well-known stability\nconditions of a fluid is adhered to, the values of $n$ are constrained to be\nnegative definite to make $ \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial V}\\right)_{S} <0$\n\\& $ \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial V}\\right)_{T} <0$ throughout the\nevolution. Moreover the positivity of thermal capacity at constant volume\n$c_{V}$ as also the validity of the third law of thermodynamics are ensured in\nthis case.

Method: We used APEX SEPIA Band 5 to perform the observations. Results: We\ndetected 183 GHz water maser emission towards NGC 4945 with a peak flux density\nof ~3 Jy near the galactic systemic velocity. The emission spans a velocity\nrange of several hundred km/s. We estimate an isotropic luminosity of > 1000\nLsun, classifying the emission as a megamaser. A comparison of the 183 GHz\nspectrum with that observed at 22 GHz suggests that 183 GHz emission also\narises from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) central engine. If the 183 GHz\nemission originates from the circumnuclear disk, then we estimate that a\nredshifted feature at 1084 km/s in the spectrum should arise from a distance of\n0.022 pc from the supermassive black hole (1.6 x 10(5) Schwarzschild radii),\ni.e. closer than the water maser emission previously detected at 22 GHz. This\nis only the second time 183 GHz maser emission has been detected towards an AGN\ncentral engine (the other galaxy being NGC 3079). It is also the strongest\nextragalactic millimetre/submillimetre water maser detected to date.\nConclusions: Strong millimetre 183 GHz water maser emission has now been shown\nto occur in an external galaxy. For NGC 4945, we believe that the maser\nemission arises, or is dominated by, emission from the AGN central engine.\nEmission at higher velocity, i.e. for a Keplerian disk closer to the black\nhole, has been detected at 183 GHz compared with that for the 22 GHz megamaser.\nThis indicates that millimetre/submillimetre water masers can indeed be useful\nprobes for tracing out more of AGN central engine structures and dynamics than\npreviously probed. Future observations using ALMA Band 5 should unequivocally\ndetermine the origin of the emission in this and other galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2016 20:13:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

We focus on a particular syntactic construction called\ncenter-embedding, which is well studied in psycholinguistics and noted to cause\nparticular difficulty for comprehension. Since people use language as a tool\nfor communication, one expects such complex constructions to be avoided for\ncommunication efficiency. From a computational perspective, center-embedding is\nclosely relevant to a left-corner parsing algorithm, which can capture the\ndegree of center-embedding of a parse tree being constructed. This connection\nsuggests left-corner methods can be a tool to exploit the universal syntactic\nconstraint that people avoid generating center-embedded structures. We explore\nsuch utilities of center-embedding as well as left-corner methods extensively\nthrough several theoretical and empirical examinations.\n  Our primary task is unsupervised grammar induction. In this task, the input\nto the algorithm is a collection of sentences, from which the model tries to\nextract the salient patterns on them as a grammar. This is a particularly hard\nproblem although we expect the universal constraint may help in improving the\nperformance since it can effectively restrict the possible search space for the\nmodel. We build the model by extending the left-corner parsing algorithm for\nefficiently tabulating the search space except those involving center-embedding\nup to a specific degree. We examine the effectiveness of our approach on many\ntreebanks, and demonstrate that often our constraint leads to better parsing\nperformance. We thus conclude that left-corner methods are particularly useful\nfor syntax-oriented systems, as it can exploit efficiently the inherent\nuniversal constraints in languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 01:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-02"}

The results show that our approach not only\ndramatically decreases the time for computing p(E^\\sigma), but also has an\nattractive property, which is contrary to that of existing approaches: the\ndenser the edges of a PrAG are or the bigger the size of a given extension E\nis, the more efficient our approach computes p(E^\\sigma). Meanwhile, it is\nshown that under complete and preferred semantics, the problems of determining\np(E^\\sigma) are fixed-parameter tractable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 02:34:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2016 21:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

On the other hand, the Boltzmann equation\nis applied for the rarefied gas dynamics. Both equations are constructed from\nmodeling flow physics in different scales. Fortunately, due to the distinct\nseparation of scales, i.e., the hydrodynamic and kinetic ones, both\nNavier-Stokes equations and the Boltzmann equation are valid in their\nrespectable domains. However, in real physical application, there may not have\nsuch a distinctive scale separation. For example, around a hypersonic flying\nvehicle, the flow physics at different regions may correspond to different\nregimes, where the local Knudsen number can be changed in several order of\nmagnitudes. With a variation of modeling scale, theoretically a continuous\ngoverning equation from kinetic Boltzmann equation to the hydrodynamic\nNavier-Stokes equations should exist. However, due to the difficulties of a\ndirect modeling of flow physics in the scale between the kinetic and\nhydrodynamic ones, there is basically no reliable theory or valid governing\nequation to cover the whole transition regime. In fact, it is an unresolved\nproblem about the exact scale for the validity of the NS equations as Reynolds\nnumber decreases. The traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is based\non the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDE), and it\ntargets on the recovering of the exact solution of the PDEs as mesh size and\ntime step converging to zero. This methodology can be hardly applied here\nbecause there is no such a complete PDE for flow physics in all scales. It may\nbe the time to combine the modeling and computation together without going\nthrough the process of constructing PDEs. In other words, the CFD research is\nnot only to obtain the numerical solution of governing equation, but also to\nconstruct a valid discrete governing equation to identify the flow physics in\nthe mesh size and time step scales. In this paper, we are going to present the\nidea for the modeling and computation. This methodology leads to the unified\ngas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for flow simulation in all flow regimes. Based on\nUGKS, the boundary for the validation of the Navier-Stokes equations can be\nquantitatively evaluated. The combination of modeling and computation provides\na paradigm for the description of multiscale transport process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 02:35:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

In\npractice, since the transmitters (power chargers) are usually at fixed\nlocations and the receiver (e.g. mobile phone) is desired to be freely located\nin a target region for wireless charging, its received power can fluctuate\nsignificantly over locations even with adaptive magnetic beamforming applied.\nTo achieve uniform coverage, the transmitters need to be optimally placed in\nthe region, which motivates this paper. First, we derive the optimal magnetic\nbeamforming solution in closed-form for a distributed MISO WPT system with\ngiven locations of the transmitters and receiver to maximize the deliverable\npower to the receiver load subject to a given sum-power constraint at all\ntransmitters.

Most recent research has focused on learning the true inverse\ndynamics using data points mapping observed accelerations to the torques used\nto generate them. Unfortunately, if the initial tracking error is bad, such\nlearning processes may train substantially off-distribution to predict well on\nactual observed acceleration rather then the desired accelerations.

Because of the interactions between A and exotic\nfermions, which ensure the approximate unification of the SM gauge couplings\nand anomaly cancellation in this model, the couplings of the pseudoscalar A to\ngauge bosons get induced. As a result, the SM singlet pNGB state A with mass\naround 750 GeV may give rise to sufficiently large cross section of pp\\to\n\\gamma\\gamma that can be identified with the recently observed diphoton excess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 04:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

However, not only the EoS is directly connected with neutron star\nmasses, but also the speed of sound in dense matter is a crucial quantity which\ncharacterizes the stiffness of the EoS. The upper bound of the speed of sound\nimposes strong constraints on the maximum mass of neutron stars. However, this\nupper bound remains still an open issue.

To date, improving\nthe TE figure of merit remains the key challenge. The advent of the topological\ninsulator and the emerging nanotechnology open a new way to design\nhigh-performance TE devices. In this paper, we investigate the TE transport\nproperties of the Bi2Se3 thin film by the first-principle calculations and the\nBoltzmann transport theory. By comparing our calculations with the earlier\nexperimental data, we demonstrate that, for the Bi2Se3 film of thickness larger\nthan six quintuple layers, the relaxation time of the topological surface\nstates in the bulk gap is about hundreds of femtoseconds, which is about two\norders larger than that of the bulk states. Such a large relaxation-time\ndifference causes the ratio of the electrical conductance to the thermal\nconductance much larger than the value predicted by the Wiedemann-Franz law, as\nwell as the large magnitude of Seebeck coefficient, and consequently the large\nTE figure of merit, when the Fermi level is near the conduction band edge. We\nshows that the TE performance can be further improved by introducing defects in\nthe middle layers of the thin film. The improvement is generally significant at\nroom temperature and can be further enhanced at higher temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 08:19:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-02"}

Allowing asymmetry, we\nconsider four different persistence modules. The first method is through\nsymmetrisation.

These two methods have the same\npersistent homology as the standard Rips filtration when applied to a metric\nspace, or more generally to a symmetric function.

New tools continue to be developed and used to analyse our personal\nconnections, with particular emphasis on detecting communities or identifying\nkey individuals in a social network. This raises privacy concerns that are\nlikely to exacerbate in the future. With this in mind, we ask the question: Can\nindividuals or groups actively manage their connections to evade social network\nanalysis tools?\n  By addressing this question, the general public may better protect their\nprivacy, oppressed activist groups may better conceal their existence, and\nsecurity agencies may better understand how terrorists escape detection. We\nfirst study how an individual can evade \"network centrality\" analysis without\ncompromising his or her influence within the network. We prove that an optimal\nsolution to this problem is hard to compute. Despite this hardness, we\ndemonstrate that even a simple heuristic, whereby attention is restricted to\nthe individual's immediate neighbourhood, can be surprisingly effective in\npractice. For instance, it could disguise Mohamed Atta's leading position\nwithin the WTC terrorist network, and that is by rewiring a strikingly-small\nnumber of connections. Next, we study how a community can increase the\nlikelihood of being overlooked by community-detection algorithms. We propose a\nmeasure of concealment, expressing how well a community is hidden, and use it\nto demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple heuristic, whereby members of the\ncommunity either \"unfriend\" certain other members, or \"befriend\" some\nnon-members, in a coordinated effort to camouflage their community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 10:09:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}

A coherent explanation of the positron origin, propagation through the\nGalaxy and subsequent annihilation in the interstellar medium has not yet been\nfound. Tentative explanations involve positrons from radioactivity, X-ray\nbinaries, and dark matter (DM). Dwarf satellite galaxies (DSGs) are believed to\nbe DM-dominated and hence promising candidates in the search for 511 keV\nemission as a result of DM annihilation into electron-positron pairs. The goal\nof this study is to constrain possible 511 keV gamma-ray signals from 39 DSGs\nof the MW and to test the annihilating DM scenario. We use the spectrometer SPI\non INTEGRAL to extract individual spectra for the studied objects. As the\ndiffuse galactic emission dominates the signal, the large scale morphology of\nthe MW has been modelled accordingly and was included in a maximum likelihood\nanalysis. Alternatively, a distance-weighted stacked spectrum has been\ndetermined. Only Reticulum II (Ret II) shows a 3.1 sigma signal. Five other\nsources show tentative 2 sigma signals. The mass-to-511-keV-luminosity-ratio\nshows a marginal trend towards higher values for intrinsically brighter\nobjects, opposite to the V band mass-to-light-ratio, which is generally used to\nuncover DM in DSGs. All derived flux values are above the level implied by a DM\ninterpretation of the MW bulge signal. The signal from Ret II is unlikely to be\nrelated to a DM origin alone, otherwise, the MW bulge would be about 100 times\nbrighter than what is seen. Ret II is exceptional considering the DSG sample,\nand rather points to enhanced recent star formation activity, if its origins\nare similar to processes in the MW. Understanding this emission may provide\nfurther clues regarding the origin of the annihilation emission in the MW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 11:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

As well-known, the standard GKPW\nprescription, applied to a finite radial cut-off, leads to contact terms in\ncorrelators. de Haro et al (arXiv:hep-th/0002230) introduced bulk counterterms\nto remove these. However, this prescription yields additional terms in the\ncorrelator corresponding to spurious double trace deformations. Further, if we\nview GKPW prescription coupled with the prescription in arXiv:hep-th/0002230,\nin terms of a boundary wavefunction, we find that it is incompatible with\nradial Schrodinger evolution (in the spirit of holographic Wilsonian RG). We\nconsider a more general wavefunction satisfying the Schrodinger equation, and\nfind that generically such wavefunctions generate both (a) double trace\ndeformations and (b) contact terms. However, we find that there exist special\nchoices of these wavefunctions, amounting to a new AdS/CFT prescription at a\nfinite cut-off, so that both (a) and (b) are removed and we obtain a pure power\nlaw behaviour for the correlator. We compare these special wavefunctions with a\nspecific RG scheme in field theory. We give a geometric interpretation of these\nwavefunctions; these correspond to some specific smearing of boundary points in\nthe Witten diagrams. We present a comprehensive calculation of exact\ndouble-trace beta-functions for all couplings $\\mathbb{O}_n$ and match with a\nholographic computation using the method described above. The matching works\nwith a mapping between the field theory and bulk couplings; such a map is\nhighly constrained because the beta-functions are quadratic and exact on both\nsides.

We observed that\nadding increasing numbers of autaptic connections to excitatory neurons\nincreased the number of spiking events in the network and the number of\nnetwork-wide bursts, particularly in the portion of the phase space in which\nexcitatory synapses were stronger contributors to bursting behavior than\ninhibitory synapses.

Spin-liquid (SL) states of frustrated quantum\nantiferromagnets, in which highly-correlated spins keep to fluctuate down to\nvery low temperatures, are prominent examples of such quantum states. SL states\noften exhibit exotic physical properties, but the precise nature of the\nelementary excitations behind such phenomena remains entirely elusive. Here we\nutilize thermal Hall measurements that can capture the unexplored property of\nthe elementary excitations in SL states, and report on the observation of\nanomalous excitations that may unveil the unique features of the SL state. Our\nprincipal finding is a negative thermal Hall conductivity (k_xy) which the\ncharge-neutral spin excitations in a gapless SL state of the two-dimensional\nkagome insulator volborthite Cu_3V_2O_7(OH)_2 \\cdot 2H_2O exhibit, in much the\nsame way in which charged electrons give rise to the conventional electric Hall\neffect. We find that k_xy is absent in the high-temperature paramagnetic state\nand develops upon entering the SL state in accordance with the growth of the\nshort-range spin correlations, demonstrating that k_xy is a key signature of\nthe elementary excitation formed in the SL state.

But in a world where the\npreference for safe looking neighborhoods is small, the connection between the\nperception of safety and liveliness will be either weak or nonexistent. In this\npaper we explore the connection between the levels of activity and the\nperception of safety of neighborhoods in two major Italian cities by combining\nmobile phone data (as a proxy for activity or liveliness) with scores of\nperceived safety estimated using a Convolutional Neural Network trained on a\ndataset of Google Street View images scored using a crowdsourced visual\nperception survey. We find that: (i) safer looking neighborhoods are more\nactive than what is expected from their population density, employee density,\nand distance to the city centre; and (ii) that the correlation between\nappearance of safety and activity is positive, strong, and significant, for\nfemales and people over 50, but negative for people under 30, suggesting that\nthe behavioral impact of perception depends on the demographic of the\npopulation. Finally, we use occlusion techniques to identify the urban features\nthat contribute to the appearance of safety, finding that greenery and street\nfacing windows contribute to a positive appearance of safety (in agreement with\nOscar Newman's defensible space theory). These results suggest that urban\nappearance modulates levels of human activity and, consequently, a\nneighborhood's rate of natural surveillance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 15:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-02"}

The question\nis why cancer stem cells can be both phenotypically distinct and have\nmorphological effects so different from normal stem cells. The difference\nbetween cancer stem cells and normal stem cells lies not in differences their\nnetwork architecture, but rather in the spatial-temporal locality of their\nactivation in the genome and the resulting expression in the body. The\nmetastatic potential cancer stem cells is not based primarily on their network\ndivergence from normal stem cells, but on non-network based genetic changes\nthat enable the evolution of gene-based phenotypic properties of the cell that\npermit its escape and travel to other parts of the body. Stem cell network\ntheory allows the precise prediction of stem cell behavioral dynamics and a\nmathematical description of stem cell proliferation for both normal and cancer\nstem cells. It indicates that the best therapeutic approach is to tackle the\nhighest order stem cells first, otherwise spontaneous remission of so called\ncured cancers will always be a danger. Stem cell networks point to a pathway to\nnew methods to diagnose and cure not only stem cell cancers but cancers\ngenerally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 15:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

In our asymptotic approach, locally linear Rayleigh-Bloch waves\nthat attenuate exponentially away from the ring are matched to a ring-scale\nWKB-type wave field. The latter provides a descriptive physical picture of how\nthe mode energy is transferred via tunnelling to a circular\nevanescent-to-propagating transition region a finite distance away from the\nring, from where radiative grazing rays emanate to the far field. Excluding the\nzeroth-order standing-wave modes, the position of the transition circle\nbifurcates with respect to clockwise and anti-clockwise contributions,\nresulting in striking spiral wavefronts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 11:23:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}
