This source is associated with a spectacular bipolar outflow,\nand the recent detection of high-velocity SiO suggests the occurrence of a jet.\n  Observations of CO 2-1 and SiO 5-4 at 0.8\" resolution were obtained with the\nIRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer as part of the CALYPSO large program. The\njet and outflow structure were fit with a precession model. We derived the\ncolumn density of CO and SiO, as well as the jet mass-loss rate and mechanical\nluminosity.\n  High-velocity CO and SiO emission resolve for the first time the first 200 au\nof the outflow-driving molecular jet. The jet is strongly asymmetric, with the\nblue lobe 0.65 times slower than the red lobe. This suggests that the\nlarge-scale asymmetry of the outflow is directly linked to the jet velocity and\nthat the asymmetry in the launching mechanism has been at work for the past\n1800 yr. Velocity asymmetries are common in T Tauri stars, which suggests that\nthe jet formation mechanism from Class 0 to Class II stages might be similar.\nOur model simultaneously fits the inner jet and the clumpy 0.2 pc scale outflow\nby assuming that the jet precesses counter-clockwise on a cone inclined by 73\ndegree to the line of sight with an opening angle of 8 degree on a period of\n1640 yr.

A\nsystematic difference of the apparent speeds in the northern and southern limbs\nof the jet is detected, providing evidence for jet rotation. The angular\nvelocity of the magnetic field line associated with this rotation suggests that\nthe jet in M87 is launched in the inner part of the disk, at a distance $r_0\n\\sim 5\\, R_\\mathrm{s}$ from the central engine. The combined results of the\nanalysis imply that MHD acceleration and conversion of Poynting flux to kinetic\nenergy play the dominant roles in collimation and acceleration of the flow in\nM\\,87.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2016 19:37:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

Further the net flow in and out of\neach node is conserved. Learning the structure and state of physical networks\nis necessary for optimal control as well as to quantify its privacy needs. We\nconsider radial flow networks and study the problem of learning the operational\nnetwork from a loopy graph of candidate edges using statistics of nodal\npotentials. Based on the monotonic properties of the flow functions, the key\nresult in this paper shows that if variance of the difference of nodal\npotentials is used to weight candidate edges, the operational edges form the\nminimum spanning tree in the loopy graph. Under realistic conditions on the\nstatistics of nodal injection (consumption or production), we provide a greedy\nstructure learning algorithm with quasilinear computational complexity in the\nnumber of candidate edges in the network. Our learning framework is very\ngeneral due to two significant attributes. First it is independent of the\nspecific marginal distributions of nodal potentials and only uses order\nproperties in their second moments. Second, the learning algorithm is agnostic\nto exact flow functions that relate edge flows to corresponding potential\ndifferences and is applicable for a broad class of networks with monotonic flow\nfunctions.

It has been well\nestablished that reconnection can develop over timescales faster than those\npredicted traditionally once kinetic scales are reached. It has also been shown\nthat, within the framework of resistive Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), fast\nreconnection is achieved for thin enough sheets via the onset of the so-called\nplasmoid instability. The latter was discovered in studies specifically devoted\nto the Sweet-Parker current sheet, either as an initial condition or an\napparent transient state developing in nonlinear studies. On the other hand, a\nfast tearing instability can grow on an ideal, i.e., $S$-independent, timescale\n(dubbed \"ideal\" tearing) within current sheets whose aspect ratio scales with\nthe macroscopic Lundquist number as $L/a\\sim S^{1/3}$ -- much smaller than the\nSweet-Parker one -- suggesting a new way to approach to the initiation of fast\nreconnection in collapsing current configurations.

This approach is currently being standardized by 3GPP under the\nname of LTE Licensed-Assisted Access (LTE-LAA). In this paper, we take a\nholistic approach for LTE-LAA small cell traffic balancing by jointly\noptimizing the use of the licensed and unlicensed bands.

With HST ACS I-band imaging\nwe map the rest-frame UV emission on the same scale as the dust, effectively\nresolving the 'infrared excess' (IRX=L_FIR/L_UV) in a normal galaxy at z=3.\nIntegrated over the galaxy we measure IRX=0.56+/-0.15, and the galaxy-averaged\nUV slope is beta=-1.25+/-0.03. This puts the galaxy a factor of ~10 below the\nIRX-beta relation for local starburst nuclei of Meurer et al. (1999). However,\nIRX varies by more than a factor of 3 across the galaxy, and we conclude that\nthe complex relative morphology of the dust relative to UV emission is largely\nresponsible for the scatter in the IRX-beta relation at high-z. A naive\napplication of a Meurer-like dust correction based on the UV slope would\ndramatically over-estimate the total star formation rate, and our results\nsupport growing evidence that when integrated over the galaxy, the typical\nconditions in high-z star-forming galaxies are not analogous to those in the\nlocal starburst nuclei used to establish the Meurer relation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2016 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

This suggests that Hercules may be dissolving under the Milky\nWay's gravitational influence, and hence could be a tidal stream in formation\nrather than a bound, dark-matter dominated satellite. Using Bayesian inference\nin combination with N-body simulations, we show that Hercules has to be on a\nvery eccentric orbit (epsilon~0.95) within the Milky Way in this scenario. On\nsuch an orbit, Hercules \"explodes\" as a consequence of the last tidal shock at\npericenter 0.5 Gyr ago. It is currently decelerating towards apocenter of its\norbit with a velocity of V=157 km/s -- of which 99% is directed radially\noutwards. Due to differential orbital precession caused by the non-spherical\nnature of the Galactic potential, its debris fans out nearly perpendicular to\nits orbit. This explains why Hercules has an elongated shape without showing a\ndistance gradient along its main body: it is in fact a stream that is\nsignificantly broader than it is long. In other words, it is moving\nperpendicular to its apparent major axis. In this scenario, there is a spike in\nthe radial velocity profile created by the dominant debris component that\nformed through the last pericenter passage. This is similar to kinematic\nsubstructure that is observed in the real Hercules. Modeling a satellite on\nsuch a highly eccentric orbit is strongly dependent on the form of the Galactic\npotential. We therefore propose that detailed kinematic investigation of\nHercules and other exploding satellite candidates can yield strong constraints\non the potential of the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2016 20:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

In space-critical\napplications such as sparse and compressed text indexing, only information\nregarding the lexicographical order of a size-$b$ subset of all $n$ text\nsuffixes is often needed. Such information can be stored space-efficiently (in\n$b$ words) in the sparse suffix array (SSA). The SSA and its relative sparse\nLCP array (SLCP) can be used as a space-efficient substitute of the sparse\nsuffix tree. Very recently, Gawrychowski and Kociumaka [SODA 2017] showed that\nthe sparse suffix tree (and therefore SSA and SLCP) can be built in\nasymptotically optimal $O(b)$ space with a Monte Carlo algorithm running in\n$O(n)$ time. The main reason for using the SSA and SLCP arrays in place of the\nsparse suffix tree is, however, their reduced space of $b$ words each. This\nleads naturally to the quest for in-place algorithms building these arrays.\nFranceschini and Muthukrishnan [ICALP 2007] showed that the full suffix array\ncan be built in-place and in optimal running time.

We provide tables that give representatives of each\nconjugacy class of overgroups within this lattice structure.

Dark and bright transitions can reorder and\nsplit, increasing the Stokes shift even without the formation of deep traps.\nOur findings resolve the highly-debated topic of excess Stokes shifts in PbS\nnanocrystals as due to parity-forbidden transitions instead of traps.

We note that even small\nfeatures on the disk's surface cast shadows, because the starlight grazes the\nsurface. We therefore focus on accurately computing the disk's thickness, which\ndepends on its temperature. We present models with temperatures set by the\nbalance between starlight heating and radiative cooling, that are also in\nvertical hydrostatic equilibrium. The planet has 20, 100, or 1000~M$_\\oplus$,\nranging from barely enough to perturb the disk significantly, to clearing a\ndeep tidal gap. The hydrostatic balance strikingly alters the model disk's\nappearance. The planet-carved gap's outer wall puffs up under starlight\nheating, throwing a shadow across the disk beyond. The shadow appears in\nscattered light as a dark ring that could be mistaken for a gap opened by\nanother more distant planet. The surface brightness contrast between outer wall\nand shadow for the 1000-M$_\\oplus$ planet is an order of magnitude greater than\na model neglecting the temperature disturbances. The shadow is so deep it\nlargely hides the planet-launched spiral wave's outer arm. Temperature\ngradients are such that outer low-mass planets undergoing orbital migration\nwill converge within the shadow. Furthermore the temperature perturbations\naffect the shape, size, and contrast of features at millimeter and centimeter\nwavelengths.

Gas-grain reactions require a substrate (e.g. a dust\nor ice grain) on which the reaction is able to occur. The formation of\nmolecular hydrogen (H$_2$) in the ISM is the prototypical example of a\ngas-grain reaction. In these reactions, an atom of hydrogen will strike a\nsurface, stick to it, and diffuse across it. When it encounters another\nadsorbed hydrogen atom, the two can react to form molecular hydrogen and then\nbe ejected from the surface by the energy released in the reaction. We perform\nin-depth classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of hydrogen atoms\ninteracting with an amorphous water-ice surface.

We find a striking similarity between the dependence of dynamo\nbehavior on Pm in a conducting fluid and R (a function of ionization fraction)\nin partially ionized gas. In a weakly ionized medium, the kinematic stage is\nlargely extended, including not only exponential growth but a new regime of\ndynamo characterized by linear-in-time growth of magnetic field strength, and\nthe resulting magnetic energy is much higher than the kinetic energy carried by\nviscous-scale eddies.

We are\nmotivated by applications where response varies by individuals and therefore,\nestimating responses at the individual-level is valuable for personalizing\ndecision-making. We refer to this as the problem of estimating individualized\ntreatment response (ITR) curves. In statistics, G-computation formula (Robins,\n1986) has been commonly used for estimating treatment responses from\nobservational data containing sequential treatment assignments. However, past\nstudies have focused predominantly on obtaining point-in-time estimates at the\npopulation level. We leverage the G-computation formula and develop a novel\nBayesian nonparametric (BNP) method that can flexibly model functional data and\nprovide posterior inference over the treatment response curves at both the\nindividual and population level. On a challenging dataset containing time\nseries from patients admitted to a hospital, we estimate responses to\ntreatments used in managing kidney function and show that the resulting fits\nare more accurate than alternative approaches.

A major benefit to using an IR camera instead of an RGB camera is\nthat the IR images captured are narrow band images that filter out most\nundesired ambient light, which makes our system robust against natural indoor\nillumination. Moreover, for many natural objects with colorful textures in the\nvisible spectrum, the subjects appear to have a uniform albedo in the IR\nspectrum. Based on our analyses on the IR projector light of the Kinect, we\ndefine a near light source IR shading model that describes the captured\nintensity as a function of surface normals, albedo, lighting direction, and\ndistance between light source and surface points. To resolve the ambiguity in\nour model between the normals and distances, we utilize an initial 3D mesh from\nthe Kinect fusion and multi-view information to reliably estimate surface\ndetails that were not captured and reconstructed by the Kinect fusion. Our\napproach directly operates on the mesh model for geometry refinement. We ran\nexperiments on our algorithm for geometries captured by both the Kinect I and\nKinect II, as the depth acquisition in Kinect I is based on a structured-light\ntechnique and that of the Kinect II is based on a time-of-flight (ToF)\ntechnology.

Core creation is\nregarded as one of the most promising solutions to potential issues faced by\nthe lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) cosmology on small scales. For example,\nthe reduced dynamical mass enclosed by cores can explain the low rotational\nvelocities measured for nearby dwarf galaxies, thus possibly lifting the\nseeming contradiction with the LambdaCDM expectations (the so-called \"too big\nto fail\" problem).

On the other hand, we find\nlarger atomic displacement parameters for the Cu atoms, which indicates that\nthe stronger anharmonicity of BiCuSeO may originate from the rattling behavior\nof Cu instead of previously believed Bi atoms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2016 09:19:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

For the system with larger repulsive step at high densities\nthe conventional first-order transition takes place without random pinning.\nHowever, in the presence of disorder the single first-order transition\ntransforms into two transitions, one of them (solid-hexatic) is the continuous\nKTHNY-like transition, while the hexatic to isotropic liquid transition occurs\nas the first order transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2016 10:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-19"}

Since the likelihood of a finite mixture model can grow\nunboundedly by centering a Gaussian on a single datapoint and shrinking the\ncovariance, we constrain the problem by assuming that the parameters of the\nindividual models are members of a large discrete set (e.g. estimating a\nmixture of two Gaussians where the means and variances of both Gaussians are\nmembers of a set of a million possible means and variances). For this setting\nwe show that a simple upper bound on the likelihood can be computed using\nconvex optimization and we analyze conditions under which the bound is\nguaranteed to be tight. This bound can then be used to assess the quality of\nsolutions found by EM (where the final result is projected on the discrete set)\nor any other mixture estimation algorithm. For any dataset our method allows us\nto find a finite mixture model together with a dataset-specific bound on how\nfar the likelihood of this mixture is from the global optimum of the likelihood\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2016 14:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-19"}

In this paper, we quantify the interaction of a relativistic\nspacecraft with gas and dust in the interstellar medium. For gas bombardment,\nwe find that damage by track formation due to heavy elements is an important\neffect.

However, due to the limitations of\ndata gathering technologies, some interactions might be missing from the\nnetwork model. This is a ubiquitous problem in all domains that use network\nanalysis, from social networks to hyper-linked web networks to biological\nnetworks. Consequently, an important question in analyzing networks is to\nunderstand how increasing the noise level (i.e. percentage of missing edges)\naffects different network parameters.\n  In this paper we evaluate the effect of noise on community scoring and\ncentrality-based parameters with respect to two different aspects of network\nanalysis: (i) sensitivity, that is how the parameter value changes as edges are\nremoved and (ii) reliability in the context of message spreading, that is how\nthe time taken to broadcast a message changes as edges are removed.\n  Our experiments on synthetic and real-world networks and three different\nnoise models demonstrate that for both the aspects over all networks and all\nnoise models, permanence qualifies as the most effective metric. For the\nsensitivity experiments closeness centrality is a close second. For the message\nspreading experiments, closeness and betweenness centrality based initiator\nselection closely competes with permanence. This is because permanence has a\ndual characteristic where the cumulative permanence over all vertices is\nsensitive to noise but the ids of the top-rank vertices, which are used to find\nseeds during message spreading remain relatively stable under noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2016 15:26:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2016 05:35:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 08:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-25"}

The effect of the evolution of the basis\nset within the spanned Hilbert space separates explicitly from the effect of\nthe turning of the space itself when moving in parameter space, as the tangent\nspace turns when moving in a curved space. New insights are obtained using\nfamiliar concepts in that context such as the Riemann curvature. The\ndifferential geometry is not strictly that for curved spaces as in general\nrelativity, a more adequate mathematical framework being provided by fibre\nbundles. The language used here, however, will be restricted to tensors and\nbasic quantum mechanics.

Each relay faces the dilemma of accepting/rejecting to cache the\nsource's file. Cooperation incurs energy cost due to caching, carrying and\nforwarding the source's file. Yet, when a relay accepts to cooperate, it may\nreceive some reward if it succeeds to be the first relay to forward the content\nto the destination. Otherwise, the relay may receive some penalty in the form\nof a constant regret; the latter parameter is introduced to make incentive for\ncooperation.

The ground state CDWs seem to have two functions the\nfirst is to form a stable optical platform and the second is to suppress\nradical formation and energy dissipation of the coherent excited state by\ncreating single particle energy gaps. After excitation by a photon, the B850\nexciton delocalizes on the ring a second photon can form a two-level exciton\npolariton that could be an alternative explanation for the splitting of the\nB850 exciton band. The coherent polariton formed could actively participate in\nuphill electronic energy transfer EET. Additionally we suggest other possible\nenergy storage mechanisms and entanglement possibilities. We suggest\nexperimental studies to clarify these proposals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2016 17:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-25"}

In addition, the time independent process induced\nvariation has also increased because of the aggressive scaling down of devices.\nAs a result, the faster devices at the lower threshold voltage distribution\ntail experience higher stress, leading to additional skewness in the BTI\ndegradation. Since time dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) and\nstress-induced leakage current (SILC) in NMOS devices are correlated to BTI, it\nis necessary to investigate the effect of time zero variability on all these\neffects simultaneously. To that effect, we propose a simulation framework to\nmodel and analyze the impact of time-zero variability (in particular, random\ndopant fluctuations) on different aging effects. For small area devices (~1000\nnm2) in 30nm technology, we observe significant effect of Random Dopant\nFluctuation (RDF) on BTI induced variability ({\\sigma}{\\Delta}Vth). In\naddition, the circuit analysis reveals similar trend on the performance\ndegradation. However, both TDDB and SILC show weak dependence on RDF. We\nconclude that the effect of RDF on Vth degradation cannot be disregarded in\nscaled technology and needs to be considered for variation tolerant circuit\ndesign.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2016 19:23:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

Pre requirement of succeeding in this field, accurate and suitable\nelectricity tariff price forecasting tools are needed. In the presence of\neffective forecasting tools, taking the decisions of production, merchandising,\nmaintenance and investment with the aim of maximizing the profits and benefits\ncan be successively and effectively done. According to the electricity demand,\nthere are four various electricity tariffs pricing in Turkey; monochromic, day,\npeak and night. The objective is find the best suitable tool for predicting the\nfour pricing periods of electricity and produce short term forecasts (one year\nahead-monthly). Our approach based on finding the best model, which ensures the\nsmallest forecasting error measurements of: MAPE, MAD and MSD. We conduct a\ncomparison of various forecasting approaches in total accounts for nine teen,\nat least all of those have different aspects of methodology. Our beginning step\nwas doing forecasts for the year 2015. We validated and analyzed the\nperformance of our best model and made comparisons to see how well the\nhistorical values of 2015 and forecasted data for that specific period matched.\nResults show that given the time-series data, the recommended models provided\ngood forecasts. Second part of practice, we also include the year 2015, and\ncompute all the models with the time series of January 2011 to December 2015.\nAgain by choosing the best appropriate forecasting model, we conducted the\nforecast process and also analyze the impact of enhancing of time series\nperiods (January 2007 to December 2015) to model that we used for forecasting\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2016 07:16:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-27"}
