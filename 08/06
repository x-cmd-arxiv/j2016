Antiparallel spin sublattices in antiferromagnets,\nproducing zero dipolar fields, lead to the insensitivity to magnetic field\nperturbations, multi-level stability, ultra-fast spin dynamics and other\nfavorable characteristics which may find utility in fields ranging from\nmagnetic memories to optical signal processing. However, the absence of a net\nmagnetic moment and the ultra-short magnetization dynamics timescales make\nantiferromagnets notoriously difficult to study by common magnetometers or\nmagnetic resonance techniques. In this paper we demonstrate the experimental\ndetermination of the Neel vector in a thin film of antiferromagnetic CuMnAs\nwhich is the prominent material used in the first realization of\nantiferromagnetic memory chips. We employ a femtosecond pump-probe\nmagneto-optical experiment based on magnetic linear dichroism.

We detected 275 giant pulses (in\n0.16\\% of the pulse periods) and 465 giant pulses (0.27\\%) at 42 and 74~MHz,\nrespectively. The pulsar is weaker and produces less frequent giant pulses than\nat 100~MHz. Here, giant pulses are taken as having $\\geq$ 10 times the flux\ndensity of an average pulse; their cumulative distribution of pulse strength\nfollows a power law, with a index of $-$4.1 at 42~MHz and $-$5.1 at 74~MHz,\nwhich is much less steep than would be expected if we were observing the tail\nof a Gaussian distribution of normal pulses. We detected no other transient\npulses in a wide dispersion measure range from 1 to 5000~pc~cm$^{-3}$. There\nwere 128 giant pulses detected within in the same periods from both 42 and\n74~MHz, which means more than half of them are not generated in a wide band.

In order\nto further synthesizing time-domain signals, it is necessary to recover the\nphase of the corresponding complex-valued STFT. Most authors in this field\nchoose a Wiener-like filtering approach which boils down to using the phase of\nthe original mixture. In this paper, a different standpoint is adopted. Many\nmusic events are partially composed of slowly varying sinusoids and the STFT\nphase increment over time of those frequency components takes a specific form.\nThis allows phase recovery by an unwrapping technique once a short-term\nfrequency estimate has been obtained. Herein, a novel iterative source\nseparation procedure is proposed which builds upon these results. It consists\nin minimizing the mixing error by means of the auxiliary function method. This\nprocedure is initialized by exploiting the unwrapping technique in order to\ngenerate estimates that benefit from a temporal continuity property.\nExperiments conducted on realistic music pieces show that, given accurate\nmagnitude estimates, this procedure outperforms the state-of-the-art consistent\nWiener filter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 17:45:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 09:04:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 11 Nov 2017 10:35:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2018 09:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-28"}

While NiZrSn is found\nto be a small-band-gap semiconductor (E_g = 0.46 eV in PBE and 0.60 eV in\nHSE06), CoZrBi has a band gap of 1.01 eV in PBE (1.34 eV in HSE06). Moreover,\neffective masses and deformation potentials are reported. In both materials\nABC, the intrinsic point defects introduced by species A (Ni or Co) are\ncalculated. The Co-induced defects in CoZrBi are found to have a higher\nformation energy compared to Ni-induced defects in NiZrSn. The interstitial Ni\natom (Ni_i ) as well as the V_Ni Ni_i complex introduce defect states in the\nband gap, whereas the Ni vacancy (V_Ni) only reduces the size of the band gap.\nMotivated by the reported use of NiZrSn for thermoelectric applications, the\nSeebeck coefficient of both materials is calculated. We find that CoZrBi\ndisplays a rather large thermopower of up to 500 micro-V/K when p-doped,\nwhereas NiZrSn possesses its maximum thermopower in the n-type regime. The\nreported difficulties in achieving p-type doping in NiZrSn could be\nrationalized by the unintended formation of Ni_i^2+ in conjunction with\nextrinsic acceptors, resulting in their compensation. Moreover, it is found\nthat all types of defects considered, when present in concentrations as large\nas 3%, tend to reduce the thermopower compared to ideal bulk crystals at\nT=600K.

The\nEinstein radius is $R_{Ein} \\approx 2.3$ arcsec, projecting to ~5 kpc at the\ndistance of the lens. The total projected lensing mass is $(3.6\\pm0.6) \\times\n10^{11} M_\\odot$, and the total J-band mass-to-light ratio is $3.0\\pm0.7$ solar\nunits. Plausible estimates of the likely dark matter content could reconcile\nthis with a Milky-Way-like initial mass function (for which M/L~1.5 is\nexpected), but heavier IMFs are by no means excluded with the present data.

The emergent\nelectric polarization associated with the chiral spin order, i.e. the\nmagnetoelectric coupling, renders possible steering of the spin order by an\nexternal electric field and hence renders possible an electric-field control of\nthe cycle.

Such a minimum is our uncertainty lower bound:\nthe total information lost by replacing the target observables with their\noptimal approximations, evaluated at the worst possible state. The bound turns\nout to be also an entropic incompatibility degree, that is, a good\ninformation-theoretic measure of incompatibility: indeed, it vanishes if and\nonly if the target observables are compatible, it is state-independent, and it\nenjoys all the invariance properties which are desirable for such a measure. In\nthis context, we point out the difference between general approximate joint\nmeasurements and sequential approximate joint measurements; to do this, we\nintroduce a separate index for the tradeoff between the error of the first\nmeasurement and the disturbance of the second one. By exploiting the symmetry\nproperties of the target observables, exact values, lower bounds and optimal\napproximations are evaluated in two different concrete examples: (1) a couple\nof spin-1/2 components (not necessarily orthogonal); (2) two Fourier conjugate\nmutually unbiased bases in prime power dimension. Finally, the entropic\nincompatibility degree straightforwardly generalizes to the case of many\nobservables, still maintaining all its relevant properties; we explicitly\ncompute it for three orthogonal spin-1/2 components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 19:52:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 13:12:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Jan 2018 11:57:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-02"}

The formation of accurate shared beliefs is one of the key\ncomponents of human collective intelligence. How are accurate shared beliefs\nformed in groups of fallible individuals? Answering this question requires a\nmultiscale analysis. We must understand both the individual decision mechanisms\npeople use, and the properties and dynamics of those mechanisms in the\naggregate. As of yet, mathematical tools for such an approach have been\nlacking. To address this gap, we introduce a new analytical framework: We\npropose that groups arrive at accurate shared beliefs via distributed Bayesian\ninference. Distributed inference occurs through information processing at the\nindividual level, and yields rational belief formation at the group level. We\ninstantiate this framework in a new model of human social decision-making,\nwhich we validate using a dataset we collected of over 50,000 users of an\nonline social trading platform where investors mimic each others' trades using\nreal money in foreign exchange and other asset markets. We find that in this\nsetting people use a decision mechanism in which popularity is treated as a\nprior distribution for which decisions are best to make. This mechanism is\nboundedly rational at the individual level, but we prove that in the aggregate\nimplements a type of approximate \"Thompson sampling\"---a well-known and highly\neffective single-agent Bayesian machine learning algorithm for sequential\ndecision-making. The perspective of distributed Bayesian inference therefore\nreveals how collective rationality emerges from the boundedly rational decision\nmechanisms people use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 19:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

The\nobserved spectral domain includes the upper chromospheric He I triplet at\n1083.0 nm and the photospheric Si I 1082.7 nm and Ca I 1083.3 nm spectral\nlines. The upper chromospheric magnetic field is obtained by inverting the He I\ntriplet assuming a Milne-Eddington type model atmosphere.

The typical peak-to-peak variations in the inclination of\nthe magnetic field in the upper chromosphere is found to be 10-15 degree, i.e.,\nroughly half the variation in the photosphere.

We also show that if a unitary can exactly decide membership in\nthe coset subspace, then the collision problem for subset sum can be solved for\ndensity $>1$ but approaching $1$ as the problem size increases. This\nstrengthens the previous hardness result that implementing the optimal POVM in\na specific way is as hard as quantum sampling subset sum solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 20:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-09"}

This has opened the route to extending the axiomatic\ninformation-theoretic derivation of the quantum theory of abstract systems to\ninclude quantum field theory. The inherent discrete nature of the informational\naxiomatization leads to an extension of quantum field theory to a quantum\ncellular automata theory, where the usual field theory is recovered in a regime\nwhere the discrete structure of the automata cannot be probed. A simple\nheuristic argument sets the scale of discreteness to the Planck scale, and the\ncustomary physical regime where discreteness is not visible is the relativistic\none of small wavevectors.

DR13 makes\npublicly available 1390 spatially resolved integral field unit observations of\nnearby galaxies from MaNGA, the first data released from this survey. It\nincludes new observations from eBOSS, completing SEQUELS. In addition to\ntargeting galaxies and quasars, SEQUELS also targeted variability-selected\nobjects from TDSS and X-ray selected objects from SPIDERS. DR13 includes new\nreductions of the SDSS-III BOSS data, improving the spectrophotometric\ncalibration and redshift classification. DR13 releases new reductions of the\nAPOGEE-1 data from SDSS-III, with abundances of elements not previously\nincluded and improved stellar parameters for dwarf stars and cooler stars. For\nthe SDSS imaging data, DR13 provides new, more robust and precise photometric\ncalibrations.

A major challenge is to\nleverage such data to gain insight into the brain's computational mechanisms.\nThe first step is to define candidate brain-computational models (BCMs) that\ncan perform the behavioural task in question. We would then like to infer,\nwhich of the candidate BCMs best accounts for measured brain-activity data.\nHere we describe a method that complements each BCM by a measurement model\n(MM), which simulates the way the brain-activity measurements reflect neuronal\nactivity (e.g. local averaging in fMRI voxels or sparse sampling in array\nrecordings). The resulting generative model (BCM-MM) produces simulated\nmeasurements. In order to avoid having to fit the MM to predict each individual\nmeasurement channel of the brain-activity data, we compare the measured and\npredicted data at the level of summary statistics. We describe a novel\nparticular implementation of this approach, called probabilistic RSA (pRSA)\nwith measurement models, which uses representational dissimilarity matrices\n(RDMs) as the summary statistics. We validate this method by simulations of\nfMRI measurements (locally averaging voxels) based on a deep convolutional\nneural network for visual object recognition. Results indicate that the way the\nmeasurements sample the activity patterns strongly affects the apparent\nrepresentational dissimilarities. However, modelling of the measurement process\ncan account for these effects and different BCMs remain distinguishable even\nunder substantial noise. The pRSA method enables us to perform Bayesian\ninference on the set of BCMs and to recognise the data-generating model in each\ncase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 21:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-09"}

Our results demonstrated better\nagreement with experimental data in comparison with classical nucleation\ntheory. Then, we determined the thermodynamics and kinetics of nucleation and\nthe early stage of growth of clusters in an isothermal sonocrystallisation\nprocess. This new contribution shows that the effect of pressure on the\nkinetics of nucleation is cluster size-dependent in contrast to classical\nnucleation theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 22:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

The generalized correlation dimension of\nmultifractals is based on Renyi entropy. However, the mathematical transform\nfrom entropy to fractal dimension is not yet clear in both theory and practice.\nThis paper is devoted to revealing the new equivalence relation between spatial\nentropy and fractal dimension using functional box-counting method. Based on\nvaried regular fractals, the numerical relationship between spatial entropy and\nfractal dimension is examined. The results show that the ratio of actual\nentropy (Mq) to the maximum entropy (Mmax) equals the ratio of actual dimension\n(Dq) to the maximum dimension (Dmax). The spatial entropy and fractal dimension\nof complex spatial systems can be converted into one another by means of\nfunctional box-counting method. The theoretical inference is verified by\nobservational data of urban form. A conclusion is that normalized spatial\nentropy is equal to normalized fractal dimension. Fractal dimensions proved to\nbe the characteristic values of entropies. In empirical studies, if the linear\nsize of spatial measurement is small enough, a normalized entropy value is\ninfinitely approximate to the corresponding normalized fractal dimension value.\nBased on the theoretical result, new spatial measurements of urban space\nfilling can be defined, and multifractal parameters can be generalized to\ndescribe both simple systems and complex systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2016 02:16:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2016 03:37:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2017 09:07:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

This was\ndone by investigating the effect of bursty influx on the switching dynamics of\nstochastic populations. Here we extend this formalism to account for bursty\nreproduction processes, and improve the accuracy of the formalism to include\nsubleading-order corrections. Bursty reproduction appears in various contexts,\nwhere notable examples include bursty viral production from infected cells, and\nreproduction of mammals involving varying number of offspring. The main\nquestion we quantitatively address is how bursty reproduction affects the\noverall fate of the population. We consider two complementary scenarios:\npopulation extinction and population survival; in the former a population gets\nextinct after maintaining a long-lived metastable state, whereas in the latter\na population proliferates despite undergoing a deterministic drift towards\nextinction. In both models reproduction occurs in bursts, sampled from an\narbitrary distribution. In the extinction problem, we show that bursty\nreproduction broadens the quasi-stationary distribution of population sizes in\nthe metastable state, which results in an exponential decrease of the mean time\nto extinction. In the survival problem, bursty reproduction yields an\nexponential increase in survival probability of the population. Close to the\nbifurcation limit our analytical results simplify considerably and are shown to\ndepend solely on the mean and variance of the burst-size distribution. Our\nformalism is demonstrated on several realistic distributions which all compare\nwell with numerical Monte-Carlo simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2016 09:05:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

In this work, we explore an alternative evolutionary route\ntoward UCXBs where the companions evolve from intermediate-mass Ap/Bp stars\nwith an anomalously strong magnetic field ($100 - 10000$\\,G). Including the\nmagnetic braking caused by the coupling between the magnetic field and an\nirradiation-driven wind induced by the X-ray flux from the accreting component,\nwe show that intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (IMXBs) can evolve into UCXBs.\nUsing the \\emph{MESA} code, we have calculated evolutionary sequences for a\nlarge number of IMXBs.

Specifically, we show if an orthogonal projection map\nsatisfies certain invariance conditions, restricting to its range yields an\nequivalent primal-dual pair over a lower-dimensional symmetric cone---namely,\nthe cone-of-squares of a Jordan subalgebra of symmetric matrices. We present a\nsimple algorithm for minimizing the rank of this projection and hence the\ndimension of this subalgebra. We also show that minimizing rank optimizes the\ndirect-sum decomposition of the algebra into simple ideals, yielding an optimal\n\"block-diagonalization\" of the SDP. Finally, we give combinatorial versions of\nour algorithm that execute at reduced computational cost and illustrate\neffectiveness of an implementation on examples. Through the theory of Jordan\nalgebras, the proposed method easily extends to linear and second-order-cone\nprogramming and, more generally, symmetric cone optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2016 10:17:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 2019 11:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-09"}

We mathematically characterize the impact of hybrid\npilot on the massive MIMO uplink by deriving a closed-form approximation for\nthe uplink achievable rate. In large-number-of-antennas regime, we obtain the\nasymptotically optimal solution for hybrid pilot by jointly designing the TM\npilot and the TS pilot. It is shown that either TM pilot or TS pilot has the\nadvantages for large frame-size and limited frame-size transmission,\nrespectively, while the hybrid pilot scheme can offer a superior performance to\nthat employing either TM pilot or TS pilot.

It is aimed to increase the forecasting\naccuracy by using sparse matrices in the algorithm while decreasing the\ncalculation times significantly compared to the similar methods presented in\nthe literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 19:42:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

It is argued that\nextra-terrestrials (ET) might regard sending physical probes to our own Solar\nSystem as a more efficient means for sending large amounts of information to\nEarth. Probes are more efficient in terms of energy and time expenditures; may\nsolve for the vexing problem of Drake's L factor term, namely, that the\ncivilization wishing to send information may not coexist temporally with the\nintended recipient; and they alleviate ET's reasonable fear that the intended\nrecipient might prove hostile. It is argued that probes may be numerous and\neasier to find than interstellar beacons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 19:59:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 17:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

But usually it is supposed that an event is occurred at once. In this\nresearch an integrated framework called continuous occurrence theory (COT) is\npresented to investigate respective path leading to occurrence of the events in\nthe real world. For this purpose initially fundamental concepts are defined.\nAfterwards, the appropriate tools such as occurrence variables computations,\noccurrence dependency function and occurrence model are introduced and\nexplained in a systematic manner. Indeed, COT provides the possibility to: (a)\nmonitor occurrence of events during time; (b) study background of the events;\n(c) recognize the relevant issues of each event; and (d) understand how these\nissues affect on the considered event. The developed framework (COT) provides\nthe necessary context to analyze accurately continual changes of the issues and\nthe relevant events in the various branches of science and business. Finally,\ntypical applications of COT and an applied modeling example of it have been\nexplained and a mathematical programming example is modeled in the occurrence\nbased environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Aug 2016 10:30:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 06:43:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-14"}
