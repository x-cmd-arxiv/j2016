In\na wide range of temperatures centered on the phase transition, T=195K-108K, the\nTA phonon width (damping) exhibits a step increase around momentum q=0.07, goes\nthrough a shallow maximum at q=0.09-0.12 and remains high up to the highest\nmomentum studied of q=0.16. These experimental results are explained in terms\nof a resonant interaction between the TA phonon and the collective or\ncorrelated reorientation through tunneling of the off-center Nb+5 ions. The\nobserved TA damping is successfully reproduced in a simple model that includes\nan interaction between the TA phonon and a dispersionless localized mode (LM)\nwith frequency $\\omega_L$ and damping $\\Gamma_L$ ($\\Gamma_L < \\omega_L$),\nitself coupled to the transverse optic (TO) mode. Maximum damping of the TA\nphonon occurs when its frequency $\\omega_a \\approx{\\omega_L}$. $\\omega_L$ and\n$\\Gamma_L$ are moderately dependent on temperature but the oscillator strength,\n$M_2$, of the resonant damping exhibits a strong maximum in the range\n$T\\sim{150 K-120 K}$ in which neutron diffuse scattering near the (110) B.Z.\npoint is also maximum and the dielectric susceptibility exhibits the relaxor\nbehavior. The maximum value of M appears to be due to the increasing number of\npolar nanodomains. In support of the proposed model, the observed value of\n$\\omega_L$ is found to be similar to the estimate previously obtained by\nGirshberg and Yacoby. Alternatively, the TA phonon damping can be successfully\nfitted in the framework of an empirical Havriliak - Negami (HN) relaxation\nmodel that includes a strong resonance-like transient contribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2016 16:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

Typical routing protocols avoid areas that are highly\ncongested with primary users, leaving only a small fragment of available links\nfor secondary route construction. In addition, wireless links are prone to\nchannel impairments such as multipath fading; which renders the quality of the\navailable links highly fluctuating. In this paper, we investigate using\ncooperative communication mechanisms to reveal new routing opportunities,\nenhance route qualities, and enable true coexistence of primary and secondary\nnetworks. As a result, we propose Undercover: a cooperative routing protocol\nthat utilizes the available location information to assist in the routing\nprocess. Specifically, our protocol revisits a fundamental assumption taken by\nthe state of the art routing protocols designed for cognitive radio networks.\nUsing Undercover, secondary users can transmit in the regions of primary users\nactivity through utilizing cooperative communication techniques to null out\ntransmission at primary receivers via beamforming. In addition, the secondary\nlinks qualities are enhanced using cooperative diversity. To account for the\nexcessive levels of interference typically incurred due to cooperative\ntransmissions, we allow our protocol to be interference-aware. Thus,\ncooperative transmissions are penalized in accordance to the amount of\nnegatively affected secondary flows. We evaluate the performance of our\nproposed protocol via NS2 simulations which show that our protocol can enhance\nthe network goodput by a ratio reaches up to 250% compared to other popular\ncognitive routing protocols with minimal added overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2016 18:12:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-05"}

A few of its remarkable features are conformal symmetry\nat the quantum level, evidence of integrability and, moreover, it is a prime\nexample of the AdS/CFT duality. Triggered by Witten's twistor string theory,\nthe past 15 years have witnessed enormous progress in reformulating this theory\nto make as many of these special features manifest, from the choice of\nconvenient variables to recursion relations that allowed new mathematical\nstructures to appear, like the Grassmannian. These methods are collectively\nreferred to as on-shell methods. The ultimate hope is that, by understanding\nN=4 SYM in depth, one can learn about other, more realistic quantum field\ntheories. The overarching theme of this thesis is the investigation of how\non-shell methods can aid the computation of quantities other than scattering\namplitudes. In this spirit we study form factors and correlation functions,\nsaid to be partially and completely off-shell quantities, respectively.

The response of the liquid crystal to competing\nsurface orientations, typical of patterned substrates, is determined by the\nanisotropy of the elastic constants and the interplay of the relevant lengths\nscales, such as the correlation length and the surface geometrical parameters.\nTransitions between different textures, usually with different symmetries, may\noccur under a wide range of conditions. We use the Landau-de Gennes free energy\nto investigate the texture of nematics in sinusoidal channels with parallel\nanchoring bounded by nematic-air interfaces that favour perpendicular\n(hometropic) anchoring. In micron size channels 5CB was observed to exhibit a\nnon-trivial texture characterized by a disclination line, within the channel,\nwhich is broken into a zigzag pattern. Our calculations reveal that when the\nelastic anisotropy of the nematic does not favour twist distortions the defect\nis a straight disclination line that runs along the channel, which breaks into\na zigzag pattern with a characteristic period, when the twist elastic constant\nbecomes sufficiently small when compared to the splay and bend constants. The\ntransition occurs through a twist instability that drives the defect line to\nrotate from its original position. The interplay between the energetically\nfavourable twist distortions that induce the defect rotation and the liquid\ncrystal anchoring at the surfaces leads to the zigzag pattern. We investigate\nin detail the dependence of the periodicity of the zigzag pattern on the\ngeometrical parameters of the sinusoidal channels, which in line with the\nexperimental results is found to be non-linear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2016 19:46:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

The lack of rigorous scientific practices prevalent in\nbiologically inspired security research does not aid in presenting bio-inspired\nsecurity approaches as a viable way of dealing with complex security problems.\nThis chapter introduces a biologically inspired algorithm, called the Self\nOrganising Map (SOM), that was developed by Teuvo Kohonen in 1981.

The\nSOM algorithm's close relation to a number of vital functions of the human\nbrain and the emergence of multi-core computer architectures are the two main\nreasons behind our assumption that the future of the SOM algorithm and its\nvariations is promising, notably in the field of computer security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 05:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

We combine bounded independence, which we show to\nbe sufficient for some algorithms, with the method of conditional expectations\nand with additional machinery, to obtain the following results.\n  Our techniques give a deterministic maximal independent set (MIS) algorithm\nin the CONGEST model, where the communication graph is identical to the input\ngraph, in $O(D\\log^2 n)$ rounds, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph.

These \"state machine maps\" provide an alternative\nrepresentation of classical Moore type state machines. Composition of state\nmachine maps corresponds to state machine products and can be used to specify\nessentially any type of interconnection as well as parallel and distributed\ncomputation. State machine maps can also specify abstract properties of systems\nand are significantly more concise and scalable than traditional\nrepresentations of automata. Examples included here include specifications of\nproducer/consumer software, network distributed consensus, real-time digital\ncircuits, and operating system scheduling. The motivation for this work comes\nfrom experience designing and developing operating systems and real-time\nsoftware where weak methods for understanding and exploring designs is a well\nknown handicap. The methods introduced here are based on ordinary discrete\nmathematics, primitive recursive functions and deterministic state machines and\nare intended, initially, to aid the intuition and understanding of the system\ndevelopers. Staying strictly within the boundaries of classical deterministic\nstate machines anchors the methods to the algebraic structures of automata and\nsemigroups, obviates any need for axiomatic deduction systems, \"formal\nmethods\", or extensions to the model, and makes the specifications more\nfaithful to engineering practice. While state machine maps are obvious\nrepresentations of state machines, the techniques introduced here for defining\nand composing them are novel.

To estimate the effects of variations in air humidity and\ntemperature on the chemical sensors signals, we used a standard energy band\nmodel for an n-type metal-oxide (MOX) gas sensor. The main assumption of the\nmodel is that variations in sensor conductivity can be expressed as a nonlinear\nfunction of changes in the semiconductor energy bands in the presence of\nexternal humidity and temperature variations. Fitting this model to the\ncollected data, we confirmed that the most statistically significant factors\nare humidity changes and correlated changes of temperature and humidity. This\nsimple model achieves excellent accuracy with a coefficient of determination\n$R^2$ close to 1. To show how the humidity-temperature correction model works\nfor gas discrimination, we constructed a model for online discrimination among\nbanana, wine and baseline response. This shows that pattern recognition\nalgorithms improve performance and reliability by including the filtered signal\nof the chemical sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Aug 2016 23:54:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 03:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-17"}

We prove that a commutative ring is maximal with\nrespect to the quasi-order if and only if some network is scalar linearly\nsolvable over the ring but not over any other commutative ring of the same\nsize. Furthermore, we show that maximal commutative rings are direct products\nof certain fields specified by the integer partitions of the prime factor\nmultiplicities of the maximal ring's size.\n  Finally, we prove that there is a unique maximal commutative ring of size $m$\nif and only if each prime factor of $m$ has multiplicity in $\\{1,2,3,4,6\\}$. In\nfact, whenever $p$ is prime and $k \\in \\{1,2,3,4,6\\}$, the unique such maximal\nring of size $p^k$ is the field $GF(p^k)$. However, for every field $GF(p^k)$\nwith $k\\not\\in \\{1,2,3,4,6\\}$, there is always some network that is not scalar\nlinearly solvable over the field but is scalar linearly solvable over a\ncommutative ring of the same size. These results imply that for scalar linear\nnetwork coding over commutative rings, fields can always be used when the\nalphabet size is flexible, but alternative rings may be needed when the\nalphabet size is fixed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 01:52:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 05:13:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-31"}

The registration of states\nis inspired by the intrinsic relationship of optimal transport and the\nWasserstein metric between distributions. Specifically, the components of the\nmarginal GMMs are matched by solving an optimal transport problem where the\ncost between components is the Wasserstein metric for Gaussian distributions.\nThe solution of the optimization problem is a fast approximation to the\nWasserstein metric between two GMMs. The new Aggregated Wasserstein distance is\na semi-metric and can be computed without generating Monte Carlo samples.

This distance quantifies\nthe dissimilarity of GMM-HMMs by measuring both the difference between the two\nmarginal GMMs and the difference between the two transition matrices.

The chirality in magnetic materials is often caused by the\nnoncollinear exchange interaction, called the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction\n(DMI). The DMI produces topological spin alignments such as the magnetic\nskyrmions and chiral domain walls (DWs). In the chiral DWs, the DMI generates\nan effective magnetic field $H_{DMI}$, resulting in a peculiar DW speed\nvariation in the DW creep regime. However, the role of $H_{DMI}$ over the\ndifferent DW-dynamics regimes remains elusive, particularly due to recent\nobservation of distinct behaviors between the creep and flow regimes. We hereby\ndemonstrate experimentally that the role of $H_{DMI}$ is invariant over the\ncreep and flow regimes. In the experiments, the pure DMI effect is quantified\nby decomposing the symmetric and antisymmetric contributions of the DW motion.\nThe results manifest that the antisymmetric contribution vanishes gradually\nacross the creep and flow regimes, revealing that the symmetric contribution\nfrom $H_{DMI}$ is unchanged. Though the DW dynamics is governed by distinct\nmechanisms, the present observation demonstrates the uniqueness of the DMI\neffect on the DWs over the creep and flow regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 05:16:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-10"}

Another way to make the system approach the Mott transition is the\nvariation of bandwidth or correlation strength, which gives a new dimension to\nexploring this exotic state. Here we report nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\nstudies on layered organic superconductors with half-filled bands whose widths\nare pressure-tuned near the Mott transition. The system situated on the verge\nof the Mott transition shows a pseudogap-like anomalous suppression of spin\nexcitations on cooling from well above the superconducting critical temperature\n$T_{\\mathrm{c}}$. The pressure variation of the NMR relaxation rate shows that\nthe pseudogap-like behavior is rapidly suppressed by applying pressure.

A laser beam driving the cavity at its resonance\nfrequency will acquire red- and blue-shifted sidebands due to noise in the\nposition of the mechanical oscillator. In a classical theory without noise in\nthe electromagnetic field, the powers of these sidebands are of equal\nmagnitude. In a quantum theory, however, an asymmetry between the sidebands can\nbe resolved when the oscillator's average number of vibrational excitations\n(phonons) becomes small, i.e., comparable to 1. We discuss the interpretation\nof this sideband asymmetry in a heterodyne photodetection measurement scheme\nand show that it depends on the choice of detector model. In the optical\nregime, standard photodetection theory leads to a photocurrent noise spectrum\ngiven by normal and time ordered expectation values. The sideband asymmetry is\nin that case a direct reflection of the quantum asymmetry of the position noise\nspectrum of the mechanical oscillator. Conversely, for a detector that measures\nsymmetric, non-ordered expectation values, we show that the sideband asymmetry\ncan be traced back to quantum optomechanical interference terms. This ambiguity\nin interpretation applies not only to mechanical oscillators, but to any degree\nof freedom that couples linearly to noise in the electromagnetic field.\nFinally, we also compare the quantum theory to a fully classical model, where\nsideband asymmetry can arise from classical optomechanical interference terms.\nWe show that, due to the oscillator's lack of zero point motion in a classical\ntheory, the sidebands in the photocurrent spectrum differ qualitatively from\nthose of a quantum theory at sufficiently low temperatures.

The observed\nfluctuations are thought to be transverse waves, i.e. highly incompressible\nmotions whose restoring force is dominated by the magnetic tension, some of\nwhich demonstrate clear periodicity. We aim to exploit CoMP's ability to\nprovide high cadence observations of the off-limb corona to investigate the\nproperties of velocity fluctuations in a range of coronal features, providing\ninsight into how(if) the properties of the waves are influenced by the varying\nmagnetic topology in active regions, quiet Sun and open fields regions. An\nanalysis of Doppler velocity time-series of the solar corona from the\n$10,747$~{\\AA} Iron XIII line is performed, determining the velocity power\nspectra and using it as a tool to probe wave behaviour. Further, the average\nphase speed and density for each region are estimated and used to compute the\nspectra for energy density and energy flux. In addition, we assess the noise\nlevels associated with the CoMP data, deriving analytic formulae for the\nuncertainty on Doppler velocity measurements and providing a comparison by\nestimating the noise from the data. It is found that the entire corona is\nreplete with transverse wave behaviour. The corresponding power spectra\nindicates that the observed velocity fluctuations are predominately generated\nby stochastic processes, with the spectral slope of the power varying between\nthe different magnetic regions. Most strikingly, all power spectra reveal the\npresence of enhanced power occurring at $ \\sim3$~mHz, potentially implying that\nthe excitation of coronal transverse waves by $p$-modes is a global phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 11:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

Tackling search problems\nbeyond NP using ASP is less straightforward. The class of disjunctive logic\nprograms offers the most prominent way of reaching the second level of the PH,\nbut encoding respective hard problems as disjunctive programs typically\nrequires sophisticated techniques such as saturation or meta-interpretation.\nThe application of such techniques easily leads to encodings that are\ninaccessible to non-experts. Furthermore, while disjunctive ASP solvers often\nrely on calls to a (co-)NP oracle, it may be difficult to detect from the input\nprogram where the oracle is being accessed. In other formalisms, such as\nQuantified Boolean Formulas (QBFs), the interface to the underlying oracle is\nmore transparent as it is explicitly recorded in the quantifier prefix of a\nformula. On the other hand, ASP has advantages over QBFs from the modeling\nperspective. The rich high-level languages such as ASP-Core-2 offer a wide\nvariety of primitives that enable concise and natural encodings of search\nproblems. In this paper, we present a novel logic programming--based modeling\nparadigm that combines the best features of ASP and QBFs. We develop so-called\ncombined logic programs in which oracles are directly cast as (normal) logic\nprograms themselves. Recursive incarnations of this construction enable logic\nprogramming on arbitrarily high levels of the PH.

Thanks to the FD capability, the jammer also harvests energy from the\ninformation-bearing signal that it overhears from the source. We study the\ncomplex energy accumulation and consumption procedure at the jammer by\nconsidering a practical finite-capacity energy storage, of which the long-term\nstationary distribution is characterized through applying a discrete-state\nMarkov Chain. An alternative energy storage with infinite capacity is also\nstudied to serve as an upper bound. We further derive closed-form expressions\nfor two secrecy metrics, i.e., secrecy outage probability and probability of\npositive secrecy capacity. In addition, the impact of imperfect channel state\ninformation on the performance of our proposed protocol is also investigated.\nNumerical results validate all theoretical analyses and reveal the merits of\nthe proposed AnJ protocol over its half-duplex counterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 12:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Stellar activity is an important source of systematic\nerrors and uncertainties in the characterization of exoplanets. Most of the\ntechniques used to correct for this activity focus on an ad hoc data reduction.\nAims. We have developed a software for the combined fit of transits and stellar\nactivity features in high-precision long-duration photometry. Our aim is to\ntake advantage of the modelling to derive correct stellar and planetary\nparameters, even in the case of strong stellar activity. Methods. We use an\nanalytic approach to model the light curve. The code KSint, modified by adding\nthe evolution of active regions, is implemented into our Bayesian modelling\npackage PASTIS. The code is then applied to the light curve of CoRoT-2. The\nlight curve is divided in segments to reduce the number of free parameters\nneeded by the fit. We perform a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis in two ways.\nIn the first, we perform a global and independent modelling of each segment of\nthe light curve, transits are not normalized and are fitted together with the\nactivity features, and occulted features are taken into account during the\ntransit fit. In the second, we normalize the transits with a model of the\nnon-occulted activity features, and then we apply a standard transit fit, which\ndoes not take the occulted features into account. Results. Our model recovers\nthe activity features coverage of the stellar surface and different rotation\nperiods for different features. We find variations in the transit parameters of\ndifferent segments and show that they are likely due to the division applied to\nthe light curve. Neglecting stellar activity or even only bright spots while\nnormalizing the transits yields a $\\sim 1.2\\sigma$ larger and $2.3\\sigma$\nsmaller transit depth, respectively. The stellar density also presents up to\n$2.5\\sigma$ differences depending on the normalization technique...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 12:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

Availability of high performance computing\ndevices enables learning algorithms to search simultaneously over multiple\nviews or feature spaces to obtain an optimum classification performance. The\npaper is a pioneering attempt of formulating a mathematical foundation for\nrealizing a multiview aided collaborative boosting architecture for multiclass\nclassification. Most of the present algorithms apply multiview learning\nheuristically without exploring the fundamental mathematical changes imposed on\ntraditional boosting. Also, most of the algorithms are restricted to two class\nor view setting. Our proposed mathematical framework enables collaborative\nboosting across any finite dimensional view spaces for multiclass learning. The\nboosting framework is based on forward stagewise additive model which minimizes\na novel exponential loss function. We show that the exponential loss function\nessentially captures difficulty of a training sample space instead of the\ntraditional `1/0' loss. The new algorithm restricts a weak view from over\nlearning and thereby preventing overfitting. The model is inspired by our\nearlier attempt on collaborative boosting which was devoid of mathematical\njustification. The proposed algorithm is shown to converge much nearer to\nglobal minimum in the exponential loss space and thus supersedes our previous\nalgorithm. The paper also presents analytical and numerical analysis of\nconvergence and margin bounds for multiview boosting algorithms and we show\nthat our proposed ensemble learning manifests lower error bound and higher\nmargin compared to our previous model. Also, the proposed model is compared\nwith traditional boosting and recent multiview boosting algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 13:19:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

Compared with previously proposed near-field methods of\nacoustic superresolution, in this work we describe how far-field\nsuperresolution can be obtained using an acoustic vortex wave antenna. This is\naccomplished by leveraging the recent advances in optical vortices in\nconjunction with the topological diversity of a leaky wave antenna design. In\nparticular, the use of an acoustic vortex wave antenna eliminates the need for\na complicated phased array consisting of multiple active elements, and enables\na superresolving aperture to be achieved with a single simple acoustic source\nand total aperture size less than a wavelength in diameter. A theoretical\nformulation is presented for the design of an acoustic vortex wave antenna with\narbitrary planar arrangement, and explicit expressions are developed for the\nradiated acoustic pressure field. This geometric versatility enables\nvariously-shaped acoustic vortex patterns to be achieved, which propagate from\nthe near-field into the far-field through an arrangement of stable integer mode\nvortices. Two examples are presented and discussed in detail, illustrating the\ngeneration and transmission of an \"X\" and \"Y\" shape into the far-field. Despite\nthe total aperture size being less than a wavelength in diameter, the proposed\nacoustic vortex wave antenna is shown to achieve far-field superresolution with\nfeature sizes 4-9 times smaller than the resolution limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 13:59:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-08"}

The sender Alice wishes to communicate a\nsecret message to Bob privately and reliably, i.e. in such a way that Eve will\nnot get any information about the message while Bob will be able to recover it\ncompletely.\n  In this paper, we focus on protocols that work in two transmission rounds for\nn= 2t+1.

However, much less\nis known today about the network dynamics: indeed, complex networks in reality\nare not static, but rather dynamically evolve over time.\n  Our paper is motivated by the empirical observation that network evolution\npatterns seem far from random, but exhibit structure. Moreover, the specific\npatterns appear to depend on the network type, contradicting the existence of a\n\"one fits it all\" model. However, we still lack observables to quantify these\nintuitions, as well as metrics to compare graph evolutions. Such observables\nand metrics are needed for extrapolating or predicting evolutions, as well as\nfor interpolating graph evolutions.\n  To explore the many faces of graph dynamics and to quantify temporal changes,\nthis paper suggests to build upon the concept of centrality, a measure of node\nimportance in a network. In particular, we introduce the notion of centrality\ndistance, a natural similarity measure for two graphs which depends on a given\ncentrality, characterizing the graph type. Intuitively, centrality distances\nreflect the extent to which (non-anonymous) node roles are different or, in\ncase of dynamic graphs, have changed over time, between two graphs.\n  We evaluate the centrality distance approach for five evolutionary models and\nseven real-world social and physical networks. Our results empirically show the\nusefulness of centrality distances for characterizing graph dynamics compared\nto a null-model of random evolution, and highlight the differences between the\nconsidered scenarios. Interestingly, our approach allows us to compare the\ndynamics of very different networks, in terms of scale and evolution speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 15:13:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2016 15:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

A\ncomputational experiment of DNA condensation using Monte$-$Carlo simulation in\ngrand canonical ensemble is carried out where DNA system is in equilibrium with\na bulk solution containing a mixture of salt of different valency of co-ions.\nCompared to system with purely monovalent co-ions, the influence of divalent\nco-ions shows up in multiple aspects. Divalent co-ions lead to an increase of\nmonovalent salt in the DNA condensate. Because monovalent salts mostly\nparticipate in linear screening of electrostatic interactions in the system,\nmore monovalent salt molecules enter the condensate leads to screening out of\nshort-range DNA$-$DNA like charge attraction and weaker DNA condensation free\nenergy. The overcharging of DNA by multivalent counterions is also reduced in\nthe presence of divalent co$-$ions. Strong repulsions between DNA and divalent\nco-ions and among divalent co-ions themselves leads to a {\\em depletion} of\nnegative ions near DNA surface as compared to the case without divalent\nco-ions. At large distance, the DNA$-$DNA repulsive interaction is stronger in\nthe presence of divalent co$-$ions, suggesting that divalent co$-$ions role is\nnot only that of simple stronger linear screening.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 15:17:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2016 04:40:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 16:20:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-25"}

The prototype was designed as a double-deck stage, upper rotary stage\nand lower linear stage. Most of components are selected to take advantage of\nheritage from existing astronomical instruments. In contrast, mechanical\ncomponents with lubricants such as bearings, linear motion guides and ball\nscrews were modified to survive cryogenic environment. The performance proving\ntest was carried out to evaluate errors such as wobbling, rotary and linear\npositioning error.
