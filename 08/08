In real\nspace, this anomaly can be quantified by the temperature variance in the\nnorthern and southern Ecliptic hemispheres. In this context, the northern\nhemisphere displays an anomalously low variance while the southern hemisphere\nappears unremarkable (consistent with expectations from the best-fitting\ntheory, $\\Lambda$CDM). While this is a well established result in temperature,\nthe low signal-to-noise ratio in current polarization data prevents a similar\ncomparison. This will change with a proposed ground-based CMB experiment,\nCMB-S4. With that in mind, we generate realizations of polarization maps\nconstrained by the temperature data and predict the distribution of the\nhemispherical variance in polarization considering two different sky coverage\nscenarios possible in CMB-S4: full Ecliptic north coverage and just the portion\nof the North that can be observed from a ground based telescope at the high\nChilean Atacama plateau. We find that even in the set of realizations\nconstrained by the temperature data, the low northern hemisphere variance\nobserved in temperature is not expected in polarization. Therefore, an\nanomalously low variance detection in polarization would provide strong\nevidence against the hypothesis that the temperature anomaly is simply a\nstatistical fluke. We show, within $\\Lambda$CDM, how variance measurements in\nboth sky coverage scenarios are related. We find that the variance makes for a\ngood statistic in cases where the sky coverage is limited, however a full\nnorthern coverage is still preferable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2016 16:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

Whilst most\napproaches aim to predict the single best grasp pose from an image, our method\nfirst predicts a score for every possible grasp pose, which we denote the grasp\nfunction. With this, it is possible to achieve grasping robust to the gripper's\npose uncertainty, by smoothing the grasp function with the pose uncertainty\nfunction. Therefore, if the single best pose is adjacent to a region of poor\ngrasp quality, that pose will no longer be chosen, and instead a pose will be\nchosen which is surrounded by a region of high grasp quality. To learn this\nfunction, we train a Convolutional Neural Network which takes as input a single\ndepth image of an object, and outputs a score for each grasp pose across the\nimage. Training data for this is generated by use of physics simulation and\ndepth image simulation with 3D object meshes, to enable acquisition of\nsufficient data without requiring exhaustive real-world experiments. We\nevaluate with both synthetic and real experiments, and show that the learned\ngrasp score is more robust to gripper pose uncertainty than when this\nuncertainty is not accounted for.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2016 16:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-14"}

Here we present an analysis of our magnetic focusing\nimaging results based on the effects of the tip-created charge density dip on\nthe motion of ballistic electrons. The density dip locally reduces the Fermi\nenergy, creating a force that pushes electrons away from the tip. When the tip\nis above the cyclotron orbit, electrons are deflected away from the receiving\ncontact, creating an image by reducing the transmission between contacts. The\ndata and our analysis suggest that graphene edge is rather rough, and electrons\nscattering off the edge bounce in random directions. However, when the tip is\nclose to the edge it can enhance transmission by bouncing electrons away from\nthe edge, toward the receiving contact. Our results demonstrate that a cooled\nSPM is a promising tool to investigate the motion of electrons in ballistic\ngraphene devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2016 17:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

Due to subtle facial movement of micro-expressions,\nfeature extraction has become an important and critical issue for spontaneous\nfacial micro-expression recognition. Recent works usually used spatiotemporal\nlocal binary pattern for micro-expression analysis. However, the commonly used\nspatiotemporal local binary pattern considers dynamic texture information to\nrepresent face images while misses the shape attribute of face images. On the\nother hand, their works extracted the spatiotemporal features from the global\nface regions, which ignore the discriminative information between two\nmicro-expression classes. The above-mentioned problems seriously limit the\napplication of spatiotemporal local binary pattern on micro-expression\nrecognition. In this paper, we propose a discriminative spatiotemporal local\nbinary pattern based on an improved integral projection to resolve the problems\nof spatiotemporal local binary pattern for micro-expression recognition.\nFirstly, we develop an improved integral projection for preserving the shape\nattribute of micro-expressions. Furthermore, an improved integral projection is\nincorporated with local binary pattern operators across spatial and temporal\ndomains. Specifically, we extract the novel spatiotemporal features\nincorporating shape attributes into spatiotemporal texture features. For\nincreasing the discrimination of micro-expressions, we propose a new feature\nselection based on Laplacian method to extract the discriminative information\nfor facial micro-expression recognition. Intensive experiments are conducted on\nthree availably published micro-expression databases. We compare our method\nwith the state-of-the-art algorithms.

Simulation results show that reference governor designs are\neffective in avoiding rollover. The results also demonstrate that the\ncontrollers are not overly conservative, adjusting the driver steering input\nonly for very high steering angles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2016 20:47:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-09"}

They are physically linked to the convection efficiency, differential\nrotation, and angular momentum evolution and are a potential indicator of age.\nHowever, for ages > 2 Gyr, the age-activity relationship remains poorly\nconstrained thus hampering its full application. The Ca II infrared triplet\n(IRT lines) has been poorly studied compared to classical chromospheric\nindicators. We report in this paper absolute chromospheric fluxes in the three\nCa II IRT lines, based on a new calibration tied to up-to-date model\natmospheres. We obtain the Ca II IRT absolute fluxes for 113 FGK stars from\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio and high-resolution spectra covering an extensive\ndomain of chromospheric activity levels. We perform an absolute continuum flux\ncalibration for the Ca II IRT lines anchored in atmospheric models calculated\nas an explicit function of effective temperatures, metallicity, and gravities\navoiding the degeneracy present in photometric continuum calibrations based\nsolely on color indices. The internal uncertainties achieved for continuum\nabsolute flux calculations are 2\\% of the solar chromospheric flux, one order\nof magnitude lower than photometric calibrations. We gauge the impact of\nobservational errors on the final chromospheric fluxes due to the absolute\ncontinuum flux calibration and find that $T_{\\rm eff}$ uncertainties are\nproperly mitigated by the photospheric correction leaving [Fe/H] as the\ndominating factor in the chromospheric flux uncertainty. Across the FGK\nspectral types, the Ca II IRT lines are sensitive to chromospheric activity.\nThe reduced internal uncertainties reported here enable us to build a new\nchromospheric absolute flux scale and explore the age-activity relation from\nthe active regime down to very low activity levels and a wide range of $T_{\\rm\neff}$, mass, [Fe/H], and age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 00:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

Despite this potential, little work has gone into developing\nvehicle routing problems (VRPs) specifically for drone delivery scenarios.\nExisting VRPs are insufficient for planning drone deliveries: either multiple\ntrips to the depot are not permitted, leading to solutions with excess drones,\nor the effect of battery and payload weight on energy consumption is not\nconsidered, leading to costly or infeasible routes. We propose two multi-trip\nVRPs for drone delivery that address both issues. One minimizes costs subject\nto a delivery time limit, while the other minimizes the overall delivery time\nsubject to a budget constraint. We mathematically derive and experimentally\nvalidate an energy consumption model for multirotor drones, demonstrating that\nenergy consumption varies approximately linearly with payload and battery\nweight.

While the ultimate goal is to generate a graph of neuron\nconnectivity, most prior automated methods have focused on volume segmentation\nrather than explicit graph estimation. In these approaches, one of the key,\ncommonly occurring error modes is dendritic shaft-spine fragmentation.\n  We posit that directly addressing this problem of connection identification\nmay provide critical insight into estimating more accurate brain graphs. To\nthis end, we develop a network-centric approach motivated by biological priors\nimage grammars. We build a computer vision pipeline to reconnect fragmented\nspines to their parent dendrites using both fully-automated and semi-automated\napproaches.

This paper\nstudies an asymptotic behavior of downlink (DL) performance of a LS-CRAN with\nthree practical constraints: 1) limited transmit power, 2) limited\nfront/backhaul capacity, and 3) limited pilot resource. As an asymptotic\nperformance measure, the scaling exponent of the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) is derived for interference-free\n(IF), maximum-ratio transmission (MRT), and zero-forcing (ZF) operations. Our\nasymptotic analysis reveals four fundamental operating regimes and the\nperformances of both MRT and ZF operations are fundamentally limited by the UL\ntransmit power for estimating user's channel state information, not the DL\ntransmit power. We obtain the conditions that MRT or ZF operation becomes\ninterference-free, i.e., order-optimal with three practical constraints.\nSpecifically, as higher UL transmit power is provided, more users can be\nassociated and the data rate per user can be increased simultaneously while\nkeeping the order-optimality as long as the total front/backhaul overhead is\n$\\Omega(N^{\\eta_{\\rm{bs}}+\\eta_{\\rm{ant}}+\\eta_{\\rm{user}}+\\frac{2}{\\alpha}\\rho^{\\rm{ul}}})$\nand $\\Omega(N^{\\eta_{\\rm{user}}-\\eta_{\\rm{bs}}})$ pilot resources are\navailable.

In models where the coupling between\nneutrinos and dark energy grows with the value of the scalar cosmon field, the\nevolution of neutrino lumps depends on the neutrino mass. For small masses the\nlumps form and dissolve periodically, leaving only a small backreaction of the\nneutrino structures on the cosmic evolution. This process heats the neutrinos\nto temperatures much above the photon temperature such that neutrinos acquire\nagain an almost relativistic equation of state. The present equation of state\nof the combined cosmon-neutrino fluid is very close to -1. In contrast, for\nlarger neutrino masses the lumps become stable. The highly concentrated\nneutrino structures entail a large backreaction similar to the case of a\nconstant neutrino-cosmon coupling. A present average neutrino mass of around\n0.5 eV seems so far compatible with observation. For masses lower than this\nvalue, neutrino induced gravitational potentials remain small, making the lumps\ndifficult to detect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 09:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

We focus on two kinds of bacteria, Pseudomonas\naeruginosa and Escherichia coli, and investigate the inversion events among\ndifferent strains of the same specie.

Size-dependent multiphysics\nstability diagrams are obtained, and size-dependent serrated stress-strain\ncurves are interpreted through combined gradient-stochastic models. When\ndifferential equations are not available for describing material behavior, a\nTsallis non-extensive thermodynamic formulation is employed to characterize\nstatistical properties. A novel multiscale coarse graining technique, the\nequation free method (EFM), is suggested for bridging length scales, and the\nsame is done for determining ILs through novel laboratory tests by employing\nspecimens with fabricated gradient micro/nano structures.

We used ALMA to study the chromospheric\nemission of the aCen binary system in all six available frequency bands during\nCycle2 in 2014/15.

The\ncomparison of the observed spectral energy distributions with theoretical model\ncomputations provides the chromospheric structure in terms of temperature and\ndensity above the stellar photosphere and the quantitative understanding of the\nprimary emission processes.

The submm/mm emission of the aCen stars is indeed very\nwell reproduced by modified chromospheric models of the Quiet Sun. This most\nlikely means that the non-radiative heating mechanisms of the upper atmosphere\nthat are at work in the Sun are operating also in other solar-type stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 11:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

In thin electron current sheets (ECS)\n(thickness ~ an electron inertial length) formed in collisionless magnetic\nreconnection, electron shear flow instabilities (ESFI) are potential candidates\nfor providing an anomalous dissipation mechanism which can break the frozen-in\ncondition of the magnetic field affecting the structure and rate of\nreconnection. We investigate the evolution of ESFI in guide field magnetic\nreconnection. The properties of the resulting plasma turbulence and their\ndependence on the strength of the guide field are studied.

The latter cause the development of,\nfirst, a wavy structure of the ECS. The turbulence, developed later, consists\nof current filaments and electron flow vortices. As a result of the nonlinear\nevolution of the instability, the ECS broadens simultaneously with its\nflattening in the central region mimicking a viscous-like turbulent\ndissipation. Later, the flattened ECS bifurcates. During the time of the\nbifurcation, the rate of the change of the mean electron flow velocity is\nproportional to the magnitude of the flow velocity, suggesting a resistive-like\ndissipation. The turbulence energy cascades to shorter wavelengths\npreferentially in the direction perpendicular to the guide magnetic field.

The FCI\nmethod constructs a finite difference scheme for $\\nabla_\\Vert$ by following\nfield lines between planes and interpolating within planes. Doing so removes\nthe need for field-aligned coordinate systems that suffer from singularities in\nthe metric tensor at null points in the magnetic field (or equivalently, when\n$q \\to \\infty$). One cost of this method is that as the field lines are not on\nthe mesh, they may leave the domain at any point between neighbouring planes,\ncomplicating the application of boundary conditions.\n  The Leg Value Fill (LVF) boundary condition scheme presented here involves an\nextrapolation/interpolation of the boundary value onto the field line end\npoint. The usual finite difference scheme can then be used unmodified. We\nimplement the LVF scheme in BOUT++ and use the Method of Manufactured Solutions\nto verify the implementation in a rectangular domain, and show that the error\nscaling of the finite difference scheme isn't modified.

The understanding of\ntheir emergent cooperative behaviour has become an important issue across\ndisciplines, requiring a general conceptual framework in order to harvest the\npotential of these systems. We study the synchronization of coupled oscillators\nin time-evolving networks defined by the positions of self-propelled agents\ninteracting in real space. In order to understand the impact of mobility in the\nsynchronization process on general grounds, we introduce a simple model of\nself-propelled hard disks performing persistent random walks in 2$d$ space and\ncarrying an internal Kuramoto phase oscillator. For non-interacting particles,\nself-propulsion accelerates synchronization. The competition between agent\nmobility and excluded volume interactions gives rise to a richer scenario,\nleading to an optimal self-propulsion speed. We identify two extreme dynamic\nregimes where synchronization can be understood from theoretical\nconsiderations. A systematic analysis of our model quantifies the departure\nfrom the latter ideal situations and characterizes the different mechanisms\nleading the evolution of the system.

The protection of equipment from beam accidents is more recent,\nalthough there was one paper that discussed beam-induced damage for the SLAC\nlinac (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) as early as in 1967.

Designing a machine protection system requires an\nexcellent understanding of accelerator physics and operation to anticipate\npossible failures that could lead to damage. Machine protection includes beam\nand equipment monitoring, a system to safely stop beam operation (e.g. dumping\nthe beam or stopping the beam at low energy) and an interlock system providing\nthe glue between these systems.

It has been observed that\nin many realistic propagation scenarios as well as in spatially correlated\nchannel models used in standardizations, although the user channel vectors have\na very high-dim $M$, they lie on low-dim subspaces due to their limited angular\nspread. This low-dim subspace structure remains stable across many coherence\nblocks and can be exploited in several ways to improve the system performance.\nA main challenge, however, is to estimate this signal subspace from samples of\nusers' channel vectors as fast and efficiently as possible. In a recent work,\nwe addressed this problem and proposed a very effective novel algorithm\nreferred to as Approximate Maximum-Likelihood (AML), which was formulated as a\nsemi-definite program (SDP). In this paper, we address two problems left open\nin our previous work: computational complexity and tracking.

Previously, such invariants were known only in\ndimensions $2$ and $3$ from the work of Welschinger. Our approach does not\nrequire the Lagrangian to be fixed by an anti-symplectic involution, but can\nuse such an involution, if present, to obtain stronger results. Also,\nnon-trivial invariants are defined for broader classes of interior constraints\nand Lagrangian submanifolds than previously possible even in the presence of an\nanti-symplectic involution. The invariants of the present work specialize to\ninvariants of Welschinger, Fukaya, and Georgieva in many instances.\n  The main obstacle to defining open Gromov-Witten invariants with boundary\nconstraints in arbitrary dimension is the bubbling of $J$-holomorphic disks.\nUnlike in low dimensions or for interior constraints, disk bubbles do not\ncancel in pairs by anti-symplectic involution symmetry. Rather, we use the\ntechnique of bounding chains introduced in Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono's work on\nLagrangian Floer theory to cancel disk bubbling. At the same time and\nindependently, gauge equivalence classes of bounding chains play the role of\nboundary constraints, in place of the cohomology classes that usually serve as\nconstraints in Gromov-Witten theory.

A large part of space-time turns\nout to be classically inaccessible, and the boundary of this region is a\ncaustic of an unusual type, where the amplitude vanishes instead of diverging.\nWe show that this curve is the limit of caustics in the usual sense when the\nreflecting boundary is approximated by steeply rising smooth potentials. Then,\nto improve the WKB approximation we construct the propagator for initial data\nin momentum space; this requires classifying the interesting variety of\nclassical paths with initial momentum $p$ arriving at $x$ after time $t$. The\ntwo approximate propagators are compared by applying them to Gaussian initial\npackets by numerical integration; the results show physically expected\nbehavior, with advantages to the momentum-based propagator in the classically\nforbidden regime (large $t$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 15:48:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

We investigate its dependence on source\nclass and examine whether the radio variability is related to the gamma-ray\nloudness. Finally, we assess the validity of a putative correlation between the\ntwo bands. The F-GAMMA monitored monthly a sample of about 60 sources at up to\ntwelve radio frequencies between 2.64 and 228.39 GHz. We perform a time series\nanalysis on the first 2.5-year dataset to obtain variability parameters. A\nmaximum likelihood analysis is used to assess the significance of a correlation\nbetween radio and gamma-ray fluxes. We present light curves and spectra\n(coherent within ten days) obtained with the Effelsberg 100-m and IRAM 30-m\ntelescopes. All sources are variable across all frequency bands with amplitudes\nincreasing with frequency up to rest frame frequencies of around 60 - 80 GHz as\nexpected by shock-in-jet models. Compared to FSRQs, BL Lacs show systematically\nlower variability amplitudes, brightness temperatures and Doppler factors at\nlower frequencies, while the difference vanishes towards higher ones. The time\nscales appear similar for the two classes. The distribution of spectral indices\nappears flatter or more inverted at higher frequencies for BL Lacs. Evolving\nsynchrotron self-absorbed components can naturally account for the observed\nspectral variability. We find that the Fermi-detected sources show larger\nvariability amplitudes as well as brightness temperatures and Doppler factors,\nthan non-detected ones. Flux densities at 86.2 and 142.3 GHz correlate with 1\nGeV fluxes at a significance level better than 3sigma, implying that gamma rays\nare produced very close to the mm-band emission region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2016 21:31:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-30"}

Which player is able to\nhelp the build-up of an attack, or to maintain the possession of the ball? We\nintroduce a novel methodology called QPass to answer questions like these\nquantitatively. Based on the analysis of an entire season, we rank the players\nbased on the intrinsic value of their passes using QPass. We derive an album of\npass trajectories for different gaming styles. Our methodology reveals a quite\ncounterintuitive paradigm: losing the ball possession could lead to better\nchances to win a game.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 12:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-12"}

We found that the frequencies of email sizes followed a power-law\ndistribution and discovered two inflection points in the distribution. After\nanalyzing these results, we collected new system log data for both staff and\nstudents for the period from April 1, 2009 to March 31, 2015 and analyzed the\nfrequency distributions per academic year. The results of the earlier\ninvestigation were replicated for each of these distributions. Then, we\ndisaggregated the system log data for the staff for the period from May 1, 2015\nto July 31, 2015 using the email header \"Content-Type\" and created four\nsubdistributions. Frequency distributions were calculated for the disaggregated\ndata. We then proposed and evaluated a model to explain the overall frequency\ndistribution as a sum of the four subdistributions. The correlation coefficient\nbetween the observed frequency distribution and the distribution predicted by\nour model was 0.8408 for the staff. This coefficient confirmed that our\napproach can successfully model and predict the size distribution of emails.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 10:51:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 16:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-03"}

Additionally the video data capturing was done on\nspontaneous emotions invoked by watching sports events from group of\nparticipants. The method was view and occlusion independent and the results\nwere not affected by presence of multiple people chaotically expressing various\nemotions.
