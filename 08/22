Recently proposed electrical manipulation with spin-orbit torques is\nrestricted to metals with a specific crystal structure.\n  Here we propose an alternative, broadly applicable approach: using asymmetric\nmagnetic field pulses to induce controlled ratchet motion of AF domain walls.\n  The efficiency of this approach is based on three peculiarities of AF\ndynamics. First, a time-dependent magnetic field couples with an AF order\nparameter stronger than a static magnetic field, which leads to higher mobility\nof the domain walls. Second, the rate of change of the magnetic field couples\nwith the spatial variation of the AF order parameter inside the domain and this\nenables synchronous motion of multiple domain walls with the same structure.\nThird, tailored asymmetric field pulses in combination with static friction can\nprevent backward motion of domain walls and thus lead to the desired controlled\nratchet effect.\n  The proposed use of an external field, rather than internal spin-orbit\ntorques, avoids any restrictions on size, conductivity, and crystal structure\nof the AF material.\n  We believe that our approach paves a way for the development of new AF-based\ndevices based on controlled motion of AF domain walls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2016 17:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

We employ\nthe linear theory of warped accretion discs to find the shape of a disc for\nwhich the stream arising from the disrupted star provides a source of angular\nmomentum that is misaligned with that of the black hole. For quasi-steady\nconfigurations we find that when the warp diffusion or propagation time is\nlarge compared to the local mass accretion time and/or the natural disc\nalignment radius is small, misalignment is favoured. These results have been\nverified using SPH simulations. We also simulated 1D model discs including gas\nand radiation pressure. As accretion rates initially exceed the Eddington limit\nthe disc is initially advection dominated. Assuming the $\\alpha$ model for the\ndisc, where it can be thermally unstable it subsequently undergoes cyclic\ntransitions between high and low states. During these transitions the aspect\nratio varies from $\\sim 1$ to $\\sim 10^{-3}$ which is reflected in changes in\nthe degree of disc misalignment at the stream impact location. For maximal\nblack hole rotation and sufficiently large values of viscosity parameter\n$\\alpha > \\sim 0.01-0.1$ the ratio of the disc inclination to that of the\ninitial stellar orbit is estimated to be $0.1-0.2$ in the advection dominated\nstate, while reaching of order unity in the low state.

The\noblivious robot model is hence attractive from a self-stabilization\nperspective, where state is subject to adversarial manipulation. However, to\nthe best of our knowledge, all existing robot convergence protocols rely on the\nassumption that robots, despite being \"weak\", can measure distances.\n  We in this paper initiate the study of convergence protocols for even simpler\nrobots, called \\emph{monoculus robots}: robots which cannot measure distances.\nIn particular, we introduce two natural models which relax the assumptions on\nthe robots' cognitive capabilities: (1) a Locality Detection ($\\mathcal{LD}$)\nmodel in which a robot can only detect whether another robot is closer than a\ngiven constant distance or not, (2) an Orthogonal Line Agreement\n($\\mathcal{OLA}$) model in which robots only agree on a pair of orthogonal\nlines (say North-South and West-East, but without knowing which is which).\n  The problem turns out to be non-trivial, and simple median and angle\nbisection strategies can easily increase the distances among robots (e.g., the\narea of the enclosing convex hull) over time. Our main contribution are\ndeterministic self-stabilizing convergence algorithms for these two models,\ntogether with a complexity analysis.

To\naddress today's ever increasing large dataset, effective screening relies on a\ntight region bound on the solution to the dual lasso. Typical region bounds are\nin the form of an intersection of a sphere and multiple half spaces. One way to\ntighten the region bound is using more half spaces, which however, adds to the\noverhead of solving the high dimensional optimization problem in lasso\nscreening. This paper reveals the interesting property that the optimization\nproblem only depends on the projection of features onto the subspace spanned by\nthe normals of the half spaces. This property converts an optimization problem\nin high dimension to much lower dimension, and thus sheds light on reducing the\ncomputation overhead of lasso screening based on tighter region bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2016 23:48:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 22:05:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-29"}

However, some fundamental physics behind the\nbrilliant emission remains highly controversial. One of the important facts in\naddressing the flare energetics is the spatialtemporal correlation between the\nwhite-light emission and the hard X-ray radiation, presumably suggesting that\nthe energetic electrons are the energy sources. In this study, we present a\nstatistical analysis of 25 strong flares (?greater than or equal to M5)\nobserved simultaneously by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board\nthe Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar\nSpectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). Among these events, WL emission was detected by\nSDO/HMI in 13 flares, associated with HXR emission. To quantitatively describe\nthe strength of WL emission, equivalent area (EA) is defined as the integrated\ncontrast enhancement over the entire flaring area. Our results show that the\nequivalent area is inversely proportional to the HXR power index, indicating\nthat stronger WL emission tends to be associated with larger population of high\nenergy electrons. However, no obvious correlation is found between WL emission\nand flux of non-thermal electrons at 50 keV. For the other group of 13 flares\nwithout detectable WL emission, the HXR spectra are softer (larger power index)\nthan those flares with WL emission, especially for the X-class flares in this\ngroup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2016 23:51:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

One approach circumventing this cost is training\nmodels on synthetic data where annotations are provided automatically. Despite\ntheir appeal, such models often fail to generalize from synthetic to real\nimages, necessitating domain adaptation algorithms to manipulate these models\nbefore they can be successfully applied. Existing approaches focus either on\nmapping representations from one domain to the other, or on learning to extract\nfeatures that are invariant to the domain from which they were extracted.\nHowever, by focusing only on creating a mapping or shared representation\nbetween the two domains, they ignore the individual characteristics of each\ndomain.

Our model is\ntrained not only to perform the task we care about in the source domain, but\nalso to use the partitioned representation to reconstruct the images from both\ndomains.

Solving microscopic models suitable for cuprates, here, we\ndemonstrate that at an interface between a Mott insulator and an overdoped\nnon-superconducting metal, the superconducting amplitude stays always pinned at\nthe optimum achieved in the bulk, independently of the carrier concentration in\nthe metal. This is in contrast to the dome-like dependence in bulk\nsuperconductors, but consistent with the astonishing independence of the\ncritical temperature from the carrier density x observed at interfaces of\nLa2CuO4 and La2-xSrxCuO4.

The setting is that of the Poisson bipolar model introduced in [1],\nwhich is a natural model for ad-hoc and device-to-device (D2D) networks. The\nprimary finding is that, with knowledge of channel state information between a\nreceiver and its associated transmitter, by zero-forcing successive\ninterference cancellation, and for appropriate antenna configurations, the\nergodic spectral efficiency can be made to scale linearly with both 1) the\nminimum of the number of transmit and receive antennas, 2) the density of nodes\nand 3) the path-loss exponent. This linear gain is achieved by using the\ntransmit antennas to send multiple data streams (e.g. through an open-loop\ntransmission method) and by exploiting the receive antennas to cancel\ninterference. Furthermore, when a receiver is able to learn channel state\ninformation from a certain number of near interferers, higher scaling gains can\nbe achieved when using a successive interference cancellation method. A major\nimplication of the derived scaling laws is that spatial multiplexing\ntransmission methods are essential for obtaining better and eventually optimal\nscaling laws in multiple antenna random wireless networks.

The effects of\nnon-Markovian noise on a number of facets of quantum cryptography, such as\nquantum secure direct communication, deterministic secure quantum communication\nand their controlled counterparts, quantum dialogue, quantum key distribution,\nquantum key agreement, etc., have been extensively investigated. Specifically,\na scheme for controlled quantum dialogue (CQD) is analyzed over damping,\ndephasing and depolarizing non-Markovian channels, and subsequently, the effect\nof these non-Markovian channels on the other schemes of secure quantum\ncommunication is deduced from the results obtained for CQD.

Mathematically, this requires that the learning algorithm enjoys a\nsmall generalization risk, which is defined either in expectation or in\nprobability. Both types of generalization are commonly used in the literature.\nFor instance, generalization in expectation has been used to analyze\nalgorithms, such as ridge regression and SGD, whereas generalization in\nprobability is used in the VC theory, among others. Recently, a third notion of\ngeneralization has been studied, called uniform generalization, which requires\nthat the generalization risk vanishes uniformly in expectation across all\nbounded parametric losses. It has been shown that uniform generalization is, in\nfact, equivalent to an information-theoretic stability constraint, and that it\nrecovers classical results in learning theory. It is achievable under various\nsettings, such as sample compression schemes, finite hypothesis spaces, finite\ndomains, and differential privacy. However, the relationship between uniform\ngeneralization and concentration remained unknown. In this paper, we answer\nthis question by proving that, while a generalization in expectation does not\nimply a generalization in probability, a uniform generalization in expectation\ndoes imply concentration. We establish a chain rule for the uniform\ngeneralization risk of the composition of hypotheses and use it to derive a\nlarge deviation bound. Finally, we prove that the bound is tight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 07:47:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2016 16:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

The equivalent of a cambrian explosion may however have the\nchance to unfold on transiently habitable planets if it would be possible to\nfast forward evolution by 3-4 billion years (with respect to terrestrial\ntimescales). We argue here, that this is indeed possible when seeding the\ncandidate planet with the microbial lifeforms, bacteria and unicellular\neukaryotes alike, characterizing earth before the cambrian explosion. An\ninterstellar mission of this kind, denoted the `Genesis project', could be\ncarried out by a relatively low-cost robotic microcraft equipped with a\non-board gene laboratory for the in situ synthesis of the microbes.\n  We review here our current understanding of the processes determining the\ntimescales shaping the geo-evolution of an earth-like planet, the prospect of\nfinding Genesis candidate planets and selected issues regarding the mission\nlayout. Discussing the ethical aspects connected with a Genesis mission, which\nwould be expressively not for human benefit, we will also touch the risk that a\nbiosphere incompatibility may arise in the wake of an eventual manned\nexploration of a second earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 08:49:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2016 12:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-23"}

We examine whether\nor not these extinction curves can be explained by well known dust evolution\nprocesses. We treat the dust production in stellar ejecta, destruction in\nsupernova shocks, dust growth by accretion and coagulation, and dust disruption\nby shattering. To make a survey of the large parameter space possible, we\nsimplify the treatment of the grain size distribution evolution by adopting the\n`two-size approximation', in which we divide the grain population into small\n($\\lesssim 0.03~\\mu$m) and large ($\\gtrsim 0.03~\\mu$m) grains. It is confirmed\nthat the MW extinction curve can be reproduced in reasonable ranges for the\ntime-scale of the above processes with a silicate-graphite mixture. This\nindicates that the MW extinction curve is a natural consequence of the dust\nevolution through the above processes. We also find that the same models fail\nto reproduce the SMC/LMC extinction curves. Nevertheless, this failure can be\nremedied by giving higher supernova destruction rates for small carbonaceous\ndust and considering amorphous carbon for carbonaceous dust; these modification\nfall in fact in line with previous studies. Therefore, we conclude that the\ncurrent dust evolution scenario composed of the aforementioned processes is\nsuccessful in explaining the extinction curves.

In this study we employ Herschel/PACS [OI] and [CII] spectral line\nmaps of the NGC 1333 star-forming region to assess the relative influence of\natomic jets onto the star-formation process. Atomic line maps are compared\nagainst molecular outflow tracers and atomic ejecta are associated to\nindividual driving sources. We study the detailed morphology and velocity\ndistribution of [OI] line using channel and line-centroid maps and derive the\nmomentum, energy, and mass flux for all the bipolar jets traced by [OI] line\nemission.

The estimated\nratios of the jet to the outflow momenta and energies are consistent with the\nresults of two-component, nested jet/outflow simulations, where jets are\nassociated to episodic accretion events. Under this scenario, the energy from\natomic jets to the cloud is as important as the energy output from outflows in\nmaintaining turbulence and dissipating the cloud gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 11:38:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

Existing works mainly concentrate on either\nthe synaptic weights or the neural parameters. In this paper we present an\nalgorithm to reconstruct all parameters including the synaptic weights of a\nspiking neuron model. The model based on works of Eugene M. Izhikevich\n(Izhikevich 2007) consists of two differential equations and covers different\ntypes of cortical neurons. It combines the dynamical properties of\nHodgkin-Huxley-type dynamics with a high computational efficiency. The\npresented algorithm uses the recordings of the corresponding membrane\npotentials of the model for the reconstruction and consists of two main\ncomponents. The first component is a rank based Genetic Algorithm (GA) which is\nused to find the neural parameters of the model. The second one is a Least Mean\nSquares approach which computes the synaptic weights of all interconnected\nneurons by minimizing the squared error between the calculated and the measured\nmembrane potentials for each time step. In preparation for the reconstruction\nof the neural parameters and of the synaptic weights from real measured\nmembrane potentials, promising results based on simulated data generated with a\nrandomly parametrized Izhikevich model are presented. The reconstruction does\nnot only converge to a global minimum of neural parameters, but also\napproximates the synaptic weights with high precision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 11:47:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-23"}

Two extreme cases are considered: (i) a reduced\nacquisition time that leads to very low photon counts and (ii) a highly\nattenuating environment (such as a turbid medium) which makes the reflectivity\nestimation more difficult at increasing range. Adopting a Bayesian approach,\nthe Poisson distributed observations are combined with prior distributions\nabout the parameters of interest, to build the joint posterior distribution.\nMore precisely, two Markov random field (MRF) priors enforcing spatial\ncorrelations are assigned to the DR images. Under some justified assumptions,\nthe restoration problem (regularized likelihood) reduces to a convex\nformulation with respect to each of the parameters of interest. This problem is\nfirst solved using an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that\napproximates the minimum mean square parameter estimators. This algorithm is\nfully automatic since it adjusts the parameters of the MRFs by maximum marginal\nlikelihood estimation. However, the MCMC-based algorithm exhibits a relatively\nlong computational time. The second algorithm deals with this issue and is\nbased on a coordinate descent algorithm. Results on single-photon depth data\nfrom laboratory based underwater measurements demonstrate the benefit of the\nproposed strategy that improves the quality of the estimated DR images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 12:23:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-23"}

Cell fate\nspecification is coordinated via Notch's interaction with the canonical Wnt\npathway. Here, we propose a new mathematical model of the Notch and Wnt\npathways, in which the Hes1 promoter acts as a hub for pathway crosstalk.\nComputational simulations of the model can assist in understanding how healthy\nintestinal tissue is maintained, and predict the likely consequences of\nbiochemical knockouts upon cell fate selection processes. Chemical reaction\nnetwork theory (CRNT) is a powerful, generalised framework which assesses the\ncapacity of our model for monostability or multistability, by analysing\nproperties of the underlying network structure without recourse to specific\nparameter values or functional forms for reaction rates. CRNT highlights the\nrole of beta-catenin in stabilising the Notch pathway and damping oscillations,\ndemonstrating that Wnt-mediated actions on the Hes1 promoter can induce\ndynamical transitions in the Notch system, from multistability to\nmonostability. Time-dependent model simulations of cell pairs reveal the\nstabilising influence of Wnt upon the Notch pathway, in which beta-catenin- and\nDsh-mediated action on the Hes1 promoter are key in shaping the subcellular\ndynamics. Where Notch-mediated transcription of Hes1 dominates, there is Notch\noscillation and maintenance of fate flexibility; Wnt-mediated transcription of\nHes1 favours bistability akin to cell fate selection. Cells could therefore\nregulate the proportion of Wnt- and Notch-mediated control of the Hes1 promoter\nto coordinate the timing of cell fate selection as they migrate through the\nintestinal epithelium and are subject to reduced Wnt stimuli.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 12:32:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

High column densities and complex kinematical structures make direct\nobservations challenging and they only provide a snapshot. Chemical tracers\nprovide an interesting alternative to characterise the infall histories of\nprotostars. Previous observations of H13CO+ towards the low-mass protostar\nIRAS15398-3359 showed a depression in the abundance. This is a sign of\ndestruction of HCO+ by an enhanced presence of gaseous water in an extended\nregion, possibly related to a recent burst in the accretion. Direct\nobservations of water vapour can determine the exact extent of the emission and\nconfirm the hypothesis that HCO+ is indeed a good tracer of the water\nsnow-line. IRAS15398 was observed using ALMA at 0.5\" resolution. Maps of\nHDO(101-000) and H218O(414-321) were taken simultaneously with observations of\nthe CS(8-7) and N2H+(5-4) lines and continuum at 0.65 and 0.75 mm. The maps\nwere interpreted using dust radiative transfer calculations of the protostellar\ninfalling envelope with an outflow cavity. HDO is clearly detected and extended\nover the scales of the H13CO+ depression, although it is displaced by ~500 AU\nin the direction of the outflow. H218O is tentatively detected towards the\nred-shifted outflow lobe, but otherwise it is absent from the mapped region,\nwhich suggests that temperatures are low.

However, formulating constraints manually\nrequires domain expertise, is prone to human errors, and may be excessively\ntime consuming, especially on large datasets. Hence, proposals for automatic\ndiscovery have been made for some classes of ICs, such as functional\ndependencies (FDs), and recently, order dependencies (ODs). ODs properly\nsubsume FDs, as they can additionally express business rules involving order;\ne.g., an employee never has a higher salary while paying lower taxes compared\nwith another employee.\n  We address the limitations of prior work on OD discovery which has factorial\ncomplexity in the number of attributes, is incomplete (i.e., it does not\ndiscover valid ODs that cannot be inferred from the ones found) and is not\nconcise (i.e., it can result in \"redundant\" discovery and overly large\ndiscovery sets). We improve significantly on complexity, offer completeness,\nand define a compact canonical form. This is based on a novel polynomial\nmapping to a canonical form for ODs, and a sound and complete set of axioms\n(inference rules) for canonical ODs.

Owing to the close\ndistance to Orion (about 1,350 light-year), the effects of stellar feedback on\nthe parental cloud can be studied in detail. Visible-light observations of the\nBar(1) show that the transition between the hot ionised gas and the warm\nneutral atomic gas (the ionisation front) is spatially well separated from the\ntransition from atomic to molecular gas (the dissociation front): about 15\narcseconds or 6,200 astronomical units (one astronomical unit is the Earth-Sun\ndistance). Static equilibrium models(2,3) used to interpret previous\nfar-infrared and radio observations of the neutral gas in the Bar(4,5,6)\n(typically at 10-20 arcsecond resolution) predict an inhomogeneous cloud\nstructure consisting of dense clumps embedded in a lower density extended gas\ncomponent. Here we report one-arcsecond-resolution millimetre-wave images that\nallow us to resolve the molecular cloud surface. In contrast to stationary\nmodel predictions(7,8,9), there is no appreciable offset between the peak of\nthe H2 vibrational emission (delineating the H/H2 transition) and the edge of\nthe observed CO and HCO+ emission. This implies that the H/H2 and C+/C/CO\ntransition zones are very close. These observations reveal a fragmented ridge\nof high-density substructures, photoablative gas flows and instabilities at the\nmolecular cloud surface. The results suggest that the cloud edge has been\ncompressed by a high-pressure wave that currently moves into the molecular\ncloud.

Currently, data augmentation methods are used to carry out\ninference for discrete copula and, in practice, the computation becomes\ninfeasible when $J$ is large. Our article proposes two new fast Bayesian\napproaches for estimating high dimensional copulas with discrete margins, or a\ncombination of discrete and continuous margins. Both methods are based on\nrecent advances in Bayesian methodology that work with an unbiased estimate of\nthe likelihood rather than the likelihood itself, and our key observation is\nthat we can estimate the likelihood of a discrete copula unbiasedly with much\nless computation than evaluating the likelihood exactly or with current\nsimulation methods that are based on augmenting the model with latent\nvariables. The first approach builds on the pseudo marginal method that allows\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo simulation from the posterior distribution using only\nan unbiased estimate of the likelihood. The second approach is based on a\nVariational Bayes approximation to the posterior and also uses an unbiased\nestimate of the likelihood. We show that Monte Carlo and randomised quasi Monte\nCarlo methods can be used with both approaches to reduce the variability of the\nestimate of the likelihood, and hence enable us to carry out Bayesian inference\nfor high values of $J$ for some classes of copulas where the computation was\npreviously too expensive.

The\nthermally assisted DW motion is a consequence of the magnonic spin current due\nto the applied thermal bias. In addition to the exchange magnonic spin current\nand the exchange adiabatic and the entropic spin transfer torques, we also\nconsider the DMI-induced magnonic spin current, thermomagnonic DMI field-like\ntorque and the DMI entropic torque. Analytical estimations are supported by\nnumerical calculations. We found that the DMI has a substantial influence on\nthe size and the geometry of DWs, and that the DWs become oriented parallel to\nthe long axis of the nanostrip. Increasing the temperature smoothes the DWs.\nMoreover, the thermallyinduced magnonic current generates a torque on the DWs,\nwhich is responsible for their motion. From our analysis it follows that for a\nlarge enough DMI the influence of DMI-induced field-like torque is much\nstronger than that of the DMI and the exchange entropic torques. By\nmanipulating the strength of the DMI constant, one can control the speed of the\nDW motion, and the direction of the DW motion can be switched, as well. We also\nfound that DMI not only contributes to the total magnonic current, but also it\nmodifies the exchange magnonic spin current, and this modification depends on\nthe orientation of the steady state magnetization. The observed phenomenon can\nbe utilized in spin caloritronics devices, for example in the DMI based thermal\ndiodes. By switching the magnetization direction, one can rectify the total\nmagnonic spin current.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 14:30:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

Some of\nthis uncertainty may be removed through future gravitational wave observations\nof neutron star binaries by extracting the tidal deformabilities (or Love\nnumbers) of neutron stars. Previous studies showed that only a certain\ncombination of the individual deformabilities of each body (chirp tidal\ndeformability) can be measured with second-generation gravitational wave\ninterferometers, such as Adv. LIGO, due to correlations between the individual\ndeformabilities. To overcome this, we search for approximately universal (or\nequation-of-state independent) relations between two combinations of the\nindividual tidal deformabilities, such that once one of them has been measured,\nthe other can be automatically obtained and the individual ones decoupled\nthrough these relations. We find an approximately universal relation between\nthe symmetric and the anti-symmetric combination of the individual tidal\ndeformabilities that is equation-of-state-insensitive to $20\\%$ for binaries\nwith masses less than $1.7M_\\odot$. We show that these relations can be used to\neliminate a combination of the tidal parameters from the list of model\nparameters, thus breaking degeneracies and improving the accuracy in parameter\nestimation. A simple study shows that the universal relations can improve the\naccuracy in the extraction of the symmetric combination of tidal parameters by\nas much as an order of magnitude, making the overall accuracy in the extraction\nof this parameter slightly better than that of the chirp tidal deformability.\nThese new universal relations and the improved measurement accuracy on tidal\nparameters not only are important to astrophysics and nuclear physics, but also\nimpact our ability to probe extreme gravity with gravitational waves and\ncosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 14:53:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Oct 2018 02:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-16"}

Variational inference in these dense models is performed\nusing a filtering-based mean-field algorithm in order to obtain a\nfully-factorized distribution minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence to the\ntrue distribution. In contrast to the continuous relaxation-based energy\nminimisation algorithms used for sparse CRFs, the mean-field algorithm fails to\nprovide strong theoretical guarantees on the quality of its solutions.

This result offers an explanation for why gradient methods\nsucceed so frequently in quantum control in both theory and practice. The role\nof singular controls is analyzed using geometric tools in the case of the\ncontrol of the propagator of closed finite dimension systems. This type of\ncontrol field has been implicated as a source of landscape traps. The\nconditions under which singular controls can introduce traps, and thus\ninterrupt the progress of a control optimization, are discussed and a\ngeometrical characterization of the issue is presented. It is shown that a\ncontrol being singular is not sufficient to cause a control optimization\nprogress to halt and sufficient conditions for a trap free landscape are\npresented. It is further shown that the local surjectivity axiom of landscape\nanalysis can be refined to the condition that the end-point map is transverse\nto each of the level sets of the fidelity function. This novel condition is\nshown to be sufficient for a quantum system's landscape to be trap free.

The particles are compressed using a time-dependent quasi-one\ndimensional trough potential that controls the local density, causing the\nsystem to undergo a series of structural phase transitions from a low density\nclump lattice to stripes, voids, and a high density uniform state. The\ncompression proceeds via slow elastic motion that is interrupted with\navalanche-like bursts of activity as the system collapses to progressively\nhigher densities via plastic rearrangements. The plastic events vary in\nmagnitude from small rearrangements of particles, including the formation of\nquadrupole-like defects, to large-scale vorticity and structural phase\ntransitions. In the dense uniform phase, the system compresses through row\nreduction transitions mediated by a disorder-order process. We characterize the\nrearrangement events by measuring changes in the potential energy, the fraction\nof sixfold coordinated particles, the local density, and the velocity\ndistribution. At high confinements, we find power law scaling of the velocity\ndistribution during row reduction transitions. We observe hysteresis under a\nreversal of the compression when relatively few plastic rearrangements occur.\nThe decompressing system exhibits distinct phase morphologies, and the phase\ntransitions occur at lower compression forces as the system expands compared to\nwhen it is compressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 15:50:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}
