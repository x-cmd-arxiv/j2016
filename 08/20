Existing solutions typically require intermediate\nresults of individual operators to be materialized into temporary tables to be\nconsidered for reuse in subsequent queries. However, these approaches are\nfundamentally ill-suited for use in modern main memory databases. The reason is\nthat modern main memory DBMSs are typically limited by the bandwidth of the\nmemory bus, thus query execution is heavily optimized to keep tuples in the CPU\ncaches and registers. To that end, adding additional materialization operations\ninto a query plan not only add additional traffic to the memory bus but more\nimportantly prevent the important cache- and register-locality opportunities\nresulting in high performance penalties.\n  In this paper we study a novel reuse model for intermediates, which caches\ninternal physical data structures materialized during query processing (due to\npipeline breakers) and externalizes them so that they become reusable for\nupcoming operations. We focus on hash tables, the most commonly used internal\ndata structure in main memory databases to perform join and aggregation\noperations. As queries arrive, our reuse-aware optimizer reasons about the\nreuse opportunities for hash tables, employing cost models that take into\naccount hash table statistics together with the CPU and data movement costs\nwithin the cache hierarchy. Experimental results, based on our HashStash\nprototype demonstrate performance gains of $2\\times$ for typical analytical\nworkloads with no additional overhead for materializing intermediates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2016 17:36:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-22"}

Second, we use Newtonian numerical hydrodynamics to study the\ndetailed evolution of the fallback debris from 120 disruptions randomly\nselected from the three-body ensemble (excluding only the most deeply\npenetrating encounters). We find that the overall morphology of the debris is\ngreatly altered by the presence of the second black hole, and the accretion\nrate histories display a wide range of behaviors, including order of magnitude\ndips and excesses relative to control simulations that include only one black\nhole. Complex evolution persists, in some cases, for many orbital periods of\nthe binary. We find evidence for power in the accretion curves on timescales\nrelated to the binary orbital period, though there is no exact periodicity. We\ndiscuss our results in the context of future wide-field surveys, and comment on\nthe prospects of identifying and characterizing the subset of events occurring\nin nuclei with binary SMBHs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2016 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 19:05:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

At present, the\nmodeling of these harmonics with Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes is extremely\nchallenging as it implies an accurate description of tens of harmonic orders on\na a broad range of angles. In particular, we show here that standard Finite\nDifference Time Domain (FDTD) Maxwell solvers used in most PIC codes partly\nfail to model Doppler harmonic generation because they induce numerical\ndispersion of electromagnetic waves in vacuum which is responsible for a\nspurious angular deviation of harmonic beams. This effect was extensively\nstudied and a simple toy-model based on Snell-Descartes law was developed that\nallows us to finely predict the angular deviation of harmonics depending on the\nspatio-temporal resolution and the Maxwell solver used in the simulations. Our\nmodel demonstrates that the mitigation of this numerical artifact with FDTD\nsolvers mandates very high spatio-temporal resolution preventing doing\nrealistic 3D simulations. We finally show that non dispersive pseudo-spectral\nanalytical time domain solvers can considerably reduce the spatio-temporal\nresolution required to mitigate this spurious deviation and should enable in\nthe the near future 3D accurate modeling on supercomputers in a realistic\ntime-to-solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2016 21:10:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2017 13:47:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

We\npropose a strategy for benchmarking randomized optimization algorithms that\nminimizes the expected total cost for obtaining a good solution with an optimal\nnumber of calls to the solver. To do so, rather than letting the objective\nfunction alone define a cost to be minimized, we introduce a further\ncost-per-call of the algorithm. We show that this problem can be formulated\nusing optimal stopping theory. The expected cost is a flexible figure of merit\nfor benchmarking probabilistic solvers that can be computed when the optimal\nsolution is not known, and that avoids the biases and arbitrariness that affect\nother measures. The optimal stopping formulation of benchmarking directly leads\nto a real-time, optimal-utilization strategy for probabilistic optimizers with\npractical impact. We apply our formulation to benchmark simulated annealing on\na class of MAX2SAT problems.

The BSs compress the received signals with\nWyner-Ziv coding and send the representation bits to the CP; the CP performs\nthe decoding of all the users' messages.

On the CP\ndecoding strategy design, this paper shows that under a sum fronthaul capacity\nconstraint, a generalized successive decoding strategy of the quantization and\nuser message codewords that allows arbitrary interleaved order at the CP\nachieves the same rate region as the optimal joint decoding. Further, it is\nshown that a practical strategy of successively decoding the quantization\ncodewords first, then the user messages, achieves the same maximum sum rate as\njoint decoding under individual fronthaul constraints.

Metric\nmeasure space involves a geometrical scalar $f$, dubbed as density function,\nwhich here appears as a conformal degree of freedom. In this framework, we\npresent conformally invariant field equations, the relevant identities and\ngeodesic equations. In metric measure space, the volume element and accordingly\nthe operators with integral based definitions are modified. For instance, the\ndivergence operator in this space differs from the Riemannian one. As a result,\na gravitational theory formulated in this space has a generalized second\nBianchi identity and a generalized conservation of energy-momentum tensor. It\nis shown how, by using the generalized identity for conservation of\nenergy-momentum tensor, one can obtain a conformally invariant geodesic\nequation. By comparison of the geodesic equations in metric measure space with\nthe Bohmian trajectories, in both relativistic and non-relativistic regimes, a\nrelation between density function $f$ and the quantum potential is proposed.\nThis suggests metric measure space to be considered as a suitable framework for\ngeometric description of Bohm's quantum mechanics. On the other hand, as it is\nknown, Weyl geometry is one of the main approaches to construct conformally\ninvariant gravitational models. Regarding the fact that the connection in the\nintegrable Weyl space is modified and in metric measure space remains the same\nas it is in the Riemann space, the mathematical analogy between these two\nspaces is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2016 10:48:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

The restriction applies to\nstrain energy functions $W$ that are explicit functions of the elastic\ndeformation gradient $\\mathbf{F}$ and initial stress $\\boldsymbol \\tau$, i.e.\n$W:= W(\\mathbf F, \\boldsymbol \\tau)$. The restriction is a consequence of\nenergy conservation and ensures that the predicted stress and strain energy do\nnot depend upon an arbitrary choice of reference configuration. We call this\nrestriction: initial stress reference independence (ISRI). It transpires that\nalmost all strain energy functions found in the literature do not satisfy ISRI,\nand may therefore lead to unphysical behaviour, which we illustrate via a\nsimple example. To remedy this shortcoming we derive three strain energy\nfunctions that do satisfy the restriction. We also show that using initial\nstrain (often from a virtual configuration) to model initial stress leads to\nstrain energy functions that automatically satisfy ISRI. Finally, we reach the\nfollowing important result: ISRI reduces the number of unknowns of the linear\nstress tensor of initially stressed solids. This new way of reducing the linear\nstress may open new pathways for the non-destructive determination of initial\nstresses via ultrasonic experiments, among others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Aug 2016 14:21:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2016 11:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-30"}

The effective surface of reflection\n(ESR) is defined as the loci of intersection of all beams, emanating from the\nsource at a given time, with the moving mirror. Fermat principle of least time\nis then applied to ESR and it is shown that, assuming the independence of speed\nof light, the result is identical with the relativistic reflection law. For a\nuniformly moving mirror ESR is a conic and the reflection law becomes a case of\nbi-angular equation of the conic, with the incident and reflected beams\ncoinciding with the focal rays of the conic. A short calculus-based proof for\naccelerating mirrors is also given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2016 18:29:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
