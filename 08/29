This paper attempts to reconcile some apparently\ndifferent views emerged after the 2008 crisis regarding the nature and the\nrelevance of contagion in financial networks. We develop a common framework\nencompassing several network contagion models and show that, regardless of the\nshock distribution and the network topology, precise ordering relationships on\nthe level of aggregate systemic losses hold among models. We argue that the\nextent of contagion crucially depends on the amount of information that each\nmodel assumes to be available to market players. Under no uncertainty about the\nnetwork structure and values of external assets, the well-known Eisenberg and\nNoe (2001) model applies, which delivers the lowest level of contagion. This is\ndue to a property of loss conservation: aggregate losses after contagion are\nequal to the losses incurred by those institutions initially hit by a shock.\nThis property implies that many contagion analyses rule out by construction any\nloss amplification, treating de facto an interconnected system as a single\naggregate entity, where losses are simply mutualised. Under higher levels of\nuncertainty, as captured for instance by the DebtRank model, losses become\nnon-conservative and get compounded through the network. This has important\npolicy implications: by reducing the levels of uncertainty in times of distress\n(e.g. by obtaining specific data on the network) policymakers would be able to\nmove towards more conservative scenarios. Empirically, we compare the magnitude\nof contagion across models on a sample of the largest European banks during the\nyears 2006-2016. In particular, we analyse contagion effects as a function of\nthe size of the shock and the type of external assets shocked.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2016 16:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

This is insightful for two reasons: First, we can define a curvature\nflow in order to asymptotically simplify a network and reduce it to its\nessentials. Second, using a construction of Bloch, which yields a discrete\nGauss-Bonnet theorem, we have the Euler characteristic of a network as a global\ncharacteristic.

Our results\nsuggest that in the Earth's upper mantle, water-rich geo-fluids transport a\nmajority of carbon in the form of rapidly interconverting CO$_3^{2-}$ and\nHCO$_3^-$ ions, not solvated CO$_2$(aq) molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2016 22:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-03"}

Recent studies have shown that\ndiffusion can fail on a network in which people are only active in \"bursts\",\nactive for a while and then silent for a while, but diffusion could succeed on\nthe same network if people were active in a more random Poisson manner. Those\nstudies generally consider models in which nodes are active according to the\nsame random timing process and then ask which timing is optimal.

Among 1029 reliable rotation periods obtained from\nthe surveys, we discovered one new large super-fast rotator, (40511) 1999 RE88,\nand other 18 candidates. (40511) 1999 RE88 is an S-type inner main-belt\nasteroid with a diameter of D = 1.9 +- 0.3 km, which has a rotation period of P\n= 1.96 +- 0.01 hr and a lightcurve amplitude of ~0.1 mag.

The base\nflow is parallel to the axis of the cylinder at inlet. The pressure gradient is\nzero in the streamwise direction. The base flow velocity profile is fully\nnon-parallel and non-similar in nature. The boundary layer grows continuously\nin the spatial directions. Linearized Navier-Stokes(LNS) equations are derived\nfor the disturbance flow quantities in the cylindrical polar coordinates. The\nLNS equations along with homogeneous boundary conditions forms a generalized\neigenvalues problem. Since the base flow is axisymmetric, the disturbances are\nperiodic in azimuthal direction. Chebyshev spectral collocation method and\nArnoldi's iterative algorithm is used for the solution of the general\neigenvalues problem. The global temporal modes are computed for the range of\nReynolds numbers and different azimuthal wave numbers. The largest imaginary\npart of the computed eigenmodes are negative and hence the flow is temporally\nstable. The spatial structure of the eigenmodes shows that the flow is\nconvectively unstable because the disturbance amplitudes grow in size and\nmagnitude when moving towards downstream. The global modes of axisymmetric\nboundary layer are more stable than that of 2D flat plate boundary layer at low\nReynolds number. However, at high Reynolds number they approaches to 2D flat\nplate boundary layer. Thus, the damping effect of transverse curvature is\nsignificant at low Reynolds number.

To achieve higher\nsystem efficiency, massive antenna deployment with tight coordination is one\npotential strategy for designing 5G systems, but has two types of associated\nsystem overhead. First is the synchronization overhead, which can be reduced by\nimplementing a cloud radio access network (CRAN)-based architecture design,\nthat separates the baseband processing and radio access functionality to\nachieve better system synchronization. Second is the overhead for acquiring\nchannel state information (CSI) of the users present in the system, which,\nhowever, increases tremendously when instantaneous CSI is used to serve\nhigh-mobility users. To serve a large number of users, a CRAN system with a\ndense deployment of remote radio heads (RRHs) is considered, such that each\nuser has a line-of-sight (LOS) link with the corresponding RRH. Since, the\ntrajectory of movement for high-mobility users is predictable; therefore,\nfairly accurate position estimates for those users can be obtained, and can be\nused for resource allocation to serve the considered users. The resource\nallocation is dependent upon various correlated system parameters, and these\ncorrelations can be learned using well-known \\emph{machine learning}\nalgorithms. This paper proposes a novel \\emph{learning-based resource\nallocation scheme} for time division duplex (TDD) based 5G CRAN systems with\ndense RRH deployment, by using only the users' position estimates for resource\nallocation, thus avoiding the need for CSI acquisition. This reduces the\noverall system overhead significantly, while still achieving near-optimal\nsystem performance; thus, better (effective) system efficiency is achieved.\n(See the paper for full abstract)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 08:33:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

We obtained optical images\nin the Halpha and OI 6300A lines at the unprecedented angular resolution of\n~0.03 arcsec, on which we have performed both continuum subtraction and\ndeconvolution, thereby deriving results that are consistent with each other.\nOur images reveal extended emission from both sources: a fairly compact and\npoorly collimated emission SW of the Herbig component and an extended\ncollimated and precessing jet from the FUor component. The compact emission\nfrom the Herbig star is compatible with a wide-angle wind and is possibly\nconnected to the recent outburst events shown by this component. The FUor jet\nis traced down to 70 mas (80 AU) from the source and is highly collimated with\na width of 26-48 AU at distances 100-200 AU, which is similar to the width of\njets from T Tauri stars. This strongly suggests that the same\nmagneto-centrifugal jet-launching mechanism also operates in FUors. The\nobserved jet wiggle can be modelled as originating from an orbital motion with\na period of 4.2 yr around an unseen companion with mass between 0.48 and 1\nMsun. The jet mass loss rate Mloss was derived from the OI luminosity and is in\nthe range 1E-8 and 1E-6 Msun/yr. This is the first direct Mloss measurement\nfrom a jet in a FUor. If we assume previous Macc estimates obtained through\nmodelling of the accretion disk, the derived range of Mloss would imply a very\nlow mass-ejection efficiency (Mloss/Macc < 0.02), which is lower than that\ntypical of T Tauri stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 09:58:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

Such algorithms exploit the local geometry of the\nparameter space, thus enabling chains to achieve a faster convergence rate when\nmeasured in number of steps. However, acquiring local geometric information can\noften increase computational complexity per step to the extent that sampling\nfrom high-dimensional targets becomes inefficient in terms of total\ncomputational time. This paper analyzes the computational complexity of\nmanifold Langevin Monte Carlo and proposes a geometric adaptive Monte Carlo\nsampler aimed at balancing the benefits of exploiting local geometry with\ncomputational cost to achieve a high effective sample size for a given\ncomputational cost. The suggested sampler is a discrete-time stochastic process\nin random environment. The random environment allows to switch between local\ngeometric and adaptive proposal kernels with the help of a schedule. An\nexponential schedule is put forward that enables more frequent use of geometric\ninformation in early transient phases of the chain, while saving computational\ntime in late stationary phases.

In this\npaper, using techniques from optics as well as gravity, we identify the energy\n$(\\omega)$ interval outside which $v_p \\le c$ for the field eigenstates\n$|\\gamma_{\\parallel} > $ and $ |\\phi > $, and stability of the system is\nrestored. The behavior of group velocity $v_g$ is also explored in the same\ncontext. We conclude by pointing out its possible astrophysical implications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 11:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

The principal results are as follows. GCs formed in a host dwarf galaxy\nwith a total mass of ~ 10^10 M_sun can merge to form a single nuclear GC before\nthe host is completely destroyed by the Galaxy, if they are massive (> 3*10^5\nM_sun) and if they are formed in the inner region (R<400 pc). The GC merger\nremnants can capture field stars during its spiral-in to nuclear regions. If\ntwo GCs are formed from star formation events separated by ~300 Myr in their\nhost dwarf, then the new GC formed from GC merging can have [Fe/H] spread of\n0.2 dex and [Ba/Fe] spread of 0.3 dex. GCs formed from GC merging can show\nvariety of internal abundance spreads depending on the details of their hosts'\nchemical evolution. We suggest that anomalous GCs were formed from GC merging\nthat occurred before the destruction of GC host dwarfs yet after\nself-enrichment processes responsible for the observed anti-correlations\nbetween chemical abundances of light elements.

In contrast to existing works, multiple D2D\nlinks are allowed to share the same channel, and the quality of service (QoS)\nrequirements for both the cellular and D2D links are enforced.

Many different techniques have been developed to produce those\nredshift estimates with increasing precision. Instead of providing a point\nestimate only, astronomers start to generate probabilistic density functions\n(PDFs) which should provide a characterisation of the uncertainties of the\nestimation.

The bluing of the continuum of the NW component along with the\nabsolute flux and color-variation of the system during the outburst suggests\nthat the outburst was caused by a complex interplay between a variation of the\nextinction in the line of sight of the NW component on one hand, and the\nemission of shocked regions close to the NW component on the other.

To obtain enough spectrum resources\nto meet its customer demands, the virtual operator can either sense for the\ntemporarily unused spectrum in a licensed band, or lease spectrum from a\nspectrum owner. Sensing is usually cheaper than leasing, but the amount of\navailable spectrum obtained by sensing is uncertain due to the primary users'\nactivities in the licensed band. Previous studies on spectrum investment\nproblems mainly considered the expected profit maximization problem of a\nrisk-neutral operator based on the expected utility theory (EUT). In reality,\nhowever, an operator's decision is influenced by not only the consideration of\nexpected profit maximization, but also the level of its risk preference. To\ncapture this tradeoff between these two considerations, we analyze the\noperator's optimal decision problem using the prospect theory from behavioral\neconomics, which includes EUT as a special case. The sensing and leasing\noptimal problem under prospect theory is non-convex and challenging to solve.\nNevertheless, by exploiting the unimodal structure of the problem, we are able\nto compute the unique global optimal solution. We show that comparing to an EUT\noperator, both the risk-averse and risk-seeking operator achieve a smaller\nexpected profit. On the other hand, a risk-averse operator can guarantee a\nlarger minimum possible profit, while a risk-seeking operator can achieve a\nlarger maximum possible profit. Furthermore, the tradeoff between the expected\nprofit and the minimum possible profit for a risk-averse operator is better\nwhen the sensing cost increases, while the tradeoff between the expected profit\nand the maximum possible profit for a risk-seeking operator is better when the\nsensing cost decreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 13:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

The methodology\nis a combination of a computationally efficient implementation of a\nparallel-in-space-time finite element solver coupled with a posteriori\nspace-time error estimates and a parallel mesh generator. This methodology\nenables, in principle, simultaneous adaptivity in both space and time (within\nthe block) domains.

Because of the\ntwo-fold degeneracy holes in the CuO plane cluster into four-particles\nresonance valence bond plaquettes bound with dopant ions. Such dipoles may\norder into charge-density waves (CDW) or stripes or form a disordered state\ndepending on doping and temperature. The lowest energy of the ordered system\ncorresponds to a local anti-ferroelectric ordering. The mobility of individual\ndisordered dipoles is very low at low temperatures and they prefer first to\nbind into dipole-dipole pairs. Electromagnetic radiation interacts strongly\nwith electric dipoles and when the sample is subjected to it the mobility\nchanges significantly. This leads to a fractal growth of dipolar clusters. The\nexistence of electric dipoles and CDW induce two phase transitions with\nincreasing temperature, melting of the ordered state and disappearance of the\ndipolar state. Ferroelectricity at low doping is a natural consequence of such\ndipole moments. We develop a theory based on two-level systems and\ndipole-dipole interaction to explain the behavior of the polarization as a\nfunction of temperature and electric field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 14:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

Understanding vortex\ndynamics is therefore of fundamental and technological importance, and the\ncompetition between the effects of thermal energy and energy barriers defined\nby material disorder is not completely understood. In particular, early\nmeasurements of thermally-activated vortex motion (creep) in iron-based\nsuperconductors unveiled fast rates (S) comparable to measurements of YBa2Cu3O7\n(YBCO).

Aims: given a set of aliased and noisy stars images\nfrom a telescope, we want to estimate well-resolved and noise-free PSFs at the\nobserved stars positions, in particular, exploiting the spatial correlation of\nthe PSFs across the FOV. Contributions: we introduce RCA (Resolved Components\nAnalysis) which is a noise-robust dimension reduction and super-resolution\nmethod based on matrix factorization.

Perspectives:\nRCA can be naturally extended to account for the wavelength dependency of the\nPSFs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 15:30:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 12:40:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Aug 2016 07:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-04"}
