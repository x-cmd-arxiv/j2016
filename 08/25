Ultimately, this implies that if an experiment cannot be reproduced\nindependently to some satisfactory level of precision, its value is essentially\nunquantifiable; put brutally, it is impossible to determine its scientific\nvalue. The burgeoning presence of software in most scientific work adds a new\nand particularly opaque layer of complexity [29]. In spite of much recent\ninterest in many scientific areas, emphasis remains more on procedures,\nstrictures and discussion [12, 14, 16, 29, 30, 37, 41], reflecting the\ninexperience of most scientific journals when it comes to software, rather than\nthe details of how computational reproducibility is actually achieved, for\nwhich there appear to be relatively few guiding examples [6, 10, 17].

If the system has an additional planet, as suggested by the\ndiscovery data, then it may perturb planet b's eccentricity and inclination,\npossibly driving those parameters to non-zero values, even in the presence of\nstrong tidal damping. We also model the internal evolution of the planet,\nevaluating the roles of different radiogenic abundances and tidal heating and\nfind that magnetic field generation is likely for billions of years. We find\nthat if planet b formed in situ, then it experienced 169 +/- 13 million years\nin a runaway greenhouse as the star contracted during its formation.

To avoid such comparisons, we\ndevelop an algebraic method for obtaining of saddle-splay elastic constant\n$K_{24}$.

Since this angle\ndepends on factors such as refractive indexes, curvature elastic constants,\nanchoring regime, surface anchoring strength and radius $R_{0}$, the\nmeasurement of $\\phi_{0}$ from the interference experiments involving two\ndifferent radii allows us to algebraically retrieve $K_{24}$.

Our results reveal a universal structure\nbehind noisy entanglement growth, and also provide simple new heuristics for\nthe `entanglement tsunami' in Hamiltonian systems without noise.

Loosely, this property entails that given the sizes of the sub-trees\nabove the root, these sub-trees are independent and their distributions only\ndepend upon their respective sizes. The laws of the elements of a Markov\nbranching family are characterised by a sequence of probability distributions\non the sets of integer partitions which describes how the sizes of the\nsub-trees above the root are distributed.\n  We prove that under some natural assumption on this sequence of\nprobabilities, when their sizes go to infinity, the trees converge in\ndistribution to an infinite tree which also satisfies the Markov branching\nproperty. Furthermore, when this infinite tree has a single path from the root\nto infinity, we give conditions to ensure its convergence in distribution under\nappropriate rescaling of its distance and counting measure to a self-similar\nfragmentation tree with immigration. In particular, this allows us to determine\nhow, in this infinite tree, the \"volume\" of the ball of radius $R$ centred at\nthe root asymptotically grows with $R$.\n  Our unified approach will allow us to develop various new applications, in\nparticular to different models of growing trees and cut-trees, and to recover\nknown results. An illustrative example lies in the study of Galton-Watson\ntrees: the distribution of a critical Galton-Watson tree conditioned on its\nsize converges to that of Kesten's tree when the size grows to infinity. If\nfurthermore, the offspring distribution has finite variance, under adequate\nrescaling, Kesten's tree converges to Aldous' self-similar CRT and the total\nsize of the $R$ first generations asymptotically behaves like $R^2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 20:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-26"}

It is known that\nproteins unfold upon addition of denaturants, adopting random coil structures.\nThe dependence of the radii of gyration on protein size in the folded and\nunfolded states obeys the same scaling laws as synthetic polymers. Thus, one\nmight surmise that the mechanism of collapse in proteins and polymers ought to\nbe similar. However, because the number of amino acids in single domain\nproteins is not significantly greater than about two hundred, it has not been\nresolved if the unfolded states of proteins are compact under conditions that\nfavor the folded states - a problem at the heart of how proteins fold. By\nadopting a theory used to derive polymer-scaling laws, we find that the\npropensity for the unfolded state of a protein to be compact is universal and\nis encoded in the contact map of the folded state. Remarkably, analysis of over\n2000 proteins shows that proteins rich in $\\beta$-sheets have greater tendency\nto be compact than $\\alpha$-helical proteins. The theory provides insights into\nthe reasons for the small size of single domain proteins and the physical basis\nfor the origin of multi-domain proteins.

An implication of our theory is that the evolution of\nnatural foldable sequences is guided by the requirement that for efficient\nfolding they should populate minimum energy compact states under folding\nconditions.

We present a short\nreview on the application of EDA in human-computer interaction.\n  This paper aims to serve as a primer for the novice, enabling rapid\nfamiliarisation with the latest core concepts.

After removing a high velocity\ncomponent (HVC) associated with microjets, we study the properties of the low\nvelocity component (LVC).

Both of\nthese winds play an important role in the evolution and dispersal of\nprotoplanetary material.\n  LVC emission is seen in all 30 stars with detected [O I] but only in 2 out of\neight with detected [S II] , so our analysis is largely based on the properties\nof the [O I] LVC. The LVC itself is resolved into broad (BC) and narrow (NC)\nkinematic components. Both components are found over a wide range of accretion\nrates and their luminosity is correlated with the accretion luminosity, but the\nNC is proportionately stronger than the BC in transition disks.\n  The FWHM of both the BC and NC correlates with disk inclination, consistent\nwith Keplerian broadening from radii of 0.05 to 0.5 AU and 0.5 to 5 AU,\nrespectively.

We study this magnetar's global energetics and the\nproperties of its particle wind or outflows. At a distance of $\\sim4\\;$kpc,\nSwift~J1834.9$-$0846 is located at the center of the supernova remnant (SNR)\nW41 whose radius is $\\sim 19\\;$pc, an order of magnitude larger than that of\nthe X-ray nebula ($\\sim2\\;$pc). The association with SNR W41 suggests a common\nage of $\\sim5-100\\;$kyr, while its spin-down age is $4.9$~kyr. A small natal\nkick velocity may partly explain why a wind nebula was detected around this\nmagnetar but not around other magnetars, most of which appear to have larger\nkick velocities and may have exited their birth SNR. We find that the GeV and\nTeV source detected by Fermi/LAT and H.E.S.S., respectively, of radius\n$\\sim11\\;$pc is most likely of hadronic origin. The dynamics and internal\nstructure of the nebula are examined analytically to explain the nebula's\ncurrent properties. Its size may naturally correspond to the\ndiffusion-dominated cooling length of the X-ray emitting $e^+e^-$ pairs. This\nmay also account for the spectral softening of the X-ray emission from the\nnebula's inner to outer parts. Analysis of the X-ray synchrotron nebula implies\nthat (i) the nebular magnetic field is $\\gtrsim 11\\;\\mu$G (and likely\n$\\lesssim30\\;\\mu$G), and (ii) the nebula is not powered predominantly by the\nmagnetar's quiescent spin-down-powered MHD wind, but by other outflows that\ncontribute most of its energy. The latter are most likely associated with the\nmagnetar's bursting activity, and possibly dominated by outflows associated\nwith its past giant flares. The energy source for the required outflows cannot\nbe the decay of the magnetar's dipole field alone, and is most likely the decay\nof its much stronger internal magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 00:49:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2016 11:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

Many approaches have been proposed to improve clustering performance by\nexploring and integrating heterogeneous information underlying different views.\nIn this paper, we propose a new multi-view fuzzy clustering approach called\nMinimaxFCM by using minimax optimization based on well-known Fuzzy c means. In\nMinimaxFCM the consensus clustering results are generated based on minimax\noptimization in which the maximum disagreements of different weighted views are\nminimized.

Since it seems\nunlikely that these tasks can be done with only $O(\\log n)$ initialized\nancillary qubits, our results give evidences that adding uninitialized\nancillary qubits increases the computational power of shallow quantum circuits\nwith only $O(\\log n)$ initialized ancillary qubits. Lastly, to understand the\nlimitations of uninitialized ancillary qubits, we focus on\nnear-logarithmic-depth quantum circuits with them and show the impossibility of\ncomputing the parity function on $n$ bits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 05:48:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2017 00:38:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 07:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

Here we analyse the\ncomplex radio structure of 3C 293 winged source hosted by the post-merger\ngalaxy, which uniquely displays a significant asymmetry between the sizes of\nthe two pairs of lobes, indicating that an episode of jet realignment took\nplace only very recently. Based on all the available radio data for 3C 293, we\nhave performed a detailed spectral modelling for the older and younger lobes in\nthe system. In this way we derived the lobes' ages and jet energetics, which we\nthen compared to the accretion power in the source. We found that the 200\nkpc-scale outer lobes of 3C 293 are ~60 Myr old and that jet activity related\nto the formation of the outer lobes ceased within the last Myr. Meanwhile, the\ninner 4 kpc-scale lobes, tilted by ~40 deg with respect to the outer ones, are\nonly about ~0.3 Myr old. The best model fits also return identical values of\nthe jet power supplying the outer and the inner structures. This power is of\nthe order of the maximum kinetic luminosity of a Blandford-Znajek jet for a\ngiven black hole mass and accretion rate, but only in the case of relatively\nlow values of a black hole spin, a~0.2. The derived jet energetics and\ntimescales, along with the presence of two optical nuclei in 3C 293, all\nprovide a strong support to the Lense-Thirring precession model in which the\nsupermassive black hole spin, and therefore the jet axis, flips rapidly owing\nto the interactions with the tilted accretion disk in a new tidal interaction\nepisode of the merging process. We further speculate that, in general, X-shape\nradio morphology forms in post-merger systems that are rich in cold molecular\ngas, and only host slowly spinning supermassive black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 09:13:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

This equation\nrepresents an ill-posed problem, thus solving it requires some kind of\nregularization. Our method is based on solving the equation on a so-called\ncompact set of functions and/or using Tikhonov's regularization. A priori\nconstraints on the unknown function, defining a compact set, are very loose and\ncan be set using simple physical considerations. Tikhonov's regularization on\nitself does not require any explicit a priori constraints on the unknown\nfunction and can be used independently of such constraints or in combination\nwith them. Various target degrees of smoothness of the unknown function may be\nset, as required by the problem at hand. The advantage of the method, apart\nfrom its flexibility, is that it gives uniform convergence of the approximate\nsolution to the exact solution, as the errors of input data tend to zero. The\nmethod is illustrated on several simulated models with known solutions.

In fact, some $\\Xi$'s have full widths of the order of even 10-20\nMeV when, in principle, they have a large phase space to decay to some open\nchannels. Such is the case of $\\Xi (1690)$, for which the width has been found\nto be of the order of 10 MeV in the latest {\\it BABAR} and BELLE data.

As a widely used approach,\nMarkov chain based models are based on a strong independence assumption. As two\nclassical neural network methods for modeling sequences, recurrent neural\nnetworks cannot well model short-term contexts, and the log-bilinear model is\nnot suitable for long-term contexts.

RLBL applies a\nrecurrent structure for modeling long-term contexts. It models several items in\neach hidden layer and employs position-specific transition matrices for\nmodeling short-term contexts. Moreover, considering continuous time difference\nin behavioral history is a key factor for dynamic prediction, we further extend\nRLBL and replace position-specific transition matrices with time-specific\ntransition matrices, and accordingly propose a Time-Aware Recurrent\nLog-BiLinear (TA-RLBL) model.

Polarization parameters suffer from bias in the\npresence of measurement noise. It is critical to take into account all the\ninformation available in the data in order to accurately derive these\nparameters. The goal of this paper is to characterize the bias on the\npolarization angle dispersion function that is used to study the spatial\ncoherence of the polarization angle. We characterize, for the first time, the\nbias on the conventional estimator of the polarization angle dispersion\nfunction (S hereafter) and show that it can be positive or negative depending\non the true value. Monte Carlo simulations are performed in order to explore\nthe impact of the noise properties of the polarization data, as well as the\nimpact of the distribution of the true polarization angles on the bias. We show\nthat in the case where the ellipticity of the noise in (Q, U) varies by less\nthan 10 percent, one can use simplified, diagonal approximation of the noise\ncovariance matrix. In other cases, the shape of the noise covariance matrix\nshould be taken into account in the estimation of S. We also study new\nestimators such as the dichotomic and the polynomial estimators. Though the\ndichotomic estimator cannot be directly used to estimate S, we show that, on\nthe one hand, it can serve as an indicator of the accuracy of the conventional\nestimator and, on the other hand, it can be used for deriving the polynomial\nestimator. We propose a method for determining the upper limit of the bias on\nthe conventional estimator of S.

We describe the latest classification scheme used to derive\nthe spectral type of CoRoT targets, which is based on broadband multi-colour\nphotometry. We assess the accuracy of this spectral classification for the\nfirst time. We find that the classification method performs better for stars\nthat were observed during the mission-dedicated photometric ground-based\ncampaigns.The luminosity class is wrong for less than 7% of the targets.\nGenerally, the effective temperature of stars classified as early type (O, B,\nand A) is overestimated.

We find that the median error on the effective\ntemperature is less than 5% for dwarf stars classified with a spectral later\nthan F0, but it is worse for earlier type stars, with up to 20\\% error for A\nand late-B dwarfs, and up to 70% for early-B and O-type dwarfs.

We then\nconsider an interacting gas under the BCS mean-field approximation for local\npairing, and study the pair-breaking mechanism that is induced by the Coriolis\neffects on superfluidity, where we calculate the critical rotation frequencies\nboth for the onset of pair breaking and for the complete destruction of\nsuperfluidity in the system. In particular, by comparing the results of\nfully-quantum-mechanical Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach with those of\nsemi-classical local-density approximation, we construct extensive phase\ndiagrams for a wide-range of parameter regimes in the trap where the\naforementioned competition may, e.g., favor an outer normal edge that is\ncompletely phase separated from the central superfluid core by vacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 12:29:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2016 15:57:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

However, interstellar O$_2$ gas is notoriously difficult to detect\nand has only been observed in one potential precursor of a solar-like system.\nHere, the chemical and physical origin of O$_2$ in comets is investigated using\nsophisticated astrochemical models. Three origins are considered: i) in dark\nclouds, ii) during forming protostellar disks, and iii) during luminosity\noutbursts in disks. The dark cloud models show that reproduction of the\nobserved abundance of O$_2$ and related species in comet 67P/C-G requires a low\nH/O ratio facilitated by a high total density ($\\geq 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$), and a\nmoderate cosmic ray ionisation rate ($\\leq 10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$) while a\ntemperature of 20 K, slightly higher than the typical temperatures found in\ndark clouds, also enhances the production of O$_2$.

However, depending on the type of\nmask used, experiments have shown that vacancy-related substrate modification\ncan be inferred tens of microns away from the edge of the mask used to define\nthe implanted region. This could be due to fast diffusion of vacancies from the\nimplanted area during annealing or to a geometric effect related to ion\nscattering around the mask edges.

This leads to the creation of persistent\nsurface structures (spots) in stars with sufficiently weak winds as a result of\nthe radiative diffusion. These spots become evident in spectroscopic and\nphotometric variability. This type of variability is not expected in stars with\nstrong winds, where the wind inhibits the radiative diffusion. Therefore, a\nweak photometric variability of the magnetic Of?p star HD 191612 is attributed\nto the light absorption in the circumstellar clouds. We study the nature of the\nphotometric variability of HD 191612. We assume that the variability results\nfrom variable wind blanketing induced by surface variations of the magnetic\nfield tilt and modulated by stellar rotation. We used our global kinetic\nequilibrium (NLTE) wind models with radiative force determined from the\nradiative transfer equation in the comoving frame (CMF) to predict the stellar\nemergent flux. Our models describe the stellar atmosphere in a unified manner\nand account for the influence of the wind on the atmosphere. The models are\ncalculated for different wind mass-loss rates to mimic the effect of magnetic\nfield tilt on the emergent fluxes. We integrate the emergent fluxes over the\nvisible stellar surface for individual rotational phases, and calculate the\nrotationally modulated light curve of HD 191612. The wind blanketing that\nvaries across surface is able to explain a part of the observed light\nvariability in this star. The mechanism is able to operate even at relatively\nlow mass-loss rates. The remaining variability is most likely caused by the\nflux absorption in circumstellar clouds. The variable wind blanketing is an\nadditional source of the light variability in massive stars. The presence of\nthe rotational light variability may serve as a proxy for the magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 14:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

We bring two\nideas concerning the Jacobian Conjecture: First, we conjecture that for all\n$n$, the degree of the field extension $\\mathbb{C}(F(x_1),\\ldots,F(x_n))\n\\subseteq \\mathbb{C}(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ is less than or equal to $d^{n-1}$, where\n$d$ is the minimum of the degrees of the $F(x_i)$'s. If this conjecture is\ntrue, then the generalized Jacobian Conjecture is true. Second, we suggest to\nreplace in some known theorems the assumption on the degrees of the $F(x_i)$'s\nby a similar assumption on the degrees of the minimal polynomials of the\n$x_i$'s over $\\mathbb{C}(F(x_1)\\ldots,f(x_n))$; this way we obtain some\nanalogous results to the known ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 19:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-07"}
