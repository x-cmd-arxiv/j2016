We focus on the case where there are dark states\nbecause the atom is driven on a \"type-II\" system where the angular momentum of\nthe excited state, $F'$, is less than or equal to that of the ground state,\n$F$. For these systems we find that the force in a three-dimensional light\nfield has very different behaviour to its one dimensional counterpart. This\ndiffers from the more commonly used \"type-I\" systems ($F'=F+1$) where the 1D\nand 3D behaviours are similar. Unlike type-I systems where, for red-detuned\nlight, both Doppler and sub-Doppler forces damp the atomic motion towards zero\nvelocity, in type-II systems in 3D, the Doppler force and polarization gradient\nforce have opposite signs. As a result, the atom is driven towards a non-zero\nequilibrium velocity, $v_{0}$, where the two forces cancel. We find that\n$v_{0}^{2}$ scales linearly with the intensity of the light and is fairly\ninsensitive to the detuning from resonance. We also discover a new\nmagneto-optical force that alters the normal MOT force at low magnetic fields\nand whose influence is greatest in the type-II systems. We discuss the\nimplications of these findings for the laser cooling and magneto-optical\ntrapping of molecules where type-II transitions are unavoidable in realising\nclosed optical cycling transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2016 16:04:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 17:11:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

We show that this extension to logics is strongly\nhelped if we submerge the elementary logical calculus in a matrix-vector\nformalism that naturally includes a kind of fuzzy-logic. In this way, guided by\nthe laws of matrix algebra, we can construct compact representations for the\nderivatives and the integrals of logical functions. Inside this\nsemantic-algebraic calculus, we obtain expressions for the derivatives of some\nof the basic logical operations and show the general way to obtain the\nderivatives of any well-formed formula of propositional calculus.

In addition using the logical derivatives we show\nthat relatively complex formulas can collapse in simple expressions that reveal\nclearly their hidden logical meaning. The search for the antiderivatives\nproduces naturally an integral calculus. Within this logical formalism an\nindefinite integral can always be found for any logical expression. Moreover,\nparticular integrals can be constructed based on detachment properties that\nlead to logical expressions of growing complexity.

This\nexpression is given in terms of a reverse waterfilling formula over the\nasymptotic spectral distribution of a sequence of finite-rank operators\nassociated with the optimal estimator of the Wiener process from its samples.\nWe show that the ratio between this expression and the standard distortion rate\nfunction of the Wiener process, describing the optimal tradeoff between bitrate\nand distortion without a sampling constraint, is only a function of the number\nof bits per sample. For example using one bit per sample on average, the\nexpected distortion is approximately 1.2 times the standard distortion rate\nfunction, indicating a performance loss of about 20% due to sampling. We next\nconsider the distortion when the continuous-time process is estimated from the\noutput of an encoder that is optimal with respect to the discrete-time samples.\nWe show that while the latter is strictly greater than the distortion under\noptimal encoding, the ratio between the two does not exceed 1.027.

Many previous authors have noted that stars in our\nuniverse would have difficulty producing carbon and other heavy elements in the\nabsence of the well-known $^{12}$C resonance at 7.6 MeV. This resonance is\nnecessary because $^8$Be is unstable in our universe, so that carbon must be\nproduced via the triple alpha reaction to achieve the requisite abundance.\nAlthough a moderate change in the energy of the resonance (200 -- 300 keV) will\nindeed affect carbon production, an even smaller change in the binding energy\nof beryllium ($\\sim100$ keV) would allow $^8$Be to be stable. A stable isotope\nwith $A=8$ would obviate the need for the triple alpha process in general, and\nthe $^{12}$C resonance in particular, for carbon production. This paper\nexplores the possibility that $^8$Be can be stable in other universes. Simple\nnuclear considerations indicate that bound states can be realized, with binding\nenergy $\\sim0.1-1$ MeV, if the fundamental constants vary by a $\\sim {\\rm\nfew}-10$ percent. In such cases, $^8$Be can be synthesized through helium\nburning, and $^{12}$C can be produced later through nuclear burning of\nberyllium. This paper focuses on stellar models that burn helium into\nberyllium; once the universe in question has a supply of stable beryllium,\ncarbon production can take place during subsequent evolution in the same star\nor in later stellar generations. Using both a semi-analytic stellar structure\nmodel as well as a state-of-the-art stellar evolution code, we find that viable\nstellar configurations that produce beryllium exist over a wide range of\nparameter space. Finally, we demonstrate that carbon can be produced during\nlater evolutionary stages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2016 17:58:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2016 22:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-08"}

They arise not only in band theory, but also in connection with\ntensor-network states for non-interacting fermion systems, and for flat-band\nHamiltonians with strictly short-range hopping matrix elements. In earlier\nwork, it was proved that for general complex band structures (vector bundles)\nor general complex Hamiltonians---that is, class A in the ten-fold\nclassification of Hamiltonians and band structures---a set of\ncompactly-supported Wannier functions can span the vector bundle only if the\nbundle is topologically trivial, in any dimension $d$ of space, even when use\nof an overcomplete set of such functions is permitted.

Due to the different participating length scales the\nmodelling of the short-range interactions in three dimensions plays a special\nrole. We review different approaches for the latter and elaborate that for\nmulti-configurational computational strategies finite range potentials are\nadequate resulting in the need of large grids to resolve the relevant length\nscales. This results in computational challenges which include also the\nexponential scaling of complexity with the number of atoms. We show that the\nrecently developed ab-initio Multi-Layer Multi-Configurational Time- Dependent\nHartee method for Bosons (ML-MCTDHB) [J. Chem.

This is the strongest global\nconstraint compatible with walking. For an initial value of the wave function\ncorresponding to a localized configuration at the origin, the probability law\nof the first leg of the centipede can be expressed in closed form in terms of\nBessel functions. The dispersion relation and the group velocities are worked\nout exactly. Their maximal group velocity goes to zero when $N$ goes to\ninfinity, which is in contrast with the behaviour of group velocities of\nquantum centipedes without global constraint, which were recently shown by\nKrapivsky, Luck and Mallick to give rise to ballistic spreading of extremal\nwave-front at non-zero velocity in the large-$N$ limit.

First, we consider current\nfluctuations of the stationary asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), run\nfor some long time $T$, and show that they are of order $T^{1 / 3}$ along a\ncharacteristic line. Upon scaling by $T^{1 / 3}$, we establish that these\nfluctuations converge to the long-time height fluctuations of the stationary\nKPZ equation, that is, to the Baik-Rains distribution. This result has long\nbeen predicted under the context of KPZ universality and in particular extends\nupon a number of results in the field, including the work of Ferrari and Spohn\nin 2005 (who established the same result for the TASEP), and the work of Balazs\nand Seppalainen in 2010 (who established the $T^{1 / 3}$ scaling for the\ngeneral ASEP).\n  Second, we introduce a class of translation-invariant Gibbs measures that\ncharacterizes a one-parameter family of slopes for an arbitrary ferroelectric,\nsymmetric six-vertex model.

A\nparticularly exciting application of CS is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),\nwhere CS significantly speeds up scan time by requiring far fewer measurements\nthan standard MRI techniques. Such a reduction in sampling time leads to less\npower consumption, less need for patient sedation, and more accurate images.\nThis accuracy increase is especially pronounced in pediatric MRI where patients\nhave trouble being still for long scan periods. Although such gains are already\nsignificant, even further improvements can be made by utilizing past MRI scans\nof the same patient. Many patients require repeated scans over a period of time\nin order to track illnesses and the prior scans can be used as references for\nthe current image. This allows samples to be taken adaptively, based on both\nthe prior scan and the current measurements.\n  Work by Weizman has shown that so-called reference based adaptive-weighted\ntemporal Compressed Sensing MRI (LACS-MRI) requires far fewer samples than\nstandard Compressed Sensing (CS) to achieve the same reconstruction\nsignal-to-noise ratio (RSNR). The method uses a mixture of reference-based and\nadaptive-sampling. In this work, we test this methodology by using various\nadaptive sensing schemes, reconstruction methods, and image types. We create a\nthorough catalog of reconstruction behavior and success rates that is\ninteresting from a mathematical point of view and is useful for practitioners.\nWe also solve a grayscale compensation toy problem that supports the\ninsensitivity of LACS-MRI to changes in MRI acquisition parameters and thus\nshowcases the reliability of LACS-MRI in possible clinical situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2016 19:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

This is due to confusion\nintroduced by the coarse angular resolution of the single-dish telescope and\ncould lead to the inferred halo masses being significantly overestimated. We\ninvestigate the extent to which this bias affects the measurement of the\ncorrelation function of SMGs when it is derived via a cross-correlation with a\nmore abundant galaxy population. We find that the blending bias is essentially\nthe same as in the auto-correlation case and conclude that the best way to\nreduce its effects is to calculate the angular correlation function using SMGs\nin narrow redshift bins. Blending bias causes the inferred host halo masses of\nthe SMGs to be overestimated by a factor of $\\sim6$ when a redshift interval of\n$\\delta z=3$ is used. However, this reduces to a factor of $\\sim2$ for $\\delta\nz=0.5$.

Here we study this relationship for a Milky Way chemo-dynamical\nmodel and show that equivalence between MAPs and mono-age populations exists\nonly for the high-[alpha/Fe] tail, where the chemical evolution curves of\ndifferent Galactic radii are far apart. At lower [alpha/Fe]-values a MAP is\ncomposed of stars with a range in ages, even for small observational\nuncertainties and a small MAP bin size. Due to the disk inside-out formation,\nfor these MAPs younger stars are typically located at larger radii, which\nresults in negative radial age gradients that can be as large as 2 Gyr/kpc.\nPositive radial age gradients can result for MAPs at the lowest [alpha/Fe] and\nhighest [Fe/H] end.

Owing to the fact that the scale-independent leptonic decay constant of\na scalar meson constituted from equal-mass valence-constituents vanishes, it is\nfound that the PDA of a given scalar system possesses one more zero than that\nof an analogous vector meson. Consequently, whereas the mean light-front\nrelative momentum of the valence-constituents within a vector meson is zero,\nthat within a scalar meson is large, an outcome which hints at a greater role\nfor light-front angular momentum in systems classified as $P$-wave in quantum\nmechanical models.

From time to time such systems undergo large-amplitude\nbrightenings. The most spectacular eruptions, over $10^4$ times in brightness,\noccur in classical novae and are caused by a thermonuclear runaway on the\nsurface of the white dwarf. Such eruptions are thought to recur on timescales\nof $10^4-10^6$. In between, the system's properties depend primarily on the\nmass-transfer rate: if it is lower than a $10^{-9} M_{\\odot}$/year, the\naccretion becomes unstable and the matter is dumped onto the white dwarf during\nquasi-periodic dwarf nova outbursts. The hibernation hypothesis predicts that\nnova eruptions strongly affect the mass-transfer rate, keeping it high for\ncenturies after the event. Subsequently, the mass-transfer rate should\nsignificantly decrease for $10^3-10^6$ years, starting the hibernation phase.\nAfter that the nova awakes again - with accretion returning to the pre-eruption\nlevel and leading to a new nova explosion. The hibernation model predicts\ncyclical evolution of CVs through phases of high and low mass-transfer. The\ntheory gained some support from the discovery of ancient nova shells around\ndwarf novae Z Cam and AT Cnc, but direct evidence for considerable\nmass-transfer changes prior, during and after nova eruptions has not hitherto\nbeen found. Here we report long-term observations of the classical nova V1213\nCen (Nova Cen 2009) covering its pre- and post-eruption phases.

K2-95 is a faint\n($\\mathrm{Kp = 15.5\\,mag}$) $\\mathrm{M3.0\\pm0.5}$ dwarf from K2's Campaign 5\nwith an effective temperature of $\\mathrm{3471 \\pm 124\\,K}$, approximately\nsolar metallicity and a radius of $\\mathrm{0.402 \\pm 0.050 \\,R_\\odot}$. We\ndetected a transiting planet with a radius of $\\mathrm{3.47^{+0.78}_{-0.53} \\,\nR_\\oplus}$ and an orbital period of 10.134 days. We combined photometry,\nmedium/high-resolution spectroscopy, adaptive optics/speckle imaging and\narchival survey images to rule out any false positive detection scenarios,\nvalidate the planet, and further characterize the system. The planet's radius\nis very unusual as M-dwarf field stars rarely have Neptune-sized transiting\nplanets. The comparatively large radius of K2-95b is consistent with the other\nrecently discovered cluster planets K2-25b (Hyades) and K2-33b (Upper\nScorpius), indicating systematic differences in their evolutionary states or\nformation. These discoveries from K2 provide a snapshot of planet formation and\nevolution in cluster environments and thus make excellent laboratories to test\ndifferences between field-star and cluster planet populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2016 20:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

While\nboth approaches have been valued for their intrinsic mathematical interest, it\nis not clear how they relate to each other, and to what extent they can be used\nas practical tools for inference of phylogenetic trees.\n  In this paper, by focusing on the special case of binary sequence data and\nquartets of taxa, we are able to view these two different polynomial-based\napproaches within a common framework. To motivate the discussion, we present\nthree desirable statistical properties that we argue any phylogenetic method\nshould satisfy: (1) sensible behaviour under reordering of input sequences; (2)\nstability as the taxa evolve independently according to a Markov process; and\n(3) ability to detect if the conditions of a continuous-time process are\nviolated.

We underline that the vulnerability exploited by the KYE\nattack is proper of SDN and is not present in legacy networks. To address the\nKYE attack, we also propose an active defense countermeasure based on network\nflows obfuscation, which considerably increases the complexity for a successful\nattack.

The physical conditions for\ngrain evolution are taken from hydrodynamical simulations of giant molecular\nclouds in a Milky Way-like spiral galaxy. We improve the treatment of dust\ngrowth by accretion in the ISM to investigate the role of the\ntemperature-dependent sticking coefficient and ion-grain interactions. From\ndetailed observational data on the gas-phase Si abundances [Si/H]_{gas}\nmeasured in the local Galaxy, we derive a relation between the average\n[Si/H]_{gas} and the local gas density n(H) which we use as a critical\nconstraint for the models. This relation requires a sticking coefficient that\ndecreases with the gas temperature. The synthetic relation constructed from the\nspatial dust distribution reproduces the slope of -0.5 of the observed relation\nin cold clouds. This slope is steeper than that for the warm medium and is\nexplained by the dust growth. We find that it occurs for all adopted values of\nthe minimum grain size a_{min} from 1 to 5nm. For the classical cut-off of\na_{min}=5 nm, the ion-grain interactions result in longer growth timescales and\nhigher [Si/H]_{gas} than the observed values. For a_{min} below 3 nm, the\nion-grain interactions enhance the growth rates, steepen the slope of\n[Si/H]_{gas}-n(H) relation and provide a better match to observations. The\nrates of dust re-formation in the ISM by far exceed the rates of dust\nproduction by stellar sources as expected from simple evolution models. After\nthe cycle of matter in and out of dust reaches a steady state, the dust growth\nbalances the destruction operating on similar timescales of 350 Myr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Aug 2016 21:03:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

Under bed load conditions,\nthe granular bed may become unstable, generating ripples and dunes.

Strikingly, while the temperature dependence\nof few layered WTe$_{2}$ showed clear metallic tendency in the fresh state,\ndegraded devices first exhibited a re-entrant insulating behavior, and finally\nentered a fully insulating state. Correspondingly, a crossover from parabolic\nto linear magnetoresistance, and finally to weak anti-localization was seen.\nReal-time Raman scattering measurement, together with transmission electron\nmicroscopy studies done before and after air degradation of atomically thin\nWTe$_{2}$ further confirmed that the material gradually form amorphous islands.\nIt thus leads to localized electronic states and explains the low temperature\nCoulomb gap observed in transport measurements.

Thus, it is generally thought to be destructive, obscuring signals and\ninterfering with function. However, early in the 20th century, mechanical\nengineers found that mechanisms inducing additional vibration in mechanical\nsystems could prevent sticking and hysteresis. This so-called \"dither\" noise\nwas later introduced in an entirely different context at the advent of digital\ninformation transmission and recording in the early 1960s. Ironically, the\naddition of noise allows one to preserve information that would otherwise be\nlost when the signal or image is digitized. As we shall see, the benefits of\nadded noise in these contexts are closely related to the phenomenon which has\ncome to be known as stochastic resonance, the original version of which\nappealed to noise to explain how small periodic fluctuations in the\neccentricity of the earth's orbit might be amplified in such a way as to bring\nabout the observed periodic transitions in climate from ice age to temperate\nage and back. These noise-induced transitions have since been invoked to\nexplain a wide array of biological phenomena, including the foraging and\ntracking behavior of ants. Many biological phenomena, from foraging to gene\nexpression, are noisy, involving an element of randomness. In this paper, we\nillustrate the general principles behind dithering and stochastic resonance\nusing examples from image processing, and then show how the constructive use of\nnoise can carry over to systems found in nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2016 01:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-10"}

It is not difficult to show that such a modification does not change the\ncomputational power as long as the noise is not too strong so that errors are\ncorrectable with high probability, since if Merlin encodes the witness state in\na quantum error-correction code and sends it to Arthur, Arthur can correct the\nerror caused by the noisy channel. If we further assume that Arthur can do only\nsingle-qubit measurements, however, the problem becomes nontrivial, since in\nthis case Arthur cannot do the universal quantum computation by himself. In\nthis paper, we show that such a restricted complexity class is still equivalent\nto QMA. To show it, we use measurement-based quantum computing: honest Merlin\nsends the graph state to Arthur, and Arthur does fault-tolerant\nmeasurement-based quantum computing on the noisy graph state with only\nsingle-qubit measurements. By measuring stabilizer operators, Arthur also\nchecks the correctness of the graph state. Although this idea itself was\nalready used in several previous papers, these results cannot be directly used\nto the present case, since the test that checks the graph state used in these\npapers is so strict that even honest Merlin is rejected with high probability\nif the channel is noisy. We therefore introduce a more relaxed test that can\naccept not only the ideal graph state but also noisy graph states that are\nerror-correctable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2016 01:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-18"}

A solution to these\nequations is obtained, in the asymptotic limit that the height of the\nrectangular electrode is much smaller than its width, that shows the\nmacroscopic deformation is one-dimensional. The confinement of macroscopic\ndeformations to one dimension is used to obtain boundary conditions on the\nmicroscopic problem for the deformations in a 'unit cell' centered on a single\nelectrode particle. The resulting microscale problem is solved using numerical\n(finite element) techniques. The two different forcing mechanisms are found to\ncause distinctly different patterns of deformation within the microstructure.\nSwelling of the binder induces stresses that tend to lead to binder\ndelamination from the electrode particle surfaces in a direction parallel to\nthe current collector, whilst cycling causes stresses that tend to lead to\ndelamination orthogonal to that caused by swelling.

The simulations show how these soft interactions make the dynamics\nmore heterogenous compared to the disordered Lorentz gas and lead to strong\nnon-Gaussian fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2016 04:55:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

Here, we\nstudy the spin-boson model as a prototype. By utilizing the Majorana- Fermion\nrepresentation together with the polaron transformation, we establish a\ntheoretical approach to analyze Green's functions of the spin-boson model. In\ncontrast to conventional perturbation theories either in the tunneling energy\nor in the system-bath coupling strength, the proposed scheme gives reliable\nresults over wide regimes of the coupling strength, bias, as well as\ntemperature. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, we consider the\nsusceptibility as well as the symmetrized spin correlation function (SSCF)\nwhich can be expressed in terms of Green's functions. Thorough investigations\nare made on systems embedded in Ohmic or sub-Ohmic bosonic baths. We found the\nso-obtained SSCF is the same as that of the non-interacting blip approximation\n(NIBA) in unbiased systems while it is applicable for a wider range of\ntemperature in the biased systems compared with the NIBA. We also show that a\nprevious perturbation result is recovered as a weak coupling limit of the\nso-obtained SSCF. Furthermore, by studying the quantum criticality of the\nsusceptibility, we confirm the validity of the quantum-toclassical mapping in\nthe whole sub-Ohmic regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2016 05:10:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-24"}

However, this\napproach can potentially result in excessive fetching of large volumes of data\nand cause heavy loads on radio-access networks. To solve this problem, the\nnovel technique of live prefetching is proposed in this paper that seamlessly\nintegrates the task-level computation prediction and prefetching within the\ncloud-computing process of a large program with numerous tasks. The technique\navoids excessive fetching but retains the feature of leveraging prediction to\nreduce the program runtime and mobile transmission energy. By modeling the\ntasks in an offloaded program as a stochastic sequence, stochastic optimization\nis applied to design fetching policies to minimize mobile energy consumption\nunder a deadline constraint. The policies enable real-time control of the\nprefetched-data sizes of candidates for future tasks.

In this paper we propose\ndual time-scale coordination for the Volt-VAR control scheme, corresponding to\nslow and fast control. In the case of slow control, a robust voltage and\nreactive power optimization model is developed. This guarantees that subsequent\nfast controls can maintain the system's voltage security if the uncertain\nparameters vary within predefined limits.

With the aim of understanding these measurements, we carry out\nnumerical simulations of wave propagation through sunspots.

However, in the\nscenario of data compression, its efficiency and popularity are hindered. It is\nbecause of the fact that encoding sparsely distributed coefficients may consume\nmore bits for representing the index of nonzero coefficients. Therefore,\nintroducing an accurate rate-constraint in sparse coding and dictionary\nlearning becomes meaningful, which has not been fully exploited in the context\nof sparse representation. According to the Shannon entropy inequality, the\nvariance of a Gaussian distributed data bounds its entropy, indicating the\nactual bitrate can be well estimated by its variance. Hence, a Globally\nVariance-Constrained Sparse Representation (GVCSR) model is proposed in this\nwork, where a variance-constrained rate term is introduced to the optimization\nprocess. Specifically, we employ the Alternating Direction Method of\nMultipliers (ADMM) to solve the non-convex optimization problem for sparse\ncoding and dictionary learning, both of them have shown the state-of-the-art\nrate-distortion performance for image representation. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate the potential of applying the GVCSR algorithm in the practical\nimage set compression, where the optimized dictionary is trained to efficiently\nrepresent the images captured in similar scenarios by implicitly utilizing\ninter-image correlations.

The effect of perturbation waves have been\ninvestigated experimentally and found to confirm the essentials of the theory.\nHowever, there is no unanimity about the origin of these perturbation waves.\nRecently, the idea of recoil capillary waves as an important source of the\nperturbation waves has been emphasized. The recoil of the end point of the\nremaining continuous jet at its breakup point is considered to travel upward as\na recoil capillary wave which gets reflected at the mouth of the nozzle from\nwhich the jet originates. The reflected capillary wave travels along the jet\ndownward with its Doppler shifted wavelength as a perturbation wave. We set up\nan experiment to directly verify the existence and effect of the recoil\ncapillary waves and present some preliminary results of our experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2016 10:04:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

We further report on the spectroscopic identification of\nseven, possibly eight member stars of Peg III. The Ca II triplet lines of the\nbrightest member stars indicate that Peg III contains stars with metallicity as\nlow as [Fe/H]=$-2.55\\pm0.15$ dex. Peg III has a systemic velocity of $-222.9\n\\pm 2.6$ km s$^{-1}$ and a velocity dispersion of $5.4^{+3.0}_{-2.5}$ km\ns$^{-1}$. The inferred dynamical mass within the half-light radius is\n$1.4^{+3.0}_{-1.1} \\times 10^6\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ and the mass-to-light ratio\n$\\rm{M/L}$$_{V} = 1470^{+5660}_{-1240}$ $\\rm{M_{\\odot}/L_{\\odot}}$, providing\nfurther evidence that Peg III is a dwarf galaxy satellite. We find that Peg III\nand another distant dwarf satellite Pisces II lie relatively close to each\nother ($\\Delta d_{spatial}=43\\pm19$ kpc) and share similar radial velocities in\nthe Galactic standard-of-rest frame ($\\Delta v_{GSR}=12.3\\pm3.7$ km s$^{-1}$).\nThis suggests that they may share a common origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2016 12:03:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 23:31:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

The\nslope of the radial iron gradient of the young red-giant population\n($-0.058\\pm0.008$ [stat.] $\\pm0.003$ [syst.] dex/kpc) is consistent with recent\nCepheid measurements. For stellar populations with ages of $1-4$ Gyr the\ngradient is slightly steeper, at a value of $-0.066\\pm0.007\\pm0.002$ dex/kpc,\nand then flattens again to reach a value of $\\sim-0.03$ dex/kpc for stars with\nages between 6 and 10 Gyr. Our results are in good agreement with a\nstate-of-the-art chemo-dynamical Milky-Way model in which the evolution of the\nabundance gradient and its scatter can be entirely explained by a non-varying\nnegative metallicity gradient in the interstellar medium, together with stellar\nradial heating and migration. We also offer an explanation for why\nintermediate-age open clusters in the Solar Neighbourhood can be more\nmetal-rich, and why their radial metallicity gradient seems to be much steeper\nthan that of the youngest clusters. Already within 2 Gyr, radial mixing can\nbring metal-rich clusters from the innermost regions of the disc to\nGalactocentric radii of 5 to 8 kpc. We suggest that these outward-migrating\nclusters may be less prone to tidal disruption and therefore steepen the local\nintermediate-age cluster metallicity gradient. Our scenario also explains why\nthe strong steepening of the local iron gradient with age is not seen in field\nstars. In the near future, asteroseismic data from the K2 mission will allow\nfor improved statistics and a better coverage of the inner-disc regions,\nthereby providing tighter constraints on the evolution of the central parts of\nthe Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2016 12:59:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 21:16:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 12:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

First, multiple DNNs are established, each of which corresponds\nto a different reverberation time 60 (RT60) in a setup step. Also, each model\nin the ensemble of DNN acoustic models is further jointly trained, including\nboth feature mapping and acoustic modeling, where the feature mapping is\ndesigned for the dereverberation as a front-end. In a testing phase, the two\nmost likely DNNs are chosen from the DNN ensemble using maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) probabilities, computed in an online fashion by using maximum likelihood\n(ML)-based blind RT60 estimation and then the posterior probability outputs\nfrom two DNNs are combined using the ML-based weights as a simple average.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to\nsubstantial improvements in speech recognition accuracy over the conventional\nDNN baseline systems under diverse reverberant conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2016 14:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-18"}

Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL), as an\nagent-environment interaction problem, has brought further attention to\nplanning methods. Generally in RL, one can assume a generative model, e.g.\ngraphical models, for the environment, and then the task for the RL agent is to\nlearn the model parameters and find the optimal strategy based on these learnt\nparameters. Based on environment behavior, the agent can assume various types\nof generative models, e.g. Multi Armed Bandit for a static environment, or\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP) for a dynamic environment. The advantage of these\npopular models is their simplicity, which results in tractable methods of\nlearning the parameters and finding the optimal policy. The drawback of these\nmodels is again their simplicity: these models usually underfit and\nunderestimate the actual environment behavior. For example, in robotics, the\nagent usually has noisy observations of the environment inner state and MDP is\nnot a suitable model.\n  More complex models like Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)\ncan compensate for this drawback. Fitting this model to the environment, where\nthe partial observation is given to the agent, generally gives dramatic\nperformance improvement, sometimes unbounded improvement, compared to MDP. In\ngeneral, finding the optimal policy for the POMDP model is computationally\nintractable and fully non convex, even for the class of memoryless policies.\nThe open problem is to come up with a method to find an exact or an approximate\noptimal stochastic memoryless policy for POMDP models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2016 15:20:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-18"}

This is a secondary hair, meaning that it does\nnot endow the black hole with new quantum numbers. It rather consists of a\nnon-trivial scalar field profile of fixed intensity which turns out to be\nregular everywhere outside and on the horizon and, provided the cosmological\nconstant is negative, behaves at large distance in a way compatible with the\nAnti-de Sitter (AdS) asymptotic. In this paper, we review the main features of\nthese hairy black hole solutions, such as their geometrical and thermodynamical\nproperties. The conformal coupling to matter in dimension $D>4$ in principle\nincludes higher-curvature terms. These couplings are obtained from the Lovelock\naction through the Stueckelberg strategy. As a consequence, the resulting\nscalar-tensor theory exhibits a self-duality under field redefinition that\nresembles T-duality. Through this field redefinition, the matter content of the\ntheory transforms into a Lovelock action for a dual geometry. Since the hairy\nblack holes only exist for special relations between the dual Lovelock coupling\nconstants, it is natural to compare those relations with the causality bounds\ncoming from AdS/CFT.

The design of energy management\nschemes is challenging, one of the reasons being that energy management is a\nmultistage problem where decisions are not all made at the same timescale and\nmust account for the variability during real-time operation. The joint dispatch\nof slow- and fast-timescale controls in a smart distribution grid is considered\nhere. The substation voltage, the energy exchanged with a main grid, and the\ngeneration schedules for small diesel generators have to be decided on a slow\ntimescale; whereas optimal photovoltaic inverter setpoints are found on a more\nfrequent basis. While inverter and looser voltage regulation limits are imposed\nat all times, tighter bus voltage constraints are enforced on the average or in\nprobability, thus enabling more efficient renewable integration. Upon\nreformulating the two-stage grid dispatch as a stochastic convex-concave\nproblem, two distribution-free schemes are put forth. An average dispatch\nalgorithm converges provably to the optimal two-stage decisions via a sequence\nof convex quadratic programs. Its non-convex probabilistic alternative entails\nsolving two slightly different convex problems and is numerically shown to\nconverge. Numerical tests on a real-world distribution feeder verify that both\nnovel data-driven schemes yield lower costs over competing alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2016 14:49:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-19"}
