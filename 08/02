More precisely, we show that there\nis a universal set of constant-size objects that, when added to any unknown\nhole-free polyomino shape, produces an unbounded number of copies of that shape\n(plus constant-size garbage objects). The constant-size objects can be easily\nconstructed from a constant number of individual tile types using a constant\nnumber of preprocessing self-assembly steps. Our construction uses the\nwell-studied 2-Handed Assembly Model (2HAM) of tile self-assembly, in the\nsimple model where glues interact only with identical glues, allowing glue\nstrengths that are either positive (attractive) or negative (repulsive), and\nconstant temperature (required glue strength for parts to hold together). We\nalso require that the given shape has specified glue types on its surface, and\nthat the feature size (smallest distance between nonincident edges) is bounded\nbelow by a constant. Shape replication necessarily requires a self-assembly\nmodel where parts can both attach and detach, and this construction is the\nfirst to do so using the natural model of negative/repulsive glues (also\nstudied before for other problems such as fuel-efficient computation); previous\nreplication constructions require more powerful global operations such as an\n\"enzyme\" that destroys a subset of the tile types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 16:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-02"}

Recent\nterrestrial experiments constrain both its value and slope at nuclear\nsaturation density, however, its value at higher densities is unknown. Assuming\na Free Fermi-gas (FFG) model for the kinetic symmetry energy, the high-density\nextrapolation depends on a single parameter, the density dependence of the\npotential symmetry energy. The Correlated Fermi-gas (CFG) model improves on the\nFFG model by including the effects of short-range, correlated, high-momentum,\nnucleons in nuclear matter. Using the CFG model for the kinetic symmetry energy\nalong with constraints from terrestrial measurements leads to a much softer\ndensity dependence for the potential symmetry energy. Purpose: Examine the\nability of the FFG and CFG models to describe NS observables that are directly\nsensitive to the symmetry energy at high-density. Specifically, examine the\nability of the CFG model, with its softer density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy, to describe a two solar-mass NS. Methods: Using a Bayesian\nanalysis of NS observables we compare the CFG and FFG models and examine the\nresulting parameters in the NS EOS and the density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy. Results: Despite the large difference in the density\ndependence of the potential part of the symmetry energy, both models can\ndescribe the NS data and support a two solar-mass NS. The different density\ndependences has only a small effect on the NS EOS. Conclusions: While sensitive\nto the high-density values of the symmetry energy, NS observables alone are not\nenough to distinguish between the CFG and FFG models. This indicates that the\nNS EOS, obtain from Bayesian analysis of NS observables, is robust and is not\nsensitive to the exact nuclear model used for the kinetic symmetry energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 16:36:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-04"}

A significant part of the penumbral magnetic field returns below the\nsurface in the very deep photosphere.

We study the topology of the penumbral magnetic field in the lower\nphotosphere, focusing on regions where it returns below the surface.\n  Methods. We analyzed 71 spectropolarimetric datasets from Hinode and from the\nGREGOR infrared spectrograph. We inferred the quality and polarimetric accuracy\nof the infrared data after applying several reduction steps. Techniques of\nspectral inversion and forward synthesis were used to test the detection\nalgorithm.

In the infrared, the number of reversed-polarity Stokes V\nprofiles is smaller by a factor of two than in the visible.

This modification of the collinear factorization formula goes\nbeyond the leading power and thus a natural question arises if such cutoff can\nbe extracted from a formalism which takes into account power corrections. In\nthis work, we consider the High Energy Factorization (HEF) valid at small $x$\nand a new model, based on a similar principle to HEF, which in addition has a\nlimit respecting the Dokshitzer-Dyakonov-Troyan formula for the dijet momentum\ndisbalance spectrum. Minijet cross section and its suppression is then analyzed\nin two ways. First, we study minijets directly in the low-$p_T$ region, and\ndemonstrate that higher twist corrections do generate suppression of the\ninclusive jet production cross section though these effects are not leading to\nthe increase of the cutoff with incident energy. Second, we consider hard\ninclusive dijet production where Multi Parton Interactions (MPIs) with minijets\nproduce power corrections. We introduce an observable constructed from\ndifferential cross section in the ratio $\\tau$ of dijet disbalance to the\naverage dijet $p_T$ and demonstrate that the $\\tau>1$ region is sensitive to\nthe cutoff $p_{T0}$ in the MPI minijet models. The energy dependence of the\ncutoff is reflected in the energy dependence of the bimodality coefficient $b$\nof the $\\tau$ distribution. We compare $b$ calculated from $\\mathsf{pythia}$,\nwhere one can conveniently control MPIs by the program parameters, and HEF for\na few unintegrated gluon distributions (UGDs). We find that the energy\ndependence of $b$ is very sensitive to the particular choice of UGD and in some\nmodels it resembles predictions of the Monte Carlo models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 18:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

The former produces a deterministic dynamics while the latter a\nstochastic dynamics. A more general stochastic setting considers propensity\nparameters for updating each node. Stochastic Discrete Dynamical Systems (SDDS)\nis a modeling framework that considers two propensity parameters for updating\neach node and uses one when the update has a positive impact on the variable,\nthat is, when the update causes the variable to increase its value, and uses\nthe other when the update has a negative impact, that is, when the update\ncauses it to decrease its value.

We will then argue that the present\n\"quantum omelette\" is being presently cooked in two opposite directions: the\nfirst scrambling ontological problems with epistemological solutions and the\nsecond scrambling epistemic approaches with ontological questions. A good\nexample of the former is a new type of argumentation strategy attempting to\njustify the use of decoherence, namely, the \"For All Practical Purposes\"\n(shortly known as FAPP) type of justification. We will argue that 'FAPP-type\nsolutions' remain, at best, epistemological answers which not only escape the\nontological questions at stake -regarding the quantum to classical limit- but\nalso turn the original problem completely meaningless.

The first is considering that the\ntrajectory can be approximated with piece-wise linear joins. We develop a novel\nscalable approach in terms of the number of sensors required. Robustness\nanalysis is done with respect to uncertainties in the timing recordings by the\nradiation sensors. We show that in the noise free case, a minimum of three\nsensors will suffice to recover one piece of the linear join with probability\none, even in the absence of knowledge of the speed and statistics of the\nradiation source.

The most popular family of random graph null models, called\nconfiguration models, are defined as uniform distributions over a space of\ngraphs with a fixed degree sequence. Commonly, properties of an empirical\nnetwork are compared to properties of an ensemble of graphs from a\nconfiguration model in order to quantify whether empirical network properties\nare meaningful or whether they are instead a common consequence of the\nparticular degree sequence. In this work we study the subtle but important\ndecisions underlying the specification of a configuration model, and\ninvestigate the role these choices play in graph sampling procedures and a\nsuite of applications. We place particular emphasis on the importance of\nspecifying the appropriate graph labeling (stub-labeled or vertex-labeled)\nunder which to consider a null model, a choice that closely connects the study\nof random graphs to the study of random contingency tables. We show that the\nchoice of graph labeling is inconsequential for studies of simple graphs, but\ncan have a significant impact on analyses of multigraphs or graphs with\nself-loops. The importance of these choices is demonstrated through a series of\nthree vignettes, analyzing network datasets under many different configuration\nmodels and observing substantial differences in study conclusions under\ndifferent models.

Although the unitary time evolution ensuing from a pure initial\nstate maintains the system globally at zero entropy, at long time after the\nquench local properties are captured by an appropriate statistical ensemble\nwith non zero thermodynamic entropy, which can be interpreted as the\nentanglement accumulated during the dynamics. Therefore, understanding the\npost-quench entanglement evolution unveils how thermodynamics emerges in\nisolated quantum systems.

We show that, first, these aperiodic\nmetamaterials exhibit long-range holographic order, where the 2D pixelated\nsurface texture dictates the 3D interior voxel arrangement. Second, they act as\nprogrammable shape shifters, morphing into spatially complex but predictable\nand designable shapes when uniaxially compressed. Third, their mechanical\nresponse to compression by a textured surface reveals their ability to perform\nsensing and pattern analysis.

Electrostatic interactions are\ntypically modeled using Ewald based methods, which have become one of the\ncornerstones upon which many other methods for the numerical computation of\nelectrostatic interactions are based. However, their use with charge\ndistributions rather than point charges requires the inclusion of ansatz for\nthe solutions of the Poisson equation, since there is no exact solution known\nfor smeared out charges. The interest for incorporating electrostatic\ninteractions at the scales of length and time that are relevant for the study\nthe physics of soft condensed matter has increased considerably. Using\nmesoscale simulation techniques, such as dissipative particle dynamics (DPD),\nallows us to reach longer time scales in numerical simulations, without\nabandoning the particulate description of the problem. The main problem with\nincorporating electrostatics into DPD simulations is that DPD particles are\nsoft and those particles with opposite charge can form artificial clusters of\nions. Here we show that one can incorporate the electrostatic interactions\nthrough Ewald sums with point charges in DPD if larger values of coarse\ngraining degree are used, where DPD is truly mesoscopic. Using point charges\nwith larger excluded volume interactions the artificial formation of ionic\npairs with point charges can be avoided, and one obtains correct predictions.\nWe establish ranges of parameters useful for detecting boundaries where\nartificial formation of ionic pairs occurs. Lastly, using point charges we\npredict the scaling properties of polyelectrolytes in solvents of varying\nquality and obtain predictions that are in agreement with calculations that use\nother methods, and with recent experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 21:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

We\nfind that future direct detection experiments will be able to probe most of the\nparameter space of these models for $\\mathcal{O}(100-200)$ GeV DM and lightest\nmediator mass $\\lesssim \\mathcal{O}(5\\%)$ larger than the DM mass. The direct\ndetection prospects dwindle for larger DM mass and larger mass gap between the\nDM and the lightest mediator mass, although appreciable regions are still\nprobed for $\\mathcal{O}(200)$ GeV DM and lightest mediator mass $\\lesssim\n\\mathcal{O}(20\\%)$ larger than the DM mass. The direct detection bounds are\nalso attenuated near certain \"blind spots\" in the parameter space, where the\nanapole moment is severely suppressed due to cancellation of different terms.\nWe carefully study these blind spots and the associated $Fermi$-LAT signals in\nthese regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 23:40:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 14:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-07"}

Moreover, the strategies\nyielding those Nash equilibria have a special structure: when one of the agents\ndeviate from the equilibrium, all the others form a coalition that will enforce\na retaliation mechanism that punishes the deviant agent.

However, for the circularly shaped\ntransmitter filter, GFDM provides limited performance gain of sidelobe\nsuppression. In this paper, we propose a scheme, called time-domain\nN-continuous GFDM (TD-NC-GFDM), to reduce the discontinuities caused by the\nGFDM transmitter filter and achieve promising sidelobe suppression gain. Based\non time-domain N-continuous orthogonal frequency devision multiplexing\n(TD-NC-OFDM), TD-NC-GFDM signal can be obtained by superposing a smooth signal\nin the time domain. The smooth signal is linearly combined by basis signals in\na new basis set related to GFDM transmitter waveform. To eliminate the\ninterference caused by the smooth signal, two solutions are proposed. Firstly,\na signal recovery algorithm for reception is adopted at the cost of high\ncomplexity. Thus, secondly, to simplify the TD-NC-GFDM receiver, a\nlow-interference TD-NC-GFDM is proposed by redesigning the basis signals. A\nsoft truncation of the basis signals in TD-NC-GFDM is given to design the basis\nsignals in the low-interference TD-NC-GFDM. Then, the smooth signal is aligned\nwith the beginning of the GFDM symbol and is added in the front part of the\nGFDM symbol. Moreover, for a big number of GFDM subsymbols, theoretical\nanalysis proves that the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) in TD-NC-GFDM is\nmuch higher than that in TD-NC-OFDM. Simulation results shows that TD-NC-GFDM\ncan obtain significant sidelobe suppression performance as well as the\nlow-interference TD-NC-GFDM, which can achieve the same BER performance as the\noriginal GFDM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 00:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-30"}

By posing queries\nto and receiving messages from the quantum simulator, classical computing\ndevices update the control parameters until an optimal control solution is\nfound.

To counter this problem a number of methods for detecting these fake\nreviews, termed opinion spam, have been proposed. However, to date, many of\nthese methods focus on analysis of review text, making them unsuitable for many\nreview systems where accom-panying text is optional, or not possible. Moreover,\nthese approaches are often computationally expensive, requiring extensive\nresources to handle text analysis over the scale of data typically involved.\n  In this paper, we consider opinion spammers manipulation of average ratings\nfor products, focusing on dif-ferences between spammer ratings and the majority\nopinion of honest reviewers. We propose a lightweight, effective method for\ndetecting opinion spammers based on these differences. This method uses\nbinomial regression to identify reviewers having an anomalous proportion of\nratings that deviate from the majority opinion. Experiments on real-world and\nsynthetic data show that our approach is able to successfully iden-tify opinion\nspammers. Comparison with the current state-of-the-art approach, also based\nonly on ratings, shows that our method is able to achieve similar detection\naccuracy while removing the need for assump-tions regarding probabilities of\nspam and non-spam reviews and reducing the heavy computation required for\nlearning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 02:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

To facilitate an analytical treatment we\nconsider the case of a one-dimensional interface. The effective boundary\ncondition at the contact line is determined by a dimensionless parameter that\nencodes the relative importance of thermal energy and substrate energy at the\nmicroscopic scale.

In order to illustrate the effect of\nphonon and electron excitations on the free binding energy of defect clusters,\nfirst-principles calculations are performed for vacancy-solute pairs as well as\nvacancy and Cu dimers, trimers, and quadromers in bcc Fe.

To quickly respond to defend these attacks,\nauthorized parities (e.g., the National Security Agency of the USA) need to\nintervene in the malicious communication links over the air. This paper\ninvestigates this emerging wireless communication intervention problem at the\nphysical layer. Unlike prior studies using jamming to disrupt or disable the\ntargeted wireless communications, we propose a new physical-layer spoofing\napproach to change their communicated information. Consider a fundamental\nthree-node system over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, in which\nan intermediary legitimate spoofer aims to spoof a malicious communication link\nfrom Alice to Bob, such that the received message at Bob is changed from\nAlice's originally sent message to the one desired by the spoofer. We propose a\nnew symbol-level spoofing scheme, where the spoofer designs the spoofing signal\nvia exploiting the symbol-level relationship between each original\nconstellation point of Alice and the desirable one of the spoofer. In\nparticular, the spoofer aims to minimize the average spoofing-symbol-error-rate\n(SSER), which is defined as the average probability that the symbols decoded by\nBob fail to be changed or spoofed, by designing its spoofing signals over\nsymbols subject to the average transmit power constraint. By considering two\ncases when Alice employs the widely-used binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) and\nquadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK) modulations, we obtain the respective\noptimal solutions to the two average SSER minimization problems. Numerical\nresults show that the symbol-level spoofing scheme with optimized transmission\nachieves a much lower average SSER, as compared to other benchmark schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 08:06:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

Charge\nconservation is constrained by a Lagrange multiplier (the chemical potential).\nBlack hole charge fluctuations are expected owing to continuous absorption and\nemission of particles by the black hole. For black holes much more massive than\n$10^{16} g$ , these fluctuations are exponentially suppressed. For black holes\nlighter than this, the Schwarzschild black hole is unstable under charge\nfluctuations for almost every possible size of the confining vessel. The\nstability regime and the fluctuations are calculated through the second\nderivative of the entropy with respect to the charge. The expression obtained\ncontains many puzzling terms besides the expected thermodynamical fluctuations:\nterms corresponding to instabilities that do not depend on the specific value\nof charge of the charge carriers and one of them depends on Newton's constant\ninstead.

These solutions might\ninfluence the energy transfer and the anomalous scaling properties empirically\nobserved for the forced and viscous models. In this paper we present a study of\nthe instantonic solutions for a set of four shell models of turbulence based on\nthe exact decomposition of the Navier-Stokes equations in helical eigenstates.\nWe find that depending on the helical structure of each model, instantons are\nchaotic or regular. Some instantonic solutions tend to recover mirror symmetry\nfor scales small enough. Models that have anomalous scaling develop regular non\nchaotic instantons. Conversely, models that have non anomalous scaling in the\nstationary regime are those that have chaotic instantons. The direction of the\nenergy carried by each single instanton tends to coincide with the direction of\nthe energy cascade in the stationary regime. Finally, we find that whenever the\nsmall-scale stationary statistics is intermittent, the instanton is less steep\nthan the dimensional Kolmogorov scaling, independently of whether or not it is\nchaotic.

The features may be\ninterpreted as a convolution of a lateral profile of an emitter with a\nmicroscopic radiation pattern of a non-negligible angular extent. We study a\nmodel which assumes that such an extended microbeam of the X-mode curvature\nradiation is spreading the radiation polarised at a fixed position angle within\nan interval of pulse phase. The model is capable of interpreting the strongly\ndissimilar polarisation of double notches in PSR B1821-24A (for which we\npresent new polarisation data from the Nancay Radio Telescope) and PSR\nJ0437-4715. It also explains a step-like change in PA observed at the\nbifurcated trailing component in the profile of J0437-4715. A generic form of\nthe modelled PA distortion is a zigzag-shaped wiggle, which in the presence of\nthe second polarisation mode (O mode) can be magnified or transformed into a W-\nor U-shaped deflection of a total net PA. The model's efficiency in\ninterpreting dissimilar polarisation effects provides further credence to the\nstream-based (fan-beam) geometry of pulsar emission. It also suggests that the\nmicrobeam width may not always be assumed negligible in comparison with the\nangular scale of emissivity gradients in the emission region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 11:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

Specifically, it first learns a rough\nspatial map of high-level representations by means of convolutions and then\nlearns to upsample them back to the original resolution by deconvolutions.

As a remedy, we provide a formal\nframework that generalises the existing approaches and we establish a soundness\ncriterion that explains for which programs the approach is sound.\n  This article is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 12:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

An\nimportant task in the online evaluation of rankers is using implicit user\nfeedback for inferring preferences between rankers. Interleaving methods have\nbeen found to be efficient and sensitive, i.e. they can quickly detect even\nsmall differences in quality. It has recently been shown that multileaving\nmethods exhibit similar sensitivity but can be more efficient than interleaving\nmethods. This paper presents empirical results demonstrating that existing\nmultileaving methods either do not scale well with the number of rankers, or,\nmore problematically, can produce results which substantially differ from\nevaluation measures like NDCG. The latter problem is caused by the fact that\nthey do not correctly account for the similarities that can occur between\nrankers being multileaved. We propose a new multileaving method for handling\nthis problem and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms existing\nmethods, in some cases reducing errors by as much as 50%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 12:29:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

To understand the effect of the three-dimensional temperature and\ndensity structure in the solar atmosphere on the formation of the He i 1083 nm\nline. Methods.

The emergent\nintensity in the He i 1083 nm is set by the source function and the opacity in\nthe upper chromosphere. The former is dominated by scattering of photospheric\nradiation and does not vary much with spatial location. The latter is\ndetermined by the photonionisation rate in the He i ground state continuum, as\nwell as the electron density in the chromosphere. The spatial variation of the\nflux of ionising radiation is caused by the spatially-structured emissivity of\nthe ionising photons from material at T = 100 kK in the transition region. The\nhotter coronal material produces more ionising photons, but the resulting\nradiation field is smooth and does not lead to small-scale variation of the UV\nflux.

In some applications, we work with a\nsubset of $b$ interesting suffixes, which are stored in the so-called sparse\nsuffix tree. Because the size of this structure is $\\Theta(b)$, it is natural\nto seek a construction algorithm using only $O(b)$ words of space assuming\nread-only random access to the text. We design a linear-time Monte Carlo\nalgorithm for this problem, hence resolving an open question explicitly stated\nby Bille et al. [TALG 2016]. The best previously known algorithm by I et al.\n[STACS 2014] works in $O(n\\log b)$ time. Our solution proceeds in $n/b$ rounds;\nin the $r$-th round, we consider all suffixes starting at positions congruent\nto $r$ modulo $n/b$. By maintaining rolling hashes, we lexicographically sort\nall interesting suffixes starting at such positions, and then we merge them\nwith the already considered suffixes.

To this aim, we start from a first\nattempt that proposed extending the syntax of logic programs with so-called\ncausal literals. These causal literals are expressions that can be used in rule\nbodies and allow inspecting the derivation of some atom $A$ in the program with\nrespect to some query function $\\phi$. Depending on how these query functions\nare defined, we can model different types of causal relations such as\nsufficient, necessary or contributory causes, for instance. The initial\napproach was specifically focused on monotonic query functions. This was enough\nto cover sufficient cause-effect relations but, unfortunately, necessary and\ncontributory are essentially non-monotonic.

Over history money\nhas become increasingly abstract, it used to be hardware, gold coins and the\nlike, now it is mostly software, data structures located in banks. Here I\npropose the logical conclusion of the abstraction of money: to use as money the\nmost general form of information - computer programs. The key advantage that\nusing programs for money (program-money) adds to the technology of money is\nagency. Program-money is active and thereby can fully participate in economics\nas economic agents. I describe the three basic technologies required to\nimplement program-money: computational languages/logics to unambiguously\ndescribe the actions and interactions of program-money; computational\ncryptography to ensure that only the correct actions and interactions are\nperformed; and a distributed computational environment in which the money can\nexecute. I demonstrate that most of the technology for program-money has\nalready been developed. The adoption of program-money transfers responsibility\nfrom human economic agents to money itself and has great potential economic\nadvantages over the current passive form of money. For example in\nmicroeconomics, adding agency to money will simplify the exchange of ownership,\nensure money is only used legally, automate the negotiation and forming of\ncontracts, etc. Similar advantages occur in macroeconomics, where for example\nthe control of the money supply could be transferred from central banks to\nmoney. It is also possible to envisage money that is not owned by any external\nhuman agent or corporation. One motivation for this is to force economic\nsystems to behave more rationally and/or more like a specific economic theory,\nthereby increasing the success of economic forecasting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 15:55:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

The cross sections of SEUs and Multi Cell Upsets (MCUs) for 3D SRAM are\nsimulated by using heavy ions with different energies and LETs. The results\nshow that the sensitivity of different die of 3D SRAM has obvious discrepancies\nat low LET. Average percentage of MCUs of 3D SRAMs rises from 17.2% to 32.95%\nwhen LET increases from 42.19 MeV cm2/mg to 58.57MeV cm2/mg. As for a certain\nLET, the percentage of MCUs shows a notable distinction between face-to-face\nstructure and back-to-face structure. For back-to-face structure, the\npercentage of MCUs increases with the deeper die. However, the face-to-face die\npresents the relatively low percentage of MCUs. The comparison of SEU cross\nsections for planar SRAMs and experiment data are conducted to indicate the\neffectiveness of our simulation method. Finally, we compare the upset cross\nsections of planar process and 3D integrated SRAMs. Results demonstrate that\nthe sensitivity of 3D SRAMs is not more than that of planar SRAMs and the 3D\nstructure can be become a great potential application for aerospace and\nmilitary domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 05:26:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-05"}

So far, direct observation of\nradiation-induced diffusion of defect clusters in bulk materials has not been\ndemonstrated yet. This finding was made possible by low angle annular dark\nfield (LAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with\nnon-rigid registration technique to remove sample instability, which enables\natomic resolution imaging of small migrating defect clusters.

A transformation is found to balance the\ncontrollability and observability covariances in order to determine which\nstates have the greatest contribution to the input-output behavior.

The scheme is studied in the\ncontext of the state-of-the-art 3.5G system i.e. the High Speed Downlink Packet\nAccess (HSDPA) which enhances 3G UMTS to support high-speed packet switched\nservices. Unlike earlier systems, UMTS-evolved systems from HSDPA and beyond\nincorporate mechanisms such as packet scheduling and HARQ in the base station\nnecessitating data buffering at the air interface. This introduces a potential\nbottleneck to end-to-end communication. Hence, buffer management at the air\ninterface is crucial for end-to-end QoS support of multimedia services with\nmultiplexed parallel diverse flows such as video and data in the same end-user\nsession. The dynamic buffer management scheme for HSDPA multimedia sessions\nwith aggregated real-time and non real-time flows is investigated via extensive\nHSDPA simulations. The impact of the scheme on end-to-end traffic performance\nis evaluated with an example multimedia session comprising a real-time\nstreaming flow concurrent with TCP-based non real-time flow. Results\ndemonstrate that the scheme can guarantee the end-to-end QoS of the real-time\nstreaming flow, whilst simultaneously protecting the non real-time flow from\nstarvation resulting in improved end-to-end throughput performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 14:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-18"}

QPQH is based on a\nmodified Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm which we call the\nlocal BFGS and a new basin hopping strategy based on a Chinese idiom: alternate\ntension with relaxation. Starting from a random initial layout, we apply the\nlocal BFGS algorithm to reach a local minimum layout. The local BFGS algorithm\nfully utilizes the neighborhood information of each circle to considerably\nspeed up the running time of the gradient descent process, and the efficiency\nis very apparent for large scale instances. When yielding a local minimum\nlayout, the new basin-hopping strategy is to shrink the container size to\ndifferent extent to generate several new layouts. Experimental results indicate\nthat the new basin-hopping strategy is very efficient, especially for a type of\nlayout with comparatively dense packing in the center and comparatively sparse\npacking around the boundary of the container. We test QPQH on the instances of\nn = 1,2,...,320, and obtain 66 new layouts which have smaller container sizes\nthan the current best-known results reported in literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 04:18:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 02:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-14"}
