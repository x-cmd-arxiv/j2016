Recently, there has been renewed interest in the\ninformation contained in their classical configurations, whose computation do\nnot require full knowledge of the wavefunction. Inspired by holographic\nduality, we investigated the entanglement properties of the classical\nconfigurations (snapshots) of the Potts model by introducing an ansatz ensemble\nof random fractal images. By virtue of the central limit theorem, our ansatz\naccurately reproduces the entanglement spectra of actual Potts snapshots\nwithout any fine-tuning of parameters or artificial restrictions on ensemble\nchoice. It provides a microscopic interpretation of the results of previous\nstudies, which established a relation between the scaling behavior of snapshot\nentropy and the critical exponent. More importantly, it elucidates the role of\nensemble disorder in restoring conformal invariance, an aspect previously\nignored. Away from criticality, the breakdown of scale invariance leads to a\nrenormalization of the parameter $\\Sigma$ in the random fractal ansatz, whose\nvariation can be used as an alternative determination of the critical exponent.\nWe conclude by providing a recipe for the explicit construction of fractal unit\ncells consistent with a given scaling exponent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2016 16:47:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2016 04:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

However,\nsubstituting the wired network with a wireless network - which in this context\nis referred to as an Avionics Wireless Network (AWN) - brings a number of new\nchallenges related to assurance, reliability, and security. The AWN thus has to\nensure that it provides at least the required security and safety levels\noffered by the equivalent wired network. Providing a wired-equivalent security\nfor a communication channel requires the setting up of a strong, secure\n(encrypted) channel between the entities that are connected to the AWN. In this\npaper, we propose three approaches to establish such a secure channel based on\n(i) pre-shared keys, (ii) trusted key distribution, and (iii) key-sharing\nprotocols.

In existing deployments, these networks are based on a wired\ntechnology, which supports these requirements. Furthermore, this technology\nsimplifies the security management of the network since certain assumptions can\nbe safely made, including the inability of an attacker to access the network,\nand the fact that it is almost impossible for an attacker to introduce a node\ninto the network. The proposal for Avionics Wireless Networks (AWNs), currently\nunder development by multiple aerospace working groups, promises a reduction in\nthe complexity of electrical wiring harness design and fabrication, a reduction\nin the total weight of wires, increased customization possibilities, and the\ncapacity to monitor otherwise inaccessible moving or rotating aircraft parts\nsuch as landing gear and some sections of the aircraft engines. While providing\nthese benefits, the AWN must ensure that it provides levels of safety that are\nat minimum equivalent to those offered by the wired equivalent. In this paper,\nwe propose a secure and trusted channel protocol that satisfies the stated\nsecurity and operational requirements for an AWN protocol. There are three main\nobjectives for this protocol. First, the protocol has to provide the assurance\nthat all communicating entities can trust each other, and can trust their\ninternal (secure) software and hardware states. Second, the protocol has to\nestablish a fair key exchange between all communicating entities so as to\nprovide a secure channel. Finally, the third objective is to be efficient for\nboth the initial start-up of the network and when resuming a session after a\ncold and/or warm restart of a node. The proposed protocol is implemented and\nperformance measurements are presented based on this implementation.

Following a simple feedback model, the\nresults confirm the presence of a positive eddy-jet feedback in the annular\nmode dynamics, with a feedback strength of 0.137 day$^{-1}$ in the idealized\nGCM. Statistical methods proposed by earlier studies to quantify the feedback\nstrength are evaluated against results from the LRF. It is argued that the\nmean-state-independent eddy forcing reduces the accuracy of these statistical\nmethods because of the quasi-oscillatory nature of the eddy forcing. A new\nmethod is proposed to approximate the feedback strength as the regression\ncoefficient of low-pass filtered eddy forcing onto low-pass filtered annular\nmode index, which converges to the value produced by the LRF when timescales\nlonger than 200 days are used for the low-pass filtering.

In order to address the DC-Checking problem, in [Comin and Rizzi,\nTIME 2015] we introduced epsilon-DC (a refined, more realistic, notion of DC),\nand provided an algorithmic solution to it. The epsilon-DC notion is\ninteresting per se, and the epsilon-DC-Checking algorithm in [Comin and Rizzi,\nTIME 2015] rests on the assumption that the reaction-time satisfies epsilon >\n0; leaving unsolved the question of what happens when epsilon = 0. In this\nwork, we introduce and study pi-DC, a sound notion of DC with an instantaneous\nreaction-time (i.e. one in which the planner can react to any observation at\nthe same instant of time in which the observation is made). Firstly, we\ndemonstrate by a counter-example that pi-DC is not equivalent to 0-DC, and that\n0-DC is actually inadequate for modeling DC with an instantaneous\nreaction-time. This shows that the main results obtained in our previous work\ndo not apply directly, as they were formulated, to the case of epsilon=0.\nMotivated by this observation, as a second contribution, our previous tools are\nextended in order to handle pi-DC, and the notion of ps-tree is introduced,\nalso pointing out a relationship between pi-DC and HyTN-Consistency. Thirdly, a\nsimple reduction from pi-DC-Checking to DC-Checking is identified. This allows\nus to design and to analyze the first sound-and-complete pi-DC-Checking\nprocedure. Remarkably, the time complexity of the proposed algorithm remains\n(pseudo) singly-exponential in the number of propositional letters. Finally, it\nis observed that the technique can be leveraged to actually reduce from pi-DC\nto 1-DC, this allows us to further improve the exponents in the time complexity\nof pi-DC-Checking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2016 19:54:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Aug 2016 15:04:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2017 19:52:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 9 Dec 2018 17:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-11"}

Here we reproduce these recurrent relations by calculating explicitly\nvia Barnes lemmas the contour integrals produced by the left hand sides of the\ndiagrammatic relations. In such a way we explicitly calculate a family of\nmulti-fold contour integrals of certain ratios of Euler gamma functions. We\nmake a conjecture that similar results for the contour integrals are valid for\na wider family of smooth functions which includes the MB transforms of UD\nfunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2016 22:35:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 04:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-28"}

In this setting, an external inflow is\ninjected to the so-called origin nodes. The total inflow arriving at each node\nis routed locally such that none of the outgoing links are overloaded unless\nthe node receives an inflow greater than its total outgoing capacity. A link\nirreversibly fails if it is overloaded or if there is no operational link in\nits immediate downstream to carry its flow. For such systems, resilience is\ndefined as the minimum amount of reduction in the link capacities that would\nresult in the failure of all the outgoing links of an origin node. We show that\nsuch networks do not necessarily become more resilient as additional capacity\nis built in the network. Moreover, when the external inflow does not exceed the\nnetwork capacity, selective reductions of capacity at certain links can\nactually help averting the cascading failures, without requiring any change in\nthe local routing policies. This is an attractive feature as it is often easier\nin practice to reduce the available capacity of some critical links than to add\nphysical capacity or to alter routing policies, e.g., when such policies are\ndetermined by social behavior, as in the case of road traffic networks. The\nresults can thus be used for real-time monitoring of distance-to-failure in\nsuch networks and devising a feasible course of actions to avert systemic\nfailures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2016 23:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

The success\nmainly derives from learning a discriminant Riemannian metric which encodes the\nnon-linear geometry of the underlying Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we\npropose a novel metric learning framework to learn a distance metric across a\nEuclidean space and a Riemannian manifold to fuse the average appearance and\npattern variation of faces within one video. The proposed metric learning\nframework can handle three typical tasks of video-based face recognition:\nVideo-to-Still, Still-to-Video and Video-to-Video settings. To accomplish this\nnew framework, by exploiting typical Riemannian geometries for kernel\nembedding, we map the source Euclidean space and Riemannian manifold into a\ncommon Euclidean subspace, each through a corresponding high-dimensional\nReproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS).

We set an accretion column with\na cone shape filled with tenuous gas with density of $10^{-4} {\\rm g}~ {\\rm\ncm}^{-3}$ above a neutron star and solve the two dimensional gas motion and\nradiative transfer within the column. The side boundaries are set such that\nradiation can freely escape, while gas cannot. Since the initial gas layer is\nnot in a hydrostatic balance, the column gas falls onto the neutron-star\nsurface, thereby a shock being generated. As a result, the accretion column is\ncomposed of two regions: an upper, nearly free-fall region and a lower settling\nregion, as was noted by Basko \\& Sunyaev (1976). The average accretion rate is\nvery high; ${\\dot M}\\sim 10^{2-3} L_{\\rm E}/c^2$ (with $L_{\\rm E}$ being the\nEddington luminosity), and so radiation energy dominates over gas internal\nenergy entirely within the column. Despite the high accretion rate, the\nradiation flux in the laboratory frame is kept barely below $L_{\\rm E}/(4\\pi\nr^2)$ at a distance $r$ in the settling region so that matter can slowly\naccrete. This adjustment is made possible, since large amount of photons\nproduced via dissipation of kinetic energy of matter can escape through the\nside boundaries. The total luminosity can greatly exceed $L_{\\rm E}$ by several\norders of magnitude, whereas the apparent luminosity observed from the top of\nthe column is much less. Due to such highly anisotropic radiation fields,\nobserved flux should exhibit periodic variations with the rotation period,\nprovided that the rotation and magnetic axes are misaligned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2016 08:58:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 02:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-09"}

Furthermore given a specific model of inflation, using\nquantum field theory on curved space-times this history can be pushed\n\\emph{back in time} to the epoch when space-time curvature was some $10^{62}$\ntimes that at the horizon of a solar mass black hole! However, to extend the\nhistory further back to the Planck regime requires input from quantum gravity.\nAn important aspect of this input is the choice of the background quantum\ngeometry and of the Heisenberg state of cosmological perturbations thereon,\nmotivated by Planck scale physics. This paper introduces first steps in that\ndirection. Specifically we propose two principles that link quantum geometry\nand Heisenberg uncertainties in the Planck epoch with late time physics and\nexplore in detail the observational consequences of the initial conditions they\nselect. We find that the predicted temperature-temperature (T-T) correlations\nfor scalar modes are indistinguishable from standard inflation at small angular\nscales even though the initial conditions are now set in the deep Planck\nregime. However, \\emph{there is a specific power suppression at large angular\nscales}. As a result, the predicted spectrum provides a better fit to the\nPLANCK mission data than standard inflation, where the initial conditions are\nset in the general relativity regime. Thus, our proposal brings out a deep\ninterplay between the ultraviolet and the infrared. Finally, the proposal also\nleads to specific predictions for power suppression at large angular scales\nalso for the (T-E and E-E) correlations involving electric polarization.

In particular, the tips of these\ndisconnected segments converge on the hot spots to form the closed Fermi\npockets, generating a coexistence of the Fermi arcs and Fermi pockets.\nMoreover, the single-particle coherent weight is directly related to the\npseudogap, and grows linearly with doping. The calculated result of the overall\ndispersion of the electron excitations is in qualitative agreement with the\nexperimental data. The theory also predicts that the pseudogap-induced\npeak-dip-hump structure in the electron spectrum is absent from the hot-spot\ndirections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2016 12:37:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 10:43:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 07:07:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

For example, in\nexperiments on 10 image-pair datasets, each consisting of 200 urban locations\nwith significant differences in viewing positions and conditions, we recorded\naverage precision of around 70% (at 100% recall), compared with 58% obtained\nusing whole image CNN features and 50% for the method in [1].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2016 14:13:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

Nuclei with larger $Z$ are usually\nproduced by $\\beta^-$-decay, but under certain conditions also $\\alpha$-induced\nreactions may become relevant for the production of nuclei with $Z+2$.\n  Purpose: The uncertainties of the reaction rates of these $\\alpha$-induced\nreactions are discussed within the statistical model. As an example,\n$\\alpha$-induced ($\\alpha$,n) and $(\\alpha$,$x$n) reaction cross sections for\nthe neutron-rich $^{86}$Se nucleus are studied in detail.\n  Method: In a first step, the relevance of ($\\alpha$,n) and $(\\alpha$,$x$n)\nreactions is analyzed. Next the uncertainties are determined from a variation\nof the $\\alpha$-nucleus potential which is the all-dominant parameter for the\nastrophysical $Z \\rightarrow Z+2$ reaction rate.\n  Results: It is found that the $r$-process flow towards nuclei with larger $Z$\nis essentially influenced only by the $\\alpha$-nucleus potential whereas the\nother ingredients of the statistical model play a very minor role. This finding\nis based on the fact that the flow towards larger $Z$ depends on the sum over\nall ($\\alpha$,$x$n) cross sections which is practically identical to the total\n$\\alpha$-induced reaction cross section.\n  Conclusions: $\\alpha$-nucleus potentials play an important role under certain\n$r$-process conditions because the flow towards larger $Z$ depends sensitively\non the total $\\alpha$-induced reaction cross section. The uncertainty of the\nreaction rate is about a factor of two to three at higher temperatures and\nexceeds one order of magnitude at very low temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2016 14:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

According to this field burial scenario young pulsars may have growing\nmagnetic fields, a process known to result with less-than-three braking\nindices; larger braking indices implying longer field-growth time-scales. A\nnascent neutron star with a larger kick velocity would accrete less amount of\nmatter leading to a shallower burial of its field and a more rapid field\ngrowth. Such an inverse relation between the field growth time-scale inferred\nfrom the braking indices and space velocity of pulsars was claimed in the past\nas a prediction of the field-burial scenario. With a braking index of $n\\sim 2$\nand large space velocity PSR~B0540--69 was then an outlier in the claimed\nrelation. The object recently made a transition to a rapid spin-down state\naccompanied by a low braking index. This new braking index implies a much\nshorter time-scale for the field growth which is consistent with the high space\nvelocity of the object, in better agreement with the claimed relation. This\nobservation lends support to the field burial scenario and implies that the\ngrowth of the magnetic field does not proceed at a constant pace but is slowed\nor completely halted at times. The slow spin-down state associated with the\nhigh braking index before 2011 which lasted for at least about 30 years was\nthen such an episode of slow field growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Aug 2016 15:39:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2016 14:58:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2017 12:25:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

Effects of\ntaper angle of the nozzle channel and jet-to-plate distance are evaluated. The\nresults show that tapered nozzle tends to deposit more particles toward the\ncircular spot edge than straight nozzle. At jet Reynolds number $Re = 1132$, a\ntapered nozzle deposits particles to form a pattern with a high density ring\ntoward the deposition spot edge, especially for particle Stokes number $St >\nSt_{50}$, which is absent with a straight nozzle. Increasing the jet-to-plate\ndistance tends to reduce the value of particle density peak near deposition\nspot edge. Reducing $Re$ to $283$ (e.g., for $300$ ccm flow through a $1.5$ mm\ndiameter jet nozzle) yields particle deposition patterns without the high\ndensity ring at the deposition spot edge when the same tapered nozzle is used.\nThe particle deposition patterns with the straight nozzle at $Re = 283$ exhibit\nfurther reduced particle density around the spot edge such that the particle\ndensity profile appears more or less like a Gaussian function.

From the knowledge of\nlight, we know that wave is always spread out, and hence the electron wave\nshould also spread out. That means the electron wave beam should like the light\nwave beam become diverged from the source. When the electron is received by an\natom we thought the wave collapse. The place to collapse is depends on the\nprobability calculated from the square of absolute value of the wave function.\nThe recent new discovery tell us that the light is not just wave, it is a\ncombination of waves, retarded potential and advanced potential. These two\npotentials together produce the mutual energy current or referred as M-current.\nAnother light energy current is P-current related to Poynting vector. We found\nP-current doesn't carry any energy for light. The contribution of P-current to\nenergy transfer can be omitted. The light energy is transferred only by\nM-current. The beam of M-current doesn't like the beam of P-current which is\ndiverged from the source, instead, the M-current beam first diverges from a\nsource and then converged to a sink. Since the M-current at the place to be\nreceived is localized at one electron, the concept of wave function collapse is\nneedless. The probability results of light is because that we have use\nP-current to roughly calculate the M-current. We thought if Schr\\\"odinger knew\ntoday's light theory, he would for sure also build his wave theory for quantum\nmechanics similar to the new light theory with M-current. Hence we claim that\nthe M-current theory is not only suitable to the light but also can be applied\nto the quantum physics. This means all particles are M-current. The M-current\nis composed of not only the retarded wave, but also the advanced wave.\nM-current is an inner product of a retarded and an advanced waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2016 21:36:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 03:45:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

Motivated by these results, we introduce\na simplified proportional-dimensional asymptotic framework which enables the\nquantitative evaluation of recovery guarantees for tree-based compressed\nsensing. In the context of Gaussian matrices, we apply this framework to\nexisting worst-case analysis of the Iterative Tree Projection (ITP) algorithm\nwhich makes use of the tree-based Restricted Isometry Property (RIP).
