Inviscid shock-free accretion disk solution produced a thick disk\nstructure, while the viscous shock-free solution attained a Bondi-like\nstructure, but in either case, no jet activity nor any QPO-like activity\ndeveloped. The steady state shocked solution in the inviscid, as well as, in\nthe viscous regime, matched theoretical predictions well. However, increasing\nviscosity renders the accretion shock unstable. Large amplitude shock\noscillation is accompanied by intermittent, transient inner multiple shocks.\nSuch oscillation of the inner part of disk is interpreted as the source of QPO\nin hard X-rays observed in micro-quasars. Strong shock oscillation induces\nstrong episodic jet emission. The jets also showed existence of shocks, which\nare produced as one shell hits the preceding one. The periodicity of jets and\nshock oscillation were similar.

Considering the majority of short-lived and interactive\nflows, transient startup effects, as caused by sleep scheduling in cellular\nnetworks, have, however, a substantial impact on the performance. To facilitate\nreasoning about the transient behavior of systems, this paper contributes a\nnotion of non-stationary service curves. Models of systems with sleep\nscheduling are derived and transient backlogs and delays are analyzed. Further,\nmeasurement methods that estimate the service of an unknown system from\nobservations of selected probe traffic are developed. Fundamental limitations\nof existing measurement methods are explained by the non-convexity of the\ntransient service and further difficulties are shown to be due to the\nsuper-additivity of network service processes. A novel two-phase probing\ntechnique is devised that first determines the shape of a minimal probe and\nsubsequently obtains an accurate estimate of the unknown service.

Typically, Quality of Service (QoS)\nof cloud-based services can be tuned using different underlying cloud\nconfigurations and resources, e.g., number of threads, CPU and memory etc.,\nwhich are shared, leased and priced as utilities. This benefit is fundamentally\ngrounded by autoscaling: an automatic and elastic process that adapts cloud\nconfigurations on-demand according to time-varying workloads. This thesis\nproposes a holistic cloud autoscaling framework to effectively and seamlessly\naddress existing challenges related to different logical aspects of\nautoscaling, including architecting autoscaling system, modelling the QoS of\ncloud-based service, determining the granularity of control and deciding\ntrade-off autoscaling decisions.

The major benefit is that, by leveraging the\nframework, cloud autoscaling can be effectively achieved without heavy human\nanalysis and design time knowledge. Through conducting various experiments\nusing RUBiS benchmark and realistic workload on real cloud setting, this thesis\nevaluates the effectiveness of the framework based on various quality\nindicators and compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2016 21:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

Using the heat kernel techniques, we establish a resolvent formula\nin terms of an $N \\times N$ matrix, called the principal matrix. This matrix\nessentially includes all the information about the spectrum of the problem. We\nstudy the bound state spectrum by working out the eigenvalues of the principal\nmatrix. With the help of the Feynman-Hellmann theorem, we analyze how the bound\nstate energies change with respect to the parameters in the model. We also\nprove that there are at most $N$ bound states and explicitly derive the bound\nstate wave function. The bound state problem for the two-center case is\nparticularly investigated. We show that the ground state energy is bounded\nbelow, and there exists a self-adjoint Hamiltonian associated with the\nresolvent formula. Moreover, we prove that the ground state is nondegenerate.\nThe scattering problem for $N$ centers is analyzed by exactly solving the\nsemirelativistic Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The reflection and the\ntransmission coefficients are numerically and asymptotically computed for the\ntwo-center case. We observe the so-called threshold anomaly for two\nsymmetrically located centers. The semirelativistic version of the\nKronig-Penney model is shortly discussed, and the band gap structure of the\nspectrum is illustrated. The bound state and scattering problems in the\nmassless case are also discussed. Furthermore, the reflection and the\ntransmission coefficients for the two delta potentials in this particular case\nare analytically found. Finally, we solve the renormalization group equations\nand compute the beta function nonperturbatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2016 22:05:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Aug 2016 18:19:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 19:24:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

When testing seasonal unit roots under periodic variation, the validity\nof the existing methods, such as the HEGY test, remains unknown. This paper\nanalyzes the behavior of the augmented HEGY test and the unaugmented HEGY test\nunder periodic variation. It turns out that the asymptotic null distributions\nof the HEGY statistics testing the single roots at $1$ or $-1$ when there is\nperiodic variation are identical to the asymptotic null distributions when\nthere is no periodic variation. On the other hand, the asymptotic null\ndistributions of the statistics testing any coexistence of roots at $1$, $-1$,\n$i$, or $-i$ when there is periodic variation are non-standard and are\ndifferent from the asymptotic null distributions when there is no periodic\nvariation. Therefore, when periodic variation exists, HEGY tests are not\ndirectly applicable to the joint tests for any concurrence of seasonal unit\nroots. As a remedy, bootstrap is proposed; in particular, the augmented HEGY\ntest with seasonal independent and identically distributed (iid) bootstrap and\nthe unaugmented HEGY test with seasonal block bootstrap are implemented. The\nconsistency of these bootstrap procedures is established. The finite-sample\nbehavior of these bootstrap tests is illustrated via simulation and prevails\nover their competitors'.

More\nspecifically, we scale up the novel Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion\nLasso (HSIC Lasso) to handle millions of features with tens of thousand\nsamples. The proposed method is guaranteed to find an optimal subset of\nmaximally predictive features with minimal redundancy, yielding higher\npredictive power and improved interpretability. Its effectiveness is\ndemonstrated through applications to classify phenotypes based on module\nexpression in human prostate cancer patients and to detect enzymes among\nprotein structures. We achieve high accuracy with as few as 20 out of one\nmillion features --- a dimensionality reduction of 99.998%. Our algorithm can\nbe implemented on commodity cloud computing platforms. The dramatic reduction\nof features may lead to the ubiquitous deployment of sophisticated prediction\nmodels in mobile health care applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2016 01:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

Owing to the lack of obvious clinical evidence of\ndiseases, or the incomplete information related to the disease, the risks of\ninfection cannot be perceived and may lead to inappropriate behavioral\nresponses. Therefore, how to quantitatively analyze the impacts of asymptomatic\ninfection on the interplay between diseases and behavioral responses is of\nparticular importance. In this Letter, under the complex network framework, we\nstudy the coupled disease-behavior interaction model by dividing infectious\nindividuals into two states: U-state (without evident clinical symptoms,\nlabelled as U) and I-state (with evident clinical symptoms, labelled as I). A\nsusceptible individual can be infected by U- or I-nodes, however, since the\nU-nodes cannot be easily observed, susceptible individuals take behavioral\nresponses \\emph{only} when they contact I-nodes. The mechanism is considered in\nthe improved Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model and the improved\nSusceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, respectively. Then, one of the most\nconcerned problems in spreading dynamics: the epidemic thresholds for the two\nmodels are given by two methods. The analytic results \\emph{quantitatively}\ndescribe the influence of different factors, such as asymptomatic infection,\nthe awareness rate, the network structure, and so forth, on the epidemic\nthresholds. Moreover, because of the irreversible process of the SIR model, the\nsuppression effect of the improved SIR model is weaker than the improved SIS\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2016 02:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

There is a possibility that gluon fragmentation\nfunctions, as well as quark fragmentation functions, are accurately determined\nby scaling violation. We report our global analysis of the fragmentation\nfunctions especially to show impacts of the B-factory measurements on the\nfragmentation function determination. Our results indicate that the\nfragmentation functions are determined more accurately not only by the scaling\nviolation but also by high-statistical nature of the Belle and BaBar data.\nHowever, there are some tensions between the Belle and BaBar data in comparison\nwith previous measurements. We also explain how the flavor dependence of quark\nfragmentation functions and the gluon function are separated by using\nmeasurements at different $Q^2$ values. In particular, the electric and weak\nchanges are different depending on the quark type, so that a light-quark flavor\nseparation also became possible in principle due to the precise data at both\n$\\sqrt{s}\\simeq 10.5$ GeV and 91.2 GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2016 07:19:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2016 04:14:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

This equation includes six free surface functions and recovers known\nGrad-Shafranov-like equations in the literature as well as the usual static,\nisotropic one. The form of the generalised equation indicates that pressure\nanisotropy and flow act additively on equilibrium. In addition, two sets of\nanalytical solutions, an extended Solovev one with a plasma reaching the\nseparatrix and an extended Hernegger-Maschke one for a plasma surrounded by a\nfixed boundary possessing an X-point, are constructed, particularly in\nrelevance to the ITER and NSTX tokamaks.

Also, in most of the cases considered both the anisotropy and\nthe flow have stronger effects on NSTX equilibria than on ITER ones.

This forms a configuration\nsufficiently simple to yield clues to the above issues. It is characterized by\nembedding horns, oscillations, and a gradual disappearance of the separated\nmaterial. The prominence-horn structure exhibits a large amplitude longitudinal\noscillation with a period of ~150 minutes and an amplitude of ~30 Mm along the\ntrajectory defined by the concave horn structure. The horns also experience a\nsimultaneous transverse oscillation with a much smaller amplitude (~3 Mm) and\nshorter period (~10-15 minutes), likely representative of a global mode of the\nlarge-scale magnetic structure. The gradual disappearance of the structure\nindicates that the horn, an observational manifestation of the field-aligned\ntransition region separating the cool and dense prominence from the hot and\ntenuous corona, is formed due to the heating and diluting process of the\ncentral prominence mass, while most previous studies suggest that it is the\nopposite process, i.e., the cooling and condensation of coronal plasmas, to\nform the horn. This study also demonstrates how the prominence transports\nmagnetic flux to the upper corona, a process essential for the gradual build-up\nof pre-eruption magnetic energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2016 12:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

For secured practical\nimplementation, one needs to take two initially uncorrelated quantum systems\nand perform a unitary on the composite system to generate the nonlocal\nresource, which is supposed to violate a Bell inequality (say, Bell-CHSH).\nStates which do not violate Bell-CHSH inequality, but violate it when\ntransformed by a global unitary, can be deemed useful for the preparation of\nnonlocal resource. One may then start from a state which is Bell-CHSH local\n(take for example, a pure product state) and apply an appropriate global\nunitary on it which results in a Bell-CHSH non-local state. However, an\nintriguing fact is the existence of useless states from which no Bell-CHSH\nnon-local resource can be generated with a global unitary. This is due to the\npurity preserving nature of unitary operators which bound the amount of\ncorrelation in the set of final states depending on the purity of the initial\n(possibly uncorrelated) states. The present work confirms the existence of such\na set, pertaining to two qubit systems. The set exhibits counter intuitive\nfeatures by containing within it some entangled states which remain Bell-CHSH\nlocal on the action of any unitary. From practical perspective, this work draws\na line between useful and useless states for the task of preparing nonlocal\nresource using global unitary transformations. Furthermore through an analytic\ncharacterization of the set we lay down a generic prescription through which\none can operationally identify the useful states.

In this paper we aim to investigate one special type of attacks in\nthe discrete-event system framework, where an attacker can arbitrarily alter\nsensor readings after intercepting them from a target system in order to trick\na given supervisor to issue control commands improperly, driving the system to\nan undesirable state. We first consider the cyber attack problem from an\nattacker point of view, and formulate an attack with bounded sensor reading\nalterations (ABSRA) problem. We then show that the supremal (or least\nrestrictive) ABSRA exists and can be synthesized, as long as the plant model\nand the supervisor model are regular, i.e., representable by finite-state\nautomata. Upon the synthesis of the supremal ABSRA, we present a synthesis\nalgorithm, which ensures that a computed supervisor will be ABSRA-robust ,\ni.e., either an ABSRA will be detectable or will not lead the system to an\nundesirable state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2016 13:41:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 22:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-26"}

One strategy is to reduce the size of a\nsupervisor to generate a control equivalent version, whose size is hopefully\nmuch smaller than the original one so that a user or control designer can\neasily check whether a designed controller fulfils its objectives and\nrequirements. After the first journal paper on this topic appeared in 1986 by\nVaz and Wonham, which relied on the concept of control covers, in 2004 Su and\nWonham proposed to use control congruences to ensure computational viability.\nThis work is later adopted in the supervisor localization theory, which aims\nfor a control equivalent distributed implementation of a given centralized\nsupervisor. But after so many publications, some fundamental questions, which\nshould have been addressed in the first place, have not been answered yet,\nnamely what information is critical to ensure control equivalence, what\ninformation is responsible for size reduction, and whether the partial\nobservation really makes things different. In this paper we will address these\nfundamental questions by showing that there does exist a unified supervisor\nreduction theory, which is applicable to all feasible supervisors regardless of\nwhether they are under full observation or partial observation. Our theory\nprovides a partial order over all control equivalent feasible supervisors based\non their enabling, disabling and marking information, which can be used to\ncategorize the corresponding reduction rates. Based on this result we can see\nthat, given two control equivalent feasible supervisors, the one under full\nobservation can always result in a reduced supervisor no bigger than that\ninduced by a supervisor under partial observation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Aug 2016 13:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

Here we develop a computational model of the rat kidney and\nuse it to investigate the relationship between arterial blood pressure and\ninterstitial fluid pressure. In addition, we investigate how tissue flexibility\ninfluences this relationship. Due to the complexity of the model, the large\nnumber of parameters, and the inherent uncertainty of the experimental data, we\nutilize Monte Carlo sampling to study the model's behavior under a wide range\nof parameter values and to compute first- and total-order sensitivity indices.\nCharacteristically, at elevated arterial blood pressure, the model predicts\ncases with increased or reduced interstitial pressure. The transition between\nthe two cases is controlled mostly by the compliance of the blood vessels\nlocated before the afferent arterioles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Aug 2016 16:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-19"}
