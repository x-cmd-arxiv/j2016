However,\nconventional forward error correction (FEC) codes for reliable communication do\nnot have the features for dimming support and flicker mitigation which are\nrequired in VLC for the main functionality of lighting. Therefore, auxiliary\ncoding techniques are usually needed, which eventually reduce the coding\nefficiency and increase the complexity. In this paper, a polar codes-based FEC\ncoding scheme for dimmable VLC is proposed to increase the coding efficiency\nand simplify the coding structure. Experimental results show that the proposed\nscheme has the following advantages: 1) equal probability of 1's and 0's in\ncodewords, which is inherently supporting 50% dimming balance; 2) short run\nlength property (about 90% bits have runs shorter than 5) which can avoid\nflickers and additional run-length limited line coding; 3) higher coding\nefficiency about twofold than that of other coding schemes; 4) capacity\nachieving error correction performance with low-complexity encoding and\ndecoding, which is about 3 dB higher coding gain than that of RS(64,32) in IEEE\nstandard for dimming ratio 50% and about 1 dB higher coding gain than that of\nLDPC codes for dimming ratio 25% (or 75%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 16:02:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-18"}

The super-massive black hole (SMBH) might strip\nplanets or planetary embryos from their parent star, bringing them close enough\nto be tidally disrupted. Photoevaporation by the ultraviolet field of young\nstars, combined with ongoing tidal disruption, could enhance the near-infrared\nluminosity of such starless planets, making their detection possible even with\ncurrent facilities. In this paper, we investigate the chance of planet tidal\ncaptures by means of high-accuracy N-body simulations exploiting Mikkola's\nalgorithmic regularization. We consider both planets lying in the clockwise\n(CW) disk and planets initially bound to the S-stars. We show that tidally\ncaptured planets remain on orbits close to those of their parent star.\nMoreover, the semi-major axis of the planet orbit can be predicted by simple\nanalytic assumptions in the case of prograde orbits. We find that starless\nplanets that were initially bound to CW disk stars have mild eccentricities and\ntend to remain in the CW disk. However, we speculate that angular momentum\ndiffusion and scattering with other young stars in the CW disk might bring\nstarless planets on low-angular momentum orbits. In contrast, planets initially\nbound to S-stars are captured by the SMBH on highly eccentric orbits, matching\nthe orbital properties of the G1 and G2 clouds. Our predictions apply not only\nto planets but also to low-mass stars initially bound to the S-stars and\ntidally captured by the SMBH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 17:36:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-26"}

We describe the evolution\nof such a system, and present the results of numerical simulations which show\ndynamical coupling between the effective field and the matter on which it acts.\nCrucially, the freedom of the spatial profile of the field is sufficient to\nrealize a close analogue of the Meissner effect, where the magnetic field is\nexpelled from the superfluid.

For habitable exoplanets in particular, located at small angular\nseparation from the host star, it is crucial to employ small inner working\nangle (IWA) coronagraphs that efficiently suppress starlight. These\ncoronagraphs, in turn, require careful control of the wavefront which directly\nimpacts their performance. For ground-based telescopes, atmospheric refraction\nis also an important factor, since it results in a smearing of the PSF, that\ncan no longer be efficiently suppressed by the coronagraph. Traditionally,\natmospheric refraction is compensated for by an atmospheric dispersion\ncompensator (ADC). ADC control relies on an a priori model of the atmosphere\nwhose parameters are solely based on the pointing of the telescope, which can\nresult in imperfect compensation. For a high contrast instrument like the\nSubaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) system, which employs\nvery small IWA coronagraphs, refraction-induced smearing of the PSF has to be\nless than 1 mas in the science band for optimum performance. In this paper, we\npresent the first on-sky measurement and correction of residual atmospheric\ndispersion. Atmospheric dispersion is measured from the science image directly,\nusing an adaptive grid of artificially introduced speckles as a diagnostic to\nfeedback to the telescope's ADC. With our current setup, we were able to reduce\nthe initial residual atmospheric dispersion from 18.8 mas to 4.2 in broadband\nlight (y- to H-band), and to 1.4 mas in H-band only. This work is particularly\nrelevant to the upcoming extremely large telescopes (ELTs) that will require\nfine control of their ADC to reach their full high contrast imaging potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 18:50:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2016 00:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

The challenge in the\nnumerical simulations of this problem lies in the fact that the solution\ncontains many multiscale features and requires a very fine mesh to resolve all\ndetails. In order to efficiently compute the solutions, some model reductions\nare necessary. To obtain a reduced model, we apply the generalized multiscale\nfinite element approach, which is a framework allowing systematic construction\nof reduced models. Based on this general framework, we will first construct a\nlocal snapshot space, which contains many possible multiscale features of the\nsolution. Using the snapshot space and a local spectral problem, we identify\ndominant modes in the snapshot space and use them as the multiscale basis\nfunctions. Our basis functions are constructed locally with non-overlapping\nsupports, which enhances the sparsity of the resulting linear system. In order\nto enforce the mass conservation, we propose a hybridized technique, and uses a\nLagrange multiplier to achieve mass conservation. We will mathematically\nanalyze the stability and the convergence of the proposed method. In addition,\nwe will present some numerical examples to show the performance of the scheme.\nWe show that, with a few basis functions per coarse region, one can obtain a\nsolution with excellent accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 19:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-26"}

To tackle this issue, we have introduced\nin [1] a Python tool called PyR@TE; Python Renormalization group equations @\nTwo-loop for Everyone. With PyR@TE, it is easy to implement a given Lagrangian\nand derive the complete set of two-loop RGEs for all the parameters of the\ntheory.

In addition, the group\ntheory part has been greatly improved as we introduced a new Python module\ndubbed PyLie that deals with all the group theoretical aspects required for the\ncalculation of the RGEs as well as providing very useful model building\ncapabilities. This allows the use of any irreducible representation of the\n$\\mathrm{SU}(n)$, $\\mathrm{SO}(2n)$ and $\\mathrm{SO(2n+1)}$ groups. %\nFurthermore, it is now possible to implement terms in the Lagrangian involving\nfields which can be contracted into gauge singlets in more than one way. As a\nbyproduct, results for a popular model (SM+complex triplet) for which, to our\nknowledge, the complete set of two-loop RGEs has not been calculated before are\npresented in this paper. Finally, the two-loop RGEs for the anomalous dimension\nof the scalar and fermion fields have been implemented as well. It is now\npossible to export the coupled system of beta functions into a numerical C++\nfunction, leading to a consequent speed up in solving them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 19:54:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

Adopting the canonical photon index, $\\Gamma = 1.9$,\nof the intrinsic X-ray spectrum of the Seyfert galaxies, the X-ray hardness\nratio between the 3-4 and 4-10 keV ranges derived with MAXI was roughly\nconverted into the absorption column density.

In contrast, NGC 1365, only one Compton-thick object in\nthe MAXI catalog, was found to deviate from the correlation toward a\nsignificantly lower X-ray luminosity by nearly an order of magnitude. It was\nverified that the relation between the X-ray hardness below 10 keV and\nX-ray-to-infrared color acts as an effective tool to pick up Compton-thick\nobjects. The difference in the infrared colors between the type-1 and type-2\nSeyfert galaxies and its physical implication on the classification and\nunification of active galactic nuclei were briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

We aim to understand how such\ncorrelated heterogeneous infection rates influence the spreading on different\nnetwork topologies. Motivated by real-world datasets, we propose a correlated\nheterogeneous Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model which assumes that the\ninfection rate $\\beta_{ij}(=\\beta_{ji})$ between node $i$ and $j$ is correlated\nwith the degree of the two end nodes: $\\beta_{ij}=c(d_id_j)^\\alpha$, where\n$\\alpha$ indicates the strength of the correlation and $c$ is selected so that\nthe average infection rate is $1$. In order to understand the effect of such\ncorrelation on epidemic spreading, we consider as well the corresponding\nuncorrected but still heterogeneous infection rate scenario as a reference,\nwhere the original correlated infection rates in our CSIS model are shuffled\nand reallocated to the links of the same network topology.

Most often, these devices have limited energy supplies, and\nthey can operate for a limited duration. As a result, energy-efficient\nmonitoring of various target locations through a set of monitoring devices with\nlimited energy supplies is a crucial problem in networked systems. In this\npaper, we study optimal scheduling of monitoring devices to maximize network\ncoverage for detecting and isolating events on targets for a given network\nlifetime.

We formulate the problem of\nscheduling of monitoring devices as a graph labeling problem, which unlike\nother existing solutions, allows us to directly utilize the underlying network\nstructure to explore the trade-off between coverage and network lifetime. In\nthis direction, first we propose a greedy heuristic to solve the graph labeling\nproblem, and then provide a game-theoretic solution to achieve near optimal\ngraph labeling.

This problem entails reduction of the\npoints in a given trajectory while keeping the relevant points which preserve\nimportant information. The benefits include storage reduction, computational\nexpense, while making data more manageable. Common techniques formulate a\nminimization problem to be solved, where the solution is found iteratively\nunder some error metric, which causes the algorithms to work in super-linear\ntime. We present an algorithm called FastSTray, which selects the relevant\npoints in the trajectory in linear time by following an open loop heuristic\napproach. While most current trajectory simplification algorithms are tailored\nfor GPS trajectories, our approach focuses on smooth trajectories for robot\nprogramming by demonstration recorded using motion capture systems.Two\nvariations of the algorithm are presented: 1. aims to preserve shape and\ntemporal information; 2. preserves only shape information. Using the points in\nthe simplified trajectory we use cubic splines to interpolate between these\npoints and recreate the original trajectory. The presented algorithm was tested\non trajectories recorded from a hand-tracking system.

By comparison with quadrupole frequencies observed in PAC\nmeasurements on isostructural RuIn3, it was determined that indium occupies\nonly the 8j site in the FeGa3 structure, denoted Ga(2) below because two out of\nthe three Ga sites have this point symmetry. PAC spectra at elevated\ntemperature exhibited damping characteristic of electric field gradients (EFGs)\nthat fluctuate as Cd probes jump among Ga(2) sites within the lifetime of the\nexcited PAC level. A stochastic model for the EFG fluctuations based on four\nconceivable, single-step jump-pathways connecting one Ga(2) site to neighboring\nGa(2) sites was developed and used to fit PAC spectra. The four pathways lead\nto two observable EFG reorientation rates, and these reorientation rates were\nfound to be strongly dependent on EFG orientation.

More importantly we showed\nthat in any dimension, the system has Ising dynamics in strong atom-photon\ncoupling limit. For 1D, a special relation between end-to-end spin-spin\ncorrelation is presented, which is very much different form the bulk spin-spin\ncorrelation. The entanglement between cavities is calculated and shown to have\nmaximum value at the phase transition point. Other problems we studied were the\nfrustrated quantum Ising model and its phase diagram as well as existence of\nMajorana like edge modes in different phases of the model. The fermionic\nversion of the frustrated quantum Ising problem is also presented. On a\ndifferent but related note, we present some beautiful results on Falicov\nKimball (FK) model, a fermionic model similar to Hubbard model, on a square\nlattice. Using a canonical representation for electrons (invented by Brijesh\nKumar), the FK model is mapped to classical Ising model (at infinite Hubbard\ninteraction limit) on 2D lattice. We performed classical Monte Carlo simulation\nto study magnetization as a function of Hubbard interaction and also as a\nfunction of temperature. The motivation was to study (quantum) charge\nfluctuation (thus, quantum fluctuation of top of classical Ising\nthermodynamics) due to finite Hubbard interaction term.\n  We also devote a chapter for basic numerical techniques, such as Density\nmatrix Renormalization Group method, Exact diagonalization for spin system and\nclassical Monte Carlo simulation (for classical 2D Ising model), which we have\nused in this thesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2016 07:58:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-29"}

The\ncollective diffusion coefficient is one order of magnitude higher than the\nStokes-Einstein estimate showing the importance of the electrostatic\ninteractions for the relaxation of concentration gradients. At the same time,\nwe also performed fluorescence imaging of tracers embedded within the\ndispersion during the drying of the drop, which reveals two distinct regimes.\nAt early stages, concentration gradients along the drop lead to\nbuoyancy-induced flows. Strikingly, these flows do not influence the colloidal\nconcentration gradients that generate them, as the mass transport remains\ndominated by diffusion.

Hence CZT Imager would be a useful addition to the currently\noperating GRB instruments (Swift and Fermi).

Here, we\ndemonstrate by combined quantum and classical simulations that a small\ntime-varying spatial dependence in the laser electric field creates a prominent\nhigher energy peak at energies above the \"classical cut-off\" for direct\nelectrons. This higher energy structure (HES) originates from direct electrons\nionized near the peak of a single half-cycle of the laser pulse.

Key challenges include the complex and unpredictable\nnature of the real world in which assistant and service robots operate, the\nlimitations on available V&V techniques when used individually, and the\nconsequent lack of confidence in the V&V results. Our approach, called\ncorroborative V&V, addresses these challenges by combining several different\nV&V techniques; in this paper we use formal verification (model checking),\nsimulation-based testing, and user validation in experiments with a real robot.\nWe demonstrate our corroborative V&V approach through a handover task, the most\ncritical part of a complex cooperative manufacturing scenario, for which we\npropose some safety and liveness requirements to verify and validate. We\nconstruct formal models, simulations and an experimental test rig for the HRI.\nTo capture requirements we use temporal logic properties, assertion checkers\nand textual descriptions. This combination of approaches allows V&V of the HRI\ntask at different levels of modelling detail and thoroughness of exploration,\nthus overcoming the individual limitations of each technique. Should the\nresulting V&V evidence present discrepancies, an iterative process between the\ndifferent V&V techniques takes place until corroboration between the V&V\ntechniques is gained from refining and improving the assets (i.e., system and\nrequirement models) to represent the HRI task in a more truthful manner.\nTherefore, corroborative V&V affords a systematic approach to 'meta-V&V,' in\nwhich different V&V techniques can be used to corroborate and check one\nanother, increasing the level of certainty in the results of V&V.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2016 09:31:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Aug 2018 16:55:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 2019 18:59:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

Our purpose is to study the evolution of the outflows in the intermediate\ncorona from AR 8100, from the time the AR first forms until it dissolves, after\nseveral transits at the solar limb. Data acquired by SOHO/UVCS at the time of\nthe AR limb transits, at medium latitudes and at altitudes ranging from 1.5 to\n2.3 R_sun, were used to infer the physical properties of the outflows through\nthe AR evolution. To this end, we applied the Doppler dimming technique to UVCS\nspectra. These spectra include the H I Lyman alpha line and the O VI doublet\nlines at 1031.9 and 1037.6 A. Plasma speeds and electron densities of the\noutflows were inferred over several rotations of the Sun. AR outflows are\npresent in the newly born AR and persist throughout the entire AR life.\nMoreover, we found two types of outflows at different latitudes, both possibly\noriginating in the same negative polarity area of the AR. We also analyzed the\nbehavior of the Si XII 520 A line along the UVCS slit in an attempt to reveal\nchanges in the Si abundance when different regions are traversed. Although we\nfound some evidence for a Si enrichment in the AR outflows, alternative\ninterpretations are also plausible. Our results demonstrate that outflows from\nARs are detectable in the intermediate corona throughout the whole AR lifetime.\nThis confirms that outflows contribute to the slow wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2016 09:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-07"}

The use of implantation masks with graded thickness at the\nsub-micrometer scale allows the formation of conductive channels which are\nembedded in the insulating matrix at controllable depths. In particular, the\nmodulation of the channels depth at their endpoints allows the surface\ncontacting of the channel terminations with no need of further fabrication\nstages. In the present work we describe the sample masking, which includes the\ndeposition of semi spherical gold contacts on the sample surface, followed by\nMeV ion implantation. Because of the significant difference between the\ndensities of pristine and amorphous or graphitized diamond, the formation of\nburied channels has a relevant mechanical effect on the diamond structure,\ncausing localized surface swelling, which has been measured both with\ninterferometric profilometry and atomic force microscopy. The electrical\nproperties of the buried channels are then measured with a two point probe\nstation: clear evidence is given that only the terminal points of the channels\nare electrically connected with the surface, while the rest of the channels\nextends below the surface. IV measurements are employed also to qualitatively\ninvestigate the electrical properties of the channels as a function of\nimplantation fluence and annealing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2016 11:47:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-29"}

The first part is focused on the development of\na textured rear reflector for OPVs. The use of textured reflector (TR)\nfacilitates an increase in the optical path length along with light trapping\nwithin the active layer. TR was fabricated through a relatively simpler\ntechnique by depositing metal films over a microlens array (MLA). Zinc oxide\nnanoparticles were used to minimize the shadowing effect. Using TR,\nenhancements in short-circuit current density and power conversion efficiencies\nup to 10-25% were demonstrated for a polymer based organic solar cell. The\nsecond part is focused on improving the effectiveness of MLA incorporation in\nOPVs. The increase in path length achieved using MLA can be improved by\nincreasing the refractive index of MLA and incorporating MLA directly on the\ntransparent electrode instead of glass substrate. This approach could avoid the\noptical losses occurring at the interface between MLA and glass substrate and\nincrease the net path length of light within the active layer. Initial\nexperimental results are discussed to understand the potential of this\napproach. Approximately, ~15% enhancement in short-circuit current density was\nachieved by using MLA directly on the transparent electrode in ITO-free\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 17:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-29"}

The splitting is\nperpendicular to the direction of the polarization of the light. We derive an\neffective low-energy theory that captures these key results. Finally, we\ncompute the frequency dependence of the optical conductivity for this 3-band\nmodel and analyze the various interband contributions of the Floquet modes. Our\nresults suggest strategies for optically controlling band structure and\ninteraction strength in real systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2016 15:08:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 17:06:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

We have analyzed multiple single dish and\ninterferometric data, and obtained excitation temperatures and column densities\nusing an LTE analysis. We have reported for the first time the presence of EG\ntowards G31.41+0.31, and we have also detected multiple transitions of other\ncomplex organic molecules such as GA, methyl formate (MF), dimethyl ether (DME)\nand ethanol (ET). The high angular resolution images show that the EG emission\nis very compact, peaking towards the maximum of the continuum. These\nobservations suggest that low abundance complex organic molecules, like EG or\nGA, are good probes of the gas located closer to the forming stars. Our\nanalysis confirms that EG is more abundant than GA in G31.41+0.31, as\npreviously observed in other interstellar regions. Comparing different\nstar-forming regions we find evidence of an increase of the EG/GA abundance\nratio with the luminosity of the source. The DME/MF and EG/ET ratios are nearly\nconstant with luminosity. We have also found that the abundance ratios of pairs\nof isomers GA/MF and ET/DME decrease with the luminosity of the sources. The\nmost likely explanation for the behavior of the EG/GA ratio is that these\nmolecules are formed by different chemical formation routes not directly\nlinked; although warm-up timescales effects and different formation and\ndestruction efficiencies in the gas phase cannot be ruled out. The most likely\nformation route of EG is by combination of two CH$_{2}$OH radicals on dust\ngrains. We also favor that GA is formed via the solid-phase dimerization of the\nformyl radical HCO, and a chemical link between MF and DME.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2016 15:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

For illustration, we apply these\nresults to estimate the internal temperature of the Vela pulsar and to study\nthe cooling of neutron stars of ages of 0.1 - 1 Myr at the photon cooling\nstage. The uncertainties of the cooling models associated with our poor\nknowledge of chemical composition of the heat insulating envelopes strongly\ncomplicate theoretical reconstruction of the internal structure of cooling\nneutron stars from observations of their thermal surface emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2016 14:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

Here we show how the E- and B-mode powers depend on the\ndetailed properties of the fluctuations in the magnetized interstellar medium.\nThese fluctuations are classified into the slow, fast, and Alfv\\'en\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, which are determined once the ratio of gas to\nmagnetic-field pressures is specified. We also parametrize models in terms of\nthe power amplitudes and power anisotropies for the three types of waves. We\nfind that the observed EE/BB ratio (and its scale invariance) and positive TE\ncorrelation cannot be easily explained in terms of favored models for MHD\nturbulence. The observed power-law index for temperature/polarization\nfluctuations also disfavors MHD turbulence. We thus speculate that the 0.1--30\npc length scales probed by these dust-polarization measurements are not\ndescribed by MHD turbulence but, rather, probe the large-scale physics that\ndrives ISM turbulence. We develop a simple phenomenological model, based on\nrandom displacements of the magnetized fluid, that produces EE/BB $\\simeq2$ and\na positive TE cross-correlation. According to this model, the EE/BB and TE\nsignals are due to longitudinal, rather than transverse, modes in the\nrandom-displacement field, providing, perhaps, some clue to the mechanism that\nstirs the ISM. Future investigations involving the spatial dependence of the\nEE/BB ratio, TE correlation, and local departures from statistical isotropy in\ndust-polarization maps, as well as further tests of some of the assumptions in\nthis analysis, are outlined. This work may also aid in the improvement of\nforeground-separation techniques for studies of CMB polarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}
