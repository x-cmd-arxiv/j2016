Considering a Fermi surface (FS) consisting of a\nslightly corrugated cylinder and two corrugated planes distributed periodically\nin the momentum space, the thermoelectric effects are considered under general\nassumptions for the value of a magnetic breakdown probability. As a result of\nan external generalized force, the FS sheets in layered conductors with a\nmultisheet FS appear to be so close that the charge carriers (as a result of\nmagnetic breakdown) can move from one FS sheet to another. In addition, the\ndistribution functions of the charge carriers and the magnetic breakdown\noscillations of thermoelectrical field along the normal to the layer, under\ndifferent values and orientations of the magnetic field, $B$, are calculated.\nIt is shown that if the magnetic field is deflected from the $xz$-plane at an\nangle $\\varphi$, the oscillation part of a thermoelectrical field along the\nnormal to the layer under condition $\\sin\\varphi\\tan\\vartheta \\gg 1$ is mainly\ndetermined with the Nernst-Ettingshausen effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2016 16:00:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-13"}

We attempt to derive physical parameters\nfor BHR 160 and to understand its structure and the origin of its peculiar\nbright rim. BHR 160 was mapped in the $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O (2-1)\nand (1-0) and CS (3-2) and (2-1) lines. These data, augmented with stellar\nphotometry derived from the ESO VVV survey, were used to derive the mass and\ndistribution of molecular material in BHR 160 and its surroundings.

These moments can then be used to derive useful\nproperties of the eigenvalue distribution of the Gramian (in some cases, even\nclosed-form expressions for the distribution). We illustrate this framework by\nconsidering system matrices derived from common random graph and matrix\nensembles, such as the Wigner ensemble, the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE),\nand random regular graphs. Subsequently, we illustrate how the eigenvalue\ndistribution of the Gramian can be used to draw conclusions about the energy\nrequired to control random system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2016 16:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-16"}

With this new\nnetwork, the utility of the [HCO$^+$]/[DCO$^+$] abundance ratio as a probe of\nthe cosmic ray ionization rate has been reexamined, with special attention paid\nto the effect of the initial value of the molecular hydrogen ortho-to-para\nratio (OPR). After discussing the use of the probe for cold cores, we then\ncompare our results with previous theoretical and observational results for a\nmolecular cloud close to the supernova remnant W51C, which is thought to have\nan enhanced cosmic ray ionization rate $\\zeta$ caused by the nearby\n$\\gamma$-ray source. In addition, we attempt to use our approach to estimate\nthe cosmic ray ionization rate for L1174, a dense core with an embedded star.\nBeyond the previously known sensitivity of [HCO$^+$]/[DCO$^+$] to $\\zeta$, we\ndemonstrate its additional dependence on the initial OPR and, secondarily, on\nthe age of the source, its temperature, and its density. We conclude that the\nusefulness of the [HCO$^+$]/[DCO$^+$] abundance ratio to constrain the cosmic\nray ionization rate in dense regions increases with source age and ionization\nrate as the ratio becomes far less sensitive to the initial value of the OPR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2016 16:37:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

Using coronal radio events\nabove 100 MHz exclusively from type III bursts, we revisited long-standing\nquestions: Do all coronal type III bursts have X-ray counterparts. What\ncorrelation, if any, occurs between radio and X-ray intensities. What X-ray and\nradio signatures above 100 MHz occur in connection with interplanetary type III\nbursts below 14 MHz. We analysed data from 2002 to 2011 starting with coronal\ntype III bursts above 100 MHz.

We examined the timings, intensities, associated GOES class, and any\ninterplanetary radio signature. For our 321 events, the X-ray emission at 6 keV\nusually lasted longer than type III burst groups at frequencies greater than\n100 MHz. A weak correlation was found between the type III radio flux at\nfrequencies below 327 MHz and the X-ray intensity at 25-50 keV, with an absence\nof events at high X-ray intensity and low type III radio flux. Interplanetary\ntype III bursts less than 14 MHz were observed for 54 percent of the events,\nincreasing when events were observed with 25-50 keV X-rays.

If the\ndisrupted star formed in the burst or before, the post-burst age constrains its\nmass, generally excluding O, most B, and highly massive A stars. If the\nstarburst arose from a galaxy merger, the time since the starburst began limits\nthe coalescence timescale and thus the merger mass ratio to more equal than\n12:1 in most hosts. This uncommon ratio, if also that of the central\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH) binary, disfavors the scenario in which the TDE\nrate is boosted by the binary but is insensitive to its mass ratio. The stellar\nmass fraction created in the burst is 0.5-10% for most hosts, not enough to\nexplain the observed 30-200x boost in TDE rates, suggesting that the host's\ncore stellar concentration is more important.

Therefore they learn image features that\neffectively predict human visual quality judgments of inauthentic, and usually\nisolated (single) distortions. However, real-world images usually contain\ncomplex, composite mixtures of multiple distortions. We study the perceptually\nrelevant natural scene statistics of such authentically distorted images, in\ndifferent color spaces and transform domains. We propose a bag of feature-maps\napproach which avoids assumptions about the type of distortion(s) contained in\nan image, focusing instead on capturing consistencies, or departures therefrom,\nof the statistics of real world images. Using a large database of authentically\ndistorted images, human opinions of them, and bags of features computed on\nthem, we train a regressor to conduct image quality prediction. We demonstrate\nthe competence of the features towards improving automatic perceptual quality\nprediction by testing a learned algorithm using them on a benchmark legacy\ndatabase as well as on a newly introduced distortion-realistic resource called\nthe LIVE In the Wild Image Quality Challenge Database.

However, due to the inhomogeneities of the merged binary sample and\nthe relatively low statistical significance of the detected flux increase,\nthese findings are regarded as tentative only. More data are needed to prove\nthat the flux increase is real and is related to the processes of colliding\nmagnetospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2016 18:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

The behavior of\noptimization-based super-resolution methods is principally driven by the choice\nof the objective function. Recent work has largely focused on minimizing the\nmean squared reconstruction error. The resulting estimates have high peak\nsignal-to-noise ratios, but they are often lacking high-frequency details and\nare perceptually unsatisfying in the sense that they fail to match the fidelity\nexpected at the higher resolution.

To our\nknowledge, it is the first framework capable of inferring photo-realistic\nnatural images for 4x upscaling factors. To achieve this, we propose a\nperceptual loss function which consists of an adversarial loss and a content\nloss. The adversarial loss pushes our solution to the natural image manifold\nusing a discriminator network that is trained to differentiate between the\nsuper-resolved images and original photo-realistic images. In addition, we use\na content loss motivated by perceptual similarity instead of similarity in\npixel space. Our deep residual network is able to recover photo-realistic\ntextures from heavily downsampled images on public benchmarks. An extensive\nmean-opinion-score (MOS) test shows hugely significant gains in perceptual\nquality using SRGAN.

This scenario typically requires a large \"boost factor\" to be\nconsistent with a thermal relic dark matter candidate produced via freeze-out.\nHowever, such an explanation is disfavored by constraints from CMB observations\non energy deposition during the epoch of recombination. We discuss a scenario\ncalled late-decaying two-component dark matter (LD2DM), where the entire DM\nconsists of two semi-degenerate species. Within this framework, the heavier\nspecies is produced as a thermal relic in the early universe and decays to the\nlighter species over cosmological timescales. Consequently, the lighter species\nbecomes the DM which populates the universe today. We show that annihilation of\nthe lighter DM species with an enhanced cross-section, produced via such a\nnon-thermal mechanism, can explain the observed AMS-02 positron flux while\navoiding CMB constraints. The observed DM relic density can be correctly\nreproduced as well with simple s-wave annihilation cross-sections. We\ndemonstrate that the scenario is safe from CMB constraints on late-time energy\ndepositions during the cosmic \"dark ages\". Interestingly, structure formation\nconstraints force us to consider small mass splittings between the two dark\nmatter species. We explore possible cosmological and particle physics\nsignatures in a toy model that realizes this scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2016 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 18:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-12"}

Massive satellites can change the orbital barycentre of the\nhost-satellite system by tens of kiloparsecs and are cosmologically expected to\nharbor dwarf satellite galaxies of their own. Assessing the impact of these\neffects depends crucially on the orbital histories of the LMC and M33. Here, we\nrevisit the dynamics of the MW-LMC system and present the first detailed\nanalysis of the M31-M33 system utilizing high precision proper motions and\nstatistics from the dark matter-only Illustris cosmological simulation. With\nthe latest Hubble Space Telescope proper motion measurements of M31, we\nreliably constrain M33's interaction history with its host. In particular, like\nthe LMC, M33 is either on its first passage (t_{inf} < 2 Gyr ago) or if M31 is\nmassive (>=2x10^12 Msun), it is on a long period orbit of about 6 Gyr.\nCosmological analogs of the LMC and M33 identified in Illustris support this\npicture and provide further insight about their host masses. We conclude that,\ncosmologically, massive satellites like the LMC and M33 are likely completing\ntheir first orbits about their hosts.

Soon after coalescence, winds are\nlaunched from the merger remnant. In this paper, we use realistic wind profiles\nderived from global merger simulations in order to investigate the interaction\nof sGRB jets with these winds using numerical simulations. We analyze the\nconditions for which these axisymmetric winds permit relativistic jets to\nbreakout and produce a sGRB.

We\nalso use the observed durations of sGRB to place constraints on the lifetime of\nthe wind phase, which is determined by the time it takes the jet to breakout.\nIn all cases we find that the derived limits argue against completely stable\nremnants for binary neutron star mergers that produce sGRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2016 20:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

The\nlatter can extend to relatively large distances (up to 9 nm) and is enhanced\nwhen the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature is close to the measurement\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2016 20:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-10"}

A promising approach is\nto generate intelligent schedules that reduce the resource consumption while\nmaintaining best performance, or more interestingly, to trade off reduced\nresource consumption for a slightly lower but still acceptable level of\nperformance. In this paper, we provide a framework to aid designers in\nexploring such resource-performance trade-offs and finding schedules for mobile\nrobots, guided by questions such as \"what is the minimum resource budget\nrequired to achieve a given level of performance?\" The framework is based on a\nquantitative multi-objective verification technique which, for a collection of\npossibly conflicting objectives, produces the Pareto front that contains all\nthe optimal trade-offs that are achievable. The designer then selects a\nspecific Pareto point based on the resource constraints and desired performance\nlevel, and a correct-by-construction schedule that meets those constraints is\nautomatically generated. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on\nseveral robotic scenarios in both simulations and experiments with encouraging\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 00:18:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 14:43:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 07:02:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-12"}

Supervised ASAG techniques have been\ndemonstrated to be effective but suffer from a couple of key practical\nlimitations. They are greatly reliant on instructor provided model answers and\nneed labeled training data in the form of graded student answers for every\nassessment task. To overcome these, in this paper, we introduce an ASAG\ntechnique with two novel features. We propose an iterative technique on an\nensemble of (a) a text classifier of student answers and (b) a classifier using\nnumeric features derived from various similarity measures with respect to model\nanswers. Second, we employ canonical correlation analysis based transfer\nlearning on a common feature representation to build the classifier ensemble\nfor questions having no labelled data. The proposed technique handsomely beats\nall winning supervised entries on the SCIENTSBANK dataset from the Student\nResponse Analysis task of SemEval 2013.

A detailed comparison of this DBD\nignited in a so-called burst mode (i.e. where an AC voltage is applied during a\nlimited amount of time) and pure AC mode is carried out to evaluate their\neffect on the conversion of CO2 as well as on the energy efficiency.

Whatever their configuration (tubular or\nplanar), the presence of a dielectric barrier is mandatory to prevent too much\ncharge build up in the plasma and the formation of a thermal arc. In this\narticle, the role of the barrier thickness (2.0, 2.4 and 2.8 mm) and of the\nkind of dielectric material (alumina, mullite, pyrex, quartz) is investigated\non the filamentary behavior in the plasma and on the CO2 conversion in a\ntubular flowing DBD, by means of mass spectrometry measurements correlated with\nelectrical characterization and IR imaging. Increasing the barrier thickness\ndecreases the capacitance, while preserving the electrical charge. As a result,\nthe voltage over the dielectric increases and a larger number of\nmicrodischarges is generated, which enhances the CO2 conversion. Furthermore,\nchanging the dielectric material of the barrier, while keeping the same\ngeometry and dimensions, also affects the CO2 conversion. The highest CO2\nconversion and energy efficiency are obtained for quartz and alumina, thus not\nfollowing the trend of the relative permittivity. From the electrical\ncharacterization, we clearly demonstrate that the most important parameters are\nthe somewhat higher effective plasma voltage (yielding a somewhat higher\nelectric field and electron energy in the plasma) for quartz, as well as the\nhigher plasma current (and thus larger electron density) and the larger number\nof microdischarge filaments (mainly for alumina, but also for quartz).

Robots\noften fail due to unexpected events. In robot contact tasks are often design to\nempirically look for force thresholds to define state transitions in a Markov\nchain or finite state machines. Such design is prone to failure in unstructured\nenvironments, when due to external disturbances or erroneous models, such\nthresholds are met, and lead to state transitions that are false-positives. The\nfocus of this paper is to perform high-level state estimation of robot\nbehaviors and task output for robot contact tasks. Our approach encodes raw\nlow-level 3D cartesian trajectories and converts them into a high level (HL)\naction grammars. Cartesian trajectories can be segmented and encoded in a way\nthat their dynamic properties, or \"texture\" are preserved. Once an action\ngrammar is generated, a classifier is trained to detect current behaviors and\nultimately the task output. The system executed HL state estimation for task\noutput verification with an accuracy of 86%, and behavior monitoring with an\naverage accuracy of: 72%. The significance of the work is the transformation of\ndifficult-to-use raw low-level data to HL data that enables robust behavior and\ntask monitoring. Monitoring is useful for failure correction or other\ndeliberation in high-level planning, programming by demonstration, and\nhuman-robot interaction to name a few.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 08:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

In this work we present a principled\nmethodology to bootstrap robot introspection for contact tasks. In effect, we\nare trying to answer the question, what did the robot do? To this end, we\nhypothesize that all noisy wrench data inherently contains patterns that can be\neffectively represented by a vocabulary. The vocabulary is generated by\nmeaningfully segmenting the data and then encoding it. When the wrench\ninformation represents a sequence of sub-tasks, we can think of the vocabulary\nforming sets of words or sentences, such that each subtask is uniquely\nrepresented by a word set.

We do\nthis by analyzing the differences between multidimensional models, which\ninvolve fully self-consistent radiative transfer computations in the presence\nof spatial inhomogeneities and velocity fields, and those which rely on simple\none-dimensional geometry.

These binding\nzones act as traps. Our simulations show that the tracer can undergo normal yet\nnon-Gaussian diffusion under certain circumstances, e.g, when the polymers with\ntraps are frozen in space and the volume fraction and the binding strength of\nthe traps are moderate. In this case, as the tracer moves, it experiences a\nheterogeneous environment and exhibits confined continuous time random walk\n(CTRW) like motion resulting a non-Gaussian behavior. Also the long time\ndynamics becomes subdiffusive as the number or the binding strength of the\ntraps increases. However, if the polymers are mobile then the tracer dynamics\nis Gaussian but could be normal or subdiffusive depending on the number and the\nbinding strength of the traps. In addition, with increasing binding strength\nand the number of the polymer traps, the probability of the tracer being\ntrapped increases. On the other hand, removing the binding zones does not\nresult trapping, even at comparatively high crowding. Our simulations also show\nthat the trapping probability increases with the increasing size of the tracer\nand for a bigger tracer with the frozen polymer background the dynamics is only\nweakly non-Gaussian but highly subdiffusive. Our observations are in the same\nspirit as found in many recent experiments on tracer diffusion in polymeric\nmaterials and questions the validity of Gaussian theory to describe diffusion\nin crowded environment in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 11:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-22"}

Our aim\nis to test whether these two parameters can be safely applied in multiplanet\nsystems in binaries or if their predictions fail for particular binary orbital\nconfigurations. We have used the frequency map analysis (FMA) to measure the\ndiffusion of orbits in the phase space as an indicator of chaotic behaviour.\nFirst we revisited the reliability of the empirical formula computing ac in the\ncase of single planets in binaries and we find that, in some cases, it\nunderestimates by 10-20% the real outer limit of stability. For two planet\nsystems, the value of Delta is close to that computed for planets around single\nstars, but the level of chaoticity close to it substantially increases for\nsmaller semimajor axes and higher eccentricities of the binary orbit. In these\nconfigurations ac also begins to be unreliable and non linear secular\nresonances with the stellar companion lead to chaotic behaviour well within ac,\neven for single planet systems. For two planet systems, the superposition of\nmean motion resonances, either mutual or with the binary companion, and non\nlinear secular resonances may lead to chaotic behaviour in all cases.

It is based on the multidimensional model,\nwhere data can be seen as a cube, where each cell contains one or more measures\ncan be aggregated along dimensions. Despite the extensive corpus of work in the\nfield, a standard language for OLAP is still needed, since there is no\nwell-defined, accepted semantics, for many of the usual OLAP operations. In\nthis paper, we address this problem, and present a set of operations for\nmanipulating a data cube.

We express these operations as a sequence of\natomic transformations over a fixed multidimensional matrix, whose cells\ncontain a sequence of measures. Each atomic transformation produces a new\nmeasure. When a sequence of transformations defines an OLAP operation, a flag\nis produced indicating which cells must be considered as input for the next\noperation. In this way, an elegant algebra is defined. Our main contribution,\nwith respect to other similar efforts in the field is that, for the first time,\na formal proof of the correctness of the operations is given, thus providing a\nclear semantics for them.

The approximation\nproblem of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral $\\int_a^b {f\\left( t \\right)du\\left(\nt \\right)}$ in terms of the Riemann-Stieltjes sums have been considered\nrecently by many authors. However, a small attention and a few works have been\nconsidered for mappings of two variables; i.e., The approximation problem of\nthe Riemann-Stieltjes double integral $\\int_a^b {\\int_c^d {f\\left( {t,s}\n\\right)d_s d_t u\\left( {t,s} \\right)} }$ in terms of the Riemann-Stieltjes\ndouble sums.

Recent modelling on COM\nchemistry at low temperatures has provided new insight into these processes\npredicting that COM formation depends strongly on parameters such as visual\nextinction and the level of CO freeze out. We report deep observations of COMs\ntoward two positions in the L1544 pre-stellar core: the dense,\nhighly-extinguished continuum peak with Av>=30 mag within the inner 2700 au;\nand a low-density shell with average Av~7.5-8 mag located at 4000 au from the\ncore's center and bright in CH3OH.

Other COMs such as CH3OCHO, c-C3H2O, HCCCHO, CH2CHCN\nand HCCNC show slight enhancements (by factors <=3) but the associated\nuncertainties are large. This suggests that COMs are actively formed and\nalready present in the low-density shells of pre-stellar cores. The modelling\nof the chemistry of O-bearing COMs in L1544 indicates that these species are\nenhanced in this shell because i) CO starts freezing out onto dust grains\ndriving an active surface chemistry; ii) the visual extinction is sufficiently\nhigh to prevent the UV photo-dissociation of COMs by the external interstellar\nradiation field; and iii) the density is still moderate to prevent severe\ndepletion of COMs onto grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 13:31:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

Should specimens of\nthis population be discovered transiting relatively bright and nearby brown\ndwarfs, the Jupiter-size and the low luminosity of their hosts would make them\nexquisite targets for detailed atmospheric characterisation with JWST and\nfuture ground-based facilities. The eventual discovery and detailed study of a\nsignificant sample of transiting terrestrial planets orbiting nearby brown\ndwarfs could prove to be useful not only for comparative exoplanetology but\nalso for astrobiology, by bringing us key information on the physical\nrequirements and timescale for the emergence of life.\n  In this context, we present a search for transit-signals in archival\ntime-series photometry acquired by the Spitzer Space Telescope for a sample of\n44 nearby brown dwarfs. While these 44 targets were not particularly selected\nfor their brightness, the high precision of their Spitzer light curves allows\nus to reach sensitivities below Earth-sized planets for 75% of the sample and\ndown to Europa-sized planets on the brighter targets. We could not identify any\nunambiguous planetary signal. Instead, we could compute the first limits on the\npresence of planets on close-in orbits. We find that within a 1.28 day orbit,\nthe occurrence rate of planets with a radius between 0.75 and 3.25 R$_\\oplus$\nis {\\eta} < 67 $\\pm$ 1%.

The affine inequalities serve as cuts to\nget rid of points outside of the feasible region of AC OPF with semi-definite\nprogramming (SDP) relaxation. Hence, the affine inequalities are names as SDP\ncuts. While AC OPF with SDP relaxation has a high computational complexity, AC\nOPF with SOCP has a much lower computational complexity. Recent research has\nfound that the feasible region of SDP relaxation is contained inside the\nfeasible region of the SOCP relaxation. Therefore, the integration of SDP cuts\ninto SOCP relaxation provides better scalability compared to the SDP relaxation\nand a tighter gap compared to the SOCP relaxation. The SDP cuts are generated\nby solving least square estimation (LSE) problems at cycle basis and further\nexploring the geometric characteristic of LSE.

In the coupled corona, transition\nregion and chromosphere system, an enhanced downward conductive flux results in\nan upflow (chromospheric evaporation). However, obtaining the correct upflow\ngenerally requires high spatial resolution in order to resolve the transition\nregion. With an unresolved transition region, artificially low coronal\ndensities are obtained because the downward heat flux jumps across the\nunresolved region to the chromosphere, underestimating the upflows. Here, we\ntreat the lower transition region as a discontinuity that responds to changing\ncoronal conditions through the imposition of a jump condition that is derived\nfrom an integrated form of energy conservation. To illustrate and benchmark\nthis approach against a fully resolved one-dimensional model, we present\nfield-aligned simulations of coronal loops in response to a range of impulsive\n(spatially uniform) heating events. We show that our approach leads to a\nsignificant improvement in the coronal density evolution than just when using\ncoarse spatial resolutions insufficient to resolve the lower transition region.\nOur approach compensates for the jumping of the heat flux by imposing a\nvelocity correction that ensures that the energy from the heat flux goes into\ndriving the transition region dynamics, rather than being lost through\nradiation. Hence, it is possible to obtain improved coronal densities. The\nadvantages of using this approach in both one-dimensional hydrodynamic and\nthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 14:25:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 11:25:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 May 2017 08:05:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-15"}

The devices deployed in the\nnetwork are partitioned into clusters according to some pre-defined criteria.\nMoreover, the devices in each cluster are assigned a unique signature of a\nparticular design that can be used to indicate their active status to the\nnetwork. The proposed scheme in this work mainly consists of two essential\nsteps: (i) The base station (BS) detects the active clusters and the number of\nactive devices in each cluster using a novel block sketching algorithm, and\nthen assigns a certain amount of resources accordingly. (ii) Each active device\ndetects its ranking among all the active devices in its cluster using an\nenhanced greedy algorithm and accesses the corresponding resource for\ntransmission based on the ranking. By exploiting the correlation in the device\nbehaviors and the sparsity in the activation pattern of the M2M devices, the\ndevice detection problem is thus tackled as a CS support recovery procedure for\na particular binary block-sparse signal $x\\in\\mathbb{B}^N$ -- with block\nsparsity $K_B$ and in-block sparsity $K_I$ over block size $d$.

Modern applications involve heavy batch processing\njobs over large volumes of data and at the same time require efficient ad-hoc\ninteractive analytics on temporary data. Existing solutions, however, typically\nfocus on one of these two aspects, largely ignoring the need for synergy\nbetween the two. Consequently, interactive queries need to re-iterate costly\npasses through the entire dataset (e.g., data loading) that may provide\nmeaningful return on investment only when data is queried over a long period of\ntime. In this paper, we propose DiNoDB, an interactive-speed query engine for\nad-hoc queries on temporary data. DiNoDB avoids the expensive loading and\ntransformation phase that characterizes both traditional RDBMSs and current\ninteractive analytics solutions. It is tailored to modern workflows found in\nmachine learning and data exploration use cases, which often involve iterations\nof cycles of batch and interactive analytics on data that is typically useful\nfor a narrow processing window. The key innovation of DiNoDB is to piggyback on\nthe batch processing phase the creation of metadata that DiNoDB exploits to\nexpedite the interactive queries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that\nDiNoDB achieves very good performance for a wide range of ad-hoc queries\ncompared to alternatives %such as Hive, Stado, SparkSQL and Impala.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 14:56:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-19"}

A\nlaboratory-scale device was built that utilizes a surface-piercing stainless\nsteel belt that travels in a loop around two vertical rollers, with one length\nof the belt between the rollers acting as a horizontally-moving flat wall. The\nbelt is accelerated suddenly from rest until reaching constant speed in order\nto create a temporally-evolving boundary layer analogous to the\nspatially-evolving boundary layer that would exist along a surface-piercing\ntowed flat plate. Surface profiles are measured with a cinematic laser-induced\nfluorescence system and sub-surface velocity fields are recorded using a\nhigh-speed planar particle image velocimetry system. It is found that the belt\ninitially travels through the water without creating any significant waves,\nbefore the free surface bursts with activity close to the belt surface. These\nfree surface ripples travel away from the belt before appearing to become\nfreely-propagating waves. From sub-surface velocity measurements, it is found\nthat close to the surface, transition to turbulence happens sooner than far\nfrom the surface, leading to an overall thicker boundary layer in the vicinity\nof the free surface.

More precisely, the increase in organized complexity refers\nhere to the wealth, variety and intricacy of structures, and should not be\nconfused with the increase of random complexity, formalized by Kolmogorov\n(1965). If Bennett is right in proposing to assimilate organized complexity\nwith \"computational content\", then the fundamental cause of the increase of\ncomplexity in the universe is the existence of computing mechanisms with\nmemory, and able to cumulatively create and preserve computational contents. In\nthis view, the universe computes, remembers its calculations, and reuses them\nto conduct further computations. Evolutionary mechanisms are such forms of\ncumulative computation with memory and we owe them the organized complexity of\nlife. Language, writing, culture, science and technology can also be analyzed\nas computation mechanisms generating, preserving and accelerating the increase\nin organized complexity. The main unifying theme for big history is the energy\nrate density, a metric based on thermodynamics.

The concept of \"logical depth\" provides a new lens to\nexamine the increase of organized complexity.

(ii) FP is easily and smoothly generalized into the Great Silence\nparadox, so it makes no sense either theoretically or empirically to separate\nthe two. (iii) In sharp contrast to the main implication of Gray's paper, FP\nhas become more aggravated lately due to advances in astrobiology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 14:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-03"}

The analogy between these two physical\nsystems is complete, as it is not restricted to one of the two Maxwell's\nequation couples in the vacuum, but generalized to the two equation couples as\nwell as to the diverse phenomena of dielectric polarization and magnetization\nof matter, just as to the electrical charges and the electrical currents. The\neulerian approach of the solid lattice developed here includes Maxwell's\nequations as a special case, since it stems from a tensor theory, which is\nreduced to a vector one by contraction on the tensor indices. Considering the\ntensor aspect of the eulerian solid lattice deformation theory, the analogy can\nbe extended to other physical phenomena than electromagnetism, a point which is\nshortly discussed at the end of the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 07:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}
