Strongly\nemitting sources belong to the edge-brightened FR II class, and weakly emitting\nsources to the edge-darkened FR I class. The origin of this dichotomy is not\nyet fully understood. Numerical simulations are successful in generating FR II\nmorphologies, but they fail to reproduce the diffuse structure of FR Is.\n  By means of hydro-dynamical 3D simulations of supersonic jets, we investigate\nhow the displayed morphologies depend on the jet parameters. Bow shocks and\nMach disks at the jet head, which are probably responsible for the hot spots in\nthe FR II sources, disappear for a jet kinetic power L_kin < 10^43 erg/s. This\nthreshold compares favorably with the luminosity at which the FR I/FR II\ntransition is observed.\n  The problem is addressed by numerical means carrying out 3D HD simulations of\nsupersonic jets that propagate in a non-homogeneous medium with the ambient\ntemperature that increases with distance from the jet origin, which maintains\nconstant pressure.\n  The jet energy in the lower power sources, instead of being deposited at the\nterminal shock, is gradually dissipated by the turbulence. The jets spread out\nwhile propagating, and they smoothly decelerate while mixing with the ambient\nmedium and produce the plumes characteristic of FR I objects.\n  Three-dimensionality is an essential ingredient to explore the FR I evolution\nbecause the properties of turbulence in two and three dimensions are very\ndifferent, since there is no energy cascade to small scales in two dimensions,\nand two-dimensional simulations with the same parameters lead to FRII-like\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2016 17:06:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2016 13:24:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 08:38:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 16:39:19 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 08:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

Most\nstate-of-the-art approaches for extreme multi-label classification attempt to\ncapture correlation among labels by embedding the label matrix to a\nlow-dimensional linear sub-space. However, in the presence of power-law\ndistributed extremely large and diverse label spaces, structural assumptions\nsuch as low rank can be easily violated.\n  In this work, we present DiSMEC, which is a large-scale distributed framework\nfor learning one-versus-rest linear classifiers coupled with explicit capacity\ncontrol to control model size.

Because of\nthe nature of proton-proton processes, observables based on the measurement of\nthe direction and energy of leptons provide the most precise signatures.\n  In the present paper, we concentrate on the angular distribution of leptons\nfrom W to l nu decays in the lepton-pair rest-frame. The vector nature of the\nintermediate state imposes that distributions are to a good precision described\nby spherical polynomials of at most second order. We argue, that contrary to\ngeneral belief often expressed in the literature, the full set of angular\ncoefficients can be measured experimentally, despite the presence in the final\nstate of neutrino escaping detection. There is thus no principle difference\nwith respect to the phenomenology of the Z/gamma to l^+ l^- Drell-Yan process.\n  We show also, that with the proper choice of the coordinate frames, only one\ncoefficient in this polynomial decomposition remains sizable, even in the\npresence of one or more high p_T jets. The necessary stochastic choice of the\nframes relies on probabilities independent from any coupling constants. In this\nway, electroweak effects (dominated by the V-A nature of W couplings to\nfermions) can be better separated from the ones of strong interactions. The\nseparation is convenient for the measurements interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2016 19:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

In such scenarios, both the dark and visible sectors are\npopulated after inflation, but with independent temperatures.

Central to this phenomenon are Hamiltonians whose insulating gap is\ncontrolled by a multi-dimensional (usually two-dimensional) parameter space in\nwhich paths can be defined for adiabatic changes in the Hamiltonian, i.e.,\nwithout closing the gap. Here, we extend the concept of Thouless pumps of band\ninsulators by considering a larger, three-dimensional parameter space. We show\nthat the connectivity of this parameter space is crucial for defining quantum\npumps, demonstrating that, as opposed to the conventional two-dimensional case,\npumped quantities depend not only on the initial and final points of\nHamiltonian evolution but also on the class of the chosen path and preserved\nsymmetries.

As explicit examples, we consider\nmodels similar to simple models used to describe topological insulators, but\nwith doubled degrees of freedom compared to a minimal topological insulator\nmodel.

Many interesting problems in mathematics can be formulated,\ncomputed, or can find their equivalence in terms of Ext-groups. For instance,\nimportant (co)homology theories, such as the Mac Lane cohomology for rings or\nthe Hochschild and cyclic homology of commutative algebras can be defined as\nExt-groups in suitable functor categories; homotopical invariants can also gain\ninformation from homological data with the help of the unstable Adams spectral\nsequence, whose input takes the form of Ext-groups in the category of unstable\nmodules over the Steenrod algebra.

The most essential benefit of such logical KBs is the opportunity to\nperform automatic reasoning which however requires a KB to meet some minimal\nquality criteria such as consistency. Without adequate tool assistance, the\ntask of resolving such violated quality criteria in a KB can be extremely hard,\nespecially when the problematic KB is large and complex. To this end,\ninteractive KB debuggers have been introduced which ask a user queries whether\ncertain statements must or must not hold in the intended domain. The given\nanswers help to gradually restrict the search space for KB repairs.\n  Existing interactive debuggers often rely on a pool-based strategy for query\ncomputation. A pool of query candidates is precomputed, from which the best\ncandidate according to some query quality criterion is selected to be shown to\nthe user. This often leads to the generation of many unnecessary query\ncandidates and thus to a high number of expensive calls to logical reasoning\nservices. We tackle this issue by an in-depth mathematical analysis of diverse\nreal-valued active learning query selection measures in order to determine\nqualitative criteria that make a query favorable.

Therefore, there is no temperature\ngradient in the solid, which seems to transport the heat without getting heated\nitself. Ballistic transport is typically seen in high purity crystals at either\ntemperatures below ~10 K, or physical size below ~100 nm, where the mean free\npath of the carrier is larger than the solid itself. In this letter, we show\nevidence of ballistic transport at room temperature in lithium niobate wafers\nin the in-plane and cross-plane directions under both steady state and high\nfrequency heating that are monitored using both infrared and resistance\nthermometry. We report phonon mean free path in lithium niobate around 425\nmicrons, which is about 50 times higher than the largest phonon mean free path\nin the literature at room temperature. Above this length-scale, temperature\ngradient gradually emerges and the material shows completely diffusive, bulk\ntransport at about 4 mm length. Our observations will impact phonon-based\nelectronics such as thermal transistor, thermal logic gate and memory currently\nimpossible at room temperature. If 1 micron electron mean free path in graphene\ngives the highest-mobility, the 425 microns mean free path of phonons in this\nresearch may realize phononics without any need for nanoscale size or\nultra-cold temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2016 20:56:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-12"}

One way to extract such predictions is from\ntheory-generated probability distributions that allow for selection\neffects---generally expressed in terms of assumptions about anthropic\nconditionalization and how typical we are. In this paper, I urge three lessons\nabout typicality in multiverse settings. (i) Because it is difficult to\ncharacterize our observational situation in the multiverse, we cannot assume\nthat we are typical (as in the 'principle of mediocrity'): nor can we ignore\nthe issue of typicality, for it has a measurable impact on predictions for our\nobservations. (ii) There are spectra of assumptions about both\nconditionalization and typicality, which lead to coincident predictions for our\nobservations, leading to problems of confirmation in multiverse cosmology. And\nmoreover, (iii) when one has the freedom to consider competing theories of the\nmultiverse, the assumption of typicality may not lead to the highest\nlikelihoods for our observations. These three entwined aspects of typicality\nimply that positive assertions about our typicality, such as the 'principle of\nmediocrity', are more questionable than has been recently claimed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2016 20:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-12"}

A network composed of a single\nmobile network operator (MNO) and multiple CPs is considered. The MNO aims to\ndefine the price it charges the CPs to maximize its revenue while the CPs\ncompete to determine the number of files they cache at the MNO's small base\nstations (SBSs) to improve the quality of service (QoS) of their users.

The\nfollowers game is modeled as a non-cooperative game and both the existence and\nuniqueness of a Nash equilibrium (NE) are proved. The closed-form expression of\nthe NE which corresponds to the amount of storage each CP requests from the MNO\nis derived. An optimization problem is formulated at the MNO side to determine\nthe optimal price that the MNO should charge the CPs.

In this paper, we\nconsider a class of flow problems in high contrast heterogeneous media, and\ndevelop a systematic approach to obtain an enriched multiscale mortar space.\nOur approach is based on the constructions of local multiscale basis functions.\nThe multiscale basis functions are constructed from local problems by following\nthe framework of the Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM). In\nparticular, we first create a local snapshot space. Then we select the\ndominated modes within the snapshot space using an appropriate Proper\nOrthogonal Decomposition (POD) technique.

Using the\nproposed multiscale mortar space, we will construct a multiscale finite element\nmethod to solve the flow problem on a coarse grid and a preconditioning\ntechnique for the fine scale discretization of the flow problem.

Compared to the benchmark community detection\nmethods, D-GT more accurately predicts the number of communities and finds\ncommunity assignments with a higher normalized mutual information, while\nretaining a good modularity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2016 23:56:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 02:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-13"}

Each edge is associated with a demand and each vertex is\nassociated with a weight (cost), a capacity, and an available multiplicity. The\nobjective is to find a minimum-weight vertex multiset such that the demands of\nthe edges can be covered by the capacities of the vertices and the multiplicity\nof each vertex does not exceed its available multiplicity.\n  In this paper we present an $O(f)$ bi-approximation for VC-HC that gives a\ntrade-off on the number of augmented multiplicity and the cost of the resulting\ncover. In particular, we show that, by augmenting the available multiplicity by\na factor of $k \\ge 2$, a~cover with a cost ratio of\n$\\Big(1+\\frac{1}{k-1}\\Big)(f-1)$ to the optimal cover for the original instance\ncan be obtained. This improves over a previous result, which has a cost ratio\nof $f^2$ via augmenting the available multiplicity by a factor of $f$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2016 02:20:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-12"}

However, existing work so far has two severe limitations that\nprevent its use in some domains. Firstly, it is completely unsupervised which\nis undesirable for a number of reasons.

To this end, we design a maximum likelihood (ML) estimator to optimally\nextract the path information and the associated probability of error from the\nincreasing number of channel measurements. Based on the ML estimator, the\nalgorithm is able to measure the channel using a variable number of beam\npatterns until the receiver believes that the estimated direction is correct.\nThis is in contrast to the existing mmWave channel estimation algorithms, in\nwhich the number of measurements is typically fixed.

Microlensing variability is caused by\nthe motions of the observer, the lens galaxy (including the motion of the stars\nwithin the galaxy), and the source; hence, its frequency is directly related to\nthe galaxy's transverse peculiar velocity. The idea is to count time-event\nrates (e.g., peak or caustic crossing rates) in the observed microlensing light\ncurves of lensed quasars that can be compared with model predictions for\ndifferent values of the transverse peculiar velocity. To compensate for the\nlarge time-scale of microlensing variability we propose to count and model the\nnumber of events in an ensemble of gravitational lenses.

A number of ground-based observations has been made in the\nsecond half of the XIXth century leading to controversial results mainly due to\nthe difficulty to disentangle between the solar and atmospheric effects.\nDedicated space measurements yield to a very faint dependence of the solar\ndiameter with time. New studies over the entire radiation spectrum lead to a\nclear relationship between the solar diameter and the wavelength, reflecting\nthe height at which the lines are formed. Thus the absolute value of the solar\ndiameter, which is a reference for many astrophysical applications, must be\nstated according to the wavelength.

The\naverage number of species as a function of area has a steep initial increase,\nfollowed by decreasing slopes at large scales. Finally, if we find a species in\na given location, it is more likely we find an individual of the same species\nclose-by, rather than farther apart. Such spatial turnover depends on the\ngeographical distribution of species, which often are spatially aggregated.\nThis reverberates on the abundances as well as the richness of species within a\nregion, but so far it has been difficult to quantify such relationships. Within\na neutral framework, which considers all individuals competitively equivalent,\nwe introduce a spatial stochastic model, which phenomenologically accounts for\nbirth, death, immigration and local dispersal of individuals. We calculate the\npair correlation function, which encapsulates spatial turnover, and the\nconditional probability to find a species with a certain population within a\ngiven circular area. Also, we calculate the macro-ecological patterns, which we\nhave referred to above, and compare the analytical formul{\\ae} with the\nnumerical integration of the model.

The modified formalism is applied to dislocations\nmoving uniformly in an anisotropic medium. In practice, accounting for\ncausality amounts to a simple analytic continuation procedure whereby to the\ndislocation velocity is added an infinitesimal positive imaginary part. This\ndevice allows for a straightforward computation of velocity-dependent field\nexpressions that are valid whatever the dislocation velocity ---including\nsupersonic regimes--- without needing to consider subsonic and supersonic cases\nseparately. As an illustration, the distortion field of a Somigliana\ndislocation of the Peierls-Nabarro-Eshelby-type with finite-width core is\ncomputed analytically, starting from the Green tensor of elastodynamics.

Exact expressions for the\ngenerating functions are obtained for $r \\leq 6$, as well as the asymptotic\nbehavior of the meandric numbers for general $r$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2016 12:06:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2017 08:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-12-02"}

We study the K2\nsuperstamps covering the M35 and Neptune/Nereid fields observed in the long\ncadence (29.4-min sampling) mode. Asteroid light curves are generated by\napplying elongated apertures. We use the Lomb-Scargle method to find\nperiodicities due to rotation. We derived K2 light curves of 924 main-belt\nasteroids in the M35 field, and 96 in the path of Neptune and Nereid. The light\ncurves are quasi-continuous and several days long. K2 observations are\nsensitive to longer rotational periods than usual ground-based surveys.\nRotational periods are derived for 26 main-belt asteroids for the first time.\nThe asteroid sample is dominated by faint (>20 mag) objects. Due to the\nfaintness of the asteroids and the high density of stars in the M35 field, only\n4.0% of the asteroids with at least 12 data points show clear periodicities or\ntrend signalling a long rotational period, as opposed to 15.9% in the less\ncrowded Neptune field.

Like several other German physicists\nHeisenberg was drafted by German Army Ordnance when war began in Europe in\nSeptember 1939 to investigate whether the energy from splitting Uranium nuclei\nby neutrons could be used for technical and military purposes. Heisenberg found\nthat this is possible in principle but that military use would require such\nenormous industrial expenditures that it would take many years and would be\nimpracticable while the war lasted. The project was therefore dropped by the\nNazi government in 1942. Heisenberg even refrained from calculating a precise\nvalue for the critical mass of U 235. He was relieved that he was thus spared a\nmoral decision between obeying an order to build the bomb or risking his life\nby refusing to be involved in the project or sabotaging it. He was happy to be\nconfined to a project of building a small test reactor under civilian\nadministration that the government had approved. In 1941 Heisenberg tried to\nget the opinion of Niels Bohr in Copenhagen on what the international community\nof nuclear physicist could possibly do or prevent regarding the long-range\ntechnical feasibility of making nuclear weapons. Bohr completely misunderstood\nthe cautious approach of Heisenberg.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2016 12:58:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-12"}

The influence\nof the in-medium effects on the $K^*$ dynamics at RHIC energies is rather\nmodest due to their dominant production at low baryon densities (but high meson\ndensities), however, it increases with decreasing beam energy. Moreover, we\nfind that the additional cut on the invariant mass region of the $K^*$ further\ninfluences the shape and the height of the final spectra.

Meanwhile, it generalizes the notion of core-EP inverse, introduced by\nManjunatha Prasad and Mohana for matrices in 2014, to the case of $*$-ring.\nSome equivalent characterizations for elements in $R$ to be pseudo core\ninvertible are given and expressions are presented especially in terms of\nDrazin inverse and \\{1,3\\}-inverse. Then, we investigate the relationship\nbetween pseudo core inverse and other generalized inverses. Further, we\nestablish several properties of the pseudo core inverse. Finally, the\ncomputations for pseudo core inverses of matrices are exhibited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2016 14:02:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 09:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

This is in contrast to other low-complexity methods in the\nliterature, such as the non-convex alternating directions method of multipliers\n(ADMM), for which no such guarantees are known for this class of problems. By\ninterpreting the PWA dynamics as a union of polyhedra we can exploit the\nproblem structure and develop an algorithm based on operator splitting\nprocedures. Our algorithm departs from the traditional MIP formulation, and\nleads to a simple, embeddable method that only requires matrix-vector\nmultiplications and small-scale projections onto polyhedra. We illustrate the\nefficacy of the method on two numerical examples, achieving good closed-loop\nperformance with computational times several orders of magnitude smaller\ncompared to state-of-the-art MIP solvers. Moreover, it is competitive with ADMM\nin terms of suboptimality and computation time, but additionally provides local\noptimality and local convergence guarantees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2016 14:54:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2017 14:51:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2017 13:47:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 24 Aug 2018 13:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

Among all fluid variables (at the time\nscale under consideration), only the tetrad component of the anisotropic tensor\nin the subspace orthogonal to the four--velocity and the Killing vector of\naxial symmetry, shows signs of dynamic evolution. Also, the first step toward a\ndissipative regime begins with a non--vanishing time derivative of the heat\nflux component along the meridional direction. The magnetic part of the Weyl\ntensor vanishes (not so its time derivative), indicating that the emission of\ngravitational radiation will occur at later times. Finally, the decreasing of\nthe effective inertial mass density, associated to thermal effects, is clearly\nillustrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2016 15:51:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 15:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}
