The Monte Carlo\nerror of the bridge sampling estimator is determined by the amount of overlap\nbetween the two densities. In the case of uni-modal densities, Warp-I, II, and\nIII transformations (Meng and Schilling, 2002) are effective for increasing the\ninitial overlap, but they are less so for multi-modal densities. This paper\nintroduces Warp-U transformations that aim to transform multi-modal densities\ninto Uni-modal ones without altering their normalizing constants. The\nconstruction of a Warp-U transformation starts with a Normal (or other\nconvenient) mixture distribution $\\phi_{\\text{mix}}$ that has reasonable\noverlap with the target density $p$, whose normalizing constant is unknown. The\nstochastic transformation that maps $\\phi_{\\text{mix}}$ back to its generating\ndistribution $N(0,1)$ is then applied to $p$ yielding its Warp-U version, which\nwe denote $\\tilde{p}$. Typically, $\\tilde{p}$ is uni-modal and has\nsubstantially increased overlap with $N(0,1)$. Furthermore, we prove that the\noverlap between $\\tilde{p}$ and $N(0,1)$ is guaranteed to be no less than the\noverlap between $p$ and $\\phi_{\\text{mix}}$, in terms of any $f$-divergence. We\npropose a computationally efficient method to find an appropriate\n$\\phi_{\\text{mix}}$, and a simple but effective approach to remove the bias\nwhich results from estimating the normalizing constants and fitting\n$\\phi_{\\text{mix}}$ with the same data. We illustrate our findings using 10 and\n50 dimensional highly irregular multi-modal densities, and demonstrate how\nWarp-U sampling can be used to improve the final estimation step of the\nGeneralized Wang-Landau algorithm (Liang, 2005), a powerful sampling and\nestimation method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2016 02:10:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Jun 2019 13:46:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-11"}

The asymptotic properties of the empirical independence\nprocess based on covariates and estimated residuals are investigated. In\nparticular an asymptotic expansion and weak convergence to a Gaussian process\nare proved. The results can, on the one hand, be applied to test for validity\nof the location-scale model. On the other hand, they allow to derive various\nspecification tests in conditional quantile location-scale models. In detail a\ntest for monotonicity of the conditional quantile curve is investigated. For\nthe test for validity of the location-scale model as well as for the\nmonotonicity test smooth residual bootstrap versions of Kolmogorov-Smirnov and\nCramer-von Mises type test statistics are suggested. We give rigorous proofs\nfor bootstrap versions of the weak convergence results. The performance of the\ntests is demonstrated in a simulation study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2016 03:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}

A\ngeostatistical model captures spatial discrepancy: the difference in spatial\nstructure between simulated and actual values. An emulator represents the\nintensity discrepancy: the bias in simulated values of given intensity.\nMeasurement error is also represented. Gaussian process priors represent each\nsource of error, which gives an analytical expression for the posterior\ndistribution for the actual spatial field.\n  Actual footprints for 50 European windstorms, which represent maximum wind\ngust speeds on a grid over a 72-hour period, are derived from wind gust speed\nmeasurements taken at stations across Europe and output simulated from a\ndownscaled version of the Met Office Unified Model. The derived footprints have\nrealistic spatial structure, and gust speeds closer to the measurements than\noriginally simulated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2016 08:32:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}

This setting offers the opportunity of improving the system\nperformance by employing multiple channel uses to convey a single message\n(output plant observation or control input). Common ways of doing so are\nthrough either repeating the message, or by quantizing it to a number of bits\nand then transmitting a channel coded version of the bits whose length is\ncommensurate with the number of channel uses per sampled message. We argue that\nsuch \"separated source and channel coding\" can be suboptimal and propose to\nperform joint source-channel coding. Since the block length is short we obviate\nthe need to go to the digital domain altogether and instead consider analog\njoint source-channel coding.

It is based on the Discrete\nCosine Transform Interpolation Filter (DCTIF). The proposed architecture\ncombines simple arithmetic operations on stored samples of the hyperbolic\ntangent function and on input data. The proposed DCTIF implementation achieves\ntwo orders of magnitude greater precision than previous work while using the\nsame or fewer computational resources. Various combinations of DCTIF parameters\ncan be chosen to tradeoff the accuracy and complexity of the hyperbolic tangent\nfunction. In one case, the proposed architecture approximates the hyperbolic\ntangent activation function with 10E-5 maximum error while requiring only 1.52\nKbits memory and 57 LUTs of a Virtex-7 FPGA. We also discuss how the activation\nfunction accuracy affects the performance of DNNs in terms of their training\nand testing accuracies. We show that a high accuracy approximation can be\nnecessary in order to maintain the same DNN training and testing performances\nrealized by the exact function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2016 14:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}

The arguments for rejection, one\nof the most substantive coming from Bell himself, are critically reviewed. In\nparticular, analysis of Bell's argument reveals an implicit unwarranted\nassumption: that the Euclidean metric is the appropriate yardstick for\nmeasuring distances in state space. Bell's argument is largely negated if this\nyardstick is instead based on the alternative $p$-adic metric. Such a metric,\ncommon in number theory, arises naturally when describing chaotic systems which\nevolve precisely on self-similar invariant sets in their state space. A\nlocally-causal realistic model of quantum entanglement is developed, based on\nthe premise that the laws of physics ultimately derive from an invariant-set\ngeometry in the state space of a deterministic quasi-cyclic mono-universe.\nBased on this, the notion of a complex Hilbert vector is reinterpreted in terms\nof an uncertain selection from a finite sample space of states, leading to a\nnovel form of `consistent histories' based on number-theoretic properties of\nthe transcendental cosine function. This leads to novel realistic\ninterpretations of position/momentum non-commutativity, EPR, the Bell Theorem\nand the Tsirelson bound. In this inherently holistic theory - neither\nconspiratorial, retrocausal, fine tuned nor nonlocal - superdeterminism is not\ninvoked by fiat but is emergent from these `consistent histories'\nnumber-theoretic constraints.

In its standard form, the\ntraveler changes velocity only at the destination of the trip, so that he\nappears to perceive an improbably instantaneous and non-continuous change in\nage of the stationary twin. In this work, a smooth velocity/acceleration\nprofile is used that allows the abrupt velocity-change case as a limit. All\ngravitational effects are ignored in this treatment. Aside from mutual\nperception of simultaneous clock times in an accelerating frame, constant\ncommunication of clock times between the twins by means of (digital) light\nsignals is shown to be possible, in principle if not in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2016 08:24:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}
