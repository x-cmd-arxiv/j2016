The equation is\ntransformed into the Fokker-Plank equation, and the solution demonstrates a\ntransform of population distribution from the normal Gaussian distribution to a\nshifted power law.

They have simultaneously generated a number of controversies,\nparticularly as to whether young star clusters may have the same origin as old\nglobular clusters. In addition, extensive studies have revealed that the SSP\nscenario does not seem to hold for some intermediate-age and young star\nclusters either, thus making the origin of multiple stellar populations in star\nclusters even more complicated.

Most of these have\nfocused on the discrete setting, even though in many applications the input\nsignal is continuous and naive discretization significantly worsens the\nsparsity level.\n  We present an algorithm for robustly computing sparse Fourier transforms in\nthe continuous setting. Let $x(t) = x^*(t) + g(t)$, where $x^*$ has a\n$k$-sparse Fourier transform and $g$ is an arbitrary noise term. Given sample\naccess to $x(t)$ for some duration $T$, we show how to find a\n$k$-Fourier-sparse reconstruction $x'(t)$ with\n  $$\\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T |x'(t) - x(t) |^2 \\mathrm{d} t \\lesssim\n\\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T | g(t)|^2 \\mathrm{d}t.$$\n  The sample complexity is linear in $k$ and logarithmic in the signal-to-noise\nratio and the frequency resolution. Previous results with similar sample\ncomplexities could not tolerate an infinitesimal amount of i.i.d.

We find a large repertoire of\npossible nonequilibrium steady states as a function of the shear rate and of\nthe anchoring of the nematic director field at the droplet surface. We first\ndiscuss homeotropic anchoring. For weak anchoring, we recover the typical\nbehaviour of a sheared isotropic droplet in a binary fluid, which rotates,\nstretches and can be broken by the applied flow. For intermediate anchoring,\nnew possibilities arise due to elastic effects in the nematic fluid. We find\nthat in this regime the 2D droplet can tilt and move in the flow, or tumble\nincessantly at the centre of the channel. For sufficiently strong anchoring,\nfinally, one or both of the topological defects which form close to the surface\nof the isotropic droplet in equilibrium detach from it and get dragged deep\ninto the nematic state by the flow. In 3D, instead, the Saturn ring associated\nwith normal anchoring disclination line can be deformed and shifted downstream\nby the flow, but remains always localized in proximity of the droplet, at least\nfor the parameter range we explored. Tangential anchoring in 2D leads to a\ndifferent dynamic response, as the boojum defects characteristic of this\nsituation can unbind from the droplet under a weaker shear with respect to the\nnormal anchoring case. Our results should stimulate further experiments with\ninverted liquid crystal emulsions under shear, as most of the predictions can\nbe testable in principle by monitoring the evolution of liquid crystalline\norientation patterns or by tracking the position and shape of the droplet over\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2016 14:06:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

Recently, it has been verified that networks can\nsimultaneously exhibit one coherent and other incoherent domain, known as\nchimera states. In this work, we study the existence of chimera states in a\nnetwork considering the connectivity matrix based on the cat cerebral cortex.\nThe cerebral cortex of the cat can be separated in 65 cortical areas organised\ninto the four cognitive regions: visual, auditory, somatosensory-motor and\nfrontolimbic. We consider a network where the local dynamics is given by the\nHindmarsh-Rose model. The Hindmarsh-Rose equations are a well known model of\nneuronal activity that has been considered to simulate membrane potential in\nneuron. Here, we analyse under which conditions chimera states are present, as\nwell as the affects induced by intensity of coupling on them. We observe the\nexistence of chimera states in that incoherent structure can be composed of\ndesynchronised spikes or desynchronised bursts. Moreover, we find that chimera\nstates with desynchronised bursts are more robust to neuronal noise than with\ndesynchronised spikes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2016 16:13:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2017 13:25:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

We have argues that\nany such signal can be represented as the trajectory of a particle moving in a\nforce field with one degree of freedom. At point on the trajectory, that is, on\nthe signal, the kinetic energy dissipated by the particle embeds semantic\ninformation into the trajectory or the signal in terms of giving its shape. We\nhave shown that the rate of kinetic energy dissipation operator or the power\noperator P is of importance in shape analysis of the signal by considering its\nsign changes. Operating the P-operator on digital signals we have\nmathematically proved that its sign change can induce 13 different shapes to a\nthree successive point configuration. In other words, semantic information at\neach point in a digital signal can be embedded by a syllable of 13 different\nletters.

In dense 5G networks, HO delays may neutralize or even negate the\ngains offered by network densification. Hence, user mobility imposes a\nnontrivial challenge to harvest capacity gains via network densification. In\nthis paper, we propose a velocity-aware HO management scheme for two-tier\ndownlink cellular network to mitigate the HO effect on the foreseen\ndensification throughput gains. The proposed HO scheme sacrifices the best BS\nconnectivity, by skipping HO to some BSs along the user's trajectory, to\nmaintain longer connection durations and reduce HO rates. Furthermore, the\nproposed scheme enables cooperative BS service and strongest interference\ncancellation to compensate for skipping the best connectivity. To this end, we\nconsider different HO skipping scenarios and develop a velocity-aware\nmathematical model, via stochastic geometry, to quantify the performance of the\nproposed HO scheme in terms of the coverage probability and user throughput.\nThe results highlight the HO rate problem in dense cellular environments and\nshow the importance of the proposed HO schemes. Finally, the value of BS\ncooperation along with handover skipping is quantified for different user\nmobility profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2016 14:06:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-09"}

Quantum\nobjects are collections of particles (including single particles) whose\ncollective dynamics and measurement results can only be described by the laws\nof QT and QFT. Local causal models of quantum objects' internal dynamics are\nnot possible if a locality is understood as a space-point locality. Within\nquantum objects, state transitions may occur which instantly affect the whole\nquantum object. The identification of quantum objects as the elementary units\nof causality and locality has two primary implications for a causal model of\nquantum objects: (1) quantum objects run autonomously with system-state update\nfrequencies based on their local proper times and with either no or minimal\ndependency on external parameters. (2) The laws of physics that describe global\n(but relativistic) interrelationships must be translated to a causal model of\ninteractions between quantum objects and interactions between quantum objects\nand the space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2016 13:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-15"}
