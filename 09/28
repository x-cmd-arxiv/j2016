This study uses two\natmospheric reanalyses to examine interannual variability of Sahel rainfall and\nthe Saharan SMC, which consists of northward near-surface flow across the Sahel\ninto the Sahara and southward flow near 700 hPa out of the Sahara. During wet\nSahel years, the Saharan SMC shifts poleward, producing a drop in low-level\ngeopotential and surface pressure over the Sahara. Statistically removing the\neffect of the poleward shift from the low-level geopotential eliminates\nsignificant correlations between this geopotential and Sahel precipitation. As\nthe Saharan SMC shifts poleward, its mid-tropospheric divergent outflow\ndecreases, indicating a weakening of its overturning mass flux. The poleward\nshift and weakening of the Saharan SMC during wet Sahel years is reproduced in\nan idealized model of West Africa; a wide range of imposed sea surface\ntemperature and land surface albedo perturbations in this model produce a much\nlarger range of SMC variations that nevertheless have similar quantitative\nassociations with Sahel rainfall as in the reanalyses. These results disprove\nthe idea that enhanced Sahel rainfall is caused by strengthening of the Saharan\nSMC.

However dark matter provides two additional fields which are unique\nfor collisionless media only. These are the multi- stream field in Eulerian\nspace and flip-flop field in Lagrangian space. The flip-flop field represents\nthe number of sign reversals of an elementary volume of each collisionless\nfluid element.

In\nclinical, laboratory, and real-world EEG there is a desire for dry, soft, and\ncomfortable interfaces to the scalp that are capable of relaying the\nmicrovolt-level scalp potentials to signal processing electronics. A key\nchallenge is that most material approaches are sensitive to deformation-induced\nshifts in electrical impedance associated with decreased signal-to-noise ratio.\nThis is a particular concern in real-world environments where human motion is\npresent. The entire set of brain information outside of tightly controlled\nlaboratory or clinical settings are currently unobtainable due to this\nchallenge. Here we explore the performance of an elastomeric material solution\npurposefully designed for dry, soft, comfortable scalp contact electrodes for\nEEG that is specifically targeted to have flat electrical impedance response to\ndeformation to enable utilization in real world environments. A conductive\ncarbon nanofiber filled polydimethylsiloxane (CNF-PDMS) elastomer was evaluated\nat three fill ratios (3, 4 and 7 volume percent). To evaluate usability for\nEEG, pre-recorded human EEG signals were replayed through the contact\nelectrodes subjected to quasi-static compressive strains between zero and 35%.\nThese tests show that conductive filler ratios well above the electrical\npercolation threshold are desirable in order to maximize signal-to-noise ratio\nand signal correlation with an ideal baseline. Increasing fill ratios yield\nincreasingly flat electrical impedance response to large applied compressive\ndeformations with a trade in increased material stiffness, and with nominal\nelectrical impedance tunable over greater than 4 orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2016 18:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

In this work, we analyze the low energy\nproperties of a class of modified circuit Hamiltonians, which include features\nlike complex weights and branching transitions. For history states with linear\nclocks and complex weights, we develop a method for modifying the circuit\npropagation Hamiltonian to implement any desired distribution over the time\nsteps of the circuit in a frustration-free ground state, and show that this can\nbe used to obtain a constant output probability for universal adiabatic\ncomputation while retaining the $\\Omega(T^{-2})$ scaling of the spectral gap,\nand without any additional overhead in terms of numbers of qubits.\n  Furthermore, we establish limits on the increase in the ground energy due to\ninput and output penalty terms for modified tridiagonal clocks with non-uniform\ndistributions on the time steps by proving a tight $O(T^{-2})$ upper bound on\nthe product of the spectral gap and ground state overlap with the endpoints of\nthe computation. Using variational techniques which go beyond the\n$\\Omega(T^{-3})$ scaling that follows from the usual geometrical lemma, we\nprove that the standard Feynman-Kitaev Hamiltonian already saturates this\nbound.

Indeed, with every quantum measurement one\ncan associate a number -- its POVM norm constant -- that quantifies how much\nthe distinguishability of quantum states degrades in the worst case as a result\nof the measurement. This raises the obvious question which measurements\npreserve the most information in these sense of having the largest norm\nconstant. While a number of near-optimal schemes have been found (e.g. the\nuniform POVM, or complex projective 4-designs), they all seem to be difficult\nto implement in practice. Here, we analyze the distinguishability of quantum\nstates under measurements that are orbits of the Clifford group. The Clifford\ngroup plays an important role e.g. in quantum error correction, and its\nelements are considered simple to implement. We find that the POVM norm\nconstants of Clifford orbits depend on the effective rank of the states that\nshould be distinguished, as well as on a quantitative measure of the \"degree of\nlocalization in phase space\" of the vectors in the orbit. The most important\nClifford orbit is formed by the set of stabilizer states. Our main result\nimplies that stabilizer measurements are essentially optimal for distinguishing\npure quantum states. As an auxiliary result, we use the methods developed here\nto prove new entropic uncertainty relations for stabilizer measurements. This\npaper is based on a very recent analysis of the representation theory of tensor\npowers of the Clifford group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2016 19:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

In the framework of the implementation of\nthe photo-z algorithm for Euclid, we are exploring new avenues to improve\ntemplate-fitting methods. The paper focusses on the prescription of the\nextinction of source light by dust in the Milky Way. Since Galactic extinction\nstrongly correlates with wavelength and photometry is commonly obtained in\nbroad-band filters, the amount of absorption depends on the source SED, a point\noften neglected as the SED is not known a-priori. A consequence of this is that\nthe observed E(B-V) (=A_B-A_V) will be different from the E(B-V) used to\nnormalise the absorption law k_lambda (=A_lambda/E(B-V)). Band-pass corrections\nare required to renormalise the law for a given SED. We assess the band-pass\ncorrections of a range of SEDs and find they vary by up to 20%. We investigate\nhow dust-to-reddening scaling factors depend of the sources used for their\ncalibration. We derive scaling factors from the color excesses of z<0.4 SDSS\nred galaxies and show that band-pass corrections predict the observed\ndifferences. Extinction is then estimated for a range of SEDs and filters\nrelevant to Euclid and other cosmological ground-based surveys. For high\nextinction line-of-sights (E(B-V)>0.1, ~8% of the Euclid survey), the\nvariations in corrections can be ~0.1mag in the `bluer' optical filters and\n~0.04mag in the NIR filters. An inaccurate correction of extinction critically\naffects photo-z. In particular, for high extinctions and z<0.5, the bias (mean\nD_z=z_phot-z_real) exceeds 0.2%(1+z), the precision required by weak-lensing\nanalyses. Additional uncertainty on the MW extinction law further reduces the\nphoto-z precision. We propose a new prescription of Galactic absorption for\ntemplate-fitting algorithms that takes into consideration the dependence of\nextinction with SED.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2016 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 10:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

The directly imaged planets detected so far are consistent\nwith the \"hot-start\" scenario of high entropy and luminosity. If nebular gas\npasses through a shock front before being accreted into a protoplanet, the\nentropy can be substantially altered. To investigate this, we present high\nresolution, 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations of accreting giant planets.\nThe accreted gas is found to fall with supersonic speed in the gap from the\ncircumstellar disk's upper layers onto the surface of the circumplanetary disk\nand polar region of the protoplanet. There it shocks, creating an extended hot\nsupercritical shock surface. This shock front is optically thick, therefore, it\ncan conceal the planet's intrinsic luminosity beneath. The gas in the vertical\ninflux has high entropy which when passing through the shock front decreases\nsignificantly while the gas becomes part of the disk and protoplanet. This\nshows that circumplanetary disks play a key role in regulating a planet's\nthermodynamic state. Our simulations furthermore indicate that around the shock\nsurface extended regions of atomic - sometimes ionized - hydrogen develop.\nTherefore circumplanetary disk shock surfaces could influence significantly the\nobservational appearance of forming gas-giants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2016 20:24:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 14:45:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

This is not true for most magnetically accreting stars, which have\nstrongly variable accretion outbursts on time-scales much shorter than the time\nit would take to reach spin equilibrium. This paper examines how accretion\noutbursts affect the time a star takes to reach spin equilibrium and its final\nequilibrium spin period. I consider several different models for angular\nmomentum loss -- either carried away in an outflow, lost to a stellar wind, or\ntransferred back to the accretion disc (the `trapped disc'). For transient\nsources, the outflow scenario leads to significantly longer times to reach spin\nequilibrium ($\\sim$10x), and shorter equilibrium spin periods than would be\nexpected from spin equilibrium arguments, while the `trapped disc' does not.\nThe results suggest that disc trapping plays a significant role in the spin\nevolution of strongly magnetic stars, with some caveats for young stellar\nobjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2016 20:30:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 11:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

These severe impairments induce a strong loss of orthogonality\nbetween subcarriers and OFDM symbols and, therefore, lead to a dramatic\nincrease in ICI and ISI. To be well armed against these dramatic impairments,\nwe, in the present paper, optimize the transmit/receive waveforms for FBMC\nsystems, with hexagonal time-frequency lattices, operating over severe doubly\ndispersive channels, accounting for both natural and artificial impairments.\nFor this, we exploit the POPS paradigm, recently proposed for rectangular\ntime-frequency lattices, to design offline waveforms maximizing the SINR for\nhexagonal time-frequency lattices.

Combined with new improved analysis tools, the previous\nsensitivity is more than doubled. The H.E.S.S. angular resolution of\n$0.048^\\circ$ ($0.036^\\circ$ above 2 TeV) is unprecedented in gamma-ray\nastronomy and probes physical scales of 0.8 (0.6) parsec at the remnant's\nlocation.\n  The new H.E.S.S. image of RX$~$J1713.7-3946 allows us to reveal clear\nmorphological differences between X-rays and gamma rays. In particular, for the\nouter edge of the brightest shell region, we find the first ever indication for\nparticles in the process of leaving the acceleration shock region.

However, suppression of disorder-induced scattering has never been\ndemonstrated in non-topological phononic systems.

In the current standard PSF subtraction algorithms,\na set of reference images is derived from the target image sequence to subtract\neach target image, using Angular and/or Simultaneous Spectral Differential\nImaging (ADI, SSDI, respectively). However, to avoid excessive exoplanet\nself-subtraction, ADI and SSDI (in the absence of a strong spectral feature)\nseverely limit the available number of reference images at small separations.\nThis limits the performance of the least-squares algorithm, resulting in lower\nsensitivity to exoplanets at small angular separations.

Underlying this problem is the absence of accurate sand flux\nmeasurements at the short time scales at which wind speed fluctuates.

Approximately 500,000 taxi trips are taken daily, carrying about\n800,000 passengers, and not including other livery firms such as Uber, Lyft or\nCarmel. Since 2008 yellow taxis have been able to process fare payments with\ncredit cards, and credits cards are a growing share of total fare payments.\nHowever, the use of credit cards to pay for taxi fares varies widely across\nneighborhoods, and there are strong correlations between cash payments for taxi\nfares and the presence of unbanked or underbanked populations. These issues are\nof concern for policymakers as approximately ten percent of households in the\ncity are unbanked, and in some neighborhoods the share of unbanked households\nis over 50 percent. In this paper we use multiple datasets to explore taxicab\nfare payments by neighborhood and examine how access to taxicab services is\nassociated with use of conventional banking services. There is a clear spatial\ndimension to the propensity of riders to pay cash, and we find that both\nimmigrant status and being 'unbanked' are strong predictors of cash\ntransactions for taxicabs. These results have implications for local\nregulations of the for-hire vehicle industry, particularly in the context of\nthe rapid growth of services that require credit cards. Without some type of\ncash-based payment option taxi services will isolate certain neighborhoods. At\nthe very least, existing and new providers of transit services must consider\naccess to mainstream financial products as part of their equity analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 00:34:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-29"}

However, perturbing the phase prior\nacross 100 evenly spaced intervals reveals one strong false-positive and one\nweaker instance.

Cut trees are a powerful back-end for graph management and\nmining, as they support various procedures related to the minimum cut, maximum\nflow, and connectivity. However, the crucial drawback with cut trees is the\ncomputational cost of their construction. In theory, a cut tree is built by\napplying a maximum flow algorithm for $n$ times, where $n$ is the number of\nvertices. Therefore, naive implementations of this approach result in cubic\ntime complexity, which is obviously too slow for today's large-scale graphs.

Troilite (FeS) is\nsystematically present and is the most abundant sulfide within the EH3\nchondrite chondrules. It is found either poikilitically enclosed in low-Ca\npyroxenes or scattered within the glassy mesostasis. Oldhamite (CaS) and\nniningerite [(Mg,Fe,Mn)S] are present in about 60% of the chondrules studied.\nWhile oldhamite is preferentially present in the mesostasis, niningerite\nassociated with silica is generally observed in contact with troilite and\nlow-Ca pyroxene. The chondrule mesostases contain high abundances of alkali and\nvolatile elements as well as silica. Our data suggest that most of the sulfides\nfound in EH3 chondrite chondrules are magmatic minerals that formed after the\ndissolution of S from a volatile-rich gaseous environment into the molten\nchondrules. Troilite formation occurred via sulfur solubility within Fe-poor\nchondrule melts followed by sulfide saturation, which causes an immiscible iron\nsulfide liquid to separate from the silicate melt. The FeS saturation started\nat the same time as or prior to the crystallization of low-Ca pyroxene during\nthe high temperature chondrule forming event(s). Protracted gas-melt\ninteractions under high partial pressures of S and SiO led to the formation of\nniningerite-silica associations via destabilization of the previously formed\nFeS and low-Ca pyroxene. We also propose that formation of the oldhamite\noccurred via the sulfide saturation of Fe-poor chondrule melts at moderate S\nconcentration due to the high degree of polymerization and the high Na-content\nof the chondrule melts, which allowed the activity of CaO in the melt to be\nenhanced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 03:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-29"}

Items can be replicated and\nplaced in any subset of the bins. Each (item, subset) pair has an associated\ncost. Not assigning an item to any of the bins is not free in general and can\npotentially be the most expensive option. The goal is to minimize the total\ncost of assigning items to subsets without exceeding the bin capacities. This\nproblem is motivated by the design of caching systems composed of banks of\nmemory with varying cost/performance specifications. The ability to replicate a\ndata item in more than one memory bank can benefit the overall performance of\nthe system with a faster recovery time in the event of a memory failure. For\nthis setting, the number $n$ of data objects (items) is very large and the\nnumber $d$ of memory banks (bins) is a small constant (on the order of $3$ or\n$4$). Therefore, the goal is to determine an optimal assignment in time that\nminimizes dependence on $n$. The integral version of this problem is NP-hard\nsince it is a generalization of the knapsack problem. We focus on an efficient\nsolution to the LP relaxation as the number of fractionally assigned items will\nbe at most $d$. If the data objects are small with respect to the size of the\nmemory banks, the effect of excluding the fractionally assigned data items from\nthe cache will be small. We give an algorithm that solves the LP relaxation and\nruns in time $O({3^d \\choose d+1} \\text{poly}(d) n \\log(n) \\log(nC) \\log(Z))$,\nwhere $Z$ is the maximum item size and $C$ the maximum storage cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 04:47:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2016 06:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

That is puzzling, for there is no\ndetectable static distortion, and because the features and splittings disappear\nupon modest heating, which they should not.

The lifetime of such an\noff-equilibrium state diverges with the system size, and the temperature is\nnon-uniform across the system.

The second is a\ngeneral equivalence theorem relating two refined notions of distortion: scaling\ndistortion and prioritized distortion.\n  Minimum Spanning Trees of weighted graphs are fundamental objects in numerous\napplications. In particular in distributed networks, the minimum spanning tree\nof the network is often used to route messages between network nodes.\nUnfortunately, while being most efficient in the total cost of connecting all\nnodes, minimum spanning trees fail miserably in the desired property of\napproximately preserving distances between pairs. While known lower bounds\nexclude the possibility of the worst case distortion of a tree being small, it\nwas shown in [ABN15] that there exists a spanning tree with constant average\ndistortion. Yet, the weight of such a tree may be significantly larger than\nthat of the MST. In this paper, we show that any weighted undirected graph\nadmits a {\\em spanning tree} whose weight is at most $(1+\\rho)$ times that of\nthe MST, providing {\\em constant average distortion} $O(1/\\rho)$. Our result\nexhibits the best possible tradeoff of this type.\n  This result makes use of a general equivalence theorem relating two recently\ndeveloped notions of distortion for metric embedding. The first is the notion\nof scaling distortion, which provides improved distortion for $1-\\epsilon$\nfractions of the pairs, for all $\\epsilon$ simultaneously. A stronger version\ncalled coarse scaling distortion, has improved distortion guarantees for the\nfurthest pairs. The second notion is that of prioritized distortion, a property\nallowing to prioritize the nodes whose associated distortions will be improved.\nWe show that prioritized distortion is essentially equivalent to coarse scaling\ndistortion via a general transformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 07:12:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Nov 2018 21:21:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-14"}

However, the SCL decoding\nscheme suffers from very high space and time complexities. Especially, the high\nspace complexity is a major concern for adopting polar codes in modern mobile\ncommunication standards. In this paper, we propose a novel reduced-complexity\nsuccessive cancelation list (R-SCL) decoding scheme which is effective to\nreduce the space complexity.

We extend this theory to\n\"generalized quitting games\" , a class of repeated stochastic games in which\neach player may have quitting actions, such as the Big-Match. We provide three\nsimple geometric and strongly related conditions for the weak approachability\nof a convex target set. The first is sufficient: it guarantees that, for any\nfixed horizon, a player has a strategy ensuring that the expected time-average\npayoff vector converges to the target set as horizon goes to infinity. The\nthird is necessary: if it is not satisfied, the opponent can weakly exclude the\ntarget set. In the special case where only the approaching player can quit the\ngame (Big-Match of type I), the three conditions are equivalent and coincide\nwith Blackwell's condition. Consequently, we obtain a full characterization and\nprove that the game is weakly determined-every convex set is either weakly\napproachable or weakly excludable. In games where only the opponent can quit\n(Big-Match of type II), none of our conditions is both sufficient and necessary\nfor weak approachability. We provide a continuous time sufficient condition\nusing techniques coming from differential games, and show its usefulness in\npractice, in the spirit of Vieille's seminal work for weak\napproachability.Finally, we study uniform approachability where the strategy\nshould not depend on the horizon and demonstrate that, in contrast with\nclassical Blackwell approacha-bility for convex sets, weak approachability does\nnot imply uniform approachability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 11:57:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-29"}

Note that PCA is based only on the explanatory variables, so the\nprincipal components are not selected using the information on the response\nvariable. In this paper, we propose a one-stage procedure for PCR in the\nframework of generalized linear models. The basic loss function is based on a\ncombination of the regression loss and PCA loss. An estimate of the regression\nparameter is obtained as the minimizer of the basic loss function with a sparse\npenalty. We call the proposed method sparse principal component regression for\ngeneralized linear models (SPCR-glm). Taking the two loss function into\nconsideration simultaneously, SPCR-glm enables us to obtain sparse principal\ncomponent loadings that are related to a response variable. However, a\ncombination of loss functions may cause a parameter identification problem, but\nthis potential problem is avoided by virtue of the sparse penalty. Thus, the\nsparse penalty plays two roles in this method. The parameter estimation\nprocedure is proposed using various update algorithms with the coordinate\ndescent algorithm. We apply SPCR-glm to two real datasets, doctor visits data\nand mouse consomic strain data. SPCR-glm provides more easily interpretable\nprincipal component (PC) scores and clearer classification on PC plots than the\nusual PCA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 12:33:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2016 05:59:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 03:51:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-03"}

The emerging dual connectivity paradigm\ncan be regarded as an attractive access mechanism in dense heterogeneous 5G\nnetworks, where bandwidth sharing and cooperative techniques are evolving to\nmeet the increased capacity requirements. Dual connectivity in the uplink\nremained highly controversial, since the user device has a limited power budget\nto share between two different access points, especially when located close to\nthe cell edge. On the other hand, in an attempt to enhance the uplink\ncommunications performance, the concept of uplink and downlink decoupling has\nrecently been introduced. Leveraging these latest developments, our work\nsignificantly advances prior art by proposing and investigating the concept of\nflexible cell association in dual connectivity scenarios, where users are able\nto aggregate resources from more than one serving cell. In this setup, the\npreferred association policies for the uplink may differ from those for the\ndownlink, thereby allowing for a truly decoupled access. With the use of\nstochastic geometry, the dual connectivity association regions for decoupled\naccess are derived and the resultant performance is evaluated in terms of\ncapacity gains over the conventional downlink received power access policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 12:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-29"}

Results\nshowed that infected network connectedness was lower in badgers than in cattle.\nThe contribution of an infected individual to the mean distance of disease\nspread over time was considerably lower for badger than cattle; badgers mainly\nspread the disease locally while cattle infected both locally and across longer\ndistances.

Our own recent\nwork has identified iterative models (such as quantal cognitive hierarchy) as\nthe state of the art for predicting human play in unrepeated, simultaneous-move\ngames (Wright & Leyton-Brown 2012, 2016). Iterative models predict that agents\nreason iteratively about their opponents, building up from a specification of\nnonstrategic behavior called level-0. The modeler is in principle free to\nchoose any description of level-0 behavior that makes sense for the setting.\nHowever, almost all existing work specifies this behavior as a uniform\ndistribution over actions. In most games it is not plausible that even\nnonstrategic agents would choose an action uniformly at random, nor that other\nagents would expect them to do so. A more accurate model for level-0 behavior\nhas the potential to dramatically improve predictions of human behavior, since\na substantial fraction of agents may play level-0 strategies directly, and\nfurthermore since iterative models ground all higher-level strategies in\nresponses to the level-0 strategy. Our work considers models of the way in\nwhich level-0 agents construct a probability distribution over actions, given\nan arbitrary game. Using a Bayesian optimization package called SMAC (Hutter,\nHoos, & Leyton-Brown, 2010, 2011, 2012), we systematically evaluated a large\nspace of such models, each of which makes its prediction based only on general\nfeatures that can be computed from any normal form game.

The Kepler space mission led to a large amount of high-precision\ntime series of solar-like oscillators. Using a Bayesian analysis that combines\nasteroseismic techniques and additional ground-based observations, the mass,\nradius, luminosity, and distance of those stars can be estimated with good\nprecision. This has given a new impetus to the research field of galactic\narcheology. Aims. The first data release of the Gaia space mission contains the\nTGAS catalog with parallax estimates for more than 2 million stars, including\nmany of the Kepler targets. Our goal is to make a first proper comparison of\nasteroseismic and astrometric parallaxes of a selection of dwarfs, subgiants,\nand red giants observed by Kepler for which asteroseismic distances were\npublished. Methods. We compare asteroseismic and astrometric distances of\nsolar-like pulsators using an appropriate statistical errors-in- variables\nmodel on a linear as well as on a logarithmic scale. Results. For a sample of\n22 dwarf and subgiant solar-like oscillators, the TGAS parallaxes considerably\nimproved the Hipparcos ones, yet the excellent agreement between asteroseismic\nand astrometric distances still holds. For a sample of 938 Kepler pulsating red\ngiants, the TGAS parallaxes are much more uncertain than the asteroseismic\nones, making it worthwhile to validate the former with the latter. From\nerrors-in-variables modelling we find a significant discrepancy between the\nTGAS parallaxes and the asteroseismic ones. Conclusions. For the sample of\ndwarfs and subgiants, the comparison between astrometric and asteroseismic\nparallaxes does not require a revision of the stellar models on the basis of\nTGAS. For the sample of red giants, we identify possible causes of the\ndiscrepancy, which we will likely be able to resolve with the more precise Gaia\nparallaxes of the upcoming releases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 14:55:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Oct 2016 21:25:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 12:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-30"}

The main idea is to apply the `dual foliation'\nformalism in combination with hyperboloidal coordinates and the generalized\nharmonic gauge formulation. The strength of the present approach is that,\nfollowing the ideas of Zenginoglu, a hyperboloidal layer can be naturally\nattached to a central region using standard coordinates of numerical relativity\napplications. Employing a generalization of the standard hyperboloidal slices,\ndeveloped by Calabrese et. al., we find that all formally singular terms take a\ntrivial limit as we head to null-infinity. A byproduct is a numerical approach\nfor hyperboloidal evolution of nonlinear wave equations violating the\nnull-condition. The height-function method, used often for fixed background\nspacetimes, is generalized in such a way that the slices can be dynamically\n`waggled' to maintain the desired outgoing coordinate lightspeed precisely.\nThis is achieved by dynamically solving the eikonal equation. As a first\nnumerical test of the new approach we solve the 3D flat space scalar wave\nequation. The simulations, performed with the pseudospectral bamps code, show\nthat outgoing waves are cleanly absorbed at null-infinity and that errors\nconverge away rapidly as resolution is increased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 15:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-29"}

AGN feedback is usually invoked to expel the obscuring gas and dust\nin a blow-out event, but the underlying physical mechanism remains unclear. We\nconsider AGN feedback driven by radiation pressure on dust, which directly acts\non the obscuring dusty gas. We obtain that radiative feedback can potentially\ndisrupt dense gas in the infrared-optically thick regime, and that an increase\nin the dust-to-gas fraction leads to an increase in the effective Eddington\nratio. Thus the more dusty gas is preferentially expelled by radiative\nfeedback, and the central AGN is prone to efficiently remove its own obscuring\ndust cocoon. Large amounts of dust imply heavy obscuration but also powerful\nfeedback, suggesting a causal link between dust obscuration and blow-out.

In this paper, we use thirty years of\ndata from an emerging scientific community to look at that crucial early stage\nin the development of a social network. We show that when the field was very\nyoung, islands of individual researchers labored in relative isolation, and the\ncoauthorship network was disconnected. Thirty years later, rather than a\ncluster of individuals, we find a true collaborative community, bound together\nby a robust collaboration network. However, this change did not take place\ngradually\\textemdash the network remained a loose assortment of isolated\nindividuals until the mid-2000s, when those smaller parts suddenly knit\nthemselves together into a single whole.

In these\nnetworks, the distribution of flow and pressure drop is a highly interlaced\nfunction of single vessel resistances and mutual vessel interactions. In this\npaper we propose a mathematical and computational model to study the behavior\nof microcirculatory networks subjected to different conditions. The network\ngeometry is composed of a graph of connected straight cylinders, each one\nrepresenting a vessel. The blood flow and pressure drop across the single\nvessel, further split into smaller elements, are related through a generalized\nOhm's law featuring a conductivity parameter, function of the vessel cross\nsection area and geometry, which undergo deformations under pressure loads. The\nmembrane theory is used to describe the deformation of vessel lumina, tailored\nto the structure of thick-walled arterioles and thin-walled venules. In\naddition, since venules can possibly experience negative transmural pressures,\na buckling model is also included to represent vessel collapse. The complete\nmodel including arterioles, capillaries and venules represents a nonlinear\nsystem of PDEs, which is approached numerically by finite element\ndiscretization and linearization techniques. We use the model to simulate flow\nin the microcirculation of the human eye retina, a terminal system with a\nsingle inlet and outlet. After a phase of validation against experimental\nmeasurements, we simulate the network response to different interstitial\npressure values. Such a study is carried out both for global and localized\nvariations of the interstitial pressure. In both cases, significant\nredistributions of the blood flow in the network arise, highlighting the\nimportance of considering the single vessel behavior along with its position\nand connectivity in the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 11:17:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}
