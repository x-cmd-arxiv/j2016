It was found that high NaCl concentrations affected all the\ngrowth parameters.

The Tunisian population of Medicago ciliaris, prospected on soils\naffected by salinity, was the best tolerant in all ecotypes studied in this\nwork.

Different simulations predict\ndifferent initial mass functions of the first stars, ranging from predominantly\nlow mass (0.1-10 Msol), to massive (10-100 Msol), or even supermassive\n(100-1000 Msol). The mass distribution of the first stars should lead to unique\nchemical imprints on the low-mass second and later generation metal-poor stars\nstill in existence. The chemical composition of SMSS0313-6708, which has the\nlowest abundances of Ca and Fe of any star known, indicates it was enriched by\na single massive supernova. However, even weak spectral lines may be affected\nby strong 3D and NLTE effects in metal-poor stars. If these effects are ignored\nor treated incorrectly, errors in the inferred abundances may significantly\nbias the inferred properties of the polluting supernovae. We redetermine the\nchemical composition of SMSS0313-6708 using 3D NLTE radiative transfer to\nobtain accurate abundances for Li, Na, Mg, Al, Ca and Fe. The model atoms\nemploy realistic collisional rates, with no calibrated free parameters. We find\nsignificantly higher abundances in 3D NLTE than 1D LTE by 0.8 dex for Fe, and\n0.5 dex for Mg, Al and Ca, while Li and Na are unaffected to within 0.03 dex.\nIn particular, our upper limit for [Fe/H] is now a factor ten larger, at [Fe/H]\n< -6.53 (3 sigma), than previous estimates based on <3D> NLTE (i.e. using\naveraged 3D models). This higher estimate is due to a conservative upper limit\nestimation, updated NLTE data, and 3D-<3D> NLTE differences, all of which lead\nto a higher abundance determination.

In the general third order truncated form of fRG,\nthe dependence of the two-particle vertex is described by O(N^4) independent\nvariables, where N is the dimension of the single-particle system. In a\nprevious paper [Phys. Rev. B 89, 045128 (2014)], the so-called coupled-ladder\napproximation (CLA) was introduced and shown to admit a consistent treatment\nfor models with a purely onsite interaction, reducing the vertex to O(N^2)\nindependent variables. Here, we extend this scheme to the extended coupled\nladder approximation (eCLA), which includes a spatially extended feedback\nbetween the individual channels, measured by a feedback length L, using O(N^2\nL^2) independent variables for the vertex. We apply the eCLA to three types of\none-dimensional models : First, to a quantum point contact (QPC) with a\nparabolic barrier top and short-ranged interactions. Here eCLA achieves\nconvergence for L equal to the characteristic length l_x of the QPC. It also\nturns out that the additional feedback stabilizes the fRG-flow. This enables\nus, second, to study the crossover between a QPC and a quantum dot, again for a\nmodel with short-ranged interactions. Third, the enlarged feedback also enables\nthe treatment of a finite-ranged interaction extending over up to L sites.\nEstimating the form of such a finite-ranged interaction in a QPC, we study its\neffects on the conductance and the density. For low densities and sufficiently\nlarge interaction ranges the conductance develops additional oscillatory\nfeatures, and the corresponding density shows fluctuations that can be\ninterpreted as Friedel oscillations arising from a renormalized barrier shape\nwith a rather flat top and steep flanks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 16:33:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2017 08:58:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-17"}

We then derive closed-form expressions for the achievable rate in\nflat fading channels assuming low SNR and a large number of users for the\nmaximal ratio and zero forcing receivers that takes channel estimation error\ndue to both noise and one-bit quantization into account. The closed-form\nexpressions in turn allow us to obtain insight into important system design\nissues such as optimal resource allocation, maximal sum spectral efficiency,\noverall energy efficiency, and number of antennas.

Consequently, events that trigger at\ncritical threshold levels of regulatory proteins exhibit stochasticity in their\ntiming. An important contributor to the noise in gene expression is translation\nbursts which correspond to randomness in number of proteins produced in a\nsingle mRNA lifetime. Modeling timing of an event as a first-passage time (FPT)\nproblem, we explore the effect of burst size distribution on event timing.\nTowards this end, the probability density function of FPT is computed for a\ngene expression model with burst size drawn from a generic non-negative\ndistribution. Analytical formulas for FPT moments are provided in terms of\nknown vectors and inverse of a matrix. The effect of burst size distribution is\ninvestigated by looking at how the feedback regulation strategy that minimizes\nnoise in timing around a given time deviates from the case when burst is\ndeterministic. Interestingly, results show that the feedback strategy for\ndeterministic burst case is quite robust to change in burst size distribution,\nand deviations from it are confined to about 20% of the optimal value.

In 2015, Diaco and Khovanova studied various cases of these \"discreet\nstrategies\" and introduced the revealing factor, a measure of the information\nthat is revealed.\n  In this paper we discuss a natural coin weighing strategy which we call the\nsorting strategy: divide the coins into equal piles and sort them by weight. We\nstudy the instances when the strategy is discreet, and given an outcome of the\nsorting strategy, the possible number of fake coins. We prove that in many\ncases, the number of fake coins can be any value in an arithmetic progression\nwhose length depends linearly on the number of coins in each pile. We also show\nthe strategy can be discreet when the number of fake coins is any value within\nan arithmetic subsequence whose length also depends linearly on the number of\ncoins in each pile. We arrive at these results by connecting our work to the\nclassic Frobenius coin problem. In addition, we calculate the revealing factor\nfor the sorting strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 19:06:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-26"}

Here, we use SDSS-APOGEE data to develop these constraints, by\npresenting the first maps of the LOSVD skewness and kurtosis of metal-rich and\nmetal-poor inner MW stars (divided at [Fe/H] = -0.4), and comparing the\nobserved patterns to those that are seen both in N-body models and in\nextragalactic bars. Despite closely matching the mean velocity and dispersion,\nthe models do not reproduce the observed LOSVD skewness patterns in different\nways, which demonstrates that our understanding of the detailed orbital\nstructure of the inner MW remains an important regime for improvement. We find\nevidence in the MW of the skewness-velocity correlation that is used as a\ndiagnostic of extragalactic bar/bulges. This correlation appears in metal-rich\nstars only, providing further evidence for different evolutionary histories of\nchemically differentiated populations. We connect these skewness measurements\nto previous work on high-velocity \"peaks\" in the inner Galaxy, confirming the\npresence of that phenomenon, and we quantify the cylindrical rotation of the\ninner Galaxy, finding that the latitude-independent rotation vanishes outside\nof lon ~ 7 deg.

To this aim, we\ntreat dust and metal production self-consistently with star formation and\nsupernova feedback. For dust, we consider a simplified model of grain size\ndistribution by representing the entire range of grain sizes with large and\nsmall grains. We include dust production in stellar ejecta, dust destruction by\nsupernova (SN) shocks, grain growth by accretion and coagulation, and grain\ndisruption by shattering. We find that the assumption of fixed dust-to-metal\nmass ratio becomes no longer valid when the galaxy is older than 0.2 Gyr, at\nwhich point the grain growth by accretion starts to contribute to the nonlinear\nrise of dust-to-gas ratio. As expected in our previous one-zone model,\nshattering triggers grain growth by accretion since it increases the total\nsurface area of grains. Coagulation becomes significant when the galaxy age is\ngreater than $\\sim$ 1 Gyr: at this epoch the abundance of small grains becomes\nhigh enough to raise the coagulation rate of small grains. We further compare\nthe radial profiles of dust-to-gas ratio $(\\mathcal{D})$ and dust-to-metal\nratio $(\\mathcal{D}/Z)$ (i.e., depletion) at various ages with observational\ndata. We find that our simulations broadly reproduce the radial gradients of\ndust-to-gas ratio and depletion.

In particular,\nif the perturbation is smooth and small (in amplitude and in width),\n$k_{\\star}$ is very close to the threshold wavenumber. Then, in a second step,\nwe change the point of view and, for a given wavenumber, working with singular\nperturbations of the domain, we show how to obtain $T=1$. In this case, the\nscattered field is exponentially decaying both at $-\\infty$ and $+\\infty$. We\nimplement numerically the method to provide examples of such undetectable\ndefects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2016 10:16:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2017 14:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

First, an efficient graph-based pre-segmentation is used, which\ndirectly operates on LiDAR scan strip data, rather than on point clouds.\nSecond, observation equations are obtained from a dense matching, which is\nformulated in terms of an estimation of a latent map. As a result of this\nformulation, the number of observation equations is not quadratic, but rather\nlinear in the number of scan strips.

Thus, we use manifold ranking and PUD to realize image retrieval.\nExperiments were carried out on five benchmark data sets, and the proposed\nmethod can greatly improve the accuracy of image retrieval. Our experimental\nresults in the Ukbench and Corel-1K datasets demonstrated that N-S score\nreached to 3.58 (HSV 3.4) and mAP to 81.77% (ODBTC 77.9%) respectively by\nutilizing PUD which has only 280 dimension. The results are higher than other\nholistic image descriptors (even some local ones) and state-of-the-arts\nretrieval methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2016 13:13:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}

Although it is nowadays well established that the overall size of a ring\nin these conditions scales like that of a collapsed globule, there is\ncompelling evidence that rings may exhibit ramified and tree-like\nconformations. In this work I show how to characterise these local tree-like\nstructures by measuring the local writhing of the rings' segments and by\nidentifying the patterns of intra-chain contacts. These quantities reveal two\nmajor topological structures: loops and terminal branches which strongly\nsuggest that the strictly double-folded \"lattice animal\" picture for rings in\nthe melt may be replaced by a more relaxed tree-like structure accommodating\nloops. In particular, I show that one can identify hierarchically looped\nstructures whose degree increases linearly with the size of a ring, and that\nterminal branches are found to store about 30% of the whole ring mass,\nirrespectively of its length. Finally, I draw an analogy between rings in the\nmelt and slip-linked chains, where contact points are enforced by mobile\nslip-links and for which a field-theoretic treatment can be employed to get\nsome insight into their typical conformations. These findings are ultimately\ndiscussed in the light of recent works on the static structure of rings and on\nthe existence of inter-ring threadings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2016 13:27:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2016 10:21:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-25"}

Alternatively, if they are not AGN, then their luminous broad\nemission lines imply production by extreme stellar processes. The latter would\nhave profound implications on the applicability of broad lines for mass\nestimates of massive black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2016 13:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

The moisture or temperature induced\nexpansion of individual fibres is transmitted in the network through the\ninter-fibre bonds; particularly in the case of anisotropic fibres, this\nsubstantially influences the resulting overall deformation. This paper presents\na methodology to predict the effective properties of bonded fibrous networks.\nThe distinctive features of the work are i) the focus on the\nhygro-thermo-mechanical response, whereas in the literature generally only the\nmechanical properties are addressed; ii) the adoption of asymptotic\nhomogenization to model fibrous networks. Asymptotic homogenization is an\nefficient and versatile multi-scale technique that allows to obtain within a\nrigorous setting the effective material response, even for complex\nmicro-structural geometries. The fibrous networks considered in this\ninvestigation are generated by random deposition of the fibres within a planar\nregion according to an orientation probability density function. Most of the\navailable network descriptions model the fibres essentially as uni-axial\nelements, thereby not explicitly considering the role of the bonds. In this\npaper, the fibres are treated as two dimensional ribbon-like elements; this\nallows to naturally include the contribution of the bonding regions to the\neffective expansion. The efficacy of the proposed study is illustrated by\ninvestigating the effective response for several network realizations,\nincorporating the influence of different micro-scale parameters, such as fibre\nhygro-thermo-elastic properties, orientation, geometry, areal coverage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2016 13:53:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

Unfortunately, the AFC found so far between bulk magnetic single\ncrystals and Graphene-spaced adatoms, clusters or molecules either requires low\ntemperatures, is too weak, or of complex nature, for realistic exploitation.\nHere we show theoretically and experimentally that a strong perpendicular AFC\ncan be established in ultrahin-film structures such as Fe/Gr/Co on Ir(111),\nfirst-time enabling Graphene-based synthetic antiferromagnet and ferrimagnet\nmaterials with unprecedented magnetic properties and appearing suitable for\napplications. Remarkably, the established AFC is robust on structure\nthicknesses, thermally stable up to room temperature, very strong but\nfield-controllable, and occurs in perpendicular orientation with opposite high\nremanent layer magnetizations. Our atomistic first-principle simulations\nprovide further ground for the feasibility of Graphene-mediated AFC ultra-thin\nfilm structures, revealing that Graphene acts not only as mere spacer but has a\ndirect role in sustaining antiferromagnetic superexchange-coupling between the\nmagnetic layers.

We report\ndielectric properties of zwitterionic dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles in\naqueous solutions over a wide frequency range, from 50 MHz to 1.12 THz. The\ndielectric relaxation spectra reveal different polarization mechanisms at the\nmolecular level, reflecting the complexity of DPC micelle-water interactions.\nWe have made a deconvolution of the spectra into different components and\ncombined them with the effective-medium approximation to separate delicate\nprocesses of micelles in water. Our measurements demonstrate reorientational\nmotion of the DPC surfactant head groups within the micelles, and two levels of\nhydration water shells, including tightly- and loosely-bound hydration water\nlayers. From the dielectric strength of bulk water in DPC solutions, we found\nthat the number of waters in hydration shells is approximately constant at 950\n+/- 45 water molecules per micelle in DPC concentrations up to 400 mM, and it\ndecreases after that. At terahertz frequencies, employing the effective-medium\napproximation, we estimate that each DPC micelle is surrounded by a\ntightly-bound layer of 310 +/- 45 water molecules that behave as if they are an\nintegral part of the micelle. Combined with molecular dynamics simulations, we\ndetermine that tightly-bound waters are directly hydrogen-bonded to oxygens of\nDPC, while loosely-bound waters reside within 4 A of micellar atoms. The\ndielectric response of DPC micelles at terahertz frequencies yields, for the\nfirst time, experimental information regarding the largest-scale, lowest\nfrequency collective motions in micelles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2016 00:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

Recent changes imply continuous\ndemand for bandwidth to manage the large amount of packetized traffic. Cluster\nswitches and routers make the switching fabric in a Data Center Network (DCN)\nenvironment and provide interconnectivity between elements of the same DC and\ninter DCs. To handle the constantly variable loads, switches need deliver\noutstanding throughput along with resiliency and scalability for DCN\nrequirements. Conventional DCN switches adopt crossbars or/and blocks of\nmemories mounted in a multistage fashion (commonly 2-Tiers or 3-Tiers).\nHowever, current multistage switches, with their space-memory variants, are\neither too complex to implement, have poor performance, or not cost effective.\nWe propose a novel and highly scalable multistage switch based on\nNetworks-on-Chip (NoC) fabrics for DCNs. In particular, we describe a\nthree-stage Clos packet-switch with a Round Robin packets dispatching scheme\nwhere each central stage module is based on a Unidirectional NoC (UDN), instead\nof the conventional single-hop crossbar. The design, referred to as Clos-UDN,\novercomes shortcomings of traditional multistage architectures as it (i)\nObviates the need for a complex and costly input modules, by means of few, yet\nsimple, input FIFO queues. (ii) Avoids the need for a complex and synchronized\nscheduling process over a high number of input-output modules and/or port\npairs. (iii) Provides speedup, load balancing and path-diversity thanks to a\ndynamic dispatching scheme as well as the NoC based fabric nature. Simulations\nshow that the Clos-UDN outperforms some common multistage switches under a\nrange of input traffics, making it highly appealing for ultra-high capacity DC\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Sep 2016 12:12:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}
