The social network\nwith stubborn agents is described by the Friedkin-Johnsen (F-J) model where\nagents are stubborn to their initial opinions. Firstly, we propose some\nsufficient and necessary conditions both in terms of network topology and\nsystem matrix for convergence of the F-J model over single issue.

In one, energetic cosmic ray (CR)\nparticles escape from the SNR and then illuminate nearby MCs, producing\ngamma-ray emission, while the other involves direct interaction between the SNR\nand MC. In the direct interaction scenario, re-acceleration of pre-existing CRs\nin the ambient medium is investigated while particles injected from the thermal\npool are neglected in view of the slow shock speeds in middle aged SNRs.\nHowever, standard diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) theory produces a steady\nstate particle spectrum that is too flat compared to observations, which\nsuggests that the high energy part of the observed spectrum has not yet reached\na steady state.

To\nthis end, we present a comprehensive coexistence study of Wi-Fi and\nLTE-in-unlicensed, surveying a large parameter space of coexistence mechanisms\nand a range of representative network densities and deployment scenarios.

Here we present characterizations of CdTe\nsensors hybridized with two different charge-integrating readout chips, the\nKeck PAD and the Mixed-Mode PAD (MM-PAD), both developed previously in our\nlaboratory. The charge-integrating architecture of each of these PADs extends\nthe instantaneous counting rate by many orders of magnitude beyond that\nobtainable with photon counting architectures. The Keck PAD chip consists of\nrapid, 8-frame, in-pixel storage elements with framing periods $<$150 ns. The\nsecond detector, the MM-PAD, has an extended dynamic range by utilizing an\nin-pixel overflow counter coupled with charge removal circuitry activated at\neach overflow. This allows the recording of signals from the single-photon\nlevel to tens of millions of x-rays/pixel/frame while framing at 1 kHz.

Since at\nthe partially breaking scale the sfermion masses in the $N=2$ sector is\nsuppressed due to the $N=2$ non-renormalization theorem, the anomaly mediation\neffect becomes important. If dominant, the anomaly induced masses for the\nsfermions in the $N=2$ sector are almost UV-insensitive due to the fixed point.\nInterestingly, these masses are always positive, i.e. no tachyonic slepton\nproblem. From an example model, we show interesting phenomena differing from\nthe ordinary MSSM. In particular, the dark matter can be a sbino, i.e. the\nscalar component of the $N=2$ vector multiplet of $\\rm U(1)_Y$. To obtain the\ncorrect dark matter abundance, the mass of sbino, as well as the MSSM\nsparticles in the $N=2$ sector which have a typical mass pattern of anomaly\nmediation, is required to be small. Therefore, this scenario can be tested and\nconfirmed in the LHC and may be further confirmed by the measurement of the\n$N=2$ Yukawa couplings in future colliders.

In the simplest model, SM+D,\nwhich is the standard model plus a real singlet scalar named darkon acting as\nthe DM candidate, the LUX and PandaX-II limits rule out DM masses roughly from\n4 to 450 GeV, except a small range around the resonance point at half of the\nHiggs mass where the interaction cross-section is near the neutrino-background\nfloor. In the THDM II+D, which is the type-II two-Higgs-doublet model combined\nwith a darkon, the region excluded in the SM+D by the direct searches can be\nrecovered due to suppression of the DM effective interactions with nucleons at\nsome values of the ratios of Higgs couplings to the up and down quarks, making\nthe interactions significantly isospin-violating. However, in either model, if\nthe 125-GeV Higgs boson is the portal between the dark and SM sectors, DM\nmasses less than 50 GeV or so are already ruled out by the LHC constraint on\nthe Higgs invisible decay. In the THDM II+D, if the heavier $CP$-even Higgs\nboson is the portal, theoretical restrictions from perturbativity, vacuum\nstability, and unitarity requirements turn out to be important instead and\nexclude much of the region below 100 GeV. For larger DM masses, the THDM II+D\nhas plentiful parameter space that corresponds to interaction cross-sections\nunder the neutrino-background floor and therefore is likely to be beyond the\nreach of future direct searches without directional sensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 19:45:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2016 09:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-20"}

Based on mock observations of nearby\nclusters, we find that the density of the WHIM can be determined even at > 2\nR_200 from the cluster center when FRB observations with the Square Kilometre\nArray (SKA) become available. The temperature can be derived out to r~ 1.5\nR_200, and the radius is limited by the current sensitivity of SZ observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 20:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 00:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

Objective: To evaluate the likelihood that a code reorganization to\naddress bad code smells will yield improvement in the defect-proneness of the\ncode. Method: We introduce XTREE, a tool that analyzes a historical log of\ndefects seen previously in the code and generates a set of useful code changes.\nAny bad smell that requires changes outside of that set can be deprioritized\n(since there is no historical evidence that the bad smell causes any problems).\nEvaluation: We evaluate XTREE's recommendations for bad smell improvement\nagainst recommendations from previous work (Shatnawi, Alves, and Borges) using\nmultiple data sets of code metrics and defect counts. Results: Code modules\nthat are changed in response to XTREE's recommendations contain significantly\nfewer defects than recommendations from previous studies. Further, XTREE\nendorses changes to very few code metrics, and the bad smell recommendations\n(learned from previous studies) are not universal to all software projects.\nConclusion: Before undertaking a code reorganization based on a bad smell\nreport, use a tool like XTREE to check and ignore any such operations that are\nuseless; i.e. ones which lack evidence in the historical record that it is\nuseful to make that change. Note that this use case applies to both manual code\nreorganizations proposed by developers as well as those conducted by automatic\nmethods.

Diversity can be intended as\nthe count of different items, animals, or, more generally, interactions. There\nare two classes of stylized facts that emerge when diversity is taken into\naccount. The first are Diversity explosions: evolutionary radiations in\nbiology, or the process of escaping 'Poverty Traps' in economics are two well\nknown examples. The second is nestedness: entities with a very diverse set of\ninteractions are the only ones that interact with more specialized ones. In a\nsingle sentence: specialists interact with generalists. Nestedness is observed\nin a variety of bipartite networks of interactions: Biogeographic,\nmacroeconomic and mutualistic to name a few. This indicates that entities\ndiversify following a pattern. Since they appear in such very different\nsystems, these two stylized facts point out that the build up of diversity is\ndriven by a fundamental probabilistic mechanism, and here we sketch its minimal\nfeatures. We show how the contraction of a random tripartite network, which is\nmaximally entropic in all its degree distributions but one, can reproduce\nstylized facts of real data with great accuracy which is qualitatively lost\nwhen that degree distribution is changed. We base our reasoning on the\ncombinatoric picture that the nodes on one layer of these bipartite networks\ncan be described as combinations of a number of fundamental building blocks.\nThe stylized facts of diversity that we observe in real systems can be\nexplained with an extreme heterogeneity (a scale-free distribution) in the\nnumber of meaningful combinations in which each building block is involved. We\nshow that if the usefulness of the building blocks has a scale-free\ndistribution, then maximally entropic baskets of building blocks will give rise\nto very rich behaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 22:16:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-14"}

One of the emerging areas is the security enhancement in\nthe physical layer, which exploits the intrinsic properties of the wireless\nmedium. Beamforming, which has been proved to have many advantages, can also be\napplied to enhance the wireless security.\n  One of the most common threats, i.e., passive eavesdropping, is addressed in\nthis thesis. To reduce the risk of leaking information to the eavesdroppers,\nthe physical region where the transmission is exposed to eavesdropping has been\nstudied. In this thesis, the exposure region based beamforming technique is\nproposed to combat the threat from the randomly located eavesdroppers in a\nfading channel. In this system model, the large-scale path loss and a general\nRician fading channel model are considered. The exposure region is established\nto describe the secrecy performance of the system, based on which the\nprobability that the secrecy outage event occurs is defined to evaluate the\nsecurity level of the exposure region.\n  The antenna array is one of the most important factors that affect the\nsecrecy performance of the exposure region based beamforming technique. The\npotential of using different array geometry and array configuration to improve\nsecurity is explored. In this thesis, two common arrays, i.e., linear and\ncircular arrays, are considered.Analytic expressions for general array geometry\nand for the linear and circular arrays are derived. Based on the empirical\nresults, numerical optimization algorithms are developed to exploit the array\nconfiguration to enhance the system security level. In addition, experiments\nare carried out to study the performance of the beamformer with linear and\ncircular arrays. Especially, the impact of the mutual coupling on the security\nperformance is investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 23:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-14"}

This\nrequires the superposition of different numbers of particles, but the theory\ncan describe in full the equivalence relation that leads to a particle-number\nsuperselection rule in conventionally defined subsystems. Time is defined as a\nfunctional of subsystem changes, thus eliminating the need for any reference to\nan external time variable. The dynamics of the unentangled subsystem\ndecomposition is derived from a variational principle of dynamical stability,\nwhich requires the decomposition to change as little as possible in any given\ninfinitesimal time interval, subject to the constraint that the state of the\ntotal system satisfy the Schroedinger equation.

The extension\nproblem in Torelli topology is the problem of determining when a diffeomorphism\nof compact connected subsurface of a closed surface can be extended to a\ndiffeomorphism of the whole surface acting trivially on its homology. The\nspecial case of extensions by the identity diffeomorphism was considered by A.\nPutman, whose work was one of the main sources of inspiration for the present\npaper.\n  It turns out that the answer depends on the position of the subsurface, but\nonly in a mild and controlled way discovered by A.

But recently we showed that the self-field critical\ncurrent for thin films is a universal property, independent of microstructure,\ncontrolled only by the penetration depth. Here we generalise this observation\nto include thin films, wires or nanowires of single- or multi-band s-wave and\nd-wave superconductors. Using extended BCS theory we consider dissipation-free\nself-field transport currents as Meissner-London currents, avoiding the concept\nof pinning altogether.

Our fits to 62 available data sets, from zinc\nnanowires to compressed sulphur hydride with critical temperatures of 0.65 to\n203 K, respectively, are excellent. Extracted London penetration depths,\nsuperconducting energy gaps and specific heat jumps agree well with reported\nbulk values.

The goal of this paper is to compare the efficiency of the\ndifferent methods used to deal with stellar signals to recover extremely\nlow-mass planets despite. However, because observed RV variations at the m/s\nprecision level or below is a combination of signals induced by unresolved\norbiting planets, by the star, and by the instrument, performing such a\ncomparison using real data is extremely challenging. To circumvent this\nproblem, we generated simulated RV measurements including realistic stellar and\nplanetary signals. Different teams analyzed blindly those simulated RV\nmeasurements, using their own method to recover planetary signals despite\nstellar RV signals. By comparing the results obtained by the different teams\nwith the planetary and stellar parameters used to generate the simulated RVs,\nit is therefore possible to compare the efficiency of these different methods.\nThe most efficient methods to recover planetary signals {take into account the\ndifferent activity indicators,} use red-noise models to account for stellar RV\nsignals and a Bayesian framework to provide model comparison in a robust\nstatistical approach. Using the most efficient methodology, planets can be\nfound down to K/N= K_pl/RV_rms*sqrt{N_obs}=5 with a threshold of K/N=7.5 at the\nlevel of 80-90% recovery rate found for a number of methods. These recovery\nrates drop dramatically for K/N smaller than this threshold. In addition, for\nthe best teams, no false positives with K/N > 7.5 were detected, while a\nnon-negligible fraction of them appear for smaller K/N. A limit of K/N = 7.5\nseems therefore a safe threshold to attest the veracity of planetary signals\nfor RV measurements with similar properties to those of the different RV\nfitting challenge systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 04:31:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

As users interact with different\nitems over time, user and item features can influence each other, evolve and\nco-evolve over time.

Recently, point\nprocess based models have been proposed in the literature aiming to capture the\ntemporally evolving nature of these latent features. However, these models\noften make strong parametric assumptions about the evolution process of the\nuser and item latent features, which may not reflect the reality, and has\nlimited power in expressing the complex and nonlinear dynamics underlying these\nprocesses. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep coevolutionary\nnetwork model (DeepCoevolve), for learning user and item features based on\ntheir interaction graph. DeepCoevolve use recurrent neural network (RNN) over\nevolving networks to define the intensity function in point processes, which\nallows the model to capture complex mutual influence between users and items,\nand the feature evolution over time.

However, without the relays, only one time or frequency slot is\nused for a single frame transmission. Therefore, despite the benefits of\nrelaying systems, this type of communications is not efficient from the\nspectral efficiency viewpoint. One solution to reduce this issue might be the\nfull-duplex (FD) relays. An old technique which is reconsidered recently to\nimprove the spectral efficiency of telecommunication systems. However, FD\nrelays have a certain complexity, so, some similar techniques such as\nsuccessive relays with nearly the same performance but less complexity is taken\ninto account now. In successive relaying systems, two relays between the source\nand destination are employed which receive the transmitted frames from the\nsource and relay it to the destination successively. This structure generally\nacts like an FD relays. In this paper, the effective capacity performance of an\namplify and forward (AF) successive relaying systems with power allocation\nstrategy at the relays are studied perfectly. However, while the inter-rely\ninterference (IRI) between two successive relays has to be managed well, the\npower allocation and the effective capacity is derived under different\nassumptions about the IRI. In this way, we assume weak or strong, short or\nlong-term constraints on the IRI. Then we extract the optimal transmitted power\nat the relay to maximize the effective capacity under these constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 06:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-17"}

In this method, we first measure the 2D redshift-space\ncorrelation function for the CMASS galaxies, and obtain the 2D power spectrum\nbased on Fourier Transform of the correlation function. The method is tested\nwith an N-body mock galaxy catalog, which demonstrates that the method can\nyield an accurate and unbiased measurement of the redshift-space power spectrum\ngiven the input 2D correlation function is correct. Compared with previous\nmeasurements in literature that are usually based on direct Fourier Transform\nin redshift space, our method has the advantages that the window function and\nshot-noise are fully corrected.

The surface plasmons in\nthe plasmonic layer enlarge the wave number of photon for hundreds of time of\nthat in vacuum. The evanescent field of the surface plasmons generates\ndirectional motion of carriers in the intrinsic graphene, because of the large\nmomentum transfer from the surface plasmon to the excited carriers. A model\nHamiltonian is developed on the assumption that the in-plane wavelength of the\nsurface plasmons is much smaller than the mean free path of the carriers.

To solve the\noptimization problem under slowly varying channel information, it is decoupled\nthe problem into two interrelated subproblems. First, a dynamic clustering\nmechanism is proposed to group vehicles in zones based on their traffic\npatterns and proximity information. Second, a matching game is proposed to\nallocate resources for each V2V pair within each zone. The problem is cast as\nmany-to-one matching game in which V2V pairs and resource blocks (RBs) rank one\nanother in order to minimize their service delay. The proposed game is shown to\nbelong to the class of matching games with externalities. To solve this game, a\ndistributed algorithm is proposed using which V2V pairs and RBs interact to\nreach a stable matching. Simulation results for a Manhattan model shown that\nthe proposed scheme yields a higher percentage of V2V pairs satisfying QoS as\nwell as significant gain in terms of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise\nratio (SINR) as compared to a state-of-art resource allocation baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 07:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-14"}

We examine\nthe temporal variation in the magnetic field distribution of 37 emerging ARs. A\nkernel density estimation plot of the field distribution was created on a\nlog-log scale for each AR at each time step. We found that the central portion\nof the distribution is typically linear and its slope was used to characterise\nthe evolution of the magnetic field. Results. The slopes were seen to evolve\nwith time, becoming less steep as the fragmented emerging flux coalesces. The\nslopes reached a maximum value of ~ -1.5 just before the time of maximum flux\nbefore becoming steeper during the decay phase towards the quiet Sun value of ~\n-3. This behaviour differs significantly from a classical diffusion model,\nwhich produces a slope of -1.

These models are characterised by prescribing particle\nmotion on two spatial scales: microscopic and macroscopic. At the microscopic\nlevel, each particle has its own mass, position and velocity, while at the\nmacroscopic level the particles are interpolated to a continuum quantity whose\nevolution is governed by a system of transport equations. This way, one can\nprescribe various types of interactions on a global scale, whilst still\nmaintaining high simulation speed for a large number of particles. In addition,\nthe interplay between particle motion and interaction is well tuned in both\nregions of low and high densities.\n  We analyse links between models on these two scales and prove that under\ncertain conditions, a system of interacting particles converges to a nonlinear\ncoupled system of transport equations. We use this as a motivation to derive a\nmodel defined on both modelling scales and prescribe the intercommunication\nbetween them. Simulation takes place in inhomogeneous domains with arbitrary\nconditions at inflow and outflow boundaries. We realise this by modelling\nobstacles, sources and sinks. Integrating these aspects into the simulation\nrequires a route planning algorithm for the particles. Several algorithms are\nconsidered and evaluated on accuracy, robustness and efficiency.\n  All aspects mentioned above are combined in a novel open source prototyping\nsimulation framework called Mercurial. This computational framework allows the\ndesign of geometries and is built for high performance when large numbers of\nparticles are involved. Mercurial supports various types of inhomogeneities and\nglobal systems of equations.\n  We apply our framework to simulate scenarios in crowd dynamics.

In this paper we address this issue and obtain LP relaxations\nof quasi-polynomial size that are at least as strong as that given by the\nknapsack cover inequalities.\n  For the min-knapsack cover problem, our main result can be stated formally as\nfollows: for any $\\varepsilon >0$, there is a $(1/\\varepsilon)^{O(1)}n^{O(\\log\nn)}$-size LP relaxation with an integrality gap of at most $2+\\varepsilon$,\nwhere $n$ is the number of items.

In this paper, we introduce a formal\nframework for graph aggregation grounded in social choice theory. Our focus is\non understanding which properties shared by the individual input graphs will\ntransfer to the output graph returned by a given aggregation rule. We consider\nboth common properties of graphs, such as transitivity and reflexivity, and\narbitrary properties expressible in certain fragments of modal logic. Our\nresults establish several connections between the types of properties preserved\nunder aggregation and the choice-theoretic axioms satisfied by the rules used.\nThe most important of these results is a powerful impossibility theorem that\ngeneralises Arrow's seminal result for the aggregation of preference orders to\na large collection of different types of graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 11:08:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

Due to this, the\nsensitivity of the surfaces where the collecting anode (CA) is adjacent was\ntypically about a factor of three larger than the NCA sensitivity.

To answer this, we need to be able to estimate the H2 mass.\nTraditionally, this is done using CO and a few assumptions but the Herschel\nobservations in the FIR make it possible to estimate the molecular gas mass\nindependently of CO. Previous attempts to derive gas masses from dust emission\nsuffered from biases. Generally, dust surface densities, HI column densities,\nand CO intensities are used to derive a gas-to-dust ratio (GDR) and the local\nCO intensity to H2 column density ratio (XCO), sometimes allowing for an\nadditional CO-dark gas component (Kdark). We tested earlier methods, revealing\ndegeneracies among the parameters, and then used a Bayesian formalism to derive\nthe most likely values for each of the parameters mentioned above as a function\nof position in the nearby low metallicity spiral galaxy M33. The data are from\nthe IRAM 30m CO(2-1) line, high-resolution HI and Herschel dust continuum\nobservations. Solving for GDR, XCO, and Kdark in macro pixels 500 pc in size,\nwe find that (i) allowing for CO-dark gas significantly improves fits; (ii)\nKdark decreases with galactocentric distance; (iii) GDR is slightly higher than\ninitially expected and increases with galactocentric distance; (iv) the total\namount of dark gas closely follows the radially decreasing CO emission, as\nmight be expected if the dark gas is H2 where CO is photodissociated. The total\namount of H2, including dark gas, yields an average XCO of twice the galactic\nvalue of 2e20 cm^-2/(K km/s), 55% of this traced directly through CO. The\nrather constant fraction of dark gas suggests that there is no large population\nof diffuse H2 clouds (unrelated to GMCs) without CO emission. Unlike in large\nspirals, we detect no systematic radial trend in XCO, possibly linked to the\nabsence of a radial decrease in CO line ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 12:21:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

Snap-through allows plants to gradually store\nelastic energy, before releasing it suddenly to generate rapid motions, as in\nthe Venus flytrap. Similarly, the beak of the hummingbird snaps through to\ncatch insects mid-flight, while technological applications are increasingly\nexploiting snap-through instabilities. In all of these scenarios, it is the\nability to repeatedly generate fast motions that gives snap-through its\nutility. However, estimates of the speed of snap-through suggest that it should\noccur more quickly than is usually observed. Here, we study the dynamics of\nsnap-through in detail, showing that, even without dissipation, the dynamics\nslow down close to the snap-through transition.

However, biological researches have shown\nthat not only gender but also the aging difference between the male and the\nfemale inevitably affect the age estimation. To our knowledge, so far there\nhave been two methods that have concerned the gender factor. The first is a\nsequential method which first classifies the gender and then performs age\nestimation respectively for classified male and female. Although it promotes\nage estimation performance because of its consideration on the gender semantic\ndifference, an accumulation risk of estimation errors is unavoidable. To\novercome drawbacks of the sequential strategy, the second is to regress the age\nappended with the gender by concatenating their labels as two dimensional\noutput using Partial Least Squares (PLS). Although leading to promotion of age\nestimation performance, such a concatenation not only likely confuses the\nsemantics between the gender and age, but also ignores the aging discrepancy\nbetween the male and the female. In order to overcome their shortcomings, in\nthis paper we propose a unified framework to perform gender-aware age\nestimation. The proposed method considers and utilizes not only the semantic\nrelationship between the gender and the age, but also the aging discrepancy\nbetween the male and the female.

In the present work, we use two different pipelines, GAUFRE (Valentini\net al. 2013) and Sp_Ace (Boeche & Grebel 2016), to determine atmospheric\nparameters and abundances by fixing log(g) to the seismic one.

We follow in\ndetail the evolution of the abundances of several chemical species (C, O, S,\nSi, Fe and Zn) in the gas and dust of a typical dwarf irregular galaxy. The\ndwarf irregular galaxy is assumed to evolve with a low but continuous level of\nstar formation and experience galactic winds triggered by supernova explosions.\nWe predict the evolution of the gas to dust ratio in such a galaxy and discuss\ncritically the main processes involving dust, such as dust production by AGB\nstars and Type II SNe, destruction and accretion (gas condensation in clouds).\nWe then apply our model to Damped Lyman-Alpha systems which are believed to be\ndwarf irregulars, as witnessed by their abundance patterns. Our main\nconclusions are: i) we can reproduce the observed gas to dust ratio in dwarf\ngalaxies. ii) We find that the process of dust accretion plays a fundamental\nrole in the evolution of dust and in certain cases it becomes the dominant\nprocess in the dust cycle. On the other hand, dust destruction seems to be a\nnegligible process in irregulars. iii) Concerning Damped Lyman-Alpha systems,\nwe show that the observed gas-phase abundances of silicon, normalized to\nvolatile elements (zinc and sulfur), are in agreement with our model. iv) The\nabundances of iron and silicon in DLA systems suggest that the two elements\nundergo a different history of dust formation and evolution. Our work casts\nlight on the nature of iron-rich dust: the observed depletion pattern of iron\nis well reproduced only when an additional source of iron dust is considered.\nHere we explore the possibility of a contribution from Type Ia SNe as well as\nan efficient accretion of iron nano-particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 13:52:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

The fundamental\ncytoskeleton structure of cilia and flagella is the axoneme, a cylindrical\narray of microtubule doublets connected by passive crosslinkers and dynein\nmotor proteins. The complex interplay of these elements leads to the generation\nof self-organized bending waves. Although many mathematical models have been\nproposed to understand this process, few attempts have been made to assess the\nrole of dyneins on the nonlinear nature of the axoneme. Here, we investigate\nthe nonlinear dynamics of flagella by considering an axonemal sliding control\nmechanism for dynein activity. This approach unveils the nonlinear selection of\nthe oscillation amplitudes, which are typically either missed or prescribed in\nmathematical models. The explicit set of nonlinear equations are derived and\nsolved numerically. Our analysis reveals the spatiotemporal dynamics of dynein\npopulations and flagellum shape for different regimes of motor activity, medium\nviscosity and flagellum elasticity. Unstable modes saturate via the coupling of\ndynein kinetics and flagellum shape without the need of invoking a nonlinear\naxonemal response.

The more viscous liquid L_1 is injected into\nthe channel from the center inlet, and the less viscous liquid L_2 from two\nside inlets. Liquid L_1 takes the form of a thin filament due to hydrodynamic\nfocusing in the long channel that leads to the diverging region. The thread\nthen becomes unstable to a folding instability, due to the longitudinal\ncompressive stress applied to it by the diverging flow of liquid L_2. Given the\nlong computation time, we were limited to a parameter study comprising five\nsimulations in which the flow rate ratio, the viscosity ratio, the Reynolds\nnumber, and the shape of the channel were varied relative to a reference model.\nIn our simulations, the cross section of the thread produced by focusing is\nelliptical rather than circular. The initial folding axis can be either\nparallel or perpendicular to the narrow dimension of the chamber. In the former\ncase, the folding slowly transforms via twisting to perpendicular folding, or\nit may remain parallel. The direction of folding onset is determined by the\nvelocity profile and the elliptical shape of the thread cross section in the\nchannel that feeds the diverging part of the cell. Due to the high viscosity\ncontrast and very low Reynolds numbers, direct numerical simulations of this\ntwo-phase flow are very challenging and to our knowledge these are the first\nthree-dimensional direct parallel numerical simulations of viscous threads in\nmicrochannels.

Such acceleration\ncan produce the non-thermal particles that emit the broadband continuum\nradiation that is detected from extragalactic jets. An important recent\ndevelopment for blazar science is the ability of Fermi-LAT spectroscopy to pin\ndown the shape of the distribution of the underlying non-thermal particle\npopulation. This paper highlights how multi-wavelength spectra spanning optical\nto X-ray to gamma-ray bands can be used to probe diffusive acceleration in\nrelativistic, oblique, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks in blazar jets.\nDiagnostics on the MHD turbulence near such shocks are obtained using thermal\nand non-thermal particle distributions resulting from detailed Monte Carlo\nsimulations of DSA.

An other application\nconsists in proving that smooth solutions of the Euler-Arnold equation for the\nHdiv right-invariant metric are length minimizing geodesics for sufficiently\nshort times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 14:09:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 12:23:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2017 08:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-15"}
