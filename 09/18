However, many mainstream\nprogramming and markup languages (C, Haskell, Python, XML, and more) possess\ncontext-sensitive features. These features are traditionally handled with\nad-hoc code (e.g., custom lexers), outside of the scope of parsing theory.\n  Current grammar formalisms struggle to express context-sensitive features.\nMost solutions lack context transparency: they make grammars hard to write,\nmaintain and compose by hardwiring context through the entire grammar. Instead,\nwe approach context-sensitive parsing through the idea that parsers may recall\npreviously matched input (or data derived therefrom) in order to make parsing\ndecisions. We make use of mutable parse state to enable this form of recall.\n  We introduce principled stateful parsing as a new transactional discipline\nthat makes state changes transparent to parsing mechanisms such as backtracking\nand memoization. To enforce this discipline, users specify parsers using\nformally specified primitive state manipulation operations.\n  Our solution is available as a parsing library named Autumn.

The UCHVCs were selected based on\na combination of size, isolation, large recessional velocity and high column\ndensity as the best candidate dark matter halos. The WSRT data were tapered to\nimage the UCHVCs at 210\" (comparable to Arecibo) and 105\" angular resolution.\nIn a comparison of the single-dish to interferometer data, we find that the\nline flux recovered in the WSRT observations is comparable to that from the\nsingle-dish ALFALFA data. In addition, any structure seen in the ALFALFA data\nis reproduced in the WSRT maps at the same angular resolution. At 210'\"\nresolution all the sources are generally compact with a smooth HI morphology,\nas expected from their identification as UCHVCs. At the higher angular\nresolution, a majority of the sources break into small clumps contained in a\ndiffuse envelope. These UCHVCs also have no ordered velocity motion and are\nmost likely Galactic halo clouds. We identify two UCHVCs, AGC 198606 and AGC\n249525, as excellent galaxy candidates based on maintaining a smooth HI\nmorphology at higher angular resolution and showing ordered velocity motion\nconsistent with rotation. A third source, AGC 249565, lies between these two\npopulations in properties and is a possible galaxy candidate.

In general, such problems\npose issues for standard finite difference solvers, as the inherent\ndiscontinuity in the solution results in erroneous derivative information\nwherever the stencils straddle the given interface. Here, however, the recently\nproposed Correction Function Method (CFM) is used, in which correction terms\nare computed from the interface conditions, and added to affected nodes to\ncompensate for the discontinuity. In contrast to existing methods, these\ncorrections are not simply defined at affected nodes, but rather generalized to\na continuous function within a small region surrounding the interface. As a\nresult, the correction function may be defined in terms of its own governing\npartial differential equation (PDE) which may be solved, in principle, to\narbitrary order of accuracy. The resulting scheme is not only arbitrarily high\norder, but also robust, having already seen application to Poisson problems and\nthe heat equation. By extending the CFM to this new class of PDEs, the\ntreatment of wave interface discontinuities in homogeneous media becomes\npossible. This allows, for example, for the straightforward treatment of\ninfinitesimal source terms and sharp boundaries, free of staircasing errors.\nAdditionally, new modifications to the CFM are derived, allowing compatibility\nwith explicit multi-step methods, such as Runge-Kutta (RK4), without a\nreduction in accuracy.

The archetypal network-style diagrammatic language is\nthat of electric circuits; other examples include signal flow graphs, Markov\nprocesses, automata, Petri nets, chemical reaction networks, and so on. The key\nfeature is that the language is comprised of a number of components with\nmultiple (input/output) terminals, each possibly labelled with some type, that\nmay then be connected together along these terminals to form a larger network.\nThe components form hyperedges between labelled vertices, and so a diagram in\nthis language forms a hypergraph. We formalise the compositional structure by\nintroducing the notion of a hypergraph category. Network-style diagrammatic\nlanguages and their semantics thus form hypergraph categories, and semantic\ninterpretation gives a hypergraph functor.\n  The first part of this thesis develops the theory of hypergraph categories.\nIn particular, we introduce the tools of decorated cospans and corelations.\nDecorated cospans allow straightforward construction of hypergraph categories\nfrom diagrammatic languages: the inputs, outputs, and their composition are\nmodelled by the cospans, while the 'decorations' specify the components\nthemselves. Not all hypergraph categories can be constructed, however, through\ndecorated cospans. Decorated corelations are a more powerful version that\npermits construction of all hypergraph categories and hypergraph functors.\nThese are often useful for constructing the semantic categories of diagrammatic\nlanguages and functors from diagrams to the semantics.

Perturbations to the network can change the relative ranking within\nthe cluster, but vertices rarely move from one cluster to another.

Uniform procedures are\ndeveloped to compute the detection threshold, to estimate the\nforeground/background contamination, and to calculate the XLFs for individual\ngalaxies and groups of galaxies, resulting in an XLF library for 343 galaxies\nof different types. With the large number of surveyed galaxies, we have studied\nthe XLFs and ULX properties across different host galaxy types, and confirm\nwith good statistics that the XLF slope flattens from lenticular\n($\\alpha\\sim1.50\\pm0.07$) to elliptical ($\\sim1.21\\pm0.02$), to spirals\n($\\sim0.80\\pm0.02$), to peculiars ($\\sim0.55\\pm0.30$), and to irregulars\n($\\sim0.26\\pm0.10$).

We\nshow that the time-fractional diffusion-wave equation interpolates between\nthese two different responses in the sense that the propagation velocities of\nthe maximum points, centers of gravity, and medians of the fundamental\nsolutions to both the Cauchy and the signaling problems are all finite. On the\nother hand, the disturbance spreads infinitely fast and the time-fractional\ndiffusion-wave equation is non-relativistic like the classical diffusion\nequation. In this paper, the maximum locations, the centers of gravity, and the\nmedians of the fundamental solution to the Cauchy and signaling problems and\ntheir propagation velocities are described analytically and calculated\nnumerically. The obtained results for the Cauchy and the signaling problems are\ninterpreted and compared to each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2016 08:16:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}

At very low $Ro$,\nthe transient growth amplitudes are close to those for non-rotating flow, but\nCoriolis forces already assert themselves by producing distinct asymmetry about\nthe channel centreline.

We can control their curvature by\ncontrolling the environment in which the process is carried out, including\nseveral parameters, such as the contact angle and the curvature of the drops by\nchanging the surface tension of the liquid drop during crystal growth. Here we\npresent an energetic model that explains this phenomenon and predicts why and\nunder what conditions crystals will be forced to grow with the curvature of the\nmicro droplet even though the energetic state of a curved single crystal is\nvery high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2016 10:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}

Turing\nkernelization is a general form of kernelization. In the aspect of\nkernelization, an impressive hardness theory has been established [Bodlaender\netc. (ICALP 2008, JCSS2009), Fortnow and Santhanam (STOC 2008, JCSS 2011), Dell\nand van Melkebeek (STOC 2010, J.

Unfortunately, there is\nyet no tool can prove Turing kernel lower bound for any FPT problem modulo any\nreasonable complexity hypothesis. Thus, constructing a framework for Turing\nkernel lower bound was proposed as an open problem in different occasions\n[Fernau etc. (STACS 2009), Misra etc. (Discrete Optimization 2011), Kratsch\n(Bulletin of the EATCS 2014), Cygan etc. (Dagstuhl Seminars on kernels 2014)].\nLadner [J.

The interface behaves as a plasmonic waveguide composed\nof surface-plasmon polariton modes. It is found that significantly different\ndynamics occur for the resonant and an off-resonant couplings of the plasma\nfield to the atoms. In the case of the resonant coupling, the plasma field does\nnot appear as a dissipative reservoir to the atoms. We adopt the image method\nand show that the dynamics of the two atoms are completely equivalent to those\nof a four-atom system. Moreover, two threshold coupling strengths exist, one\ncorresponding to the strength of coupling of the plasma field to the symmetric\nand the other the antisymmetric mode of the two-atom system. The thresholds\ndistinguish between the non-Markovian (memory preserving) and Markovian\n(memoryless) regimes of the evolutions that different time scales of the\nevolution of the memory effects and entanglement can be observed. The Markovian\nregime is characterized by exponentially decaying whereas the non-Markovian\nregime by sinusoidally oscillating contributions to the evolution of the\nprobability amplitudes. The solutions predict a large and long living\nentanglement mediated by the plasma field in both Markovian and non-Markovian\nregimes of the evolution. We also show that a simultaneous Markovian and\nnon-Markovian regime of the evolution may occur in which the memory effects\nexist over a finite evolution time. In the case of an off-resonant coupling of\nthe atoms to the plasma field, the atoms interact with each other by exchanging\nvirtual photons which results in the dynamics corresponding to those of two\natoms coupled to a common reservoir.

Such error can result\nin noise under estimation up to a few dB in the lowest-noise quartz\noscillators, and in a complete nonsense in the case of cryogenic oscillators.\nAs another alarming fact, the presence of metamaterial components in the\noscillator results in unpredictable behavior and large errors, even in well\ncontrolled experimental conditions.
