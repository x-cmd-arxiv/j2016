We used Chandra data of the XBOOTES field\n($\\sim9\\,\\mathrm{deg^2}$) to conduct the most accurate measurement to date of\nthe power spectrum of fluctuations of the unresolved CXB on the angular scales\nof $\\sim3\\,$arcsec $-$ $\\sim17\\,$arcmin. We find that at sub-arcmin angular\nscales, the power spectrum is consistent with the AGN shot noise, without much\nneed for any significant contribution from their one-halo term. This is\nconsistent with the theoretical expectation that low-luminosity AGN reside\nalone in their dark matter halos. However, at larger angular scales we detect a\nsignificant LSS signal above the AGN shot noise. Its power spectrum, obtained\nafter subtracting the AGN shot noise, follows a power law with the slope of\n$-0.8\\pm0.1$ and its amplitude is much larger than what can be plausibly\nexplained by the two-halo term of AGN. We demonstrate that the detected LSS\nsignal is produced by unresolved clusters and groups of galaxies. For the flux\nlimit of the XBOOTES survey, their flux-weighted mean redshift equals\n$\\left<z\\right>\\sim0.3$, and the mean temperature of their intracluster medium\n(ICM), $\\left<T\\right>\\approx 1.4$ keV, corresponds to the mass of $M_{500}\n\\sim 10^{13.5}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$.

High-resolution, two-dimensional,\nradiation-hydrodynamical simulations of the formation and evolution of hot\nbubbles in PNe, with and without thermal conduction, are used to calculate the\nX-ray emission and study its time-dependence and relationship to the changing\nstellar parameters. Instabilities in the wind-wind interaction zone produce\nclumps and filaments in the swept-up shell of nebular material. Turbulent\nmixing and thermal conduction at the corrugated interface can produce\nquantities of intermediate temperature and density gas between the hot, shocked\nwind bubble and the swept-up photoionized nebular material, which can emit in\nsoft, diffuse X-rays. We use the CHIANTI software to compute synthetic spectra\nfor the models and calculate their luminosities.

Eventually, an M7.3 quake occurred on Apr 16 on the Futagawa FZ. We\ninvestigated if any sign indicative of the M7.3 quake could be found in the\nspace-time changes of seismicity after the M6.5 quake. We determined in advance\nthe threshold magnitude, above which all earthquakes are completely recorded.\nWe then showed that the occurrence rate of relatively large (M >= 3)\nearthquakes significantly decreased 1 day before the M7.3 quake. Significance\nof this decrease was evaluated by one standard deviation of sampled changes in\nthe rate of occurrence. We next confirmed that seismicity with M >= 3 was well\nmodeled by the OU law with p ~ 1.5 +/- 0.3, which indicates that the temporal\ndecay of seismicity was significantly faster than a typical decay with p = 1.\nThe larger p value was obtained when we used data of the longer time period in\nthe analysis. This significance was confirmed by a bootstrapping approach. Our\ndetailed analysis shows that the large p value was caused by the rapid decay of\nthe seismicity in the northern area around the Futagawa FZ. Application of the\nslope (the b value) of the GR frequency-magnitude distribution to the\nspatiotemporal change in the seismicity revealed that the b value in the\nnorthern area increased significantly, the increase being db = 0.3-0.5.\nSignificance was verified by a statistical test of db and a test using\nbootstrapping errors. Based on our findings, combined with the results obtained\nby a stress inversion analysis performed by the NIED, we suggested that stress\nnear the Futagawa FZ had reduced just prior to the occurrence of the M7.3\nquake. We proposed, with some other observations, that a reduction in stress\nmight have been induced by growth of the slow slips on the Futagawa FZ.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 01:52:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 23:59:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2016 18:36:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

In the paper, we use the heterogeneous mean-field\ntheory to derive the rate equation for governing the model's dynamics that can\nanalytically determine the critical noise $f_c$ in the limit of infinite\nnetwork size $N\\rightarrow \\infty$. The result shows that $f_c$ depends on the\nratio of ${\\left\\langle k \\right\\rangle }$ to ${\\left\\langle k^{3/2}\n\\right\\rangle }$, where ${\\left\\langle k \\right\\rangle }$ and ${\\left\\langle\nk^{3/2} \\right\\rangle }$ are the average degree and the $3/2$ order moment of\ndegree distribution, respectively.

Supernovae come in different\ntypes, and although their energy budget is of the same order, their remnants\nhave different properties, and so may contribute in different ways to the pool\nof Galactic cosmic-rays.

However, the propagation of the counting noise in the correlation\nalgorithm of data reduction is disadvantageous for the lowest intensity parts\nof the observed spectrum. To mitigate this effect at pulsed neutron sources we\npropose two dimensional time-of-flight recording of each neutron detection\nevent: with respect to both the neutron source pulses and to the rotation phase\nof the pseudo-random beam modulation statistical chopper. We have identified a\nformulation of the data reduction algorithm by matching the data processing\ntime channel width to the inherent time resolution of this chopper, which makes\nthe reconstruction of the direct time-of-flight spectra exact and independent\nof all other contributions to instrumental resolution. Two ways are proposed\nfor most flexible choice of intensity vs. resolution without changing the\nstatistical chopper or its speed: changing the size of the beam window during\nthe experiment or varying intensity and resolution options in the data\nreduction algorithm after the experiment. This latter is a unique and very\npromising new potential offered by the correlation method. Furthermore, it\ndisplays reduced sensitivity to external background, also due to the much\nhigher signal intensity. This is particularly advantageous for extending the\noperational range to higher neutron energies. In hot and thermal neutron\nvibrational spectroscopy, the statistical chopper approach allows us to achieve\nvery significant gains in spectrometer efficiency compared to using\nconventional choppers.

Although it brings the benefits such as functionality\nreuse and data sharing, a threat called component hijacking is also introduced.\nBy hijacking a vulnerable component in victim apps, an attack app can escalate\nits privilege for originally prohibited operations. Many prior studies have\nbeen performed to understand and mitigate this issue, but component hijacking\nremains a serious open problem in the Android ecosystem due to no effective\ndefense deployed in the wild. In this paper, we present our vision on\npractically defending against component hijacking in Android apps. First, we\nargue that to fundamentally prevent component hijacking, we need to switch from\nthe previous mindset (i.e., performing system-level control or repackaging\nvulnerable apps after they are already released) to a more proactive version\nthat aims to help security-inexperienced developers make secure components in\nthe first place. To this end, we propose to embed into apps a secure component\nlibrary (SecComp), which performs in-app mandatory access control on behalf of\napp components. An important factor for SecComp to be effective is that we find\nit is possible to devise a set of practical in-app policies to stop component\nhijacking. Furthermore, we allow developers design custom policies, beyond our\nby-default generic policies, to support more fine-grained access control. We\nhave overcome challenges to implement a preliminary SecComp prototype, which\nstops component hijacking with very low performance overhead. We hope the\nfuture research that fully implements our vision can eventually help real-world\napps get rid of component hijacking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 09:33:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 03:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-14"}

However, no comparable\nhigh-resolution survey exists at long radio wavelengths around 21cm in line and\ncontinuum emission. Methods: Employing the Very Large Array (VLA) in the\nC-array configuration and a large program, we observe the HI 21cm line, four OH\nlines, nineteen Halpha radio recombination lines as well as the continuum\nemission from 1 to 2GHz in full polarization over a large part of the first\nGalactic quadrant. Results: Covering Galactic longitudes from 14.5 to 67.4deg\nand latitudes between +-1.25deg, we image all of these lines and the continuum\nat ~20\" resolution. These data allow us to study the various components of the\ninterstellar medium (ISM): from the atomic phase, traced by the HI line, to the\nmolecular phase, observed by the OH transitions, to the ionized medium,\nrevealed by the cm continuum and the Halpha radio recombination lines.\nFurthermore, the polarized continuum emission enables magnetic field studies.\nIn this overview paper, we discuss the survey outline and present the first\ndata release as well as early results from the different datasets.

Conclusions: The HI/OH/Recombination line\nsurvey of the Milky Way (THOR) opens a new window to the different parts of the\nISM. It enables detailed studies of molecular cloud formation, conversion of\natomic to molecular gas, and feedback from HII regions as well as the magnetic\nfield in the Milky Way. It is highly complementary to other surveys of our\nGalaxy, and comparing different datasets allows us to address many open\nquestions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 10:00:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

BaFe2As2 is one of ideal systems for\nsuch investigation because its superconductivity can be induced in several\nways, allowing a comparative examination. Here we report a study on the spin\nfluctuations of the hole-overdoped iron-based superconductors Ba1-xKxFe2As2 (x\n= 0.5 and 1.0; Tc = 36 K and 3.4 K, respectively) over the entire Brillouin\nzone using inelastic neutron scattering.

The band width of\nthe spin wave-like dispersion is almost constant from the non-doped to\noptimum-doped region, which is followed by a large reduction in the overdoped\nregion. This suggests that the superconductivity is suppressed by the reduction\nof magnetic exchange couplings, indicating a strong relationship between\nmagnetism and superconductivity in iron-based superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 10:40:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-13"}

In this paper, we propose a meaning-oriented approach to\nmodeling semantic data and establish a graph-based semantic data model. In this\napproach we use the meanings, i.e., the subjective views of the entities and\nrelationships, to describe the semantic information, and use the semantic\ngraphs containing the meaning nodes and the meta-meaning relations to specify\nthe taxonomy and the compound construction of the semantic concepts. We\ndemonstrate how this meaning-oriented approach can address many important\nsemantic representation issues, including dynamic specialization and natural\njoin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 11:16:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-13"}

For this purpose, two different methods\nto estimate the instantaneous charge state of the projectile have been\nemployed: (1) rate equations using ionization and recombination cross sections,\nand (2) equilibrium charge state formulas for plasmas. Also, the equilibrium\ncharge state has been obtained using these ionization and recombination cross\nsections, and compared with the former equilibrium formulas. The equilibrium\ncharge state of projectiles in plasmas is not always reached, it depends mainly\non the projectile velocity and the plasma density. Therefore, a non-equilibrium\nor an instantaneous description of the projectile charge is necessary. The\ncharge state of projectile ions cannot be measured, except after exiting the\ntarget, and experimental data remain very scarce. Thus, the validity of our\ncharge state model is checked by comparing the theoretical predictions with an\nenergy loss experiment, as the energy loss has a generally quadratic dependence\non the projectile charge state. The dielectric formalism has been used to\ncalculate the plasma stopping power including the Brandt-Kitagawa (BK) model to\ndescribe the charge distribution of the projectile. In this charge\ndistribution, the instantaneous number of bound electrons instead of the\nequilibrium number has been taken into account. Comparing our theoretical\npredictions with experiments, it is shown the necessity of including the\ninstantaneous charge state and the BK charge distribution for a correct energy\nloss estimation. The results also show that the initial charge state has a\nstrong influence in order to estimate the energy loss of the uranium ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 11:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

The stellar metallicity excess in\nclusters is also sensitive to the efficiency scaling of star formation\nfeedback. We identify stripping of low-metallicity gas from the galaxy\noutskirts, as well as suppression of metal-poor inflows towards the galaxy\ncentre, as key drivers of the enhancement of gas metallicity. Stellar\nmetallicities in satellites are higher than in the field as a direct\nconsequence of the more metal-rich star forming gas, whereas stripping of stars\nand suppressed stellar mass growth, as well as differences in accreted vs.\nin-situ star formation between satellites and the field, are of secondary\nimportance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 13:06:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-30"}

The formation histories, and thus ages, of dark matter halos\ncorrelate with their large-scale density $\\rho$, an effect known as assembly\nbias. We test whether this correlation extends to galaxies by measuring the\ndependence of galaxy stellar age on $\\rho$. To clarify the comparison between\ntheory and observation, and to remove the strong environmental effects on\nsatellites, we use galaxy group catalogs to identify central galaxies and\nmeasure their quenched fraction, $f_Q$, as a function of large-scale\nenvironment. Models that match halo age to central galaxy age predict a strong\npositive correlation between $f_Q$ and $\\rho$. However, we show that the\namplitude of this effect depends on the definition of halo age: assembly bias\nis significantly reduced when removing the effects of splashback halos---those\nhalos that are central but have passed through a larger halo or experienced\nstrong tidal encounters. Defining age using halo mass at its peak value rather\nthan current mass removes these effects. In SDSS data, at M$_{\\rm gal}\\gtrsim\n10^{10.0}$ M_sol/h$^2$, there is a $\\sim 5\\%$ increase in $f_Q$ from low to\nhigh densities, which is in agreement with predictions of dark matter halos\nusing peak halo mass. At lower stellar mass there is little to no correlation\nof $f_Q$ with $\\rho$. For these galaxies, age-matching is inconsistent with the\ndata across the wide range the halo formation metrics that we tested. This\nimplies that halo formation history has a small but statistically significant\nimpact on quenching of star formation at high masses, while the quenching\nprocess in low-mass central galaxies is uncorrelated with halo formation\nhistory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 13:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

The initial\nnodes of the tree separate the instances based on feature information and\nselectively enable the latter nodes to perform object specific classification.\nThe proposed methodology allows selective activation of only those branches and\nnodes of the classification tree that are relevant to the input while keeping\nthe remaining nodes idle.

Unfortunately, most\nexisting approaches to joint modelling are either too simplistic to be powerful\nor are impracticable for computational reasons. Inspired by Richardson et al.\n(2010, Bayesian Statistics 9), we consider a sparse multivariate regression\nmodel that allows simultaneous selection of predictors and associated\nresponses. As Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference on such models can be\nprohibitively slow when the number of genetic variants exceeds a few thousand,\nwe propose a variational inference approach which produces posterior\ninformation very close to that of MCMC inference, at a much reduced\ncomputational cost. Extensive numerical experiments show that our approach\noutperforms popular variable selection methods and tailored Bayesian\nprocedures, dealing within hours with problems involving hundreds of thousands\nof genetic variants and tens to hundreds of clinical or molecular outcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 13:43:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 15:47:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 20:15:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

As most stars in the Gaia catalogue will have non-negligible fractional\nparallax errors, we must treat distance estimation as a constrained inference\nproblem. Here we investigate the performance of various priors for estimating\ndistances, using a simulated Gaia catalogue of one billion stars. We use three\nminimalist, isotropic priors, as well an anisotropic prior derived from the\nobservability of stars in a Milky Way model. The two priors that assume a\nuniform distribution of stars--either in distance or in space density---give\npoor results: The root mean square fractional distance error, f_RMS, grows far\nin excess of 100% once the fractional parallax error, f_true, is larger than\n0.1. A prior assuming an exponentially decreasing space density with increasing\ndistance performs well once its single scale length parameter has been set to\nan appropriate value: f_RMS is roughly equal to f_true for f_true < 0.4, yet\ndoes not increase further as f_true increases up to to 1.0. The Milky Way prior\nperforms well except towards the Galactic centre, due to a mismatch with the\n(simulated) data. Such mismatches will be inevitable (and remain unknown) in\nreal applications, and can produce large errors. We therefore suggest to adopt\nthe simpler exponentially decreasing space density prior, which is also less\ntime-consuming to compute. Including Gaia photometry improves the distance\nestimation significantly for both the Milky Way and exponentially decreasing\nspace density prior, yet doing so requires additional assumptions about the\nphysical nature of stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 14:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-30"}

The vegetation is modelled as a porous zone, and\nthe effects of the vegetation are included in the momentum and turbulence\nequations. A detailed dry deposition model is incorporated in the pollutant\ntransport equation, allowing the investigation of the filtering properties of\nurban vegetation. The solver is validated on four test cases to assess the\ncomponents of the model: the flow and pollutant dispersion around the 2D hill,\nthe temporal evolution of the rising thermal bubble, the flow through and\naround the forest canopy, and a hedgerow filtering the particle-laden flow.\nGenerally good agreement with the measured values or previously computed\nnumerical solution is observed, although some deficiencies of the model are\nidentified. These are related to the chosen turbulence model and to the\nuncertainties of the vegetation properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 14:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-13"}

Loss of follow-up could be\ncaused by valve intervention or the death of the patient.

As a necessary step, we also extend previous results,\nconcerning the base case of square matrices, to cover complexes other than free\nresolutions.\n  Our statements specialize to those of ordinary Boij-S\\\"oderberg theory when\n$k=1$. Our proof of the equivariant pairing gives a new proof in the graded\nsetting: it relies on finding perfect matchings on certain graphs associated to\nBetti tables.\n  Finally, we give preliminary results on $2 \\times 3$ matrices, exhibiting\ncertain classes of extremal rays on the cone of Betti tables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 15:23:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2016 20:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-20"}

Spectra of heavy ions in many large SEP events show features\nsuch as roll-overs or spectral breaks. In some events when the spectra are\nplotted in energy/nucleon they can be shifted relative to each other to make\nthe spectral breaks align. The amount of shift is charge-to-mass ratio (Q/A)\ndependent and varies from event to event. This can be understood if the spectra\nof heavy ions are organized by the diffusion coefficients (Cohen et al., 2005).\nIn the work of Li et al. (2009), the Q/A dependences of the scaling is related\nto shock geometry when the CME-driven shock is close to the Sun. For events\nwhere multiple in-situ spacecraft observations exist, one may expect that\ndifferent spacecraft are connected to different portions of the CME-driven\nshock that have different shock geometries, therefore yielding different Q/A\ndependence.

Gaussian and triangle-based membership functions are investigated and\ncompared using real data over several weeks from different Android phone users.\nThe presented results show that our proposed Fuzzy Logic approach is a highly\neffective, and viable scheme for lightweight real-time implicit authentication\non mobile devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 10:15:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-11"}
