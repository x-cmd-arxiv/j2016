It\nis an open question how real spiking neurons produce the kind of powerful\nneural computation that is possible with deep artificial neural networks, using\nonly so very few spikes to communicate. Building on recent insights in\nneuroscience, we present an Adapting Spiking Neural Network (ASNN) based on\nadaptive spiking neurons. These spiking neurons efficiently encode information\nin spike-trains using a form of Asynchronous Pulsed Sigma-Delta coding while\nhomeostatically optimizing their firing rate. In the proposed paradigm of\nspiking neuron computation, neural adaptation is tightly coupled to synaptic\nplasticity, to ensure that downstream neurons can correctly decode upstream\nspiking neurons. We show that this type of network is inherently able to carry\nout asynchronous and event-driven neural computation, while performing\nidentical to corresponding artificial neural networks (ANNs). In particular, we\nshow that these adaptive spiking neurons can be drop in replacements for ReLU\nneurons in standard feedforward ANNs comprised of such units. We demonstrate\nthat this can also be successfully applied to a ReLU based deep convolutional\nneural network for classifying the MNIST dataset. The ASNN thus outperforms\ncurrent Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) implementations, while responding (up\nto) an order of magnitude faster and using an order of magnitude fewer spikes.\nAdditionally, in a streaming setting where frames are continuously classified,\nwe show that the ASNN requires substantially fewer network updates as compared\nto the corresponding ANN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 16:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

This proves that ensemble inequivalence is a consequence of\n$non$-$additivity$ rather than $non$-$extensivity$.

This new\napproach is fast, simple, and effective in saving storage space. A key insight\nin our approach is that access time (including decompression latency) is\ncritical in modern memory hierarchies. By combining inexpensive hardware\nsupport with modest OS support, our holistic approach to compression achieves\nsubstantial improvements in performance and energy efficiency across the memory\nhierarchy. Using this new approach, we make several major contributions in this\nthesis. First, we propose a new compression algorithm, Base-Delta-Immediate\nCompression (BDI), that achieves high compression ratio with very low\ncompression/decompression latency. BDI exploits the existing low dynamic range\nof values present in many cache lines to compress them to smaller sizes using\nBase+Delta encoding. Second, we observe that the compressed size of a cache\nblock can be indicative of its reuse. We use this observation to develop a new\ncache insertion policy for compressed caches, the Size-based Insertion Policy\n(SIP), which uses the size of a compressed block as one of the metrics to\npredict its potential future reuse. Third, we propose a new main memory\ncompression framework, Linearly Compressed Pages (LCP), that significantly\nreduces the complexity and power cost of supporting main memory compression. We\ndemonstrate that any compression algorithm can be adapted to fit the\nrequirements of LCP, and that LCP can be efficiently integrated with the\nexisting cache compression designs, avoiding extra compression/decompression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 16:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

This article sheds new light on dimensionality reduction from the\nperspective of compressed sensing theory and studies its interplay with imaging\nalgorithms designed in the context of convex optimization. We propose a\npost-gridding linear data embedding to the space spanned by the left singular\nvectors of the measurement operator, providing a dimensionality reduction below\nimage size. This embedding preserves the null space of the measurement operator\nand hence also its sampling properties as per compressed sensing theory. We\nshow that this can be approximated by first computing the dirty image and then\napplying a weighted subsampled discrete Fourier transform to obtain the final\nreduced data vector. This Fourier dimensionality reduction model ensures a fast\nimplementation of the full measurement operator, essential for any iterative\nimage reconstruction method. The proposed reduction also preserves the i.i.d.\nGaussian properties of the original measurement noise. For convex\noptimization-based imaging algorithms, this is key to justify the use of the\nstandard L2-norm as the data fidelity term. Our simulations confirm that this\ndimensionality reduction approach can be leveraged by convex optimization\nalgorithms with no loss in imaging quality relative to reconstructing the image\nfrom the complete visibility data set.

In a pedagogical way, a few\nexamples of exactly solvable models are worked out to go from the coordinate\napproach to the Algebraic Bethe Ansatz, with some discussion on the finite\ntemperature thermodynamics. The aim is to provide the instruments to approach\nmore advanced books or to allow for a critical reading of research articles and\nthe extraction of useful information from them. We describe the solution of the\nanisotropic XY spin chain; of the Lieb-Liniger model of bosons with contact\ninteraction at zero and finite temperature; and of the XXZ spin chain, first in\nthe coordinate and then in the algebraic approach. To establish the connection\nbetween the latter and the solution of two dimensional classical models, we\nalso introduce and solve the 6-vertex model. Finally, the low energy physics of\nthese integrable models is mapped into the corresponding conformal field\ntheory. Through its style and the choice of topics, this book tries to touch\nall fundamental ideas behind integrability and is meant for students and\nresearchers interested either in an introduction to later delve in the advance\naspects of Bethe Ansatz or in an overview of the topic for broadening their\nculture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 18:31:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 10:27:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 09:51:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-23"}

Under the current pricing mechanisms, cloud\nservice providers offer several service options and charge consumers based on\nthe resources they use. Before they can decide which cloud resources to\nrequest, consumers have to estimate the completion time and cost of their\ncomputational tasks for different service options and possibly for different\nservice providers. This estimation is challenging even for expert cloud users.\nWe propose a new market-based framework for pricing computational tasks in the\ncloud. Our framework introduces an agent between consumers and cloud providers.\nThe agent takes data and computational tasks from users, estimates time and\ncost for evaluating the tasks, and returns to consumers contracts that specify\nthe price and completion time. Our framework can be applied directly to\nexisting cloud markets without altering the way cloud providers offer and price\nservices. In addition, it simplifies cloud use for consumers by allowing them\nto compare contracts, rather than choose resources directly. We present design,\nanalytical, and algorithmic contributions focusing on pricing computation\ncontracts, analyzing their properties, and optimizing them in complex\nworkflows. We conduct an experimental evaluation of our market framework over a\nreal-world cloud service and demonstrate empirically that our market ensures\nthree key properties: competitiveness, fairness, and resilience. Finally, we\npresent a fine-grained pricing mechanism for complex workflows and show that it\ncan increase agent profits by more than an order of magnitude in some cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 18:42:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2016 06:25:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 14:19:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 19:55:15 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 02:31:53 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 20:40:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-20"}

The proposed MD scheme\nenables each receiver to uniquely and efficiently detect their desired signals\nfrom the superposition of mutually interfering cochannel signals in the absence\nof noise. In our design, the optimal transmitter beamforming problem is solved\nin a closed-form for two-user MISO BC using max-min fairness as a design\ncriterion.

All modulation schemes result\nin a system that relate the transmitted and the received signals through an\nadditive noise, which follows a stable distribution. As the common notion of\nthe variance of a signal is not suitable for defining the power of stable\ndistributed signals (due to infinite variance), we derive an expression for the\ngeometric power of a large class of stable distributions, and then use this\nresult to characterize the geometric signal-to-noise ratio (G-SNR) for each of\nthe modulation techniques.

The first layer\nof the interference network is the backhaul layer between macro base stations\n(MB) and small cell base stations (SB), which is modeled as a Wyner type linear\nnetwork. The second layer is the transmission layer between SBs and mobile\nterminals (MTs), which is modeled as a linear Wyner $L_T$ network, i.e., each\nMT is connected to $L_T+1$ SBs. The SBs are assumed to be half-duplex, thus\nrestricting the per user degrees of freedom (puDoF) in the system to $1/2$. The\npuDoF can be further restricted by the number of antennas at the MB. For $L_T\n\\in \\{1,2\\}$, the optimal puDoF can be achieved by using simple interference\navoidance schemes. The increase in the connectivity of transmission layer\nbeyond $L_T=2$ limits the achievable puDoF using only zero-forcing schemes to\nless than 1/2, even in the presence of large number of antennas at each MB but\nthe optimal puDoF can be achieved by making each message available at multiple\nSBs. This is done by sending an appropriate linear combination to the SB to\nzero-force interference at the intended user. The maximum per user DoF of 1/2\ncan be achieved in the linear network with sufficient number of antennas using\nonly interference avoidance schemes. These results are also extended to a more\nrealistic hexagonal cellular model as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 19:08:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2016 19:56:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-12"}

The neuroimaging community has embraced mean-field\nvariational Bayes (VB) approximations, which are implemented in Statistical\nParametric Mapping (SPM) software. While computationally efficient, the quality\nof VB approximations remains unclear even though they are commonly used in the\nanalysis of neuroimaging data. For reliable statistical inference, it is\nimportant that these approximations be accurate and that users understand the\nscenarios under which they may not be accurate.\n  We consider this issue for a particular model that includes spatially-varying\ncoefficients. To examine the accuracy of the VB approximation we derive\nHamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) for this model and conduct simulation studies to\ncompare its performance with VB. As expected we find that the computation time\nrequired for VB is considerably less than that for HMC. In settings involving a\nhigh or moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) we find that the two approaches\nproduce very similar results suggesting that the VB approximation is useful in\nthis setting. On the other hand, when one considers a low SNR, substantial\ndifferences are found, suggesting that the approximation may not be accurate in\nsuch cases and we demonstrate that VB produces Bayes estimators with larger\nmean squared error (MSE). A real application related to face perception is also\ncarried out. Overall, our work clarifies the usefulness of VB for the\nspatiotemporal analysis of fMRI data, while also pointing out the limitation of\nVB when the SNR is low and the utility of HMC in this case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 19:24:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 00:02:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 4 Mar 2018 02:45:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

This suppression can occur via\nphotodissociation of H2 (by ultraviolet Lyman-Werner [LW] photons) or by\nphotodetachment of H-, a precursor in H2 formation (by infrared [IR] photons).\nPrevious studies have typically adopted idealised spectra, with a blackbody or\na power-law shape, in modeling the chemistry of metal-free protogalaxies, and\nutilised a single parameter, the critical UV flux, or Jcrit, to determine\nwhether H2-cooling is prevented. This can be misleading, and that independent\nof the spectral shape, there is a critical curve in the (kLW , kH^- ) plane,\nwhere kLW and kH^- are the H2-dissocation rates by LW and IR photons, which\ndetermines whether a protogalaxy can cool below ~1000 Kelvin.

This fact may be traced to interaction contributions to the heat\ncurrent operator and the mixed nature of the thermoelectric response functions.\nRemarkably, however, it appears that emergence of quasiparticles at low\ntemperatures forces alpha_{xy} = - alpha_{yx}. This suggests that\nquasiparticle-free groundstates (so-called non-Fermi liquids) may be detected\nby examining the relationship between alpha_{xy} and alpha_{yx} in the presence\nof reflection symmetry and microscopic anisotropy. These conclusions are based\non the following results: (i) The relation between the Peltier coefficients is\nexact for elastically scattered noninteracting particles; (ii) It holds\napproximately within Boltzmann theory for interacting particles when elastic\nscattering dominates over inelastic processes. In a disordered Fermi liquid the\nlatter lead to deviations that vanish as T^3.

The margin of robustness for a given\ncontrol policy is defined as the radius of the largest $l_1$ ball in the space\nof balanced disturbances under which the link flows can be asymptotically\ncontained within their specified limits. For centralized control policies, the\ncontrol design as well as margin of robustness are obtained from solution to an\nnon-convex weight control problem. We establish relationship between feasible\nsets for DC power flow and associated network flow, which is used to establish\nan upper bound on the margin of robustness in terms of the min cut capacity.\nThis bound is proven to be tight if the network is tree-like, or if the lower\nbound of the operation range of weight control is zero.

At\nthe same time, operation is becoming more flexible with improved control\nsystems and new technology such as phase shifting transformers (PSTs) and high\nvoltage direct current connections (HVDC). Previous studies have shown that the\nuse of corrective control in response to outages contributes to a reduction in\noperating cost, while maintaining N-1 security. In this work, we propose a\nmethod to extend the use of corrective control of PSTs and HVDCs to react to\nuncertainty. We characterize the uncertainty as continuous random variables,\nand define the corrective control actions through affine control policies. This\nallows us to efficiently model control reactions to a large number of\nuncertainty sources. The control policies are then included in a chance\nconstrained optimal power flow formulation, which guarantees that the system\nconstraints are enforced with a desired probability. By applying an analytical\nreformulation of the chance constraints, we obtain a second-order cone problem\nfor which we develop an efficient solution algorithm. In a case study for the\nIEEE 118 bus system, we show that corrective control for uncertainty leads to a\ndecrease in operational cost, while maintaining system security. Further, we\ndemonstrate the scalability of the method by solving the problem for the IEEE\n300 bus and the Polish system test cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 21:07:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-09"}

The effect of\nfully-supported internal damping is studied for both Berger and von Karman\ndynamics. The non-dissipative nature of the dynamics preclude the use of strong\ntools such as backward-in-time smallness of velocities and finiteness of the\ndissipation integral. Modern quasi-stability techniques are utilized to show\nthe existence of compact global attractors and generalized fractal exponential\nattractors. Specific results depending on the size of the damping parameter and\nthe nonlinearity in force. For the Berger plate, in the presence of large\ndamping, the existence of a proper global attractor (whose fractal dimension is\nfinite in the state space) is shown via a decomposition of the nonlinear\ndynamics. This leads to the construction of a compact set upon which\nquasi-stability theory can be implemented.

The segmentation is then\nrealised by solving an ordinary differential equation with the geodesic\ndistance. The results of the GDM are compared with manually segmented retinal\nlayer boundaries/surfaces.

By contrast, artificial neural networks\ntrained with backpropagation generally have fixed connection weights that do\nnot change once training is complete. While recent methods can endow neural\nnetworks with long-term memories, Hebbian plasticity is currently not amenable\nto gradient descent. Here we derive analytical expressions for activity\ngradients in neural networks with Hebbian plastic connections.

As a result, the networks \"learn\nhow to learn\" in order to solve the problem at hand: the trained networks\nautomatically perform fast learning of unpredictable environmental features\nduring their lifetime, expanding the range of solvable problems.

Here, we consider the bipartite entanglement generated by coherently\ndistributing $M$ photons in $M$ modes to two separate locations, where linear\noptics and photon detection is used to verify the non-classical correlations\nbetween the two $M$-mode systems. We show that the entangled state is symmetric\nunder mode shift operations performed in the two systems and use this symmetry\nto derive correlations between photon number distributions detected after a\ndiscrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the modes. The experimentally observable\ncorrelations can be explained by a simple and intuitive rule that relates the\nsum of the output mode indices to the eigenvalue of the input state under the\nmode shift operation. Since the photon number operators after the DFT do not\ncommute with the initial photon number operators, entanglement is necessary to\nachieve strong correlations in both the initial mode photon numbers and the\nphoton numbers observed after the DFT. We can therefore derive entanglement\nwitnesses based on the experimentally observable correlations in both photon\nnumber distributions, providing a practical criterion for the evaluation of\nlarge scale entanglement in optical multi-mode systems.

Then, a set of ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) governing the time evolution of the\nslowly-varying expansion coefficients are derived to replace the original\nSchrodinger equation. Finally, Maxwell's equations represented by the vector\npotential with a Coulomb gauge, together with the ODEs, are solved\nself-consistently. For numerical examples, the interaction between EM fields\nand a particle is investigated for both the closed, open and inhomogeneous\nelectromagnetic systems. The proposed approach not only captures the Rabi\noscillation phenomenon in the closed cavity but also captures the effects of\nradiative decay and shift in the open free space. After comparing with the\nexisting theoretical approximate models, it is found that the approximate\nmodels break down in certain cases where a rigorous self-consistent approach is\nneeded. This work is helpful for the EM simulation of emerging nanodevices or\nnext-generation quantum electrodynamic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2016 02:34:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2017 03:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-28"}

The amplification of the magnetic field is enhanced in regions with\nstronger differential rotation, because magnetorotational instability and\nfield-line stretching are more effective.

This definition is valid in loop-rich\ntrajectories that enable a mapper robot to close many loops, for which precise\nmaps can be assumed. The same cannot be said about the newly emerging\nautonomous navigation and driving systems, which typically operate in loop-less\ntrajectories that have no large loop (e.g., straight paths). In this paper, we\npropose a solution that overcomes this limitation by merging the two maps. Our\nstudy is motivated by the observation that even when there is no large loop in\neither the query or reference map, many loops can often be obtained in the\nmerged map. We add two new aspects to map matching: (1) image retrieval with\ndiscriminative deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) features, which\nefficiently generates a small number of good initial alignment hypotheses; and\n(2) map merge, which jointly deforms the two maps to minimize differences in\nshape between them. To realize practical computation time, we also present a\npreemption scheme that avoids excessive evaluation of useless map-matching\nhypotheses. To verify our approach experimentally, we created a novel\ncollection of uncertain loop-less maps by utilizing the recently published\nNorth Campus Long-Term (NCLT) dataset and its ground-truth GPS data. The\nresults obtained using these map collections confirm that our approach improves\non previous map-matching approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2016 05:43:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-09"}

This includes certain left-invariant Walker metrics as well as\npp-waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2016 10:36:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2016 00:16:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 00:16:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-26"}

We construct a dataset of more than 200 numerical models that\ncover a broad parameter range with Ekman numbers spanning $3\\times 10^{-7} \\leq\nE \\leq 10^{-1}$, Rayleigh numbers within the range $10^3 < Ra < 2\\times\n10^{10}$ and a Prandtl number unity. We investigate the scaling behaviours of\nboth local (length scales, boundary layers) and global (Nusselt and Reynolds\nnumbers) properties across various physical regimes from onset of rotating\nconvection to weakly-rotating convection. Close to critical, the convective\nflow is dominated by a triple force balance between viscosity, Coriolis force\nand buoyancy. For larger supercriticalities, a subset of our numerical data\napproaches the asymptotic diffusivity-free scaling of rotating convection\n$Nu\\sim Ra^{3/2}E^{2}$ in a narrow fraction of the parameter space delimited by\n$6\\,Ra_c \\leq Ra \\leq 0.4\\,E^{-8/5}$. Using a decomposition of the viscous\ndissipation rate into bulk and boundary layer contributions, we establish a\ntheoretical scaling of the flow velocity that accurately describes the\nnumerical data. In rapidly-rotating turbulent convection, the fluid bulk is\ncontrolled by a triple force balance between Coriolis, inertia and buoyancy,\nwhile the remaining fraction of the dissipation can be attributed to the\nviscous friction in the Ekman layers. Beyond $Ra \\simeq E^{-8/5}$, the\nrotational constraint on the convective flow is gradually lost and the flow\nproperties vary to match the regime changes between rotation-dominated and\nnon-rotating convection. The quantity $Ra E^{12/7}$ provides an accurate\ntransition parameter to separate rotating and non-rotating convection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2016 10:46:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Oct 2016 12:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

The increased influence of\nthe BiOCl/Nb interface under laser excitation corresponds to the raising the\nratio of the density of normal to superconductivity carriers in the\n$T\\rightarrow 0$ limit and this observation is in agreement with the\nphotoconductivity study of BiOCl single crystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2016 12:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-09"}

It is estimated that this fraction\nwill cross 80% in the next three years. Most popular VoD services have\nrecommendation engines which recommend videos to users based on their viewing\nhistory, thus introducing time-correlation in user requests. Understanding and\nmodeling this time-correlation in user requests is critical for network traffic\nengineering. The primary goal of this work is to use empirically observed\nproperties of user requests to model the effect of recommendation engines on\nthe request patterns in VoD services. We propose a Markovian request model to\ncapture the time-correlation in user requests and show that our model is\nconsistent with the observations of existing empirical studies.\n  Most large-scale VoD services deliver content to users via a distributed\nnetwork of servers as serving users requests via geographically co-located\nservers reduces latency and network bandwidth consumption. The content\nreplication policy, i.e., determining which contents to cache on the servers is\na key resource allocation problem for VoD services. Recent studies show that\nlow start-up delay is a key Quality of Service (QoS) requirement of users of\nVoD services. This motivates the need to pre-fetch (fetch before contents are\nrequested) and cache content likely to be request in the near future. Since\npre-fetching leads to an increase in the network bandwidth usage, we use our\nMarkovian model to explore the trade-offs and feasibility of implementing\nrecommendation based pre-fetching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2016 12:17:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 16:55:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 10:37:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-04"}

However, continuity in time\nis often assumed and only semidiscrete stability is studied. Thus, it is\ninteresting to investigate the influence of explicit and implicit time\nintegration methods on the stability of numerical schemes. If an explicit time\nintegration method is applied, spacially stable numerical schemes for\nhyperbolic conservation laws can result in unstable fully discrete schemes.\nFocusing on the explicit Euler method (and convex combinations thereof),\nundesired terms in the energy balance trigger this phenomenon and introduce an\nerroneous growth of the energy over time. In this work, we study the influence\nof artificial dissipation and modal filtering in the context of discontinuous\nspectral element methods to remedy these issues. In particular, lower bounds on\nthe strength of both artificial dissipation and modal filtering operators are\ngiven and an adaptive procedure to conserve the (discrete) $\\mathbf{L}_2$ norm\nof the numerical solution in time is derived.

Saturn's rings are\nmassive and made of 90-95% of water ice. In contrast, the much less massive\nrings of Uranus and Neptune are dark and likely to have higher rock fraction.\nHere we investigate, for the first time, the tidal disruption of a passing\nobject, including the subsequent formation of planetary rings. First, we\nperform SPH simulations of the tidal destruction of big differentiated objects\n($M_{\\rm body}=10^{21-23}$) that experience close encounters with Saturn or\nUranus. We find that about $0.1-10$% of the mass of the passing body is\ngravitationally captured around the planet. However, these fragments are\ninitially big chunks and have highly eccentric orbits around the planet. Then,\nwe perform N-body simulations including the planet's oblateness, starting with\ndata obtained from the SPH simulations. Our N-body simulations show that the\nchunks are tidally destroyed during their next several orbits. Their individual\norbits then start to precess incoherently around the planet's equator, which\nenhances their encounter velocities on longer-term evolution, resulting in more\ndestructive impacts. These collisions would damp their eccentricities resulting\nin a progressive collapse of the debris cloud into a thin equatorial and\nlow-eccentricity ring. These high energy impacts are expected to be\ncatastrophic enough to produce small particles. Our numerical results also show\nthat the mass of formed rings is large enough to explain current rings\nincluding inner regular satellites around Saturn and Uranus. In the case of\nUranus, a body can go deeper inside the planet's Roche limit resulting in a\nmore efficient capture of rocky material compared to Saturn's case in which\nmostly ice is captured. Thus, our results can naturally explain the\ncompositional difference between the rings of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2016 12:38:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Whereas the\ndifferential rotation on the Sun, Jupiter and Saturn features a super-rotating\nequatorial region, the ice giants, Neptune and Uranus harbour an equatorial jet\nslower than the planetary rotation. Global numerical models covering the\noptically thick, deep-reaching and rapidly rotating convective envelopes of gas\ngiants reproduce successfully the prograde jet at the equator. In such models,\nconvective columns shaped by the dominant Coriolis force typically exhibit a\nconsistent prograde tilt. Hence angular momentum is pumped away from the\nrotation axis via Reynolds stresses. Those models are found to be strongly\ngeostrophic, hence a modulation of the zonal flow structure along the axis of\nrotation, e.g. introduced by persistent latitudinal temperature gradients,\nseems of minor importance. Within our study we stimulate these thermal\ngradients and the resulting ageostrophic flows by applying an axisymmetric and\nequatorially symmetric outer boundary heat flux anomaly ($Y_{20}$) with\nvariable amplitude and sign. Such a forcing pattern mimics the thermal effect\nof intense solar or stellar irradiation. Our results suggest that the\nageostrophic flows are linearly amplified with the forcing amplitude $q^\\star$\nleading to a more pronounced dimple of the equatorial jet (alike Jupiter).

This framework incorporates\nweak helix structure dependent forces into the determination of the free energy\nand average structure of a plectoneme. Notably, due to their chiral nature,\nhelix structure dependent forces break the symmetry between left and right\nhanded supercoiling. The theoretical approach, presented here, also provides a\nsystematic way of enforcing the topological constraint of closed loop\nsupercoiling in the variational approximation. At large plectoneme lengths, by\nconsidering correlation functions in an expansion in terms of the spatial mean\ntwist density about its thermally averaged value, it can be argued that\ntopological constraint may be approximated with by replacing twist and writhe\nby their thermal averages. A Lagrange Multiplier, containing the sum of average\ntwist and writhe, can be added to the free energy to conveniently inforce this\nresult. The average writhe can be calculated through the thermal average of\nGauss integral in the variational approximation. Furthermore, this approach\nallows for a possible way to calculate finite size corrections due to the\ntopological constraint. Using interaction energy terms from the mean-field\nKornyshev-Leikin theory, for parameter values that correspond to weak helix\ndependent forces, we calculate the free energy, fluctuation magnitudes and mean\ngeometric parameters for the plectoneme.

A two-dimensional model is adopted, which\nassumes reactive disks of type A and B in a fixed area that react to form type\nC products if an activation threshold for impact is surpassed. Such a reaction\nliberates kinetic energy to the product particles, representative of the heat\nrelease. The results for the ignition delay are compared with those obtained\nfrom the continuum description assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium, in\norder to assess the role played by molecular fluctuations. Results show two\nregimes of non-equilibrium ignition whereby ignition occurs at different times\nas compared to that from the continuum description. The first regime is at low\nactivation energies, where the ignition time is found to be higher than that\nexpected from theory for all values of heat release, in agreement with\npredictions from Prigogine and Xhrouet who attribute this departure to\nnon-equilibrium effects. Results suggest the ignition is spatially homogeneous\nin this regime. The second regime occurs at high activation energies and\nsufficiently large heat release values. In this regime, ignition times are\nfound to be dependent on domain size, with larger domains yielding shorter\nignition delays than expected. Results for larger systems agree with the\nexpectations by Prigogine and Mahieu, who predict a non-equilibrium reaction\nrate larger than expected for a homogeneous system in equilibrium. Results\nyield a large variance for ignition times under these conditions, suggesting a\ndeparture from homogeneous combustion.

The non-axisymmetric KH instability\ncan operate in Rayleigh-stable conditions, and it therefore represents the\nlimiting factor to the structure's properties. Introducing SG triggers a second\nnon-axisymmetric instability, which is found to be located around a PV maximum,\nwhile the KH instability is linked to a PV minimum, as expected.

We demonstrate that\nclassification accuracy can be significantly improved using deep convolutional\nneural network models pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on knee OA images.\nFurthermore, we argue that it is more appropriate to assess the accuracy of\nautomatic knee OA severity predictions using a continuous distance-based\nevaluation metric like mean squared error than it is to use classification\naccuracy. This leads to the formulation of the prediction of KL grades as a\nregression problem and further improves accuracy.

To fulfill this goal, astrometry\nmust be paired with high precision calibration of the detector.\n  Aims: We present a way to calibrate a detector for high accuracy astrometry.\nAn experimental testbed combining an astrometric simulator and an\ninterferometric calibration system is used to validate both the hardware needed\nfor the calibration and the signal processing methods. The objective is an\naccuracy of 5e-6 pixel on the location of a Nyquist sampled polychromatic point\nspread function.\n  Methods: The interferometric calibration system produced modulated Young\nfringes on the detector. The Young fringes were parametrized as products of\ntime and space dependent functions, based on various pixel parameters. The\nminimization of func- tion parameters was done iteratively, until convergence\nwas obtained, revealing the pixel information needed for the calibration of\nastrometric measurements.\n  Results: The calibration system yielded the pixel positions to an accuracy\nestimated at 4e-4 pixel. After including the pixel position information, an\nastrometric accuracy of 6e-5 pixel was obtained, for a PSF motion over more\nthan five pixels. In the static mode (small jitter motion of less than 1e-3\npixel), a photon noise limited precision of 3e-5 pixel was reached.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Sep 2016 15:54:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

These neurons can be\nseparated into two types (A and C) based on the myelination of their axons and\ntheir distinct firing patterns elicited in response to specific pressure\nstimuli. This study has developed a comprehensive model of the afferent\nbaroreceptor discharge built on physiological knowledge of arterial wall\nmechanics, firing rate responses to controlled pressure stimuli, and ion\nchannel dynamics within the baroreceptor neurons. With this model, we were able\nto predict firing rates observed in previously published experiments in both A-\nand C-type neurons.

The observed variation in the\nmodel parameters are hypothesized to correspond to physiological differences\nbetween A- and C-type neurons. In agreement with published experimental\nobservations, our simulations suggest that a twofold lower potassium\nconductance in C-type neurons is responsible for the observed sustained basal\nfiring, whereas a tenfold higher mechanosensitive conductance is responsible\nfor the greater firing rate observed in A-type neurons.

We characterise\nthe narrow-line emitting gas visible by XMM RGS and make comparisons between\nthe 2012-13 spectra and those from 2004-07, already published. This source is\nusually absorbed within the soft X-ray band, with a typical neutral column\ndensity of >1.5 x 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and only 1 observation of the 9 we\ninvestigate shows low enough absorption for the continuum to emerge in the soft\nX-rays. We stack all observations from 2004-07, and separately three of the\nfour observations from 2012-13, analysing the less absorbed observation\nseparately. We first model the spectra using gaussian profiles representing the\nnarrow line emission. We fit physically motivated models to the 2012-13 stacked\nspectra, with collisionally ionised components representing the starburst\nemission and photoionised line emission models representing the AGN line\nemission. The collisional and photoionised emission line models are fitted\ntogether on top of a physical continuum and absorption model. The X-ray narrow\nemission line spectrum of NGC 1365 is well represented by a combination of two\ncollisionally ionised and three photoionised phases of emitting gas, all with\nhigher than solar nitrogen abundances. This physical model was fitted to the\n2012-13 stacked spectrum, and yet also fits well to the 2004-07 stacked\nspectrum, without changing any characteristics of the emitting gas phases. Our\n2004-07 results are consistent with previous emission line work using these\ndata, with 5 additional emission lines detected in both this and the 2012-13\nstacked spectra. We also estimate the distance of the X-ray line-emitting\nphotoionised gas from the central source to be <300 pc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 16:22:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}
