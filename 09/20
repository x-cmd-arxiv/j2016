In this paper we introduce a new type-II progressive censoring scheme\nfor two samples. It is observed that the proposed censoring scheme is\nanalytically more tractable than the existing joint progressive type-II\ncensoring scheme proposed by Rasouli and Balakrishnan \\cite{RB:2010}. It has\nsome other advantages also. We study the statistical inference of the unknown\nparameters based on the assumptions that the lifetime distribution of the\nexperimental units for the two samples follow exponential distribution with\ndifferent scale parameters. The maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown\nparameters are obtained and their exact distributions are derived. Based on the\nexact distributions of the maximum likelihood estimators exact confidence\nintervals are also constructed. For comparison purposes we have used bootstrap\nconfidence intervals also. It is observed that the bootstrap confidence\nintervals work very well and they are very easy to implement in practice. Some\nsimulation experiments are performed to compare the performances of the\nproposed method with the existing one, and the performances of the proposed\nmethod are quite satisfactory. One data analysis has been performed for\nillustrative purposes. Finally we propose some open problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 16:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}

In doing so, an APS must rely on a broad spectrum\nof dynamic, complex, and often imprecise information about its surroundings,\nthe task it is to perform, and its own sensors and actuators. For example,\ncleaning in a home or commercial setting requires the ability to perceive,\ngrasp, and manipulate many physical objects, the ability to reliably perform a\nvariety of subtasks such as washing, folding, and stacking, and knowledge about\nlocal conventions such as how objects are classified and where they should be\nstored. The information required for reliable autonomous operation may come\nfrom external sources and from the robot's own sensor observations or in the\nform of direct instruction by a trainer. Similar considerations apply across\nmany domains - construction, manufacturing, in-home assistance, and healthcare.\nFor example, surgeons spend many years learning about physiology and anatomy\nbefore they touch a patient. They then perform roughly 1000 surgeries under the\ntutelage of an expert surgeon, and they practice basic maneuvers such as suture\ntying thousands of times outside the operating room. All of these elements come\ntogether to achieve expertise at this task. Endowing a system with robust\nautonomy by traditional programming methods has thus far had limited success.\nSeveral promising new paths to acquiring and processing such data are emerging.\nThis white paper outlines three promising research directions for enabling an\nAPS to learn the physical and information skills necessary to perform tasks\nwith independence and flexibility: Deep Reinforcement Learning, Human-Robot\nInteraction, and Cloud Robotics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 16:24:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}

However, its\neffect for systems other than the standard contact process (CP), its\ncompetition with other ingredients (e.g. particle diffusion) and other kinds of\ndisorder (besides the standard types) are unknown. In order to shed some light\nin the above mentioned points, we investigate a variant of the usual CP, namely\ntriplet annihilation model (TAM), in which the competition between triplet\nannihilation and single particle diffusion leads to an unusual phase diagram\nbehavior, with reentrant shape and endless activity for sufficient large\ndiffusion rates. Two kinds of time-dependent disorder have been considered. In\nthe former, it is introduced in the creation-annihilation parameters (as\ncommonly considered in recent studies), whereas in the latter the diffusion\nrate $D$ (so far unexplored) is allowed to be time dependent. In all cases, the\ndisorder follows an uniform distribution with fixed mean and width $\\sigma$.\nTwo values of $\\sigma$ have been considered, in order to exemplify the regime\nof \"weaker\" and \"stronger\" temporal disorder strengths. Our results show that\nin the former approach, the disorder suppresses the reentrant phase diagram\nwith a critical behavior deviating from the directed percolation universality\nclass (DP) in the regime of low diffusion rates, while they strongly suggest\nthat the DP class is recovered for larger hoping rates. An opposite scenario is\nfound in the latter disorder approach, with a substantial increase of reentrant\nshape and the maximum diffusion, in which the reentrant shape also displays a\ncritical behavior consistent to the DP universality class (in similarity with\nthe pure model).

We show that,\nbecause of the quenching of the energy of partons within a jet, even when\n$K\\neq 0$ the jets that survive with some specified energy in the final state\nare narrower than jets with that energy in proton-proton collisions. For this\nreason, many standard observables are rather insensitive to $K$. We propose a\nnew differential jet shape ratio observable in which the effects of transverse\nmomentum broadening are apparent. We also analyze the response of the medium to\nthe passage of the jet through it, noting that the momentum lost by the jet\nappears as the momentum of a wake in the medium. After freezeout this wake\nbecomes soft particles with a broad angular distribution but with net momentum\nin the jet direction.

It is found that the onset of quantum\nconfinement in the surface passivated [111] nanowires occurs at larger critical\ndimensions than for the [110] nanowires. For the [111] oriented nanowires it is\npredicted that a band gap of approximately 0.5 eV can be formed at a diameter\nof approximately 6 nm, whereas for the [110] oriented nanowires a diameter of\napproximately 3 nm is required to achieve a similar band gap energy. The GW\ncorrection is also applied to estimates of the electron affinity, ionisation\npotentials and work functions for both orientations of the nanowires for\nvarious diameters below 5 nm. The magnitude of the energy band gaps that arise\nin bismuth at critical dimensions of a few nanometers are of the same order as\nfor conventional bulk semiconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 18:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

To detect and characterize inhomogeneities in\nits atmosphere (e.g., patchy clouds, hot spots), we have performed time-series\nphotometric monitoring of WISE 0855-0714 at 3.6 and 4.5 micron with the Spitzer\nSpace Telescope during two 23~hr periods that were separated by several months.\nFor both bands, we have detected variability with peak-to-peak amplitudes of\n4-5% and 3-4% in the first and second epochs, respectively.

However, comparisons\nto theoretical predictions tend to be inconclusive for the simple reason that\nwhile most cosmological models consider only dark matter, one observes only\nbaryons.

We analyze this transition by non- linear regression of\ncomputational data to a hyperbolic model. As part of this analysis, we also\npropose uncertainty quantification techniques for assessing when and to what\nextent the simulated data is informative of yield. Moreover, we show how the\nmethod directly tests for yield via the onset of permanent deformation and\ndiscuss recent experimental results, which compare favorably with our\npredictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 19:52:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}

In a\npublic-goods game, each individual pays a cost for cooperation, or to prevent\ndefection, and receives a reward from the collected cost in a group. Thus,\ndefection is beneficial for each individual, while cooperation is beneficial\nfor the group. Now, groups (say, countries) consisting of individual players\nalso play games. To study such a multi-level game, we introduce a hierarchical\npublic-goods (HPG) game in which two groups compete for finite resources by\nutilizing costs collected from individuals in each group. Analyzing this HPG\ngame, we found a hierarchical prisoner's dilemma, in which groups choose the\ndefection policy (say, armaments) as a Nash strategy to optimize each group's\nbenefit, while cooperation optimizes the total benefit. On the other hand, for\neach individual within a group, refusing to pay the cost (say, tax) is a Nash\nstrategy, which turns to be a cooperation policy for the group, thus leading to\na hierarchical dilemma. Here, the reward received by one group increases with\nthe population, as does the collected cost. In spite of this, we find that\nthere exists an optimal group size that maximizes its payoff. Furthermore, when\nthe population asymmetry between two groups is large, a smaller group will\nchoose a cooperation policy (say, disarmament) to avoid excessive response from\nthe larger group, which leads to the resolution of the prisoner's dilemma\nbetween the groups. The relevance of the HPG game to policy selection in\nsociety and the optimal size in human or animal groups are discussed\naccordingly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 17:07:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

The\npossibility that quasiparticle properties can be probed in RXS measurements\nopens up a new avenue to study the bulk band structure of materials with the\norbital and element selectivity provided by RXS.

Here we determine the physical parameters of the central\nmolecular zone (CMZ) cloud G0.253+0.016, its turbulence, magnetic field and\nfilamentary structure. Using column-density maps based on dust-continuum\nemission observations with ALMA+Herschel, we identify filaments and show that\nat least one dense core is located along them.

We show that normal\nmodes of symmetric structures have different levels of symmetry, or\nsymmetricity. One novel theoretical result of this work is that, for a ring\nstructure with $m$ subunits, the symmetricity of the normal modes falls into\n$m$ groups of equal size, with normal modes in each group having the same\nsymmetricity. The normal modes in each group can be computed separately, using\na much smaller amount of memory and time (up to $m^3$ less), thus making it\napplicable to larger complexes. We show that normal modes with perfect symmetry\nor anti-symmetry have no degeneracy while the rest of the modes have a\ndegeneracy of two. We show also how symmetry in normal modes correlates with\nsymmetry in structure. While a broken symmetry in structure generally leads to\na loss of symmetricity in symmetric normal modes, the symmetricity of some\nsymmetric normal modes is preserved even when symmetry in structure is broken.\nThis work suggests a deeper reason for the existence of symmetric complexes:\nthat they may be formed not only for structural purpose, but likely also for a\ndynamical reason, that certain symmetry is needed by a given complex to obtain\ncertain symmetric motions that are functionally critical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 20:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

After fitting a modified blackbody to the available bands, we\nestimated a dust absorption cross-section 0.49 +/- 0.13 times 1E-25 cm^2 H^-1\nat 250 um (with dust temperature T = 20.4 +/- 1.5 K and spectral index beta =\n1.53 +/- 0.17). The results are in excellent agreement with those obtained by\nPlanck over a much larger coverage of the high Galactic latitude cirrus (50% of\nthe sky vs 0.2% in our work). For dust associated with intermediate velocity\ngas, we confirm earlier Planck results and find a higher temperature and lower\nemissivity and cross-section. After subtracting the modelled components, we\nfind regions at scales smaller than 20' where the residuals deviate\nsignificantly from the average, cosmic-infrared-background dominated, scatter.\nThese large residuals are most likely due to local variations in the cirrus\ndust properties (and/or the dust/atomic-gas correlation) or to high-latitude\nmolecular clouds with average N_H2 <~ 1E20 cm^-2. We find no conclusive\nevidence for intracluster dust emission in Virgo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 21:16:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

Careful analysis reveals\nthat the so-called \"rewiring\" step in these algorithms can be interpreted as a\nlocal policy iteration (PI) step (i.e., a local policy evaluation step followed\nby a local policy improvement step) so that asymptotically, as the number of\nsamples tend to infinity, both algorithms converge to the optimal path almost\nsurely (with probability 1). Policy iteration, along with value iteration (VI)\nare common methods for solving dynamic programming (DP) problems. Based on this\nobservation, recently, the RRT$^{\\#}$ algorithm has been proposed, which\nperforms, during each iteration, Bellman updates (aka \"backups\") on those\nvertices of the graph that have the potential of being part of the optimal path\n(i.e., the \"promising\" vertices). The RRT$^{\\#}$ algorithm thus utilizes\ndynamic programming ideas and implements them incrementally on randomly\ngenerated graphs to obtain high quality solutions. In this work, and based on\nthis key insight, we explore a different class of dynamic programming\nalgorithms for solving shortest-path problems on random graphs generated by\niterative sampling methods. These class of algorithms utilize policy iteration\ninstead of value iteration, and thus are better suited for massive\nparallelization. Contrary to the RRT* algorithm, the policy improvement during\nthe rewiring step is not performed only locally but rather on a set of vertices\nthat are classified as \"promising\" during the current iteration. This tends to\nspeed-up the whole process. The resulting algorithm, aptly named Policy\nIteration-RRT$^{\\#}$ (PI-RRT$^{\\#}$) is the first of a new class of DP-inspired\nalgorithms for randomized motion planning that utilize PI methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 22:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

An effective control and coordination scheme\nof flexible loads requires an accurate and tractable model that captures their\naggregate flexibility. This paper proposes a novel approach to extract the\naggregate flexibility of deferrable loads with heterogeneous parameters using\npolytopic projection approximation. First, an exact characterization of their\naggregate flexibility is derived analytically, which in general contains\nexponentially many inequality constraints with respect to the number of loads.\nIn order to have a tractable solution, we develop a numerical algorithm that\ngives a sufficient approximation of the exact aggregate flexibility.\nGeometrically, the flexibility of each individual load is a polytope, and their\naggregation is the Minkowski sum of these polytopes. Our method originates from\nan alternative interpretation of the Minkowski sum as projection. The aggregate\nflexibility can be viewed as the projection of a high-dimensional polytope onto\nthe subspace representing the aggregate power. We formulate a robust\noptimization problem to optimally approximate the polytopic projection with\nrespect to the homothet of a given polytope. To enable efficient and parallel\ncomputation of the aggregate flexibility for a large number of loads, a\nmuti-stage aggregation strategy is proposed.

The goal of this research is to compare the\nbasic reproductive number of Zika in different municipalities, from an SIR\nmodel with implicit vector dynamics, based on the daily case reporting data of\nAntioquia, Colombia, the second most affected country after Brazil. Methods: An\nsimple SIR model with implicit vector dynamics was derived and used. The\napproximate solution of the model in terms of individuals recovered in each\ntime unit, allowed to obtain estimate of the model parameters including the\nbasic reproduction number (Ro) and its 95% confidence intervals. These\nparameters were estimated via fitting the solution of the model to the daily\nreported cumulative cases data from the regional surveillance system. Results:\nRo was estimated for 20 municipalities, all located at less than 2200 meters\nabove sea level. From January to April 2016, between 17 and 347 cases were\nreported from these municipalities. Of these, 15 municipalities had a high\npotential for transmission (Ro>1) and 5 had less potential (Ro<1), although in\n3 of these, transmission was later possible because its upper confidence\ninterval of Ro was greater than one. Conclusion: Surveillance and control of\nZika should be directed primarily to municipalities with Ro>1. Furthermore,\nstrategies that will strengthen the detection and management of cases in the\nremaining municipalities should be beneficial to the whole Antioquia region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 23:29:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

While on-site recommendation systems focus on\nfinding the most relevant items for a user at the moment (right item), email\nrecommendations add two critical additional dimensions: who to send\nrecommendations to (right person) and when to send them (right time). It is\ncritical that a recommendation email system not send too many emails to too\nmany users in too short of a time-window, as users may unsubscribe from future\nemails or become desensitized and ignore future emails if they receive too\nmany. Also, email service providers may mark such emails as spam if too many of\ntheir users are contacted in a short time-window. Optimizing email\nrecommendation systems such that they can yield a maximum response rate for a\nminimum number of email sends is thus critical for the long-term performance of\nsuch a system. In this paper, we present a novel recommendation email system\nthat not only generates recommendations, but which also leverages a combination\nof individual user activity data, as well as the behavior of the group to which\nthey belong, in order to determine each user's likelihood to respond to any\ngiven set of recommendations within a given time period. In doing this, we have\neffectively created a meta-recommendation system which recommends sets of\nrecommendations in order to optimize the aggregate response rate of the entire\nsystem.

The structure of white dwarfs is\nobtained by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations with a poloidal magnetic\nfield in a fully general relativistic approach. The stellar interior is\ncomposed of a regular crystal lattice made of carbon ions immersed in a\ndegenerate relativistic electron gas. The onsets of electron capture reactions\nand pycnonuclear reactions are determined with and without magnetic fields. We\nfind that magnetized white dwarfs violate the standard Chandrasekhar mass limit\nsignificantly, even when electron capture and pycnonuclear fusion reactions are\npresent in the stellar interior.

As a result, equatorial radii of\nwhite dwarfs cannot be smaller than $\\sim 1100$~km. Another interesting feature\nconcerns the relationship between the central stellar density and the strength\nof the magnetic field at the core of a magnetized white dwarf.

Most transport rate\npredictions in the literature are based on the scaling $M\\tilde\ng\\propto\\tau-\\tau_t$, the physical origin of which, however, has remained\ncontroversial. Here we test the universality and study the origin of this\nscaling law using particle-scale simulations of nonsuspended sediment transport\ndriven by a large range of Newtonian fluids. We find that the scaling\ncoefficient is a universal approximate constant and can be understood as an\ninverse granular friction coefficient (i.e., the ratio between granular shear\nstress and normal-bed pressure) evaluated at the base of the transport layer\n(i.e., the effective elevation of energetic particle-bed rebounds). Usually,\nthe granular flow at this base is gaslike and rapidly turns into the solidlike\ngranular bed underneath: a liquidlike regime does not necessarily exist, which\nis accentuated by a nonlocal granular flow rheology in both the transport layer\nand bed. Hence, this transition fundamentally differs from the solid-liquid\ntransition (i.e., yielding) in dense granular flows even though both\ntransitions are described by a friction law. Combining this result with recent\ninsights into the nature of $\\tau_t$, we conclude that the transport load\nscaling is a signature of a steady rebound state and unrelated to entrainment\nof bed sediment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 03:09:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 May 2017 03:07:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2018 12:58:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 11 Aug 2018 07:05:17 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 12 Oct 2018 01:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-20"}

In such a disc, a gap opens up at around 2 au after\na few million years. The inner region subsequently accrete onto the star on a\nsmaller timescale.

The formula depends on identifying a natural relevant\nself-generated, time-dependent dynamical process inherent in any entity. For\nhuman beings the relevant dynamical process identified is the ensemble of brain\nwaves, observed in EEG measurements, that are represented in the model by their\nmeasured time dependent correlation functions. These correlation functions\ndefine the accessible dynamical state of the brain at any moment of time. From\nthem a time dependent probability function, P(t), is extracted by using a\nmathematical identity. According to information theory, -P(t) log P(t), is a\nmeasure of the information contained in the brain waves. Consciousness, C, is\ndefined by this information theory formula: it is not localized, does not\ndepend on specific hardwire details of the brain, but reflects the information\ncontent present in brain waves. Justifications, based on observational\nevidence, are given for the formula and it is shown that C reflects the degree\nof \"awareness\" that a person has at a given moment of time. The model explains\nthe observed time delay between when a brain wave is seen to initiate an action\nand when there is awareness that the action has been initiated, in terms of the\nway brain waves processes information.

However, in some specific cases\nsuch as emergency situations, the only images available may be those acquired\nthrough different kinds of sensors. More precisely, this paper addresses the\nproblem of detecting changes between two multi-band optical images\ncharacterized by different spatial and spectral resolutions. This sensor\ndissimilarity introduces additional issues in the context of operational change\ndetection. To alleviate these issues, classical change detection methods are\napplied after independent preprocessing steps (e.g., resampling) used to get\nthe same spatial and spectral resolutions for the pair of observed images.\nNevertheless, these preprocessing steps tend to throw away relevant\ninformation. Conversely, in this paper, we propose a method that more\neffectively uses the available information by modeling the two observed images\nas spatial and spectral versions of two (unobserved) latent images\ncharacterized by the same high spatial and high spectral resolutions. As they\ncover the same scene, these latent images are expected to be globally similar\nexcept for possible changes in sparse spatial locations. Thus, the change\ndetection task is envisioned through a robust multi-band image fusion method\nwhich enforces the differences between the estimated latent images to be\nspatially sparse. This robust fusion problem is formulated as an inverse\nproblem which is iteratively solved using an efficient block-coordinate descent\nalgorithm. The proposed method is applied to real panchormatic/multispectral\nand hyperspectral images with simulated realistic changes. A comparison with\nstate-of-the-art change detection methods evidences the accuracy of the\nproposed strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 10:04:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

For\nthis process, we construct exact analytic solutions for all the n-point\ncorrelation functions (the n-body densities in the space of energy). The\ncorresponding results for the one-point and the two-point functions were\nalready known, but those for the higher-point functions are new. These results\ndemonstrate strong correlations associated with the existence of common\nancestors in the branching process. By integrating these n-point functions over\nthe gluon energies, we deduce the mean gluon multiplicity $\\langle N\\rangle$ as\nwell as the higher moments $\\langle N^p\\rangle$ with $p\\ge 2$. We find that the\nmultiplicities of the soft gluons are parametrically large and show a\nremarkable regularity, known as Koba-Nielsen-Olesen (KNO) scaling: the reduced\nmoments $\\langle N^p\\rangle/\\langle N\\rangle^p$ are pure numbers, independent\nof any of the physical parameters of the problem. We recognize a special\nnegative binomial distribution which is characterized by large statistical\nfluctuations. These predictions can be tested in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC,\nvia event-by-event measurements of the di-jet asymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 11:21:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

However, the modeling\nof population dynamics in biofilms from the viewpoint of social interactions,\ni.e. interplay between heterotypic strains, and the analysis of this kind using\ncontrol theory are not addressed significantly. Therefore, in this paper, we\ntheoretically analyze the population dynamics model in microbial biofilms with\nnon-participating strains (coexisting with public goods producers and\nnon-producers) in the context of evolutionary game theory and nonlinear\ndynamics. Our analysis of the replicator dynamics model is twofold: first\nwithout the inclusion of spatial pattern, and second with the consideration of\ndegree of assortment. In the first case, Lyapunov stability analysis of the\nstable equilibrium point of the proposed replicator system determines (1,0)\n('full dominance of cooperators') as a global asymptotic stable equilibrium\nwhenever the return exceeds the metabolic cost of cooperation. Hence, the\nglobal asymptotic stable nature of (1,0) in the context of non-consideration of\nspatial pattern helps to justify mathematically the adversity in the\neradication of \"cooperative enterprise\" that is an infectious biofilm. In the\nsecond case, we found non-existence of global asymptotic stability in the\nsystem, and it unveils two additional phenomena - bistability and coexistence.\nIn this context, two inequality conditions are derived for the 'full dominance\nof cooperators' and coexistence. Therefore, the inclusion of spatial pattern in\nbiofilms with non-competing strains intends conditional dominance of pathogenic\n(with respect to the hosts) public goods producers which can be an effective\nstrategy towards the control of an infectious biofilm with the drug-dependent\nregulation of degree of segregation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 11:24:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

The system has previously been used\nas a minimal model for concentrations of GTPases involved in the process of\ncell polarisation. Source and loss terms are added, breaking the mass\nconservation, which was shown previously to be responsible for the generation\nof stable fronts via a so-called wave-pinning mechanism. The extended model\ngives rise to a unique homogeneous equilibrium in the parameter region of\ninterest, which loses stability via a pattern formation, or Turing bifurcation.\nThe bistable character of the reaction terms ensures that this bifurcation is\nsubcrtical for sufficiently small values of the driving parameter multiplying\nthe nonlinear kinetics. This subcriticality leads to the onset of a multitude\nof localised solutions, through the homoclinic snaking mechanism. As the\ndriving parameter is further decreased, the multitude of solutions transforms\ninto a single pulse through a Belyakov-Devaney transition in which there is the\nloss of a precursive pattern. An asymptotic analysis is used to probe the\nconservative limit in which the source and loss terms vanish. Matched\nasymptotic analysis shows that on an infinite domain the pulse solution\ntransitions into a pair of fronts, with an additional weak quadratic core and\nexponential tails. On a finite domain, the core and tails disappear, leading to\nthe mere wave-pinning front and its mirror image.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 11:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

This often leads to the inclusion of corrupted training samples, due to\nocclusions, misalignments and other perturbations.

The VCCs were analysed\nbased on the concept of vibronic coupling density. The VCC calculations suggest\na fluorescence via higher triplets (FvHT) mechanism, which entails the\nconversion of a T$_4$ exciton generated during electrical excitation into an\nS$_2$ exciton via reverse intersystem crossing (RISC); moreover, the S$_2$\nexciton relaxes to a fluorescent S$_1$ exciton because of large vibronic\ncoupling between S$_2$ and S$_1$.

The legacy data from these missions provides us with an\nunprecedented opportunity to study cosmic dust in galaxies so that we can\nanswer fundamental questions about, for example: the origin of the chemical\nelements, physical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM), its effect on\nstellar radiation, its relation to star formation and how this relates to the\ncosmic far infrared background. In this paper we describe the DustPedia\nproject, which is enabling us to develop tools and computer models that will\nhelp us relate observed cosmic dust emission to its physical properties\n(chemical composition, size distribution, temperature), to its origins (evolved\nstars, super novae, growth in the ISM) and the processes that destroy it (high\nenergy collisions and shock heated gas). To carry out this research we will\ncombine the Herschel/Planck data with that from other sources of data,\nproviding observations at numerous wavelengths (< 41) across the spectral\nenergy distribution, thus creating the DustPedia database. To maximise our\nspatial resolution and sensitivity to cosmic dust we limit our analysis to 4231\nlocal galaxies (v < 3000 km/s) selected via their near infrared luminosity\n(stellar mass). To help us interpret the data we have developed a new physical\nmodel for dust (THEMIS), a new Bayesian method of fitting and interpreting\nspectral energy distributions (HerBIE) and a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo\nphoton tracing radiative transfer model (SKIRT). In this the first of the\nDustPedia papers we describe the project objectives, data sets used and provide\nan insight into the new scientific methods we plan to implement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 12:50:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

We demonstrate that the random point\nprocess formed by the positions of particles in space is a Poisson point\nprocess with log-normal random intensity (\"log Gaussian Cox process\" or LGCP).\nThe probability of having a finite number of particles in a small volume is\ngiven in terms of the characteristic function of a log-normal distribution.\nCorrections due to discreteness of the number of particles to the previously\nderived statistics of particle concentration in the continuum limit are\nprovided. These are relevant for dealing with experimental or numerical data.\nThe probability of having regions without particles, i.e. voids, is larger for\ninertial particles than for tracer particles where voids are distributed\naccording to Poisson processes. Further, the probability of having large voids\ndecays only log-normally with size. This shows that particles cluster, leaving\nvoids behind. At scales where there is no clustering there can still be an\nincrease of the void probability so that turbulent voiding is stronger than\nclustering. The demonstrated double stochasticity of the distribution\noriginates in the two-step formation of fluctuations. First, turbulence brings\nthe particles randomly close together which happens with Poisson-type\nprobability. Then, turbulence compresses the particles' volume in the\nobservation volume. We confirm the theory of the statistics of the number of\nparticles in small volumes by numerical observations of inertial particle\nmotion in a chaotic ABC flow. The improved understanding of clustering\nprocesses can be applied to predict the long-time survival probability of\nreacting particles. Our work implies that the particle distribution in weakly\ncompressible flow with finite time correlations is a LGCP, independently of the\ndetails of the flow statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 12:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

Without fitting stellar models to\nspectral data, we show how the planetary signal can be robustly detected from\nnoisy data using noise amplitude as a source of information. For observation of\ntransiting planets, combining this method with simple geometry allows us to\nrelate the time scales obtained to primary and secondary eclipse of the\nexoplanets.

Significant changes in the electronic band\nstructure has been observed across the phase transitions from paramagnetic to\nantiferromagnetic (44 K) and from antiferromagnetic to the ferromagnetic ground\nstate (41.5 K).

The behavior of Rashba\neffect is found to be different in the k_x and the k_y directions showing\nelectron-like and the hole-like bands, respectively. The possible origin of\nRashba effect in the paramagnetic phase is related to the anti-parallel spin\npolarization present in this system.

This approach applies to\nstrongly interacting systems that are weakly coupled to multiple reservoirs at\nhigh temperature, illustrated by an Anderson quantum dot, but shows potential\nfor generalization. Pumping gives rise to a nonadiabatic geometric phase that\ncan be described by a framework originally developed for classical dissipative\nsystems by Landsberg. This geometric phase is accumulated by the transported\nobservable (charge, spin, energy) and not by the quantum state. It thus differs\nradically from the adiabatic Berry-Simon phase, even when generalizing it to\nmixed states, following Sarandy and Lidar. Importantly, our geometric\nformulation of pumping stays close to a direct physical intuition (i) by tying\ngauge transformations to calibration of the meter registering the transported\nobservable and (ii) by deriving a geometric connection from a driving-frequency\nexpansion of the current. Our approach provides a systematic and efficient way\nto compute the geometric pumping of various observables, including charge,\nspin, energy and heat. Our geometric curvature formula reveals a general\nexperimental scheme for performing geometric transport spectroscopy that\nenhances standard nonlinear spectroscopies based on measurements for static\nparameters. We indicate measurement strategies for separating the useful\ngeometric pumping contribution to transport from nongeometric effects. Finally,\nwe highlight several advantages of our approach in an exhaustive comparison\nwith the Sinitsyn-Nemenmann full-counting statistics (FCS) approach to\ngeometric pumping of an observable`s first moment.

In the gaseous planets these jets are maintained by\nincoherent turbulence excited by small-scale convection. Large-scale coherent\nwaves are sometimes observed to coexist with the jets; a prominent example is\nSaturn's hexagonal North polar jet (NPJ). The mechanism responsible for forming\nand maintaining such a turbulent state remains elusive. The coherent\nplanetary-scale component of the turbulence arises and is maintained by\ninteraction with the incoherent small-scale turbulence component. Theoretical\nunderstanding of the dynamics of the jet/wave/turbulence coexistence regime is\ngained by employing a statistical state dynamics (SSD) model. Here, a\nsecond-order closure implementation of a two-layer beta-plane SSD is used to\ndevelop a theory that accounts for the structure and dynamics of the NPJ.\nAsymptotic analysis of the SSD equilibrium in the weak jet damping limit\npredicts a universal jet structure in agreement with NPJ observations. This\nasymptotic theory also predicts the wavenumber (six) of the prominent jet\nperturbation. Analysis with this model of the jet/wave/turbulence regime\ndynamics reveals that jet formation is controlled by the effective value of\n$\\beta$; the required value of this parameter for correspondence with\nobservation is obtained. As this is a robust prediction it is taken as an\nindirect observation of a deep poleward sloping stable layer beneath the NPJ.\nThe slope required is obtained from observations of NPJ structure as is the\nsmall-scale turbulence excitation required to maintain the jet. The observed\njet structure is then predicted by the theory as is the wave-six disturbance.\nThis wave, which is identified with the least stable mode of the equilibrated\njet, is shown to be primarily responsible for equilibrating the jet with the\nobserved structure and amplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 13:47:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2017 13:28:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 09:45:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-10"}

In addition, SQUIDs are extremely sensitive\nsensors allowing to transduce magnetic flux into measurable electric signals.\nAs a consequence, any physical observable that can be converted into magnetic\nflux, e.g., current, magnetization, magnetic field or position, becomes easily\naccessible to SQUID sensors.

D-brane inflation proposes candidates for an inflaton embedded\nin the string theory and possesses descriptions on the brane and bulk\nmetrics/frames, which are connected by a conformal/disformal transformation\nthat depends on the inflaton and its derivatives. It has been shown that\ncurvature perturbations generated by the inflaton are identical in both frames,\nmeaning that observables such as the spectrum of cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) anisotropies are independent of whether matter fields---including those\nin the standard model of particle physics---minimally couple to the brane or\nthe bulk metric/frame. This is true despite the fact that the observables are\neventually measured by the matter fields and that the total action including\nthe matter fields is different in the two cases. In contrast, in curvaton\nscenarios, the observables depend on the frame to which the curvaton minimally\ncouples. Among all inflationary scenarios, we focus on two models motivated by\nthe KKLMMT fine-tuning problem: a slow-roll inflation with an inflection-point\npotential and a model of a rapidly rolling inflaton that conformally couples to\ngravity. In the first model, the difference between the frames in which the\ncurvaton resides is encoded in the spectral index of the curvature\nperturbations, depicting the nature of the frame transformation. In the second\nmodel, the curvaton on the brane induces a spectral index significantly\ndifferent from that in the bulk and is even falsified by the observations. This\nwork thus demonstrates that two frames connected by a conformal/disformal\ntransformation lead to different physical observables such as CMB anisotropies\nin curvaton models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 14:17:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2017 07:10:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-10"}

Here we show that the multiferroic ground state of\nthe archetypal multiferroic TbMnO3 is dramatically modified by epitaxial\nstrain. Neutron diffraction reveals that in highly strained films the magnetic\norder changes from the bulk-like incommensurate bc-cycloidal structure to\ncommensurate magnetic order. Concomitant with the modification of the magnetic\nground state, optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) and electric\nmeasurements show an enormous increase of the ferroelectric polarization, and a\nchange in its direction from along the c- to the a-axis. Our results suggest\nthat the drastic change of multiferroic properties results from a switch of the\nspin-current magnetoelectric coupling in bulk TbMnO3 to symmetric\nmagnetostriction in epitaxially-strained TbMnO3. These findings experimentally\ndemonstrate that epitaxial strain can be used to control single-phase\nspin-driven multiferroic states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 15:25:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 10:13:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 22:34:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 25 Mar 2017 07:49:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

Secondly, all the studied metal atoms (Li,\nNa and K) can be adsorbed on MoN2 monolayer, with both pristine and doped MoN2\nbeing metallic. Thirdly, the metal atoms possess moderate/low migration\nbarriers on MoN2, which ensures excellent cycling performance as a battery\nelectrode.

The\nreason is twofold: classically, they provide a tracking solution leading to an\nalmost DeSitter space starting from very generic initial conditions in the deep\nradiation era. The second reason is the standard lore that Galileons are\nquantum mechanically stable. The latter property is certainly true in flat\nspace-time, thanks to the non-renormalization theorems of galilean coupling\nconstants. However, in a cosmological background, we show that quantum effects\nmight dominate the classical trajectory. Assuming the radiation era to last at\nleast up to the electroweak phase transition, the trajectory with initial\nconditions sitting on the tracker is ruled out. On the other hand, it is always\npossible to find a sub-space of initial conditions such that the dark energy\nsolution approaches stably the tracker at late times. Fixing the value of\ninitial conditions that best fit current data, and assuming that the galileon\neffective theory is valid up to the beginning of the radiation epoch, we found\nthat the reheating temperature of the universe cannot be larger than $10^8 \\\n{\\rm GeV}$. Reversing the argument, if dark energy will turn out to be in form\nof Galileons, the bounds by EUCLID on the initial conditions for these models\nwill also be a bound on the reheating temperature of our Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 20:02:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-22"}

This work was conducted in close collaboration\nwith Tottenham Hotspurs FC (THFC), the PGA European tour and the participation\nof Wolverhampton Wanderers (WW).\n  Three investigations were conducted:\n  1. Predicting the recovery time of football injuries using the UEFA injury\nrecordings: The UEFA recordings is a common standard for recording injuries in\nprofessional football. For this investigation, three datasets of UEFA injury\nrecordings were available. Different machine learning algorithms were used in\norder to build a predictive model. The performance of the machine learning\nmodels is then improved by using feature selection conducted through\ncorrelation-based subset feature selection and random forests.\n  2. Predicting injuries in professional football using exposure records: The\nrelationship between exposure (in training hours and match hours) in\nprofessional football athletes and injury incidence was studied. A common\nproblem in football is understanding how the training schedule of an athlete\ncan affect the chance of him getting injured. The task was to predict the\nnumber of days a player can train before he gets injured.\n  3. Predicting intrinsic injury incidence using in-training GPS measurements:\nA significant percentage of football injuries can be attributed to overtraining\nand fatigue. GPS data collected during training sessions might provide\nindicators of fatigue, or might be used to detect very intense training\nsessions which can lead to overtraining. This research used GPS data gathered\nduring training sessions of the first team of THFC, in order to predict whether\nan injury would take place during a week.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 11:58:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}

Free-field QFT meets\nthe axioms of axiomatic QFT, showing they are consistent. Nevertheless, even\nafter more than 50 years, there is still no known non-trivial theory of quantum\nfields with interactions in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime that meets the\nsame axioms.\n  This paper provides a similar axiomatic basis for parameterized QFT, in which\nan invariant, fifth path parameter is added to the usual four spacetime\nposition arguments of quantum fields. Dynamic evolution is in terms of the path\nparameter rather than the frame-dependent time coordinate. Further, the states\nof the theory are allowed to be off shell. Particles are therefore\nfundamentally \"virtual\" during interaction but, in the appropriate\nnon-interacting, large-time limit, they dynamically tend towards \"physical\",\non-shell states.\n  Unlike traditional QFT, it is possible to define a mathematically consistent\ninteraction picture in parameterized QFT. This may be used to construct\ninteracting fields that meet the same axioms as the corresponding free fields.\nOne can then re-derive the Dyson series for scattering amplitudes, but without\nthe mathematical inconsistency of traditional, perturbative QFT. The present\nwork is limited to the case of scalar fields, and it does not address remaining\nissues of gauge symmetry and renormalization. Nevertheless, it still\ndemonstrates that the parameterized formalism can provide a consistent\nfoundation for the interpretation of QFT as used in practice and, perhaps, for\nbetter dealing with its further mathematical issues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 20:45:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 04:53:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

But\nneither Minkowski himself nor the subsequent developers of the relativity\ntheory have provided a reasonable rationale for this mathematical construct. In\nphysics, such a rationale should show lower-level statements that determine\nwhere the proposed mathematical structure is applicable and yield formal\npremises for proving its existence.\n  The above failure has apparently been due to the features of the adopted\nformalism based on the unjustifiably exclusive use of coordinates in the\ntheoretical analysis of physical phenomena, which ignores the necessity of\nhaving physical grounds for mathematical concepts. In particular, the use of a\ncoordinate transformation between two inertial reference frames makes the\nconsideration so cumbersome that it appears useless for solving the fundamental\nproblems of physical theory, including the question of whether Minkowski space\nexists.\n  In contrast, a straightforward calculation proves that the transformation of\nthe time and the position vector of a physical event between two physical\nspaces establishes an equivalence relation between pairs made of these\nvariables. This means the existence of Minkowski space and shows that the\npremises for its proof are the same as for the coordinate-free derivation of\nbasic effects of the special relativity theory: the use of Einsteinian time\nvariable and motions of particles able to interact with each other and\nelectromagnetic field over a short spatial range only.\n  The high degeneracy of free motions of point particles, together with the\nintricacy of the above mentioned calculation, suggests that a further\ngeneralization of Minkowski space is beyond belief, so that the modification or\neven the abandonment of the concept of spacetime seems quite natural.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 14:41:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2018 12:08:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 04:26:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-17"}
