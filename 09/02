Depending on the\nsystem dynamics, the candidate Lyapunov function and the set of initial states\nof interest, one generally needs to handle large, possibly non-convex or\nnon-feasible optimization problems. To avoid such problems, we propose a\nconstructive and systematically applicable sampling-based method to Lyapunov's\ninequality verification. This approach proposes verification of the decrease\ncondition for a candidate Lyapunov function on a finite sampling of a bounded\nset of initial conditions and then it extends the validity of the Lyapunov\nfunction to an infinite set of initial conditions by automatically exploiting\ncontinuity properties. This result is based on multi-resolution sampling, to\nperform efficient state- space exploration. Using hyper-rectangles as basic\nsampling blocks, to account for different constraint scales on different\nstates, further reduces the amount of samples to be verified. Moreover, the\nverification is decentralized in the sampling points, which makes the method\nscalable.

The aim of this article is to\nstudy the twist of newly emerged ARs from the evolution of magnetic tongues\nobserved in photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms. We apply the procedure\ndescribed by Poisson et al. (2015, Solar Phys. 290, 727) to ARs observed over\nthe full Solar Cycle 23 and the beginning of Cycle 24. Our results show that\nthe hemispherical rule obtained using the tongues as a proxy of the twist has a\nweak sign-dominance (53 % in the southern hemisphere and 58 % in the northern\nhemisphere). By defining the variation of the tongue angle, we characterize the\nstrength of the magnetic tongues during different phases of the AR emergence.\nWe find that there is a tendency of the tongues to be stronger during the\nbeginning of the emergence and to become weaker as the AR reaches its maximum\nmagnetic flux. We compare this evolution with the emergence of a toroidal\nflux-rope model with non-uniform twist. The variety of evolution of the tongues\nin the analyzed ARs can only be reproduced when using a broad range of twist\nprofiles, in particular having a large variety of twist gradient in the\ndirection vertical to the photosphere.

The GPI image displays a strong asymmetry along\nthe projected minor axis as well as a fainter asymmetry along the projected\nmajor axis. We associate the minor and major axis asymmetries with polarized\nforward scattering and a possible stellocentric offset, respectively. To\nconstrain the disk geometry we fit two separate disk models to the polarized\nimage, each using a different scattering phase function. Both models favor a\ndisk inclination of $\\sim 70\\degr$ and a $1.5\\pm0.6$ AU stellar offset in the\nplane of the sky along the projected major axis of the disk. We find that the\nstellar offset in the disk plane, perpendicular to the projected major axis is\ndegenerate with the form of the scattering phase function and remains poorly\nconstrained. The disk is not recovered in total intensity due in part to strong\nadaptive optics residuals, but we recover three point sources. Considering the\nsystem's proximity to the galactic plane and the point sources' positions\nrelative to the disk, we consider it likely that they are background objects\nand unrelated to the disk's offset from the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2016 20:00:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 15:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

Methods: We consider\nan initially massive disc with ~0.1 Msun to track the evolution from the early\nstage of PPDs. We solve the time evolution of surface density and temperature\nby taking into account viscous heating and the loss of the mass and the angular\nmomentum by the disc winds within the framework of a standard alpha model for\naccretion discs. Our model parameters, turbulent viscosity, disc wind mass\nloss, and disc wind torque, which are adopted from local magnetohydrodynamical\nsimulations and constrained by the global energetics of the gravitational\naccretion, largely depends on the physical condition of PPDs, particularly on\nthe evolution of the vertical magnetic flux in weakly ionized PPDs. Results:\nAlthough there are still uncertainties concerning the evolution of the vertical\nmagnetic flux remaining, surface densities show a large variety, depending on\nthe combination of these three parameters, some of which are very different\nfrom the surface density expected from the standard accretion. When a PPD is in\na \"wind-driven accretion\" state with the preserved vertical magnetic field, the\nradial dependence of the surface density can be positive in the inner region\n<1-10 au. The mass accretion rates are consistent with observations, even in\nthe very low level of magnetohydrodynamical turbulence. Such a positive radial\nslope of the surface density gives a great impact on planet formation because\n(i)it inhibits the inward drift or even results in the outward drift of\npebble/boulder-sized solid bodies, and (ii) it also makes the inward type-I\nmigration of proto-planets slower or even reversed.

This\nis especially true in real world problems such as in social systems, where\nthere is a significant population of players involved in the game, and the\ncomplexity problem is critical. Previous studies in algorithmic game theory\npropose succinct games that enable small descriptions of payoff matrices and\nreduction of complexities. However, some of the suggested compromises lose\ngenerality with strict assumptions such as symmetries in utility functions and\ncannot be applied to the full range of real world problems that may be\npresented. Graphical games are relatively promising, with a good balance\nbetween complexity and generality. However, they assume a given graph structure\nof players' interactions and cannot be applied to games without such known\ngraphs. This study proposes a method to identify an interaction graph between\nplayers and subsequently decompose games into smaller components by cutting out\nweak interactions for the purpose of reducing complexity. At the beginning,\nplayers' mutual dependencies on their utilities are quantified as\nvariance-covariance matrices among players. Then, the interaction graphs among\nplayers are identified by solving eigenvalue problems. Players' interactions\nare further decomposed into linear combinations of games. This helps to find a\nconsistent equilibrium, which is a Nash equilibrium specified by the\ndecomposition, with reduced computational complexity.

Here, we briefly review\nempirical and computational studies addressing how localized perturbations\naffect brain activity. We then systematically analyze a model of large-scale\nbrain dynamics, assessing how localized changes in brain activity at the\ndifferent sites affect whole-brain dynamics. We find that local stimulation\ninduces changes in brain activity that can be summarized by relatively smooth\ntuning curves, which relate a region's effectiveness as a stimulation site to\nits position within the cortical hierarchy. Our results also support the notion\nthat brain hubs, operating in a slower regime, are more resilient to focal\nperturbations and critically contribute to maintain stability in global brain\ndynamics. In contrast, perturbations of peripheral regions, characterized by\nfaster activity, have greater impact on functional connectivity. As a parallel\nwith this region-level result, we also find that peripheral systems such as the\nvisual and sensorimotor networks were more affected by local perturbations than\nhigh-level systems such as the cingulo-opercular network.

However, hierarchical\ndata dependencies cause difficulties in the estimation of \"separable\" models\nthat can distinguish between the entities in the hierarchy. Extracting\nseparable models of hierarchical entities requires us to take their relative\nposition into account and to consider the different types of dependencies in\nthe hierarchy. In this paper, we present an investigation of the effect of\nseparability in text-based entity classification and argue that in hierarchical\nclassification, a separation property should be established between entities\nnot only in the same layer, but also in different layers. Our main findings are\nthe followings.

Third, we validate our claims on real-world data and\ndemonstrate that how HSWLM improves the accuracy of classification and how it\nprovides transferable models over time.

Increased earthquake activity\nwithin the caldera started a few days before and lasted for months afterwards\nand new seismic activity started on the south flank. No visible eruption broke\nthe ice and the question arose as to whether this episode relates to a minor\nsubglacial eruption with the tremor being generated by volcanic processes, or\nby the flood. The tremor signal consisted of bursts with varying amplitude and\nduration. We have identified and described three different tremor phases, based\non amplitude and frequency features. A tremor phase associated with the flood\nwas recorded only at stations closest to the river that flooded, correlating in\ntime with rising water level observed at gauging stations. Using\nback-projection of double cross-correlations, two other phases have been\nlocated near the active ice cauldrons and are interpreted to be caused by\nvolcanic or hydrothermal processes. The greatly increased seismicity and\nevidence of rapid melting of the glacier may be explained by a minor\nsub-glacial eruption. It is also plausible that the tremor was generated by\nhydrothermal boiling and/or explosions with no magma involved. This may have\nbeen induced by pressure drop triggered by the release of water when the\nglacial flood started. All interpretations require an increase of heat released\nby the volcano.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2016 10:33:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

The\nSED are fitted using the CIGALE SED modelling code. The truncated activity of\ncluster galaxies is parametrised using a specific SFH with 2 free parameters,\nthe quenching age QA and the quenching factor QF. These 2 parameters are\ncrucial for the identification of the quenching mechanism which acts on long\ntimescales if starvation while rapid and efficient if ram pressure. To be\nsensitive to an abrupt and recent variation of the star formation activity, we\ncombine in a new way 20 UV to FIR photometric bands with 3 age-sensitive Balmer\nline absorption indices extracted from available medium-resolution integrated\nspectroscopy and with Halpha narrow band imaging data. The use of a truncated\nSFH significantly increases the quality of the fit in those objects whose\natomic gas content has been removed during the interaction with the hostile\ncluster environment. The typical QA of the perturbed late-type galaxies is QA <\n300 Myr whenever the activity of star formation is reduced by 50% < QF <= 80%\nand QA < 500 Myr for QF > 80%, while that of the quiescent early-types is QA ~\n1-3 Gyr.

Both the source that generates the original (clean) codewords, and the\nchannel that corrupts them in generating the noisy codewords, as well as the\nmain channel for communicating the messages, are all modeled by non-unifilar,\nfinite-state systems (hidden Markov models). As in previous works on universal\ndecoding, here too, the average error probability of our proposed universal\ndecoder is shown to be as small as that of the optimal maximum likelihood (ML)\ndecoder, up to a multiplicative factorthat is a sub-exponential function of the\nblock length. It therefore has the same error exponent, whenever the ML decoder\nhas a positive error exponent. The universal decoding metric is based on\nLempel-Ziv (LZ) incremental parsing of each noisy codeword jointly with the\ngiven channel output vector, but this metric is somewhat different from the one\nproposed in earlier works on universal decoding for finite-state channels, by\nZiv (1985) and by Lapidoth and Ziv (1998). The reason for the difference is\nthat here, unlike in those earlier works, the probability distribution that\ngoverns the (noisy) codewords is, in general, not uniform across its support.\nThis non-uniformity of the codeword distribution also makes our derivation more\nchallenging. Another reason for the more challenging analysis is the fact that\nthe effective induced channel between the noisy codeword of the transmitted\nmessage and the main channel output is not a finite-state channel in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2016 11:10:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-05"}

Billiards with\ndifferent particles are generically not integrable, but still exhibit\ndivergence of a heat conduction coefficient (HCC) in thermodynamic limit.\nTraditional billiard models imply instantaneous (zero-time) collisions between\nthe particles. We lift this condition and consider the heat transport in a\nchain of stiff colliding particles with power-law potential of the\nnearest-neighbor interaction. The instantaneous collisions correspond to the\nlimit of infinite power in the interaction potential; for finite powers, the\ninteractions take nonzero time. This modification of the model leads to\nprofound physical consequence -- probability of multiple, in particular, triple\nparticle collisions becomes nonzero. Contrary to the integrable billiard of\nequal particles, the modified model exhibits saturation of the heat conduction\ncoefficient for large system size. Moreover, identification of scattering\nevents with the triple particle collisions leads to simple definition of\ncharacteristic mean free path and kinetic description of the heat transport.\nThis approach allows prediction both of temperature and density dependencies\nfor the HCC limit values.

This paper\nis concerned with preconditioning of linear systems of equations with a\nsymmetric block Toeplitz matrix with symmetric Toeplitz blocks that stem from\nthe discretization of a linear ill-posed problem. The right-hand side of the\nlinear systems represents available data and is assumed to be contaminated by\nerror. These kinds of linear systems arise, e.g., in image deblurring problems.\nIt is important that the preconditioner does not affect the invariant subspace\nassociated with the smallest eigenvalues of the block Toeplitz matrix to avoid\nsevere propagation of the error in the right-hand side. A perturbation result\nindicates how the dimension of the subspace associated with the smallest\neigenvalues should be chosen and allows the determination of a suitable\npreconditioner when an estimate of the error in the right-hand side is\navailable. This estimate also is used to decide how many iterations to carry\nout by a minimum residual iterative method.

Early models of the biological\naspects of remodeling were non-spatial and focused on the local dynamics at a\nfixed location in the bone. Several spatial extensions of these models have\nbeen proposed, but they generally suffer from two limitations: first, they are\nnot amenable to analysis and are computationally expensive, and second, they\nneglect the role played by bone-embedded osteocytes. To address these issues,\nwe developed a novel model of spatial remodeling based on the principles of\nevolutionary game theory. The analytically tractable framework describes the\nspatial interactions between zones of bone resorption, bone formation and\nquiescent bone, and explicitly accounts for regulation of remodeling by\nbone-embedded, mechanotransducing osteocytes. Using tools from the theory of\ninteracting particle systems we systematically classified the different dynamic\nregimes of the spatial model and identified regions of parameter space that\nallow for coexistence of resorption, formation and quiescence, as observed in\nphysiological remodeling. In coexistence scenarios, three-dimensional\nsimulations revealed the emergence of sponge-like bone clusters. Comparison\nbetween spatial and non-spatial dynamics revealed substantial differences and\nsuggested a stabilizing role of space. Our findings emphasize the importance of\naccounting for spatial structure and bone-embedded osteocytes when modeling the\nprocess of bone remodeling. Thanks to the lattice-based framework, the proposed\nmodel can easily be coupled to a mechanical model of bone loading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2016 14:35:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-05"}

For WVS, the Meissner effect (ME) occurs\nonly in the the extreme KBH where $M^2/J=1$, in this case, the magnetic field\nis totally excluded from the event horizon (EH) of KBH. However, WVS does not\nconsider the Hawking radiation (HR) but treats KBH as an absolutely black body.\nIf HR is added , researchers believe that the condition is not so restricted\nand it is possible for ME to occur in less extreme case. How less is the \"less\nextreme case\"? This paper tries to answer this question. Since the Hawking\ntemperature $T_H$ of KBH defined by HR is proportional to the surface gravity\n$\\kappa$ at the EH, this question is actually about the so-called\nexistence/non-existence of ME (ME/NME) or superconducting phase transition. In\nthis paper, we study the connection between the superconductivity of KBH-EH and\nthe existence of Weyl Fermion (WF). Using thermodynamic formulas and the KBH\nstate equation, we prove that the inherent-parameter condition for ME to occur\nis $M^2/J\\leq \\epsilon_c=1.5$ in force-free fields whether it be in the simple\naxisymmetric vacuum zero source case or in the non-zero source case which can\nbe described by the nonlinear Grad-Shafranov (G-S) equation.

We also compare the results of our calculations with those obtained by\nother research groups using chiral nuclear interactions with different\nmany-body methods, finding in many cases a very satisfactory agreement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2016 15:57:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

We compare the structure and kinematics of ionized gas with that of\natomic hydrogen and with the stellar population of the SGS. Our deep H$\\alpha$\nimages and archival images taken by the HST demonstrate that current star\nformation episodes are larger and more complicated than previously thought:\nthey represent unified star-forming complexes with sizes of several hundred pc\nrather than 'chains' of separate bright nebulae in the walls of the SGS. The\nfact that we are dealing with unified complexes is evidenced by identified\nfaint shell-like structures of ionized and neutral gas which connect several\ndistinct bright HII regions. Formation of such complexes is due to the feedback\nof stars with very inhomogeneous ambient gas in the walls of the SGS. The\narguments supporting an idea about the triggering of star formation in SGS by\nthe HI supershells collision are presented. We also found a faint ionized\nsupershell inside the HI SGS expanding with a velocity of no greater than 10-15\nkm/s. Five OB stars located inside the inner supershell are sufficient to\naccount for its radiation, although a possibility of leakage of ionizing\nphotons from bright HII regions is not ruled out as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2016 15:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-30"}

However,\nwith strong bundling, it becomes hard to identify origins and destinations of\nindividual edges. We propose a solution: we optimize edge coloring to\ndifferentiate bundled edges. We quantify strength of bundling in a flexible\npairwise fashion between edges, and among bundled edges, we quantify how\ndissimilar their colors should be by dissimilarity of their origins and\ndestinations. We solve the resulting nonlinear optimization, which is also\ninterpretable as a novel dimensionality reduction task. In large graphs the\nnecessary compromise is whether to differentiate colors sharply between locally\noccurring strongly bundled edges (\"local bundles\"), or also between the weakly\nbundled edges occurring globally over the graph (\"global bundles\"); we allow a\nuser-set global-local tradeoff. We call the technique \"peacock bundles\".\nExperiments show the coloring clearly enhances comprehensibility of graph\nlayouts with edge bundling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2016 00:09:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
