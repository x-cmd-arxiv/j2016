Our core ideas lie in\nthe new rain image models and a novel deep learning architecture. We first\nmodify an existing model comprising a rain streak layer and a background layer,\nby adding a binary map that locates rain streak regions. Second, we create a\nnew model consisting of a component representing rain streak accumulation\n(where individual streaks cannot be seen, and thus visually similar to mist or\nfog), and another component representing various shapes and directions of\noverlapping rain streaks, which usually happen in heavy rain. Based on the\nfirst model, we develop a multi-task deep learning architecture that learns the\nbinary rain streak map, the appearance of rain streaks, and the clean\nbackground, which is our ultimate output. The additional binary map is\ncritically beneficial, since its loss function can provide additional strong\ninformation to the network. To handle rain streak accumulation (again, a\nphenomenon visually similar to mist or fog) and various shapes and directions\nof overlapping rain streaks, we propose a recurrent rain detection and removal\nnetwork that removes rain streaks and clears up the rain accumulation\niteratively and progressively. In each recurrence of our method, a new\ncontextualized dilated network is developed to exploit regional contextual\ninformation and outputs better representation for rain detection.

First, the mathematical\ntheory of tensor operators for a Lie group is recast in a new way which is used\nto generalise the Wigner-Eckart theorem to non-compact groups. The result\nrelies on the knowledge of the recoupling theory between finite-dimensional and\ninfinite-dimensional irreducible representations of the group; here the\npreviously unconsidered cases of the 3D and 4D Lorentz groups are investigated\nin detail. As an application, the Wigner-Eckart theorem is used to generalise\nthe Jordan-Schwinger representation of SU(2) to both groups, for all\nrepresentation classes. Next, the results obtained for the 3D Lorentz group are\napplied to (2+1) Lorentzian loop quantum gravity to develop an analogue of the\nwell-known spinorial approach used in the Euclidean case. Tensor operators are\nused to construct observables and to generalise the Hamiltonian constraint\nintroduced by Bonzom and Livine (2012) for 3D gravity to the Lorentzian case.\nThe Ponzano-Regge amplitude is shown to be a solution of this constraint by\nrecovering the (opportunely generalised) Biedenharn-Elliott relations. Finally,\nthe focus is shifted on the intertwiner space based on SU(2) representations,\nwidely used in loop quantum gravity. When working in the spinorial formalism,\nit has been shown that the Hilbert space of n-valent intertwiners with fixed\ntotal area is a representation of U(n). Here it is shown that the full space of\nall n-valent intertwiners forms an irreducible representation of the\nnon-compact group SO*(2n). This fact is used to construct a new kind of\ncoherent intertwiner state (in the sense of Perelomov). Hints of how these\ncoherent states can be interpreted in the semi-classical limit as convex\npolyhedra are provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2016 20:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}

An important challenge is the contagion of\nfailure from one system to another, which can lead to large-scale cascading\nfailures. However, the self-healing ability emerges as a valuable opportunity\nwhere the overlaying cyber network can cure failures in the underlying physical\nnetwork. To capture both self-healing and contagion, this paper considers a\ngraphical model representation of an interdependent cyber-physical system, in\nwhich nodes represent various cyber or physical functionalities, and edges\ncapture the interactions between the nodes. A message-passing algorithm is\nproposed for this representation to study the dynamics of failure propagation\nand healing. By conducting a density evolution analysis for this algorithm,\nnetwork reaction to initial disruptions is investigated. It is proved that as\nthe number of message-passing iterations increases, the network reaches a\nsteady-state condition that would be either a complete healing or a complete\ncollapse. Then, a sufficient condition is derived to select the network\nparameters to guarantee the complete healing of the system. The result of the\ndensity evolution analysis is further employed to jointly optimize the design\nof cyber and physical networks for maximum resiliency. This analytical\nframework is then extended to the cases where propagation of failures in the\nphysical network is faster than the healing responses of the cyber network.\nSuch scenarios are of interest in many real-life applications such as smart\ngrid. Finally, extensive numerical results are presented to verify the analysis\nand investigate the impact of the network parameters on the resiliency of the\nnetwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2016 20:36:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2017 17:54:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-14"}

However, present understandings on the strain rate\ndependence of the TP are far from clear, even a virgin for extreme high strain\nrates. In this work, large scale NEMD simulations are conducted to study the\neffects of strain rates on the phase transition of iron-based single crystals.\nOur results show that the phase transition is preceded by lattice instabilities\nunder ramp compressions, but present theory, represented by modified Born\ncriteria, cannot correctly predict observed onsets of the instability. Through\nconsidering both strain and strain gradient disturbances, new instability\ncriteria are proposed, which could be generally applied for studying\ninstabilities under either static or dynamic loadings. For the ramp with a\nstrain rate smaller than about 1010s-1, the observed onset of instabilities is\nindeed equal to the one predicted by the new instability criteria under small\ngradient disturbances. The observed onsets deviates from the predicted one at\nlager strain rates because of finite strain gradient effect. Interestingly, the\nstrain rate dependence of the TP also exhibits an obvious change at the same\nstrain rate, i.e., 1010 s-1. When 1010 s-1, a certain power law is obeyed, but\nit is not applicable at larger strain rates. This strain rate effect on the TP\nis well interpreted with nucleation time and the finite strain gradient effect.\nAccording to these basic understandings, the roles of strain rates on\nnucleation and growth of the phase transition are studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 01:57:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 01:45:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-05"}

The jamming scheme consists of a Local Friendship\nCircle (LFC) and a Long-range Friendship Annulus (LFA), where all legitimate\nnodes in the LFC serve as jammers, but the legitimate nodes in the LFA are\nselected as jammers through three location-based policies.

It turns out that effectively the dynamics of this\ndistance coordinate can be captured in terms of a simple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\npicture. Reducing the many-body problem to a simple two-body problem by\nimagining predator and nearest prey to be connected by a Hookean bond, all\nfeatures of the model such as prey density and sighting ranges merge into the\neffective binding constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 06:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

For example, the research on the supercoiling of DNA is\nhelpful for understanding the replication and transcription of DNA. Similar\ndouble helices can appear in polymer chains, carbon nanotube yarns, cables,\ntelephone wires and so forth. We noticed that non-uniform double helices can be\nproduced due to the surface friction induced by the self-contact. Therefore an\nideal model was presented to investigate the formation of double helices for\nelastic rods under torque. A general equilibrium condition which is valid for\nboth the smooth surface and the rough surface situations is derived by using\nthe variational method. Based on this, by adding further constraints, the\nsmooth and rough surface situations are investigated in detail respectively.\nAdditionally, the model showed that the specific process of how to twist and\nslack the rod can determine the surface friction and hence influence the\nconfiguration of the double helix formed by rods with rough surfaces. Based on\nthis principle, a method of manufacturing double helices with designed\nconfigurations was proposed and demonstrated. Finally, experiments were\nperformed to verify the model and the results agreed well with the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 06:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-09"}

These properties can be guaranteed by\nimposing step-size restrictions on the methods. To qualitatively describe the\nstep-size restrictions, one introduces the concept of step-size coefficient for\nmonotonicity (SCM, also referred to as the strong-stability-preserving (SSP)\ncoefficient) or its generalization, the step-size coefficient for boundedness\n(SCB). A LMM with larger SCM or SCB is more efficient, and the computation of\nthe maximum SCM for a particular LMM is now straightforward. However, it is\nmore challenging to decide whether a positive SCB exists, or determine if a\ngiven positive number is a SCB.

To test the usefulness of IA in this context, this\npaper proposes a two-stage optimization framework for the downlink of a\n$G$-cell multi-antenna network with $K$ users/cell. The first stage of the\nproposed framework focuses on nulling interference from a set of dominant\ninterferers using IA, while the second stage optimizes transmit and receive\nbeamformers to maximize a network-wide utility using the IA solution as the\ninitial condition. Further, this paper establishes a set of new feasibility\nresults for partial IA that can be used to guide the number of dominant\ninterferers to be nulled in the first stage. Through simulations on specific\ntopologies of a cluster of base-stations, it is observed that the impact of IA\ndepends on the choice of the utility function and the presence of\nout-of-cluster interference. In the absence of out-of-cluster interference, the\nproposed framework outperforms straightforward optimization when maximizing the\nminimum rate, while providing marginal gains when maximizing sum-rate. However,\nthe benefit of IA is greatly diminished in the presence of significant\nout-of-cluster interference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 07:07:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}

The evolution of QPO frequency is explained\nby the systematic variation of the Compton cloud size, i.e., the steady radial\nmovement of the shock front, which is triggered by the cooling of the\npost-shock region. Thus, analysis of energy-dependent temporal properties in\ndifferent variability time scales can diagnose the dynamics and geometry of\naccretion flows around black holes. We study these properties for the high\ninclination black hole source XTE J1550-564 during its 1998 outburst and the\nlow-inclination black hole source GX 339-4 during its 2006-07 outburst using\nRXTE/PCA data, and we find that they can satisfactorily explain the time lags\nassociated with the QPOs from these systems.

However, precise interactions among\npedestrians are difficult to measure in the presence of their complex\ndecision-making processes and many related factors. While extensive studies on\npedestrian flow through bottlenecks and corridors have been conducted, the\ndominant mode of interaction in these scenarios may not be relevant in\ndifferent scenarios. Here, we attempt to decipher the factors that affect human\nreactions to other individuals from a different perspective. We conducted\nexperiments employing the inflow process in which pedestrians successively\nenter a confined area (like an elevator) and look for a temporary position. In\nthis process, pedestrians have a wider range of options regarding their motion\nthan in the classical scenarios; therefore, other factors might become\nrelevant. The preference of location is visualized by pedestrian density\nprofiles obtained from recorded pedestrian trajectories. Non-trivial patterns\nof space acquisition, e.g., an apparent preference for positions near corners,\nwere observed. This indicates the relevance of psychological and anticipative\nfactors beyond the private sphere, which have not been deeply discussed so far\nin the literature on pedestrian dynamics. From the results, four major factors,\nwhich we call flow avoidance, distance cost, angle cost, and boundary\npreference, were suggested.

In particular, these observations show that the compaction of the\nnucleoid is not static but is instead a highly dynamic feature, which depends\non several factors, like the richness of the nutrient, the cell cycle stage,\ntemperature, the action of an osmotic shock or antibiotics, etc. After a short\ndescription of the electrolyte content of the cytosol and a brief overview of\nthe different mechanisms that may lead to the formation of the nucleoid, this\npaper reviews some of the most fascinating recent results of in vivo\nsub-wavelength resolution microscopy. It is furthermore argued that these\nobservations provide converging indications in favor of a model that describes\nthe cytosol as an aqueous electrolyte solution containing several\nmacromolecular species, where demixing and segregative phase separation occur\nbetween DNA and RNA (essentially rRNA and mRNA involved in translation\ncomplexes, but also the large amounts of rRNA synthesized at the rrn operons of\ncells growing in rich media). It is also pointed out that crowding may play a\ncrucial role through its synergy with electrostatic forces. By constraining\nmacromolecules to remain at short distances from one another and feel\nelectrostatic interactions in spite of the strong screening exerted by\nelectrolyte species, crowding favors stronger DNA/RNA demixing and nucleoid\ncompaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 09:10:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}

In the context of thermoelectric generators, it\naims to engineer the Seebeck coefficient to favorably increase the power factor\nand ultimately the power generated. In this work, we employ the incoherent\nnon-equilibrium Green's function formalism to investigate in detail the physics\nof energy filtering and how it leads to a direct enhancement in power\ngeneration across nanostructured thermoelectrics featuring a single planar\nenergy barrier. In particular, we reinforce that the enhancement in the\ngenerated power via energy filtering at a particular operating efficiency is a\ncharacteristic of incoherent scattering and is absent in ballistic devices. In\nsuch cases, by assuming an energy dependent relaxation time, $\\tau(E)=kE^r$, we\nshow that there exists a minimum value $r_{min}$ for which the thermoelectric\npower generation is enhanced and thereby leading to a degradation in power\ngeneration for $r<r_{min}$. For bulk generators, we delve into the details of\nintermode scattering and show that such scattering processes between electrons\nin higher energy modes and lower energy modes have a finite contribution to the\nenhancement in the generated power. We also discuss realistic aspects such as\nfinite width of energy barriers and imperfect energy filtering due to partial\nreflections. In particular, we show that such imperfect filtering and partial\ntransmission of electrons near the top of the barrier affects the enhancement\nin the generated power drastically in the high efficiency regime of operation.\nAnalysis of the results obtained in this work should provide general design\nguidelines for nanostructured enhancement in power generation via energy\nfiltering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 09:21:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}

Our fully data-driven approach provides construction\npractitioners and academicians with an easy and automated way of extracting\nvaluable empirical insights from databases of unstructured textual injury\nreports. By applying our methodology on an attribute and outcome dataset\ndirectly obtained from 814 injury reports, we show that the frequency-magnitude\ndistribution of construction safety risk is very similar to that of natural\nphenomena such as precipitation or earthquakes. Motivated by this observation,\nand drawing on state-of-the-art techniques in hydroclimatology and insurance,\nwe introduce univariate and bivariate nonparametric stochastic safety risk\ngenerators, based on Kernel Density Estimators and Copulas.

We\nemploy general adaptive moments (GLAM) to study causes of shear bias on a\nfundamental level and for a practical definition of an image ellipticity. The\nGLAM ellipticity has useful properties for any chosen weight profile: the\nweighted ellipticity is identical to that of isophotes of elliptical images,\nand in absence of noise and pixellation it is always an unbiased estimator of\nreduced shear. We show that moment-based techniques, adaptive or unweighted,\nare similar to a model-based approach in the sense that they can be seen as\nimperfect fit of an elliptical profile to the image. Due to residuals in the\nfit, moment-based estimates of ellipticities are prone to underfitting bias\nwhen inferred from observed images. The estimation is fundamentally limited\nmainly by pixellation which destroys information on the original, pre-seeing\nimage. We give an optimized estimator for the pre-seeing GLAM ellipticity and\nquantify its bias for noise-free images. To deal with pixel noise, we consider\na Bayesian approach where the posterior of the GLAM ellipticity can be\ninconsistent with the true ellipticity if we do not properly account for our\nignorance about fit residuals. This underfitting bias is S/N-independent but\nchanges with the pre-seeing brightness profile and the correlation or\nheterogeneity of pixel noise over the post-seeing image. Furthermore, when\ninferring a constant ellipticity or, more relevantly, constant shear from a\nsource sample with a distribution of intrinsic properties (sizes, centroid\npositions, intrinsic shapes), an additional, now noise-dependent bias arises\ntowards low S/N if incorrect priors for the intrinsic properties are used.

DF Cygni shows a very rich behaviour on all\ntime-scales. The slow variation has a period of 779.606 d and it has been\nremarkably coherent during the whole time-span of the combined data.

Sufficient conditions for robust stability\nare derived using two different methods. In the first approach, a generalized\nsmall-gain theorem is presented and in the second approach, robust stability is\nanalyzed within the framework of Lyapunov theory.

As detectors 32 poly-crystalline (pCVD) diamond sensors are\npositioned in rings around the beam pipe. Here, high particle rates occur from\nthe colliding beams scattering particles outside the beam pipe. These particles\ncause defects, which act as traps for the ionization, thus reducing the charge\ncollection efficiency (CCE). However, the loss in CCE was much more severe than\nexpected from low rate laboratory measurements and simulations, especially in\nsingle-crystalline (sCVD) diamonds, which have a low initial concentration of\ndefects. The reason why in real experiments the CCE is much worse than in\nlaboratory experiments is related to the ionization rate. At high particle\nrates the trapping rate of the ionization is so high compared with the\ndetrapping rate, that space charge builds up. This space charge reduces locally\nthe internal electric field, which in turn increases the trapping rate and\nrecombination and hence reduces the CCE in a strongly non-linear way. A diamond\nirradiation campaign was started to investigate the rate dependent electrical\nfield deformation with respect to the radiation damage. Besides the electrical\nfield measurements via the Transient Current Technique (TCT), the CCE was\nmeasured. The experimental results were used to create an effective deep trap\nmodel that takes the radiation damage into account. Using this trap model the\nrate dependent electrical field deformation and the CCE were simulated with the\nsoftware SILVACO TCAD. The simulation, tuned to rate dependent measurements\nfrom a strong radioactive source, was able to predict the non-linear decrease\nof the CCE in the harsh environment of the LHC, where the particle rate was a\nfactor 30 higher.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 12:39:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}

The regret ratio\nhere is modeled by the relative difference in the optimality between the\nlocally optimal object in S and the globally optimal object in D. The\noptimality of a data object in turn is modeled by a utility function of the\nquery user. Unlike traditional top-k queries, the k-regret query does not\nminimize the regret ratio for a specific utility function. Instead, it\nconsiders a family of infinite utility functions F, and aims to find a size-k\nsubset that minimizes the maximum regret ratio of any utility function in F.\n  Studies on k-regret queries have focused on the family of additive utility\nfunctions, which have limitations in modeling individuals' preferences and\ndecision making processes, especially for a common observation called the\ndiminishing marginal rate of substitution (DMRS). We introduce k-regret queries\nwith multiplicative utility functions, which are more expressive in modeling\nthe DMRS, to overcome those limitations. We propose a query algorithm with\nbounded regret ratios.

Hence, an analysis of\nthe quantities that enhance Eeff is necessary to identify suitable molecules\nfor eEDM searches. In the context of such searches, it is generally believed\nthat a molecule with larger electric polarization also has a larger value of\nEeff. However, our Dirac-Fock and relativistic coupled-cluster singles and\ndoubles calculations show that the hydrides of Yb and Hg have larger Eeff than\nthose of fluorides, even though their polarizations are smaller. This is due to\nsignificant mixing of valence s and p orbitals of the heavy atom in the\nmolecules. This mixing has been attributed to the energy differences of the\nvalence atomic orbitals and the overlap of the two atomic orbitals based on the\norbital interaction theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 14:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

Laser fields are transverse, but proxy fields are longitudinal;\nthere can be no gauge equivalence. The proxy field is sometimes serviceable,\nbut its limitations are severe. One example is the \"above-threshold ionization\"\n(ATI) phenomenon; surprising by proxy-field understanding, but natural and\npredicted in advance of observation with a laser-field method. An\noften-overlooked limitation is that numerical solution of the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation (TDSE) is exact for proxy fields, but not for laser\nfields. Acceptance of proxy-field concepts has been costly in terms of\ninefficiently deployed research resources. Calculations with a nearly-40-year\nold transverse-field method remain unmatched with proxy fields. The\ntransverse-field method is applicable in the \"tunneling\" domain, the\n\"multiphoton\" domain, and, as shown here, in the low-frequency \"magnetic\"\ndomain. Attempts to introduce low-frequency magnetic field corrections into\nTDSE cannot be expected to produce meaningful results. They would be based on\ninappropriate Maxwell equations, a non-existent virtual source, and would\napproach constant electric field properties as the field frequency declines.\nLaser fields propagate at the speed of light for all frequencies; they cannot\napproach a constant-field limit.

In particular, model based real-time control of\nurban water infrastructures and online flood alarm systems require fast\nprediction of the network response at different actuation and/or parameter\nvalues. General purpose urban drainage simulators are too slow for this\napplication. Fast surrogate models, so-called emulators, provide a solution to\nthis efficiency demand. Emulators are attractive, because they sacrifice\nunneeded accuracy in favor of speed. However, they have to be fine-tuned to\npredict the system behavior satisfactorily. Also, some emulators fail to\nextrapolate the system behavior beyond the training set. Although, there are\nmany strategies for developing emulators, up until now the selection of the\nemulation strategy remains subjective. In this paper, we therefore compare the\nperformance of two families of emulators for open channel flows in the context\nof urban drainage simulators. We compare emulators that explicitly use\nknowledge of the simulator's equations, i.e. mechanistic emulators based on\nGaussian Processes, with purely data-driven emulators using matrix\nfactorization. Our results suggest that in many urban applications, naive\ndata-driven emulation outperforms mechanistic emulation. Nevertheless, we\ndiscuss scenarios in which we think that mechanistic emulation might be\nfavorable for i) extrapolation in time and ii) dealing with sparse and unevenly\nsampled data. We also provide many references to advances in the field of\nMachine Learning that have not yet permeated into the Bayesian environmental\nscience community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2016 21:57:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2017 12:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-06"}
