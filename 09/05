In codimension four and higher,\nit is an open problem whether all complete intersections have the weak\nLefschetz property. For a given artinian Gorenstein algebra $A$ we ask what\nlinear forms are Lefschetz elements for this particular algebra, i.e., which\nlinear forms $\\ell$ give maximal rank for all the multiplication maps $\\times\n\\ell: [A]_i \\longrightarrow [A]_{i+1}$. This is a Zariski open set and its\ncomplement is the \\emph{non-Lefschetz locus}. For monomial complete\nintersections, we completely describe the non-Lefschetz locus. For general\ncomplete intersections of codimension three and four we prove that the\nnon-Lefschetz locus has the expected codimension, which in particular means\nthat it is empty in a large family of examples. For general Gorenstein algebras\nof codimension three with a given Hilbert function, we prove that the\nnon-Lefschetz locus has the expected codimension if the first difference of the\nHilbert function is of decreasing type.

However, it is well known that cell\ncultures do not obey this law. The current thinking is that were in-vitro\ncultures to obey quarter power scaling, they would have more predictive power\nand could for instance provide a viable substitute for animals in research.\nAbout two decades ago, West and coworkers established a model which predicts\nthat metabolic rate follows a quarter power relationship with the mass of an\norganism, based on the premise that tissues are supplied nutrients through a\nfractal distribution network. This paper outlines a theoretical and\ncomputational framework for establishing quarter power scaling in-vitro,\nstarting where fractal distribution ends. Allometric scaling in non-vascular\nspherical tissue constructs was assessed using models of Michaelis Menten\noxygen consumption and diffusion. The results demonstrate that physiological\nscaling is maintained when about 5 to 60% of the construct is exposed to oxygen\nconcentrations less than the Michaelis Menten constant. In these conditions the\nThiele modulus is between 8 and 80, with a significant concentration gradient\nin the sphere. The results have important implications for the design of\ndownscaled in-vitro systems with physiological relevance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2016 20:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-23"}

From a law\nenforcement perspective we have to deal with these huge amounts of data when a\ncriminal investigation is launched against an individual or company. Relevant\nquestions need to be answered like who committed the crime, who were involved,\nwhat happened and on what time, who were communicating and about what? Not only\nthe amount of available data to investigate has increased enormously, but also\nthe complexity of this data has increased. When these communication patterns\nneed to be combined with for instance a seized financial administration or\ncorporate document shares a complex investigation problem arises. Recently,\ncriminal investigators face a huge challenge when evidence of a crime needs to\nbe found in the Big Data environment where they have to deal with large and\ncomplex datasets especially in financial and fraud investigations. To tackle\nthis problem, a financial and fraud investigation unit of a European country\nhas developed a new tool named LES that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP)\ntechniques to help criminal investigators handle large amounts of textual\ninformation in a more efficient and faster way. In this paper, we present\nbriefly this tool and we focus on the evaluation its performance in terms of\nthe requirements of forensic investigation: speed, smarter and easier for\ninvestigators. In order to evaluate this LES tool, we use different performance\nmetrics. We also show experimental results of our evaluation with large and\ncomplex datasets from real-world application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2016 21:23:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

Most of the studies on extragalactic {\\gamma}-ray propagation\nperformed up to now only accounted for primary gamma-ray absorption and\nadiabatic losses (\"absorption-only model\").

Many physically-inspired\nmodels of these dynamics define the state of the brain based on instantaneous\nmeasurements of regional activity. Yet, recent work in network neuroscience has\nprovided initial evidence that the brain might also be well-characterized by\ntime-varying states composed of locally coherent activity or functional\nmodules. Here we study this network-based notion of brain state to understand\nhow functional modules dynamically interact with one another to perform\ncognitive functions. We estimate the functional relationships between regions\nof interest (ROIs) by fitting a pair-wise maximum entropy model to each ROI's\npattern of allegiance to functional modules. Local minima in this model\nrepresent attractor states characterized by specific patterns of modular\nstructure. The clustering of local minima highlights three classes of ROIs with\nsimilar patterns of allegiance to community states. Visual, attention,\nsensorimotor, and subcortical ROIs tend to form a single functional community.\nThe remaining ROIs tend to form a putative executive control community or a\nputative default mode and salience community. We simulate the brain's dynamic\ntransitions between these community states using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nrandom walk. We observe that simulated transition probabilities between basins\nresemble empirically observed transitions between community allegiance states\nin resting state fMRI data. These results collectively offer a view of the\nbrain as a dynamical system that transitions between basins of attraction\ncharacterized by coherent activity in small groups of brain regions, and that\nthe strength of these attractors depends on the cognitive computations being\nperformed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2016 01:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

An algorithm for finding an\noptimal trade-off between the measure of privacy infringement and the expected\nestimation error, captured by the number of the nodes over which the\nparticipant stops broadcasting its position, is proposed.

Topological semimetals host paired monopoles and\nantimonopoles of Berry curvature at the Weyl nodes and topologically protected\nFermi arcs at certain surfaces. We review our recent works on quantum transport\nin topological semimetals, according to the strength of the magnetic field. At\nweak magnetic fields, there are competitions between the positive\nmagnetoresistivity induced by the weak anti-localization effect and negative\nmagnetoresistivity related to the nontrivial Berry curvature. We propose a\nfitting formula for the magnetoconductivity of the weak anti-localization. We\nexpect that the weak localization may by induced by inter- alley effects and\ninteraction effect, and occur in double-Weyl semimetals. For the negative\nmagnetoresistance induced by the nontrivial Berry curvature in topological\nsemimetals, we show the dependence of the negative magnetoresistance on the\ncarrier density. At strong magnetic fields, specifically, in the quantum limit,\nthe magnetoconduction depends on the type and range of the scattering potential\nof disorder. The high-field positive magnetoconductivity may not be a\ncompelling signature of the chiral anomaly. For long-range Gaussian scattering\npotential and half filling, the magnetoconductivity can be linear in the\nquantum limit. A minimal conductivity is found at the Weyl nodes although the\ndensity of states vanishes there.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2016 05:31:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-13"}

The grasp\nselection operates in two stages: The first stage is hardcoded and outputs a\ndistribution of possible grasps that sometimes succeed. The second stage uses a\npurely learned criterion to choose the grasp to make from the proposal\ndistribution created by the first stage.\n  In an experiment, the system quickly learned to make good pickups and predict\ncorrectly, in advance, which class of object it was going to pick up and was\nable to sort the objects from a densely cluttered pile by color.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2016 07:44:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

It is generally accepted that, in Classical T Tauri Stars, the\nplasma from the circumstellar disc accretes onto the stellar surface with free\nfall velocity, and the impact generates a shock. The impact region is expected\nto contribute to emission in different spectral bands; many studies have\nconfirmed that the X-rays arise from the post-shock plasma but, otherwise,\nthere are no studies in the literature investigating the origin of the observed\nUV emission which is apparently correlated to accretion. Aims. We investigated\nthe effect of radiative heating of the infalling material by the post-shock\nplasma at the base of the accretion stream with the aim to identify in which\nregion a significant part of the UV emission originates. Methods. We developed\na 1D hydrodynamic model describing the impact of an accretion stream onto the\nstellar surface; the model takes into account the gravity, the radiative\ncooling of an optically thin plasma, the thermal conduction, and the heating\ndue to absorption of X-ray radiation. The latter term represents the heating of\nthe infalling plasma due to the absorption of X-rays emitted from the\npost-shock region. Results. We found that the radiative heating of the\npre-shock plasma plays a non-negligible role in the accretion phenomenon. In\nparticular, the dense and cold plasma of the pre-shock accretion column is\ngradually heated up to few $10^5$\\;K due to irradiation of X-rays arising from\nthe shocked plasma at the impact region. This heating mechanism does not affect\nsignificantly the dynamics of the post-shock plasma. On the other hand, a\nregion of radiatively heated gas (that we consider a precursor) forms in the\nunshocked accretion column and contributes significantly to UV emission. Our\nmodel naturally reproduces the luminosity of UV emission lines correlated to\naccretion and shows that most of the UV emission originates from the precursor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2016 08:39:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-12"}

A possible explanation\nis that the gravitational forces between the A and B components of AT Mic (that\nare a factor about 7.3 x 10^6 more intense than those between AU Mic and AT\nMic) have enhanced the dispersal of the AT Mic primordial disc, shortening its\nlifetime and the disc-locking phase duration, making the component A and B of\nAT Mic to rotate faster than the more distant AU Mic.

A highly disrupted ring with\nlarge asymmetries both radially and azimuthally. Numerically non zero\ncomponents to the curl of the velocity vector field (vorticity) in the\nperturbed area of the F ring post encounter are witnessed, significantly above\nthe background vorticity. Within the perturbed area rich distributions of local\nrotations is seen located in and around the channel edges. The gravitational\nscattering of ring particles during the encounter causes a significant elevated\ncurl of the vector field above the background F ring vorticity for the first\n1-3 orbital periods post encounter. After 3 orbital periods vorticity reverts\nquite quickly to near background levels. This new found dynamical vortex life\nof the ring will be of great interest to planet and planetesimals in\nproto-planetary disks where vortices and turbulence are suspected of having a\nsignificant role in their formation and migrations.

QSO B0218+357 is a gravitationally lensed blazar located at a\nredshift of 0.944. The gravitational lensing splits the emitted radiation into\ntwo components, spatially indistinguishable by gamma-ray instruments, but\nseparated by a 10-12 day delay. In July 2014, QSO B0218+357 experienced a\nviolent flare observed by the Fermi-LAT and followed by the MAGIC telescopes.\nAims. The spectral energy distribution of QSO B0218+357 can give information on\nthe energetics of z ~ 1 very high energy gamma- ray sources. Moreover the\ngamma-ray emission can also be used as a probe of the extragalactic background\nlight at z ~ 1. Methods. MAGIC performed observations of QSO B0218+357 during\nthe expected arrival time of the delayed component of the emission. The MAGIC\nand Fermi-LAT observations were accompanied by quasi-simultaneous optical data\nfrom the KVA telescope and X-ray observations by Swift-XRT. We construct a\nmultiwavelength spectral energy distribution of QSO B0218+357 and use it to\nmodel the source. The GeV and sub-TeV data, obtained by Fermi-LAT and MAGIC,\nare used to set constraints on the extragalactic background light. Results.\nVery high energy gamma-ray emission was detected from the direction of QSO\nB0218+357 by the MAGIC telescopes during the expected time of arrival of the\ntrailing component of the flare, making it the farthest very high energy\ngamma-ray sources detected to date.

Researchers\nhave discussed whether the mean-field approaches could accurately describe the\nepidemic spreading for the homogeneous cases but not for the heterogeneous\ncases. In this paper, we explore under what conditions the mean-field approach\ncould perform well when the infection rates are heterogeneous. In particular,\nwe employ the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model and compare the\naverage fraction of infected nodes in the metastable state obtained by the\ncontinuous-time simulation and the mean-field approximation. We concentrate on\nan individual-based mean-field approximation called the N-intertwined Mean\nField Approximation (NIMFA), which is an advanced approach considered the\nunderlying network topology. Moreover, we consider not only the independent and\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) infection rate but also the infection rate\ncorrelated with the degree of the two end nodes. We conclude that NIMFA is\ngenerally more accurate when the prevalence of the epidemic is higher. Given\nthe same effective infection rate, NIMFA is less accurate when the variance of\nthe i.i.d.\\ infection rate or the correlation between the infection rate and\nthe nodal degree leads to a lower prevalence. Moreover, given the same actual\nprevalence, NIMFA performs better in the cases: 1) when the variance of the\ni.i.d.\\ infection rates is smaller (while the average is unchanged); 2) when\nthe correlation between the infection rate and the nodal degree is positive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2016 11:29:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

We replace\nthe English text symbol sequence originally used to illustrate the theory by a\ndiscrete, bandlimited signal. Using Shannon's later theory of sampling we\nderive a new and symmetric version of the second order entropy in 1D. The new\ntheory then naturally extends to 2D and higher dimensions, where by naturally\nwe mean simple, symmetric, isotropic and parsimonious. Simplicity arises from\nthe direct application of Shannon's joint entropy equalities and inequalities\nto the gradient (del) vector field image embodying the second order relations\nof the scalar image. Parsimony is guaranteed by halving of the vector data rate\nusing Papoulis' generalized sampling expansion. The new 2D entropy measure,\nwhich we dub delentropy, is underpinned by a computable probability density\nfunction we call deldensity. The deldensity captures the underlying spatial\nimage structure and pixel co-occurrence. It achieves this because each scalar\nimage pixel value is nonlocally related to the entire gradient vector field.\nBoth deldensity and delentropy are highly tractable and yield many interesting\nconnections and useful inequalities. The new measure explicitly defines a\nrealizable encoding algorithm and a corresponding reconstruction. Initial tests\nshow that delentropy compares favourably with the conventional intensity-based\nhistogram entropy and the compressed data rates of lossless image encoders\n(GIF, PNG, WEBP, JP2K-LS and JPG-LS) for a selection of images.

To carry out\nthese measurements, we are experimenting a new way of coupling the instruments\nto the telescopes, by means of moderate-aperture, low-optical-attenuation\nmulti-mode optical fibers with a double-clad design.

We used the MAGPHYS\ncode to fit the multiwavelength (UV-radio) SEDs of 16 of the target SMGs. We\nalso constructed the pure radio SEDs of our SMGs using three different radio\nbands (325 MHz, 1.4 GHz, and 3 GHz). Moreover, since two SMGs in our sample,\nAzTEC1 and AzTEC3, benefit from previous CO line observations, we studied their\nproperties in more detail. We found that 63% of our target SMGs lie above the\ngalaxy main-sequence by more than a factor of 3, and hence are starbursts. The\n3 GHz radio sizes we have previously measured for the target SMGs were compared\nwith the present stellar mass estimates, and we found that the z>3 SMGs are\nfairly consistent with the mass-size relationship of z~2 compact, quiescent\ngalaxies (cQGs). The median IR-radio correlation parameter is found to be\nq=2.27, which is lower than measured locally (median q=2.64). AzTEC1 is found\nto have a sub-Eddington SFR surface density (by a factor of 2.6), while AzTEC3\nappears to be an Eddington-limited starburster. The gas reservoir in these two\nhigh-z SMGs would be exhausted in only ~86 and 19 Myr at the current SFR,\nrespectively. A comparison of the MAGPHYS-based properties of our SMGs with\nthose of equally bright ALESS SMGs suggests that the two populations share\nfairly similar physical characteristics, including the q parameter. A hint of\nnegative correlation is found between the 3 GHz size and the level of\nstarburstiness, and hence cosmic-ray electrons in more compact starbursts might\nbe more susceptible to free-free absorption. Some of the derived low and high q\nvalues (compared to the local median) could be the result of a specific\nmerger/post-starburst phase of galaxy evolution. Overall, our results support\nthe scenario where z>3 SMGs evolve into today's giant ellipticals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2016 13:43:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

This paper summarizes recent results on a self-consistent coupling\nof diffusive shock acceleration and radiation transfer in blazar jets. We\ndemonstrate that the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars\nstrongly constrain the nature of hydromagnetic turbulence responsible for\npitch-angle scattering by requiring a strongly energy-dependent pitch-angle\nmean free path. The prominent soft X-ray excess (\"Big Blue Bump\") in the SED of\nthe BL Lac object AO 0235+164 can be modelled as the signature of bulk Compton\nscattering of external radiation fields by the thermal electron population,\nwhich places additional constraints on the level of hydromagnetic turbulence.\nIt has further been demonstrated that internal shocks propagating in a jet\npervaded by a helical magnetic field naturally produce polarization-angle\nswings by 180$^o$, in tandem with multi-wavelength flaring activity, without\nrequiring any helical motion paths or other asymmetric jet structures. The\nspecific application of this model to 3C279 presents the first consistent,\nsimultaneous modeling of snap-shot SEDs, multi-wavelength light curves and\ntime-dependent polarization signatures of a blazar during a polarization-angle\n(PA) rotation.

The Milky Way's geometrically thick disk\nis also radially extended, but it is far from chemically uniform:\nalpha-enhanced stars are confined within the inner Galaxy. In simulated\ngalaxies, where old stars are centrally concentrated, geometrically thick disks\nare radially extended, too. Younger stellar populations flare in the simulated\ndisks' outer regions, bringing those stars high above the mid-plane. The\nresulting geometrically thick disks therefore show a radial age gradient, from\nold in their central regions to younger in their outskirts.

We carry out\na parameter study to assess how the strength and extension of the inflows\naffect the build-up of the global dipole field. We also perform simulations\nwith different levels of activity to investigate the potential role of the\ninflows in the saturation of the global dynamo.\n  Results: We find that the interaction of neighbouring active regions can lead\nto the occasional formation of single-polarity magnetic flux clumps\ninconsistent with observations.

We find that inflows decrease the amplitude of the axial dipole\nmoment by a $\\sim30\\,\\%$, relative to a no-inflows scenario.

This criminal activity is becoming more\nand more sophisticated and seems to have moved from the clichy of drug\ntrafficking to financing terrorism and surely not forgetting personal gain.\nMost of the financial institutions internationally have been implementing\nanti-money laundering solutions (AML) to fight investment fraud activities. In\nAML, the customer identification is an important task which helps AML experts\nto monitor customer habits: some being customer domicile, transactions that\nthey are involved in etc. However, simple query tools provided by current DBMS\nas well as naive approaches in customer searching may produce incorrect and\nambiguous results and their processing time is also very high due to the\ncomplexity of the database system architecture. In this paper, we present a new\napproach for identifying customers registered in an investment bank. This\napproach is developed as a tool that allows AML experts to quickly identify\ncustomers who are managed independently across separate databases. It is tested\non real-world datasets, which are real and large financial datasets.

The probability distribution is tilted because the electric field of the\nnucleus is no longer spherically symmetric. The hydrogen atom therefore cannot\nbe treated exactly in the same way as what it is in an inertial frame. We also\nfind that if the external force accelerates only the nucleus and then the\nnucleus accelerates its surrounding electrons through electromagnetic force,\nthe electrons can tunnel through the local energy gap and split the hydrogen\natom into an ion. This is similar to what one expects from the Stark effect.\nHowever, the critical acceleration is about $3\\times 10^{22} m/s^2$. It is well\nbeyond the gravitational acceleration on a regular star surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2016 01:28:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-14"}

As companies collect more and more data from daily operations,\nthey expect to extract useful knowledge from existing collected data to help\nmake reasonable decisions for new customer requests, e.g. user credit category,\nconfidence of expected return, etc. Banking and financial institutes have\napplied different data mining techniques to enhance their business performance.\nAmong these techniques, clustering has been considered as a significant method\nto capture the natural structure of data. However, there are not many studies\non clustering approaches for financial data analysis. In this paper, we\nevaluate different clustering algorithms for analysing different financial\ndatasets varied from time series to transactions.

The simplicity of this starting point leads to symmetries of\nmulti-dimensional forms of time, from which a geometrical structure can be\nderived which is similar to the framework employed in non-Abelian Kaluza-Klein\ntheories. This leads to a relationship between the external and internal\ncurvature on the spacetime manifold unified through the underlying constraint\nof the one dimension of time for the theory presented here. We also describe\nhow the symmetry breaking structure is compatible with the Coleman-Mandula\ntheorem for the subsequent quantisation of the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2016 15:34:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-17"}
