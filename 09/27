However both\nresults are restricted to the one-dimensional case.

Previous dust emission and molecular-line studies have speculated whether\nmagnetic fields could have played an important role in the formation of such\nlong-shaped structures, which are hosts to numerous young stellar sources. In\nthis work we have conducted a vast polarimetric survey at optical and\nnear-infrared wavelengths in order to study the morphology of magnetic field\nlines in IRDC G14.2 through the observation of background stars. The\norientation of interstellar polarization, which traces magnetic field lines, is\nperpendicular to most of the filamentary features within the cloud.\nAdditionally, the larger-scale molecular cloud as a whole exhibits an elongated\nshape also perpendicular to magnetic fields. Estimates of magnetic field\nstrengths indicate values in the range $320 - 550\\,\\mu$G, which allows\nsub-alfv\\'enic conditions, but does not prevent the gravitational collapse of\nhub-filament structures, which in general are close to the critical state.\nThese characteristics suggest that magnetic fields played the main role in\nregulating the collapse from large to small scales, leading to the formation of\nseries of parallel elongated structures. The morphology is also consistent with\nnumerical simulations that show how gravitational instabilities develop under\nstrong magnetic fields. Finally, the results corroborate the hypothesis that a\nstrong support from internal magnetic fields might explain why the cloud seems\nto be contracting on a time scale 2-3 times larger than what is expected from a\nfree-fall collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 16:30:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2016 16:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

In OAT, a laser is employed to\nilluminate the tissue of interest and acoustic signals are produced via the\nphotoacoustic effect. From these data, an estimate of the distribution of the\nabsorbed optical energy density within the tissue is reconstructed, referred to\nas the object function. This quantity is defined, in part, by the distribution\nof light fluence within the tissue that is established by the laser source.\nWhen performing three-dimensional imaging of large objects, such as a female\nhuman breast, it can be difficult to achieve a relatively uniform coverage of\nlight fluence within the volume of interest when the position of the laser\nsource is fixed. To circumvent this, researchers have proposed illumination\nschemes in which the relative position of the laser source and ultrasound probe\nis fixed, and both are rotated together to acquire a tomographic data set. A\nproblem with this rotating-illumination scheme is that the tomographic data are\ninconsistent; namely, the acoustic data recorded at each tomographic view angle\n(i.e., probe position) are produced by a distinct object function. In this\nwork, the impact of this data inconsistency on image reconstruction accuracy is\ninvestigated systematically. This is accomplished by use of computer-simulation\nstudies and application of mathematical results from the theory of microlocal\nanalysis. These studies specify the set of image discontinuities that can be\nstably reconstructed with a non-stationary optical illumination set-up. The\nstudy also includes a comparison of the ability of iterative and analytic image\nreconstruction methods to mitigate artifacts attributable to the data\ninconsistency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 16:49:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

Seebeck coefficients obtained from\ntheoretical calculations are in excellent agreement with those measured\nexperimentally between 100 and 600 K. From the calculation of the ratio\n$\\sigma$/$\\tau$ between the electronic conductivity and relaxation time, and\nthe experimental determination of electron conductivity, we extract the\nvariation of the scattering rate (1/$\\tau$) with temperature between 300 and\n600 K, which turns out to be almost linear, thus implying that the dominant\nelectron scattering mechanism in this temperature range is via phonons. The\nelectronic thermal conductivity, which deviates only slightly from the\nWiedemann-Franz law, provides the main contribution to thermal transport. The\nsmall lattice contribution to the thermal conductivity is calculated from the\nphonon structure and third-order force constants, and is only ~2\nWm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at 300 K (less than 10% of the total thermal conductivity),\nwhich is confirmed by experimental measurements. Overall, Ni$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ is\na poor thermoelectric material (ZT~0.01 at 300 K), principally due to the low\nabsolute value of the Seebeck coefficient. However, the understanding of its\ntransport properties will be useful for the rationalization of the\nthermoelectric behavior of other, more promising members of the shandite\nfamily.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 17:19:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

The study of patterns\nin inversion sequences was initiated recently by Mansour-Shattuck and\nCorteel-Martinez-Savage-Weselcouch through a systematic study of inversion\nsequences avoiding words of length 3. We continue this investigation by\ngeneralizing the notion of a pattern to a fixed triple of binary relations\n$(\\rho_1,\\rho_2,\\rho_3)$ and consider the set\n$\\mathbf{I}_n(\\rho_1,\\rho_2,\\rho_3)$ consisting of those $e \\in \\mathbf{I}_n$\nwith no $i < j < k$ such that $e_i \\rho_1 e_j$, $e_j \\rho_2 e_k$, and $e_i\n\\rho_3 e_k$. We show that \"avoiding a triple of relations\" can characterize\ninversion sequences with a variety of monotonicity or unimodality conditions,\nor with multiplicity constraints on the elements.

Existing work on offloading and\nsolving an LP on GPU suggests that performance is gained from large sized LPs\n(typically 500 constraints, 500 variables and above). In order to gain\nperformance from GPU for applications involving small to medium sized LPs, we\npropose batched solving of a large number of LPs in parallel. In this paper, we\npresent the design and CUDA implementation of our batched LP solver library,\nkeeping memory coalescent access, reduced CPU-GPU memory transfer latency and\nload balancing as the goals. The performance of the batched LP solver is\ncompared against sequential solving in the CPU using an open source solver GLPK\n(GNU Linear Programming Kit). The performance is evaluated for three types of\nLPs. The first type is the initial basic solution as feasible, the second type\nis the initial basic solution as infeasible and the third type is the feasible\nregion as a Hyperbox. For the first type, we show a maximum speedup of\n$18.3\\times$ when running a batch of $50k$ LPs of size $100$ ($100$ variables,\n$100$ constraints).

The basic idea is that if an observable quantity depends\nquadratically upon a quantum field, such as the electric field, then the\napplication of a classical field produces a cross term between the classical\nand quantum fields. This cross term may be significantly larger than the purely\nquantum part, but also undergoes fluctuations driven by the quantum field. We\nillustrate this effect in a model for lightcone fluctuations involving pulses\nin a nonlinear dielectric. Vacuum electric field fluctuations produce\nfluctuations in the speed of a probe pulse, and form an analog model for\nquantum gravity effects. If the material has a nonzero third-order\nsusceptibility, then the fractional light speed fluctuations are proportional\nto the square of the fluctuating electric field. Hence the application of a\nclassical electric field can enhance the speed fluctuations. We give an example\nwhere this enhancement can be an increase of one order of magnitude, increasing\nthe possibility of observing the effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 19:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

The act of measuring and removing the effect of lensing\nfrom CMB maps, or delensing, has been well studied in the context of $B$ modes,\nbut little attention has been given to the delensing of the temperature and $E$\nmodes. In this paper, we model the expected delensed $T$ and $E$ power spectra\nto all orders in the lensing potential, demonstrating the sharpening of the\nacoustic peaks and a significant reduction in lens-induced power spectrum\ncovariances. We then perform cosmological forecasts, demonstrating that\ndelensing will yield improved sensitivity to parameters with upcoming surveys.\nWe highlight the breaking of the degeneracy between the effective number of\nneutrino species and primordial helium fraction as a concrete application. We\nalso show that delensing increases cosmological information as long as the\nmeasured lensing reconstruction is included in the analysis. We conclude that\nwith future data, delensing will be crucial not only for primordial $B$-mode\nscience but for a range of other observables as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 19:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-20"}

Unfortunately, NMT systems are\nknown to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation\ninference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues\nhave hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both\naccuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's\nNeural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these\nissues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder\nlayers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and\ntherefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom\nlayer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final\ntranslation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference\ncomputations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited\nset of common sub-word units (\"wordpieces\") for both input and output. This\nmethod provides a good balance between the flexibility of \"character\"-delimited\nmodels and the efficiency of \"word\"-delimited models, naturally handles\ntranslation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the\nsystem. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and\nuses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that\nis most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. On the WMT'14\nEnglish-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive\nresults to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of\nisolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60%\ncompared to Google's phrase-based production system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 19:59:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2016 19:10:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-11"}

Both show excess emission at early times and a slowly\ndeclining light curve at late times. The early bump in PTF12dam is very similar\nin duration (~10 days) and brightness relative to the main peak (2-3 mag\nfainter) compared to those observed in other SLSNe-I. In contrast, the\nlong-duration (>30 days) early excess emission in iPTF13dcc, whose brightness\ncompetes with that of the main peak, appears to be of a different nature. We\nconstruct bolometric light curves for both targets, and fit a variety of\nlight-curve models to both the early bump and main peak in an attempt to\nunderstand the nature of these explosions. Even though the slope of the\nlate-time light-curve decline in both SLSNe is suggestively close to that\nexpected from the radioactive decay of $^{56}$Ni and $^{56}$Co, the amount of\nnickel required to power the full light curves is too large considering the\nestimated ejecta mass. The magnetar model including an increasing escape\nfraction provides a reasonable description of the PTF12dam observations.\nHowever, neither the basic nor the double-peaked magnetar model is capable of\nreproducing the iPTF13dcc light curve. A model combining a shock breakout in an\nextended envelope with late-time magnetar energy injection provides a\nreasonable fit to the iPTF13dcc observations. Finally, we find that the light\ncurves of both PTF12dam and iPTF13dcc can be adequately fit with the\ncircumstellar medium (CSM) interaction model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 19:59:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Oct 2016 09:35:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 19:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

(2006) consists of two main parts: a direct\nnumerical simulation (DNS) of a turbulent plane channel flow with streamwise\nrotation and a preceding Lie-group symmetry analysis on the two-point\ncorrelation equation (TPC) to analytically predict the scaling of the mean\nvelocity profiles for different rotation rates. We will only comment on the\nlatter part, since the DNS result obtained in the former part has already been\ncommented on by Recktenwald et al. (2009), stating that the observed mismatch\nbetween DNS and their performed experiment is possibly due to the prescription\nof periodic boundary conditions on a too small computational domain in the\nspanwise direction. By revisiting the group analysis part in Oberlack et al.\n(2006), we will generate more natural scaling laws describing better the mean\nvelocity profiles than the ones proposed. However, due to the statistical\nclosure problem of turbulence, this improvement is illusive. As we will\ndemonstrate, any arbitrary invariant scaling law for the mean velocity profiles\ncan be generated consistent to any higher order in the velocity correlations.\nThis problem of arbitrariness in invariant scaling persists even if we would\nformally consider the infinite statistical hierarchy of all multi-point\ncorrelation equations. The closure problem of turbulence simply cannot be\ncircumvented by just employing the method of Lie-group symmetry analysis alone:\nas the statistical equations are unclosed, so are their symmetries! Hence, an a\npriori prediction as how turbulence scales is thus not possible. Only a\nposteriori by anticipating what to expect from numerical or experimental data\nthe adequate invariant scaling law can be generated through an iterative\ntrial-and-error process. Finally, apart from this issue, also several\ninconsistencies and incorrect statements to be found in Oberlack et al.

Often, it suffices\nto sample these matrices from a unitary t-design, for sufficiently high t. This\nresults in more explicit, derandomized constructions. The most prominent\nunitary t-design considered in quantum information is the multi-qubit Clifford\ngroup. It is known to be a unitary 3-design, but, unfortunately, not a\n4-design.

When the wind-driven circulation is the\ndominant CO2 exchange mechanism, an atmosphere of tens of bars of CO2 results,\nwhere the exact value depends on the subtropical ocean surface temperature and\nthe deep ocean temperature. When sea-ice formation, acting on these planets as\na CO2 deposition mechanism, is the dominant exchange mechanism, an atmosphere\nof a few bars of CO2 is established. The exact value depends on the subpolar\nsurface temperature. Our results suggest the possibility of a negative feedback\nmechanism, unique to water planets, where a reduction in the subpolar\ntemperature drives more CO2 into the atmosphere to increase the greenhouse\neffect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 20:47:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-01"}

The TCP connections of a typical client application, however,\nare often accompanied by DNS requests and responses. This additional traffic\npresents more opportunities for correlation attacks. This paper quantifies how\nDNS traffic can make Tor users more vulnerable to correlation attacks. We\ninvestigate how incorporating DNS traffic can make existing correlation attacks\nmore powerful and how DNS lookups can leak information to third parties about\nanonymous communication. We (i) develop a method to identify the DNS resolvers\nof Tor exit relays; (ii) develop a new set of correlation attacks (DefecTor\nattacks) that incorporate DNS traffic to improve precision; (iii) analyze the\nInternet-scale effects of these new attacks on Tor users; and (iv) develop\nimproved methods to evaluate correlation attacks. First, we find that there\nexist adversaries who can mount DefecTor attacks: for example, Google's DNS\nresolver observes almost 40% of all DNS requests exiting the Tor network. We\nalso find that DNS requests often traverse ASes that the corresponding TCP\nconnections do not transit, enabling additional ASes to gain information about\nTor users' traffic. We then show that an adversary who can mount a DefecTor\nattack can often determine the website that a Tor user is visiting with perfect\nprecision, particularly for less popular websites where the set of DNS names\nassociated with that website may be unique to the site. We also use the Tor\nPath Simulator (TorPS) in combination with traceroute data from vantage points\nco-located with Tor exit relays to estimate the power of AS-level adversaries\nwho might mount DefecTor attacks in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 20:50:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 21:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-13"}

Up to a full $360^{\\circ}$\nrotation is possible for varied ac amplitudes or skyrmion densities. In\ncontrast to overdamped systems, in which ratchet motion is always parallel to\nthe substrate asymmetry direction, vector ratchets allow the ratchet motion to\nbe in any direction relative to the substrate asymmetry. It is also possible to\nobtain a reversal in the direction of rotation of the vector ratchet,\npermitting the creation of a reversible vector ratchet. We examine vector\nratchets for ac drives applied parallel or perpendicular to the substrate\nasymmetry direction, and show that reverse ratchet motion can be produced by\ncollective effects. No reversals occur for an isolated skyrmion on an\nasymmetric substrate. Since a vector ratchet can produce motion in any\ndirection, it could represent a new method for controlling skyrmion motion for\nspintronic applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 22:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

In this paper we develop two methods to measure aortic valve\nopening (AVO) and closing (AVC) from distal vibrations. Methods: AVO and AVC\nwere detected for each heartbeat with accelerometers on the upper arm (A),\nwrist (W), and knee (K) of 22 consenting adults following isometric exercise.\nExercise-induced changes were recorded with impedance cardiography, and\nnine-beat ensemble averaging was applied. Our first method, FilterBCG, detects\npeaks in distal vibrations after filtering with individually-tuned bandpass\nfilters while RidgeBCG uses ridge regression to estimate AVO and AVC without\npeaks. Pseudocode is provided. Results: In agreement with recent studies, we\ndid not find peaks at AVO and AVC in distal vibrations, and the conventional\nR-J interval method from the literature also correlated poorly with AVO (r2 =\n0.22 A, 0.14 W, 0.12 K). Interestingly, distal vibrations filtered with\nFilterBCG resembled seismocardiogram signals and yielded reliable peaks at AVO\n(r2 = 0.95 A, 0.94 W, 0.77 K) and AVC (r2 = 0.92 A, 0.89 W, 0.68 K).\nConclusion: FilterBCG measures AVO and AVC accurately from arm, wrist, and knee\nvibrations, and it outperforms R-J intervals and RidgeBCG. Significance: To our\nknowledge, this study is the first to measure AVC accurately from distal\nvibrations. Finally, AVO timing is needed to assess cardiovascular disease risk\nwith pulse wave velocity (PWV) and for cuff-less diastolic blood pressure\nmeasurement via aortic pulse-transit time (PTT).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 22:10:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

A common assumption is that the numbers are\ndescribed by the Poisson distribution. In contrast to the one-parameter Poisson\ndistribution, the negative-binomial distribution (NBD) has two parameters. The\nsecond parameter characterizes the clustering or over-dispersion of a process.\nWe investigate the dependence of parameters for both distributions on the\ncatalog magnitude threshold and on temporal subdivision of catalog duration. We\nfind that for most cases of interest the Poisson distribution can be rejected\nstatistically at a high significance level in favor of the NBD. Therefore we\ninvestigate whether these distributions fit the observed distributions of\nseismicity. For this purpose we study upper statistical moments of earthquake\nnumbers (skewness and kurtosis) and compare them to the theoretical values for\nboth distributions. Empirical values for the skewness and the kurtosis increase\nfor the smaller magnitude threshold and increase with even greater intensity\nfor small temporal subdivision of catalogs. A calculation of the NBD skewness\nand kurtosis levels shows rapid increase of these upper moments levels.\nHowever, the observed catalog values of skewness and kurtosis are rising even\nfaster. This means that for small time intervals the earthquake number\ndistribution is even more heavy-tailed than the NBD predicts.

Just like the Dirac\nequation, the LLE's possess a natural supersymmetry.

In this paper we show that, for a certain\nclass of supersymmetric PDE's, a natural ${\\mathbb Z}_2\\times{\\mathbb\nZ}_2$-graded Lie symmetry appears. In particular, we exhaustively investigate\nthe symmetries of the $(1+1)$-dimensional L\\'evy-Leblond Equations, both in the\nfree case and for the harmonic potential. In the free case a ${\\mathbb\nZ}_2\\times{\\mathbb Z}_2$-graded Lie superalgebra, realized by first and\nsecond-order differential symmetry operators, is found. In the presence of a\nnon-vanishing quadratic potential, the Schr\\\"odinger invariance is maintained,\nwhile the ${\\mathbb Z}_2$- and ${\\mathbb Z}_2\\times{\\mathbb Z}_2$- graded\nextensions are no longer allowed.

Low delays enable improved information flow\nin social networks, quick spread of ideas in collaboration networks, low travel\ntimes for vehicles on road networks and increased rate of packets in the case\nof communication networks. Delay reduction can be achieved by both improving\nthe propagation capabilities of individual nodes and adding additional edges in\nthe network. One of the main challenges in such design problems is that the\neffects of local changes are not independent, and as a consequence, there is a\ncombinatorial search-space of possible improvements. Thus, minimizing the\ncumulative propagation delay requires novel scalable and data-driven\napproaches.\n  In this paper, we consider the problem of network delay minimization via node\nupgrades.

Relevant issues to address in this context include the sheer volume\nof data that may consist of categorical samples, the typically streaming format\nof acquisition, and the possibly missing entries. To cope with these\nchallenges, the present paper develops a novel categorical subspace learning\napproach to unravel the latent structure for three prominent categorical\n(bilinear) models, namely, Probit, Tobit, and Logit. The deterministic Probit\nand Tobit models treat data as quantized values of an analog-valued process\nlying in a low-dimensional subspace, while the probabilistic Logit model relies\non low dimensionality of the data log-likelihood ratios. Leveraging the low\nintrinsic dimensionality of the sought models, a rank regularized\nmaximum-likelihood estimator is devised, which is then solved recursively via\nalternating majorization-minimization to sketch high-dimensional categorical\ndata `on the fly.' The resultant procedure alternates between sketching the new\nincomplete datum and refining the latent subspace, leading to lightweight\nfirst-order algorithms with highly parallelizable tasks per iteration. As an\nextra degree of freedom, the quantization thresholds are also learned jointly\nalong with the subspace to enhance the predictive power of the sought models.\nPerformance of the subspace iterates is analyzed for both infinite and finite\ndata streams, where for the former asymptotic convergence to the stationary\npoint set of the batch estimator is established, while for the latter sublinear\nregret bounds are derived for the empirical cost. Simulated tests with both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets corroborate the merits of the novel schemes\nfor real-time movie recommendation and chess-game classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2016 01:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

In this context we use a Fisher Matrix formalism to investigate the\nstatistical benefits of combining multiple peculiar velocity surveys. We find\nthat for all cases we consider there is a marked improvement on constraints on\nthe linear growth rate $f\\sigma_{8}$. For example, the constraining power of\nonly a few peculiar velocity measurements is such that the addition of the\n2MASS Tully-Fisher survey (containing only $\\sim2,000$ galaxies) to the full\nredshift and peculiar velocity samples of the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey\n(containing $\\sim 110,000$ redshifts and $\\sim 9,000$ velocities) can improve\ngrowth rate constraints by $\\sim20\\%$.

We give an answer based on a two-dimensional\nrepresentation of diseases. These two dimensions are defined as follows. In\nmortality curves there is an age, namely a_c = 10 years, which plays a crucial\nrole in the sense that the mortality rate decreases in the interval I1=(a<a_c)\nand increases in the interval I2=(a>a_c). The respective trends in I1 and I2\nare the two parameters used in our classification of diseases. Within the\nframework of reliability analysis, I1 and I2 would be referred to as the\n\"burn-in\" and \"wear-out\" phases. This leads to define three broad groups of\ndiseases. (AS1) Asymmetry with prevalence of I1. (AS2) Asymmetry with\nprevalence of I2. (S) Symmetry, with I1 and I2 both playing roles of comparable\nimportance. Not surprisingly, among AS1-cases one finds all diseases due to\ncongenital malformations. In the AS2-class one finds degenerative diseases,\ne.g. Alzheimer's disease. Among S-cases one finds most diseases due to external\npathogens or to wear-out processes. Cancer is one of those mixed cases and it\nis closer to (AS2) than to (AS1). This representation also explains what we\ncall an OVERKILL EFFECT in old age. It tells us that even an effective cancer\ntherapy would have no influence whatsoever on the extent of human life unless\nALL other diseases are cured simultaneously. We conclude that whilst one might\ndevelop a cure for many of the known diseases of old age, new diseases will\narise and the quest for the ultimate cure will be never ending. Death before\nthe age of 120 seems firmly written in our genetic code and the best we shall\nbe able to do is to help people cope with the inevitability of death as and\nwhen it arises.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2016 07:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

However, it is nontrivial due to the following\nchallenges. First, there are too many instances or the feature dimensionality\nis too large. Thus, the data may not fit in memory. How to select useful\nfeatures with limited memory space? Second, how to select features from\nstreaming data and handles the concept drift? Third, how to leverage the\nconsistent and complementary information from different views to improve the\nfeature selection in the situation when the data are too big or come in as\nstreams? To the best of our knowledge, none of the previous works can solve all\nthe challenges simultaneously.

OMVFS embeds unsupervised feature\nselection into a clustering algorithm via NMF with sparse learning. It further\nincorporates the graph regularization to preserve the local structure\ninformation and help select discriminative features. Instead of storing all the\nhistorical data, OMVFS processes the multi-view data chunk by chunk and\naggregates all the necessary information into several small matrices. By using\nthe buffering technique, the proposed OMVFS can reduce the computational and\nstorage cost while taking advantage of the structure information. Furthermore,\nOMVFS can capture the concept drifts in the data streams. Extensive experiments\non four real-world datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of the\nproposed OMVFS method. More importantly, OMVFS is about 100 times faster than\nthe off-line methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2016 07:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

We then apply the shift-and-add technique to disentangle the\nspectra and obtain spectra compatible with a WN7ha and an O4-6 star.\nConsidering an orbital inclination of $\\sim67^\\circ$, derived from previous\npolarimetry observations, the system's total mass would be a mere 2-3\nM$_{\\odot}$ , an unprecedented result for a putative massive binary system.\nHowever, a system comprising a 37 M$_{\\odot}$ secondary (typical mass of an O5V\nstar) and a 33 M$_{\\odot}$ primary (given the mass ratio) would infer an\ninclination of $\\sim18^\\circ$.

Conventional analysis on these optimization algorithms\nfocuses on their convergence rates during the training process, however, people\nin the machine learning community may care more about the generalization\nperformance of the learned model on unseen test data. In this paper, we\ninvestigate on this issue, by using stability as a tool. In particular, we\ndecompose the generalization error for R-ERM, and derive its upper bound for\nboth convex and non-convex cases. In convex cases, we prove that the\ngeneralization error can be bounded by the convergence rate of the optimization\nalgorithm and the stability of the R-ERM process, both in expectation (in the\norder of $\\mathcal{O}((1/n)+\\mathbb{E}\\rho(T))$, where $\\rho(T)$ is the\nconvergence error and $T$ is the number of iterations) and in high probability\n(in the order of\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{\\log{1/\\delta}}{\\sqrt{n}}+\\rho(T)\\right)$ with\nprobability $1-\\delta$).

Recently a new line of research has emerged, dealing with\nnonlinear eigenfunctions induced by convex functionals. This has provided new\ninsights and better theoretical understanding of convex regularization and\nintroduced new processing methods. However, the theory of nonlinear eigenvalue\nproblems is still at its infancy. We present a new flow that can generate\nnonlinear eigenfunctions of the form $T(u)=\\lambda u$, where $T(u)$ is a\nnonlinear operator and $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R} $ is the eigenvalue. We develop\nthe theory where $T(u)$ is a subgradient element of a regularizing\none-homogeneous functional, such as total-variation (TV) or\ntotal-generalized-variation (TGV). We introduce two flows: a forward flow and\nan inverse flow; for which the steady state solution is a nonlinear\neigenfunction. The forward flow monotonically smooths the solution (with\nrespect to the regularizer) and simultaneously increases the $L^2$ norm. The\ninverse flow has the opposite characteristics. For both flows, the steady state\ndepends on the initial condition, thus different initial conditions yield\ndifferent eigenfunctions. This enables a deeper investigation into the space of\nnonlinear eigenfunctions, allowing to produce numerically diverse examples,\nwhich may be unknown yet. In addition we suggest an indicator to measure the\naffinity of a function to an eigenfunction and relate it to\npseudo-eigenfunctions in the linear case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2016 13:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

We describe two natural\n$\\lambda$-structures on it which lead to the same power structure. We show that\nthis power structure is effective. In the terms of this power structure we\nwrite some equations containing classes of Hilbert-Chow morphisms. We describe\nsome generalizations of this construction for maps of varieties with some\nadditional structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Sep 2016 14:03:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 May 2017 12:37:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-19"}

We show that energy is\ndissipated at the edge of a circumbinary disc and this is associated with the\ntidal torque that maintains the cavity: angular momentum is transferred from\nthe binary to the disc through the action of compressional shocks and viscous\nfriction. These shocks can be viewed as being produced by fluid elements which\ndrift into the cavity and, before being accreted, are accelerated onto\ntrajectories that send them back to impact the disc. The rate of energy\ndissipation is approximately equal to the product of potential energy per unit\nmass at the disc's inner edge and the accretion rate, estimated from the disc\nparameters just beyond the cavity edge, that would occur without the binary.\nFor very thin discs, the actual accretion rate onto the binary may be\nsignificantly less. We calculate the energy emitted by a circumbinary disc\ntaking into account energy dissipation at the inner edge and also irradiation\narising there from reprocessing of light from the stars.

If $W$ is the Weyl group of type $B_n$ or $D_n$, we explicitly\ndescribe a finite set of basic braid $I_\\ast$-transformations for all $n$\nsimultaneously, and show that any two reduced $I_\\ast$-expressions for a given\ninvolution can be transformed into each other through a series of basic braid\n$I_\\ast$-transformations. In both cases, these basic braid\n$I_\\ast$-transformations consist of the usual basic braid transformations plus\nsome natural \"right end transformations\" and plus exactly one extra\ntransformation.

This\npaper proposes two constraint handling approaches for an emerging metaheuristic\nof Cohort Intelligence (CI). More specifically CI with static penalty function\napproach (SCI) and CI with dynamic penalty function approach (DCI) are\nproposed. The approaches have been tested by solving several constrained test\nproblems. The performance of the SCI and DCI have been compared with algorithms\nlike GA, PSO, ABC, d-Ds. In addition, as well as three real world problems from\nmechanical engineering domain with improved solutions. The results were\nsatisfactory and validated the applicability of CI methodology for solving real\nworld problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 16:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-20"}

The spectral decomposition of the shift\noperator plays an important role in that the eigenvalues represent frequencies\nand the eigenvectors provide a spectral basis. This is useful, for example, in\nthe design of filters. However, the graph or network may be uncertain due to\nstochastic influences in construction and maintenance, and, under such\nconditions, the eigenvalues of the shift matrix become random variables. This\npaper examines the spectral distribution of the eigenvalues of random networks\nformed by including each link of a D-dimensional lattice supergraph\nindependently with identical probability, a percolation model. Using the\nstochastic canonical equation methods developed by Girko for symmetric matrices\nwith independent upper triangular entries, a deterministic distribution is\nfound that asymptotically approximates the empirical spectral distribution of\nthe scaled adjacency matrix for a model with arbitrary parameters. The main\nresults characterize the form of the solution to an important system of\nequations that leads to this deterministic distribution function and\nsignificantly reduce the number of equations that must be solved to find the\nsolution for a given set of model parameters. Simulations comparing the\nexpected empirical spectral distributions and the computed deterministic\ndistributions are provided for sample parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 16:18:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}
