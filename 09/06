Although the fractures are small, the high\ninjection rate and low viscosity of the water, lead to high Reynolds numbers\nand potentially turbulence in the fracture. Here we present a semi-analytical\nsolution for a blade-shaped (PKN) geometry hydraulic fracture driven by a\nturbulent fluid in the limit of zero fluid leak-off to the formation. We model\nthe turbulence in the PKN fracture using the Gaukler-Manning-Strickler\nparametrization, which relates the the flow rate of the water to the pressure\ngradient along the fracture. The key parameter in this relation is the\nDarcy-Weisbach friction factor for the roughness of the crack wall. Coupling\nthis turbulence parametrization with conservation of mass allows us to write a\nnonlinear pde for the crack width as a function of space and time. By way of a\nsimilarity ansatz, we obtain a semi-analytical solution using an orthogonal\npolynomial series. Embedding the asymptotic behavior near the fracture tip into\nthe polynomial series, we find very rapid convergence: a suitably accurate\nsolution is obtained with two terms of the series. This closed-form solution\nfacilitates clear comparisons between the results and parameters for laminar\nand turbulent hydraulic fractures. In particular, it resolves one of the well\nknown problems whereby calibration of models to data has difficulty\nsimultaneously matching the hydraulic fracture length and wellbore pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2016 17:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

The model consists of a finite collection of modes that\ncan be occupied by N particles, either bosons or fermions. Measurement\nscenarios allow one to measure occupation of each mode in at least two\ndifferent measurement contexts. The system is said to be non-contextual if the\noccupation numbers can be assigned to modes in each measurement scenario. The\nassignment is done under the non-contextuality assumption, i.e., an occupation\nnumber assigned to a mode does not depend on a scenario in which this mode is\nmeasured. In addition, the total number of particles has to be conserved,\ntherefore the sum of occupation numbers in each measurement context is equal to\nN. For N=1 the model does not differ from the standard contextuality scenario.\nHowever, for N>1 the problem reveals new complex features. In particular, it is\nshown that a type of contextuality exhibited by the system (state-dependent,\nstate-independent, or non-contextual) depends on the type and the number of\nparticles. Further properties of this model and open problems are also\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2016 18:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

In smooth and static\nhost potentials, tidal tails of disrupting satellites appear highly symmetric.\nHowever, perturbations from dark subhaloes, as well as from GMCs and the Milky\nWay bar, can induce density fluctuations that destroy this symmetry. Motivated\nby the recent release of unprecedentedly deep and wide imaging data around the\nPal~5 stellar stream, we develop a new probabilistic, adaptive and\nnon-parametric technique which allows us to bring the cluster's tidal tails\ninto clear focus. Strikingly, we uncover a stream whose density exhibits\nvisible changes on a variety of angular scales.

State-of-the-art techniques rely\non optimised sequential scans or tree-based structures. For range queries with\nsmall result sets, sequential scans exhibit poor asymptotic performance. Also,\nas the dimensionality of the data set increases, the performance of tree-based\nstructures degenerates due to the curse of dimensionality. Recent literature\nproposed the Elf, a main-memory structure that is optimised for the case of\nsuch multi-dimensional low-selectivity queries. The Elf outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art methods in manually tuned scenarios. However, choosing an\noptimal parameter configuration for the Elf is vital, since for poor\nconfigurations, the search performance degrades rapidly. Consequently, further\nknowledge about the behaviour of the Elf in different configurations is\nrequired to achieve robust performance. In this thesis, we therefore propose a\nnumerical cost model for the Elf.

Since no separation of variables is known (or expected) for\ngeodesic motion on these backgrounds, we examine the 2D effective potentials\nfor photon trajectories, to obtain a deeper understanding of this phenomenon.\nWe find that the emergence of stable light rings on the background spacetimes,\nallows the formation of \"pockets\" in one of the effective potentials, for open\nsets of impact parameters, leading to an effective trapping of some\ntrajectories, dubbed quasi-bound orbits. We conclude that pocket formation\ninduces chaotic scattering, although not all chaotic orbits are associated to\npockets. These and other features are illustrated in a gallery of examples,\nobtained with a new ray-tracing code, PYHOLE, which includes tools for a\nsimple, simultaneous visualization of the effective potential together with the\nspacetime trajectory, for any given point in a lensing image. An analysis of\nphoton orbits allows us to further establish a positive correlation between\nphoton orbits in chaotic regions and those with more than one turning point in\nthe radial direction; we recall that the latter is not possible around Kerr\nblack holes. Moreover, we observe that the existence of several light rings\naround a horizon (several fundamental orbits, including a stable one), is a\ncentral ingredient for the existence of multiple shadows of a single hairy\nblack hole. We also exhibit the lensing and shadows by Kerr black holes with\nscalar hair, observed away from the equatorial plane, obtained with PYHOLE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2016 22:12:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

However, the situation is less understood in\ninteracting theories, especially on time scales longer than the dynamical\nrelaxation time. Recently there have been claims that the quantum theory\ndeviates spectacularly from the classical theory on this time scale, even if\nthe occupancy numbers are extremely large. Furthermore, it is claimed that the\nquantum theory quickly thermalizes while the classical theory does not. The\nevidence for these claims comes from noticing a spectacular difference in the\ntime evolution of expectation values of quantum operators compared to the\nclassical micro-state evolution. If true, this would have dramatic consequences\nfor many important phenomena, including laboratory studies of interacting BECs,\ndark matter axions, preheating after inflation, etc. In this work we critically\nexamine these claims. We show that in fact the classical theory can describe\nthe quantum behavior in the high occupancy regime, even when interactions are\nlarge. The connection is that the expectation values of quantum operators in a\nsingle quantum micro-state are approximated by a corresponding classical\nensemble average over many classical micro-states. Furthermore, by the ergodic\ntheorem, a classical ensemble average of local fields with statistical\ntranslation invariance is the spatial average of a single micro-state. So the\ncorrelation functions of the quantum and classical field theories of a single\nmicro-state approximately agree at high occupancy, even in interacting systems.\nFurthermore, both quantum and classical field theories can thermalize, when\nappropriate coarse graining is introduced, with the classical case requiring a\ncutoff on low occupancy UV modes.

In a\nVirtual Reality environment that employs camera sensors to recognize human\nactivities, we have to know when user intends to perform an action and when\nnot. Without a proper algorithm for recognizing engagement status, any kind of\nactivities could be interpreted as manipulating actions, called \"Midas Touch\"\nproblem. Baseline approach for solving this problem is activating gesture\nrecognition system using some focus gestures such as waiving or raising hand.\nHowever, a desirable natural user interface should be able to understand user's\nmental status automatically. In this paper, a novel multi-modal model for\nengagement detection, DAIA, is presented. using DAIA, the spectrum of mental\nstatus for performing an action is quantized in a finite number of engagement\nstates. For this purpose, a Finite State Transducer (FST) is designed. This\nengagement framework shows how to integrate multi-modal information from user\nbiometric data streams such as 2D and 3D imaging. FST is employed to make the\nstate transition smoothly using combination of several boolean expressions. Our\nFST true detection rate is 92.3% in total for four different states.

An explicit construction of Henriques\nproduces certain Lie $\\infty$-groupoids called `Lie $\\infty$-groups' by\nintegrating finite type Lie $n$-algebras. In order to study the compatibility\nbetween this integration procedure and the homotopy theory of Lie $n$-algebras\nintroduced in the companion paper arXiv:1809.05999, we present a homotopy\ntheory for Lie $\\infty$-groupoids. Unlike Kan simplicial sets and the higher\ngeometric groupoids of Behrend and Getzler, Lie $\\infty$-groupoids do not form\na category of fibrant objects (CFO), since the category of manifolds lacks\npullbacks. Instead, we show that Lie $\\infty$-groupoids form an `incomplete\ncategory of fibrant objects' in which the weak equivalences correspond to\n`stalkwise' weak equivalences of simplicial sheaves. This homotopical structure\nenjoys many of the same properties as a CFO, such as having, in the presence of\nfunctorial path objects, a convenient realization of its simplicial\nlocalization. We further prove that the acyclic fibrations are precisely the\nhypercovers, which implies that many of Behrend and Getzler's results also hold\nin this more general context. As an application, we show that Henriques'\nintegration functor is an exact functor with respect to a class of\ndistinguished fibrations which we call `quasi-split fibrations'. Such\nfibrations include acyclic fibrations as well as fibrations that arise in\nstring-like extensions. In particular, integration sends $L_\\infty$\nquasi-isomorphisms to weak equivalences, quasi-split fibrations to Kan\nfibrations, and preserves acyclic fibrations, as well as pullbacks of\nacyclic/quasi-split fibrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 05:02:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2017 09:11:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2018 05:09:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 01:23:42 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 2019 10:48:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

Its\nexpectation value contains information of the pressure and the energy density\nas its diagonal part. Further properties like viscosity and specific heat can\nbe extracted from its correlation function. Recently a new method based on the\ngradient flow was introduced to calculate the energy-momentum tensor on the\nlattice, and has been successfully applied to quenched QCD.\n  In this paper, we apply the gradient flow method to calculate the\nenergy-momentum tensor in (2+1)-flavor QCD.

Performing simulations on lattices with Nt=16 to 4, the\ntemperature range of T=174-697 MeV is covered. We find that the results of the\npressure and the energy density by the gradient flow method are consistent with\nthe previous results using the T-integration method at T<280 MeV, while the\nresults show disagreement at T>350 MeV (Nt<8), presumably due to the small-Nt\nlattice artifact of $O((aT)^2)=O(1/N_t^2)$.\n  We also apply the gradient flow method to evaluate the chiral condensate\ntaking advantage of the gradient flow method that renormalized quantities can\nbe directly computed avoiding the difficulty of explicit chiral violation with\nlattice quarks.

To capture the nonequilibrium irreversible nature of\nturbulence and investigate its implications, we develop a potential landscape\nand flux field theory for turbulent flow and more general nonequilibrium fluid\nsystems governed by stochastic Navier-Stokes equations. We find that\nequilibrium fluid systems with time reversibility are characterized by a\ndetailed balance constraint that quantifies the detailed balance condition. In\nnonequilibrium fluid systems with nonequilibrium steady states, detailed\nbalance breaking leads directly to a pair of interconnected consequences,\nnamely, the non-Gaussian potential landscape and the irreversible probability\nflux, forming a 'nonequilibrium trinity'. The nonequilibrium trinity\ncharacterizes the nonequilibrium irreversible essence of fluid systems with\nintrinsic time irreversibility and is manifested in various aspects of these\nsystems. The nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics of fluid systems including\nturbulence with detailed balance breaking is shown to be driven by both the\nnon-Gaussian potential landscape gradient and the irreversible probability\nflux, together with the reversible convective force and the stochastic stirring\nforce. We reveal an underlying connection of the energy flux essential for\nturbulence energy cascade to the irreversible probability flux and the\nnon-Gaussian potential landscape generated by detailed balance breaking. Using\nthe energy flux as a center of connection, we demonstrate that the four-fifths\nlaw in fully developed turbulence is a consequence and reflection of the\nnonequilibrium trinity.

However, the\nlocations and mechanisms of such particle acceleration during the flare and\neruption are still subject to much investigation. Observing the exact sites of\nparticle acceleration can help confirm how the flare and eruption are initiated\nand how they evolve. Here we use the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly to analyse a\nflare and erupting flux rope on 2014-April-18, while observations from the\nNancay Radio Astronomy Facility allows us to diagnose the sites of electron\nacceleration during the eruption. Our analysis shows evidence for a pre-formed\nflux rope which slowly rises and becomes destabilised at the time of a C-class\nflare, plasma jet and the escape of >75 keV electrons from rope center into the\ncorona. As the eruption proceeds, continued acceleration of electrons with\nenergies of ~5 keV occurs above the flux rope for a period over 5 minutes. At\nflare peak, one site of electron acceleration is located close to the flare\nsite while another is driven by the erupting flux rope into the corona at\nspeeds of up to 400 km/s. Energetic electrons then fill the erupting volume,\neventually allowing the flux rope legs to be clearly imaged from radio sources\nat 150-445MHz. Following the analysis of Joshi et al. (2015), we conclude that\nthe sites of energetic electrons are consistent with flux rope eruption via a\ntether-cutting or flux cancellation scenario inside a magnetic fan-spine\nstructure. In total, our radio observations allow us to better understand the\nevolution of a flux rope eruption and its associated electron acceleration\nsites, from eruption initiation to propagation into the corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 09:52:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

It is also one of the main\ncharacteristics distinguishing quantum and classical phenomena. In condensed\nmatter physics, in particular, scattering mechanisms, loss of quantum\ninformation, or breakdown of topological protection are deeply rooted in the\nintricate details of how and where the dissipation occurs. Despite its vital\nimportance the microscopic behavior of a system is usually not formulated in\nterms of dissipation because the latter is not a readily measureable quantity\non the microscale. Although nanoscale thermometry is gaining much recent\ninterest, the existing thermal imaging methods lack the necessary sensitivity\nand are unsuitable for low temperature operation required for study of quantum\nsystems.

While\nsuch a generalization seems rather natural, from a structural perspective there\nis a significant gap between the two concepts. Nice analytical features of\nJackson networks, such as stability conditions, product-form equilibrium\ndistributions, and stochastic monotonicity do not immediately carry over to the\nmulti-class framework. The aim of this paper is to shed some light on this\nstructural gap, focusing on monotonicity properties. To this end, we introduce\nand study a class of Markov processes, which we call \\emph{Q-processes},\nmodeling the time evolution of the network configuration of any open,\nwork-conservative McQN having exponential service times and {Poisson input}. We\ndefine a new monotonicity notion tailored for this class of processes. Our main\nresult is that we show monotonicity for a large class of McQN models, covering\nvirtually all instances of practical interest.

It has been argued that this is an\nanalogue for quantum processes in the presence of closed timelike curves\n(CTCs). The unusual properties of states of quantum communication networks that\nfulfill the D-CTC condition have been discussed extensively in recent\nliterature. In this work, the D-CTC condition is investigated in the framework\nof quantum field theory in the local, operator-algebraic approach due to Haag\nand Kastler. It is shown that the D-CTC condition cannot be fulfilled in states\nwhich are analytic for the energy, or satisfy the Reeh-Schlieder property, for\na certain class of processes and initial conditions. On the other hand, if a\nquantum field theory admits sufficiently many uncorrelated states across\nacausally related spacetime regions (as implied by the split property), then\nthe D-CTC condition can always be fulfilled approximately to arbitrary\nprecision. As this result pertains to quantum field theory on globally\nhyperbolic spacetimes where CTCs are absent, one may conclude that interpreting\nthe D-CTC condition as characteristic for quantum processes in the presence of\nCTCs could be misleading, and should be regarded with caution.

We show that the shape of the permanent flow is entirely determined by\nthe mass ratio, the filling factor, the Eddington factor and the $\\alpha$-force\nmultiplier which drives the stellar wind acceleration.

The value $p(\\ell)$ is computed from\nthe density of the language within $\\{0,1\\}^\\ell$ divided by the total word\ncount $2^\\ell$. It corresponds to the probability of retrieving a yes-instance\nof a decision problem upon a uniformly random draw from $\\{0,1\\}^\\ell$.

Anderson and Weber considered the symmetric rendezvous problem,\nwhere both parties must use the same randomized strategy. They analyzed\nstrategies where the parties repeatedly play the optimal asymmetric strategy,\ndetermining their role independently each time by a biased coin-flip. By tuning\nthe bias, Anderson and Weber achieved an expected meeting time of about $0.829\nn$, which they conjectured to be asymptotically optimal.\n  We change perspective slightly: instead of minimizing the expected meeting\ntime, we seek to maximize the probability of meeting within a specified time\n$T$. The Anderson-Weber strategy, which fails with constant probability when\n$T= \\Theta(n)$, is not asymptotically optimal for large $T$ in this setting.\nSpecifically, we exhibit a symmetric strategy that succeeds with probability\n$1-o(1)$ in $T=4n$ steps.

A recent paper noted that\ndifferent-temperature baths lead not only to different equilibrium states but\nalso to different equilibration rates. In some cases this means that\ntemperature discrimination is better achieved by comparing the rates than the\nasymptotic states -- and should therefore be carried out at finite times rather\nthan once equilibration is essentially complete. The theory work also noted\nthat for a \\emph{quantum} thermometer, the difference between the relaxation\nrates for populations and coherences means that for intermediate time regimes\n(before full equilibration but after some characteristic time that depends on\nthe temperatures of the baths), optimal discrimination is achieved not by\nprobing energy only but by using quantum coherence as well. In this work, we\nstudy these effects experimentally. Implementing a recent proposal for\nefficiently emulating an arbitrary quantum channel, we use the quantum\npolarisation state of individual photons as models of \"single-qubit\nthermometers\" which evolve for a certain time in contact with a thermal bath.\nWe investigate the optimal thermometer states for temperature discrimination,\nand the optimal interaction times, confirming that there is a broad regime\nwhere quantum coherence provides a significant improvement.

A recently discovered method called feedback-alignment shows that the\nweights used for propagating the error backward don't have to be symmetric with\nthe weights used for propagation the activation forward. In fact, random\nfeedback weights work evenly well, because the network learns how to make the\nfeedback useful. In this work, the feedback alignment principle is used for\ntraining hidden layers more independently from the rest of the network, and\nfrom a zero initial condition. The error is propagated through fixed random\nfeedback connections directly from the output layer to each hidden layer. This\nsimple method is able to achieve zero training error even in convolutional\nnetworks and very deep networks, completely without error back-propagation. The\nmethod is a step towards biologically plausible machine learning because the\nerror signal is almost local, and no symmetric or reciprocal weights are\nrequired. Experiments show that the test performance on MNIST and CIFAR is\nalmost as good as those obtained with back-propagation for fully connected\nnetworks.

Average magnetic moment saturates to a finite value\nin case of free particle but goes to zero when the particle is confined by a\n2-D harmonic potential. Fluctuations in magnetic moment shows universal\nfeatures in the presence of arbitrary friction inhomogeneity. For this case the\nsystem reaches equilibrium asymptotically.

Researchers are allowed to crawl the underlying\nsocial graphs (and data) but with limited rates, leading to only partial views\nof the true social graphs. To overcome this constraint, we may start from user\nperspective, the contributors of the OSNs. More precisely, if users cautiously\ncollaborate with one another, they can use the very infrastructure of the OSNs\nto exchange noisy friend lists with their neighbors in several rounds. In the\nend, they can build local subgraphs, also called local views of the true social\ngraph. In this paper, we propose such protocols for the problem of\n\\textit{private link exchange} over social graphs.\n  The problem is unique in the sense that the disseminated data over the links\nare the links themselves. However, there exist fundamental questions about the\nfeasibility of this model. The first question is how to define simple and\neffective privacy concepts for the link exchange processes. The second question\ncomes from the high volume of link lists in exchange which may increase\nexponentially round after round.

A particularity of causal times is that its values\nhave no intrinsic meaning, as their evolution alone is meaningful. In the\ncontext of relativistic Lagrangian mechanics, causal times corresponds to\nadmissible parameterizations of paths, and we show that in order for a\nlangragian to not depend on any particular causal time (as its values have no\nintrinsic meaning), it has to be homogeneous in its velocity argument. We\nillustrate this property with the example of a free particle in a potential.\nThen, using a geometric Lagrangian (i.e. a parameterization independent\nLagrangian which is also manifestly covariant), we introduce the notion of\nageodesicity of a path which measures to what extent a path is far from being a\ngeodesic, and show how the notion can be used in the twin paradox to\ndifferentiate the paths followed by the two twins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 08:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

Here, the discrete time steps of the simulation are\noften very small compared to the time scale of interest, i.e., of the whole\nprocess. In this setting, the detection of a global cyclic behavior of the\nprocess becomes difficult because transitions between individual states may\nappear almost reversible on the small time scale of the simulation.

Sensitivity of the\nsimulation and relationship between the flow performances are described.\nValidation of the simulation using real world data is then explained through\nthe comparison between average instantaneous speed distributions of the real\nworld data with the result of the simulations. The simulation model is then\napplied for some experiments on a hypothetical situation to gain more\nunderstanding of pedestrian behavior in one way and two way situations, to know\nthe behavior of the system if the number of elderly pedestrian increases and to\nevaluate a policy of lane-like segregation toward pedestrian crossing and\ninspects the performance of the crossing. It was revealed that the microscopic\npedestrian studies have been successfully applied to give more understanding to\nthe behavior of microscopic pedestrians flow, predict the theoretical and\npractical situation and evaluate some design policies before its\nimplementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 09:46:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

This applies to shapes from landmarks, curves,\nsurfaces, images etc. We demonstrate the asymptotic bias of the template shape\nestimation using the stratified geometry of the shape space.

We propose two bootstrap procedures that\nquantify the bias and correct it, if needed. They are applicable for any type\nof shape data.
