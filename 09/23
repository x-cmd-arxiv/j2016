Such clouds can form for\nexample through the streaming instability in protoplanetary disks. We model the\ncollapse process with a statistical model to obtain the internal structure of\nplanetesimals with solid radii between 10 and 1,000 km. In the collapse,\npebbles collide and, depending on relative speed, collisions have different\noutcomes. A mixture of particle sizes inside a planetesimal leads to better\npacking capabilities and higher densities. In this paper we apply results from\nnew laboratory experiments of dust aggregate collisions (presented in a\ncompanion paper) to model collision outcomes. We find that the internal\nstructure of a planetesimal is strongly dependent on both its mass and the\napplied fragmentation model. Low-mass planetesimals have no/few fragmenting\npebble collisions in the collapse phase and end up as porous pebble-piles. The\namount of fragmenting collisions increases with increasing cloud mass,\nresulting in wider particle size distributions and higher density. The collapse\nis nevertheless \"cold\" in the sense that collision speeds are damped by the\nhigh collision frequency. This ensures that a significant fraction of large\npebbles survive the collapse in all but the most massive clouds.

In this work we demonstrate, when the\nsignal distribution and the likelihood function associated with the noise are\nboth log-concave, that optimal MMSE performance is asymptotically achievable\nvia another M-estimation procedure. This procedure involves minimizing convex\nloss and regularizer functions that are nonlinearly smoothed versions of the\nwidely applied MAP optimization problem.

M-type subdwarfs are metal-poor low-mass stars and probe for the old\npopulations in our Galaxy. Accurate knowledge of their atmospheric parameters\nand especially the composition is essential for understanding the chemical\nhistory of our Galaxy. Aims. The purpose of this work is to perform a detailed\nstudy of M-subdwarf spectra covering the full wavelength range from the optical\nto the near-infrared. It allows to do a more detailed analysis of the\natmospheric composition in order to determine the stellar parameters, and to\nconstrain the atmospheric models. The study will allow us to further understand\nphysical and chemical processes such as increasing condensation of gas into\ndust, to point out the missing continuum opacities and see how the main band\nfeatures are reproduced by the models. The spectral resolution and the large\nwavelength coverage used is a unique combination to constrain the process that\noccur in cool atmosphere. Methods. We obtained medium-resolution (R =\n5000-7000) spectra over the wavelength range 0.3-2.5 {\\mu}m of ten M-type\nsubdwarfs with X-SHOOTER at VLT.

The onset patterns of focal seizure\nactivity have been studied intensively, and they have largely been\ndistinguished into two types - low amplitude fast oscillations (LAF), or high\namplitude spikes (HAS). Here we explore whether these two patterns arise from\nfundamentally different mechanisms. Here, we use a previously established\ncomputational model of neocortical tissue, and validate it as an adequate model\nusing clinical recordings of focal seizures. We then reproduce the two onset\npatterns in their most defining properties and investigate the possible\nmechanisms underlying the different focal seizure onset patterns in the model.\nWe show that the two patterns are associated with different mechanisms at the\nspatial scale of a single ECoG electrode. The LAF onset is initiated by\nindependent patches of localised activity, which slowly invade the surrounding\ntissue and coalesce over time. In contrast, the HAS onset is a global, systemic\ntransition to a coexisting seizure state triggered by a local event. We find\nthat such a global transition is enabled by an increase in the excitability of\nthe \"healthy\" surrounding tissue, which by itself does not generate seizures,\nbut can support seizure activity when incited. In our simulations, the\ndifference in surrounding tissue excitability also offers a simple explanation\nof the clinically reported difference in surgical outcomes. Finally, we\ndemonstrate in the model how changes in tissue excitability could be\nelucidated, in principle, using active stimulation. Taken together, our\nmodelling results suggest that the excitability of the tissue surrounding the\nseizure core may play a determining role in the seizure onset pattern, as well\nas in the surgical outcome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 17:03:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 13:20:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-08"}

[arXiv:1406.0827]. The tree-level $\\mathcal{O}(a^2)$ improvement\ncan be achieved in a simple manner, where an appropriate weighted average is\ncomputed between two definitions of the action density $\\langle E(t)\\rangle$\nmeasured at every flow time $t$. We further develop the idea of achieving the\ntree-level $\\mathcal{O}(a^4)$ improvement. For testing our proposal, we present\nnumerical results for $\\langle E(t) \\rangle$ obtained on gauge configurations\ngenerated with the Wilson and Iwasaki gauge actions at three lattice spacings\n($a\\approx 0.1, 0.07,$ and 0.05 fm). Our results show that tree-level improved\nflows significantly eliminate the discretization corrections on $t^2\\langle\nE(t)\\rangle$ in the relatively small-$t$ regime. To demonstrate the feasibility\nof our tree-level improvement proposal, we also study the scaling behavior of\nthe dimensionless combinations of the $\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\textrm{MS}}}$\nparameter and the new reference scale $t_X$, which is defined through\n$t_X^2\\langle E(t_X)\\rangle=X$ for the smaller $X$, e.g., $X= 0.15$. It is\nfound that $\\sqrt{t_{0.15}}\\Lambda_{\\overline{\\textrm{MS}}}$ shows a nearly\nperfect scaling behavior as a function of $a^2$ regardless of the types of\ngauge action and flow, after tree-level improvement is achieved up to\n$\\mathcal{O}(a^4)$.

The age of 7.5+/-1 Myr inferred from the CMD is\nmuch younger than that implied by the strong Li depletion seen in the cluster\nM-dwarfs and the Li depletion occurs at much redder colours than predicted. The\nepoch at which a star of a given mass depletes its Li and the surface\ntemperature of that star are both dependent on its radius. We demonstrate that\nif the low-mass stars have radii ~10 per cent larger at a given mass and age,\nthen both the CMD and Li depletion pattern of the Gamma Vel cluster are\nexplained at a common age of 18-21 Myr. This radius inflation could be produced\nby some combination of magnetic suppression of convection and extensive cool\nstarspots. Models that incorporate radius inflation suggest that PMS stars\nsimilar to those in the Gamma Vel cluster, in the range 0.2<M/Msun<0.7, are at\nleast a factor of two older and ~7 per cent cooler than previously thought and\nthat their masses are much larger (by >30 per cent) than inferred from\nconventional, non-magnetic models in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.\nSystematic changes of this size may be of great importance in understanding the\nevolution of young stars, disc lifetimes and the formation of planetary\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 20:00:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Crust cooling models\npredict that thermal equilibrium of the crust will be established $\\approx 1000\n\\, \\mathrm{d}$ into quiescence. Recent observations of the cooling neutron star\ntransient MXB 1659-29, however, suggest that the crust did not reach thermal\nequilibrium with the core on the predicted timescale and continued to cool\nafter $\\approx 2500 \\, \\mathrm{d}$ into quiescence. Because the quiescent light\ncurve reveals successively deeper layers of the crust, the observed late time\ncooling of MXB 1659-29 depends on the thermal transport in the inner crust. In\nparticular, the observed late time cooling is consistent with a low thermal\nconductivity layer near the depth predicted for nuclear pasta that maintains a\ntemperature gradient between the neutron star's inner crust and core for\nthousands of days into quiescence. As a result, the temperature near the\ncrust-core boundary remains above the critical temperature for neutron\nsuperfluidity and a layer of normal neutrons forms in the inner crust.

The performance of\ntraditional hierarchical structure (tree) based methods decreases as the\ndimensionality of data grows, while hashing based methods usually lack\nefficiency in practice. Recently, the graph based methods have drawn\nconsiderable attention. The main idea is that \\emph{a neighbor of a neighbor is\nalso likely to be a neighbor}, which we refer as \\emph{NN-expansion}. These\nmethods construct a $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$NN) graph offline. And at online\nsearch stage, these methods find candidate neighbors of a query point in some\nway (\\eg, random selection), and then check the neighbors of these candidate\nneighbors for closer ones iteratively. Despite some promising results, there\nare mainly two problems with these approaches: 1) These approaches tend to\nconverge to local optima. 2) Constructing a $k$NN graph is time consuming. We\nfind that these two problems can be nicely solved when we provide a good\ninitialization for NN-expansion. In this paper, we propose EFANNA, an extremely\nfast approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm based on $k$NN Graph. Efanna\nnicely combines the advantages of hierarchical structure based methods and\nnearest-neighbor-graph based methods. Extensive experiments have shown that\nEFANNA outperforms the state-of-art algorithms both on approximate nearest\nneighbor search and approximate nearest neighbor graph construction. To the\nbest of our knowledge, EFANNA is the fastest algorithm so far both on\napproximate nearest neighbor graph construction and approximate nearest\nneighbor search. A library EFANNA based on this research is released on Github.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 04:34:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 08:08:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 3 Dec 2016 06:31:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-06"}

In this thesis, we develop a low-cost mechanism, called ChargeCache,\nwhich enables faster access to recently-accessed rows in DRAM, with no\nmodifications to DRAM chips. Our mechanism is based on the key observation that\na recently-accessed row has more charge and thus the following access to the\nsame row can be performed faster. To exploit this observation, we propose to\ntrack the addresses of recently-accessed rows in a table in the memory\ncontroller. If a later DRAM request hits in that table, the memory controller\nuses lower timing parameters, leading to reduced DRAM latency. Row addresses\nare removed from the table after a specified duration to ensure rows that have\nleaked too much charge are not accessed with lower latency.

We call this\nstochastic diffusion process the (ageing) underdamped scaled Brownian motion\n(UDSBM). We demonstrate how the mean squared displacement (MSD) and the time\naveraged MSD of UDSBM are affected by the inertial term in the Langevin\nequation, both at short, intermediate, and even long diffusion times. In\nparticular, we quantify the ballistic regime for the MSD and the time averaged\nMSD as well as the spread of individual time averaged MSD trajectories. One of\nthe main effects we observe is that---both for the MSD and the time averaged\nMSD---for superdiffusive UDSBM the ballistic regime is much shorter than for\nordinary Brownian motion. In contrast, for subdiffusive UDSBM the ballistic\nregion extends to much longer diffusion times. Therefore, particular care needs\nto be taken when the overdamped limit indeed provides a correct description,\neven in the long time limit. We also analyze to what extent ergodicity in the\nBoltzmann-Khinchin sense in this non-stationary system is broken, both for\nsubdiffusive and superdiffusive UDSBM. Finally, the limiting case of ultraslow\nUDSBM is considered, with a mixed logarithmic and power law dependence of the\nensemble and time averaged MSDs of the particles. In the limit of strong\nageing, remarkably, the ordinary UDSBM and the ultraslow UDSBM behave similarly\nin the short time ballistic limit. The approaches developed here open new ways\nfor considering other stochastic processes under physically important\nconditions when a finite particle mass and ageing in the system cannot be\nneglected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 07:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

Although these lines are patient-specific, most\nsurgeons rely on generic maps to determine their orientation. Beyond the\nimprecise pinch test, there remains no accepted method for determining STLs in\nvivo.\n  Methods: (i) The speed of an elastic motion travelling radially on the skin\nof canine cadavers was measured with a commercial device called the\nReviscometer. (ii) Similar to the original experiments conducted by Karl\nLanger, circular excisions were made on the skin and the geometric changes to\nthe resulting wounds and excised samples were used to determine the orientation\nof STLs.\n  Results: A marked anisotropy in the speed of the elastic wave travelling\nradially was observed. The orientation of the fastest wave was found to\ncorrelate with the orientation of the elongated wound (P<0.001, R^2 = 74%).\nSimilarly, the orientation of fastest wave was the same for both in vivo and\nexcised isolated samples, indicating that the STLs have a structural basis.\nResulting wounds expanded by an average area of 9% (+16% along STL and -10%\nacross) while excised skin shrunk by an average area of 33% (23% along STL and\n10% across).\n  Conclusion: Elastic surface wave propagation has been validated\nexperimentally as a robust method for determining the orientation of STLs\nnon-destructively and non-invasively. This study has implications for the\nidentification of STLs and for the prediction of skin tension levels, both\nimportant factors in both human and veterinary reconstructive surgery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 08:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-26"}

In addition, the velocity distribution traced in the PV\ndiagrams can be interpreted by spiral arm-like structures, which may be\nconnected with exterior infalling gas filaments.

The detection of 7Be in several high velocity components\nshows that it has been freshly created in a thermonuclear runaway via the\nreaction 3He}(alpha,gamma) 7Be during the Nova explosion, as postulated by\nArnould and Norgaard (1975) , however in much larger amounts than predicted by\ncurrent models. 7Be decays to 7Li with a half-life of 53.22 days, comparable to\nthe temporal span covered by the observations. The non detection of LiI\nrequires that LiII remains ionised throughout our observations. The massive 7Be\nejecta result into a 7Li production that is about 4.7-4.9 dex above the\nmeteoritic abundance. If such a high production is common even in a small\nfraction (~5%) of Novae, they can make all the \"stellar\" 7Li of the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 10:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

Aiming at\na more favorable multi-view face detector, we propose a novel funnel-structured\ncascade (FuSt) detection framework.

Compared with other\nstructures, on the one hand, the proposed one uses multiple computationally\nefficient distributed classifiers to propose a small number of candidate\nwindows but with a high recall of multi-view faces. On the other hand, by using\na unified MLP cascade to examine proposals of all views in a centralized style,\nit provides a favorable solution for multi-view face detection with high\naccuracy and low time-cost. Besides, the FuSt detector is alignment-aware and\nperforms a coarse facial part prediction which is beneficial for subsequent\nface alignment.

One of the methods of choice to\nnon-parametrically estimate the unknown probability distribution function for a\ngiven random variable (defined on binary space) has been the expansion of the\nestimation function in Rademacher-Walsh Polynomial basis functions. In this\npaper we demonstrate that the expansion of the probability distribution\nfunction estimation in Rademacher-Walsh Polynomial basis functions is\nequivalent to the expansion of the function estimation in a set of \"Dirac\nkernel\" functions. The latter approach can ameliorate the computational\nbottleneck and notational awkwardness often associated with the\nRademacher-Walsh Polynomial basis functions approach, in particular when the\nbinary input space is large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 12:11:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-26"}

The first result regards the rate\nof convergence of the expected signature of the linear piecewise approximation\nof the fBm to its exact value, for a value of the Hurst parameter\n$H\\in(\\frac{1}{2},1)$. We show that the rate of convergence is given by $2H$.\nWe believe that this rate is sharp as it is consistent with the result of Ni\nand Xu, who showed that the sharp rate of convergence for the Brownian motion\n(i.e. fBm with $H=\\frac{1}{2}$) is given by $1$. The second result regards the\nbound of the coefficient of the rate of convergence obtained in the first\nresult. We obtain an uniform bound for the coefficient for the $2k$-th term of\nthe signature of $\\frac{\\tilde{A}k(2k-1)}{(k-1)!2^{k}}$, where $\\tilde{A}$ is a\nfinite constant independent of $k$. The third result regards the sharp decay\nrate of the expected signature of the fBm. We obtain a sharp bound for the\n$2k$-th term of the expected signature of $\\frac{1}{k!2^{k}}$.

We\npresent an approach to changepoint detection that is robust to the presence of\noutliers. The idea is to adapt existing penalised cost approaches for detecting\nchanges so that they use loss functions that are less sensitive to outliers. We\nargue that loss functions that are bounded, such as the classical biweight\nloss, are particularly suitable -- as we show that only bounded loss functions\nare robust to arbitrarily extreme outliers.

Indeed as\nshown by an example of Conti-De Lellis, a phenomenon of concentration of energy\ncan occur preventing the strong convergence in $W^{1,2}(\\Omega,\\mathbb{R}^3)$\nof a minimizing sequence along with the equi-integrability of the cofactors of\nthat sequence. We prove that this phenomenon can only take place on the axis of\nsymmetry of the domain. Thus if we consider domains that do not contain the\naxis of symmetry then minimizers do exist.

In many cases, the failure of a single line can cause cascading\nfailures, which impact the entire grid. We characterize the resilience of the\ngrid by three parameters, the most important of which is tolerance ${\\alpha}$,\nwhich is the ratio of the maximal load a line can carry to its initial load. We\ncharacterize a blackout by its yield, which we define as the ratio of the final\nto the initial consumed currents.

The duration\nof this latent period is proportional to the tolerance.

The leading hypothesis is that such a supernova is a\nthermonuclear explosion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, but the exact explosion\nmechanism is still a matter of debate. Observation of a galactic SN Ia would be\nof immense value in answering the many open questions related to these events.\nOne potentially useful source of information about the explosion mechanism and\nprogenitor is the neutrino signal.\n  In this paper we compute the expected neutrino signal from a gravitationally\nconfined detonation (GCD) explosion scenario for a SN~Ia and show how the flux\nat Earth contains features in time and energy unique to this scenario. We then\ncalculate the expected event rates in the Super-K, Hyper-K, JUNO, DUNE, and\nIceCube detectors and find both Hyper-K and IceCube would see a few events for\na GCD supernova at 1 kpc or closer, while Super-K, JUNO, and DUNE would see a\nevents if the supernova were closer than ${\\sim}0.3$ kpc. The distance and\ndetector criteria needed to resolve the time and spectral features arising from\nthe explosion mechanism, neutrino production, and neutrino oscillation\nprocesses are also discussed.\n  The neutrino signal from the GCD is then compared with the signal from a\ndeflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) explosion model computed\npreviously.

To resolve this\nissue, we propose an approximation of STL synthesis problems that can be solved\nvia Q-learning, and we derive some performance bounds for the policies obtained\nby the approximate approach. The performance of the proposed method is\ndemonstrated via simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 15:51:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-26"}

Unfortunately, the same has not been\npossible for general elastodynamic wave problems in continuum mechanics. In\nthis paper, we introduce a corresponding scattered-field formulation for the\nNavier equation. We derive PMLs based on complex-valued coordinate\ntransformations leading to Cosserat elasticity-tensor distributions not obeying\nthe minor symmetries. These layers are shown to work in two dimensions, for all\npolarizations, and all directions. By adaptative choice of the decay length,\nthe deep subwavelength PMLs can be used all the way to the quasi-static regime.\nAs demanding examples, we study the effectiveness of cylindrical elastodynamic\ncloaks of the Cosserat type and approximations thereof.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 22:06:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

For pristine SWCNTs at all Cs+ energies, C2 is the most dominant\nspecies, followed by C3, C4 and C1. The experiments were performed in three\nstages: in the first stage, Cs+ energy E(Cs+) was varied. During the second\nstage, the nanotubes were irradiated continuously at E(Cs+) = 5 keV for 1,800\ns. Afterwards, the entire sequence of irradiation energies was repeated to\ndifferentiate between the fragmentation patterns of the pristine and of heavily\nirradiated SWCNTs. The sputtering and normalized yields identify the\nquantitative and relative extent of the ion-induced damage by creating double,\ntriple and quadruple vacancies; the single vacancies are least favored.\nSputtering from the heavily irradiated SWCNTs occurs not only from the damaged\nand fragmented nanotubes, but also from the inter-nanotube structures that are\ngrown due to the accumulation of the sputtered clusters. Similar irradiation\nexperiments were performed with the multi-walled carbon nanotubes; the results\nconfirmed the dominant C2 followed by C3, C4 and C1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 11:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

The geometrical picture of a horizon\nacting as a one-way membrane for information flow can be accepted as a natural\ninterpretation of assigning a quantum field theory to a spacetime with\nboundary, ultimately leading to a close connection with thermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 13:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-03"}

Thus, it is imperative for service\nsystem managers to understand how the information that they provide will affect\nthe performance of the system. To this end, we construct and analyze two\ntwo-dimensional deterministic fluid models that incorporate customer choice\nbehavior based on delayed queue length information. In the first fluid model,\ncustomers join each queue according to a Multinomial Logit Model, however, the\nqueue length information the customer receives is delayed by a constant\n$\\Delta$. We show that the delay can cause oscillations or asynchronous\nbehavior in the model based on the value of $\\Delta$. In the second model,\ncustomers receive information about the queue length through a moving average\nof the queue length. Although it has been shown empirically that giving\npatients moving average information causes oscillations and asynchronous\nbehavior to occur in U.S. hospitals in the work of Dong et al., we analytically\nand mathematically show for the first time that the moving average fluid model\ncan exhibit oscillations and determine their dependence on the moving average\nwindow. Thus, our analysis provides new insight on how managers of service\nsystems information systems should report queue length information to customers\nand how delayed information can produce unwanted behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 15:07:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-07"}
