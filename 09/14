The\nintegration of these spectra within broadband and smaller 100$\\AA$ bins\nprovides us with 'white' and spectrophotometric light curves, from 5700 to\n8000$\\AA$. Through modelling the white light curve, we obtain refined bulk and\ntransit parameters of the planet, as well as wavelength-dependent variations of\nthe planetary radius from smaller spectral bins through which the transmission\nspectrum is obtained. The inference of transit parameters, as well as the noise\nstatistics, is performed using a Gaussian Process model. We achieve a typical\nprecision in the transit depth of a few hundred parts per million from various\ntransit light curves. From the transmission spectra we rule out a flat spectrum\nat >3$\\sigma$ and detect marginal presence of the pressure-broadened sodium\nwings. Furthermore, we detect the wing of the potassium absorption line in the\nupper atmosphere of the planet with 3$\\sigma$ confidence, both facts pointing\nto a relatively shallow temperature gradient of the atmosphere. These\nconclusions are mostly consistent with previous studies of this exo-atmosphere,\nalthough previous potassium measurements have been inconclusive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 16:01:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2016 22:29:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 15:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

We use this method in\na way that simultaneously takes into account the measurements of spectral lines\nas well as the continuum shape. Unlike Principal Component Analysis, this\nmethod does not assume that the Euclidean distance between galaxy spectra is a\ngood global measure of similarity between all spectra, but instead it only\nassumes that local difference information between similar spectra is reliable.\nMoreover, unlike other nonlinear dimensionality methods, this method can be\nused to characterize very finely both small-scale local as well as large-scale\nglobal properties of realistic noisy data. The power of the method is\ndemonstrated on the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample by illustrating that the derived\nembeddings of spectra carry an unprecedented amount of information.

Computed parameters of the method can be used\nto describe line strengths and their interdependencies. By using a\nlocally-biased or semi-supervised variant, we are able to focus on typical\nvariations around specific objects of astronomical interest.

According to a model of opinion dynamics from sociophysics the\nmachinery of Trump's amazing success obeys well-defined counter-intuitive\nrules. Therefore, his success was in principle predictable from the start. The\nmodel uses local majority rule arguments and obeys a threshold dynamics. The\nassociated tipping points are found to depend on the leading collective\nbeliefs, cognitive biases and prejudices of the social group which undertakes\nthe public debate. And here comes the sesame of the Trump campaign, which\ndevelops along two successive steps. During a first moment, Trump's statement\nproduces a majority of voters against him. But at the same time, according to\nthe model the shocking character of the statement modifies the prejudice\nbalance. In case the prejudice is present even being frozen among voters, the\ntipping point is lowered at Trump's benefit. Nevertheless, although the tipping\npoint has been lowered by the activation of frozen prejudices it is\ninstrumental to preserve enough support from openly prejudiced people to be\nabove the threshold. Then, as infuriated voters launch intense debate,\noccurrence of ties will drive progressively hostile people to shift their\nvoting intention without needing to endorse the statement which has infuriated\nthem. The on going debate does drive towards a majority for Trump. The possible\nTrump victory at November Presidential election is discussed. In particular,\nthe model shows that to eventually win the Presidential election, Trump must\nnot modify his past shocking attitude but to appeal to a different spectrum of\nfrozen prejudices, which are common to both Democrats and Republicans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 16:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

In settings where\nproportionality cannot be achieved due to the geometric constraints, our\nalgorithms provide a partially-proportional division, guaranteeing that the\nfraction allocated to each agent be at least a certain positive constant.

Until the discovery of the first ULX pulsar, M82 X-2,\nthe mechanism powering the large luminosities of most ULXs was thought to be\nsuper-Eddington accretion onto black holes. The ULX pulsar clearly indicates\nthat this hypothesis is not universal, and the question arises if other ULXs\nare as well powered by accretion onto neutron stars. One possibility to have\nhighly super-Eddington luminosity is by reducing the opacity by strong magnetic\nfields as in magnetars, as proposed for M82 X-2. To study the link between ULXs\nand magnetar bursts/flares, we have performed a comparative spectral study\nbetween these classes, which both emit at similar super-Eddington luminosities\nat around $L \\sim 10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We find that, when their spectra are\nfitted with dual thermal models, the long term spectral variations of ULXs are\nsimilar to short term spectral variability seen during magnetar flares. In both\nclasses of sources the black body temperatures and radii follow similar\n$R_\\textrm{bb} \\propto T_\\textrm{bb}^{-2}$ trends, the only difference being\nthat the temperatures in ULXs are an order of magnitude lower and thus they\nhave much larger characteristic emission areas. Furthermore, the ratio between\nthe luminosities of the two black body components shows the same one-to-one\ndependence in ULXs and magnetars.

Organizing this data into a dynamic multiplex network,\nwhere each layer is composed of a single edge type linking the same underlying\nvertices, can reveal interesting cross-layer interaction patterns. In\ncoevolving networks, links in one layer result in an increased probability of\nother types of links forming between the same node pair. Hence we believe that\na holistic approach in which all the layers are simultaneously considered can\noutperform a factored approach in which link prediction is performed separately\nin each layer. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework, MLP (Multilayer\nLink Prediction), in which link existence likelihoods for the target layer are\nlearned from the other network layers. These likelihoods are used to reweight\nthe output of a single layer link prediction method that uses rank aggregation\nto combine a set of topological metrics.

We suggest that the best way to assess\ntemporal persistence is to perform a test-retest study, and assess test-retest\nreliability. For ratio-scale features that are normally distributed, this is\nbest done using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). For 10 distinct\ndata sets (8 eye-movement related, and 2 gait related), we calculated the\ntest-retest reliability ('Temporal persistence') of each feature, and compared\nbiometric performance of high-ICC features to lower ICC features, and to the\nset of all features. We demonstrate that using a subset of only high-ICC\nfeatures produced superior Rank-1-Identification Rate (Rank-1-IR) performance\nin 9 of 10 databases (p = 0.01, one-tailed). For Equal Error Rate (EER), using\na subset of only high-ICC features produced superior performance in 8 of 10\ndatabases (p = 0.055, one-tailed). In general, then, prescreening potential\nbiometric features, and choosing only highly reliable features will yield\nbetter performance than lower ICC features or than the set of all features\ncombined.

To deal with the leakage of flow when the Lagrangian mesh\nbecomes coarser than the fluid mesh, we employ adaptive interaction quadrature\npoints for Lagrangian-Eulerian interaction equations based on a previous work.\nIn particular, we introduce a new anisotropic adaptive interaction quadrature\nrule. The new rule permits us to vary the interaction quadrature points not\nonly at each time-step and element but also at different orientations per\nelement. For the material model, we extend our previous fiber-based model to a\ncontinuum-based model. We first study a case in which a three-dimensional short\ntube is dilated. Results match very well with those from the implicit FE\nmethod. We remark that in our IB-FE case, the three-dimensional tube undergoes\na very large deformation and the Lagrangian mesh-size becomes about 6 times of\nEulerian mesh-size. To validate the method in handling fiber-matrix material\nmodels, we perform a second study on dilating a long fiber-reinforced tube.\nErrors are small when we compare numerical solutions with analytical solutions.\nThe technique is then applied to the problem of esophageal transport. We\npresent three cases that differ in the material model and muscle fiber\narchitecture. The overall transport features are consistent with those from the\nprevious model. We remark that the continuum-based model can handle more\nrealistic and complicated material behavior. This is demonstrated in our third\ncase with spatially varying fiber architecture. We find this unique muscle\nfiber architecture could generate a so-called pressure transition zone. This\nsuggests an important role of muscle fiber architecture in esophageal\ntransport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 18:26:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

This excess has been interpreted as a population of\n~Jupiter-mass objects that outnumber main-sequence stars by nearly twofold;\nhowever the microlensing data alone cannot distinguish between events due to\nwide-separation (a>~10 AU) and free-floating planets. Assuming these STEs are\nindeed due to planetary-mass objects, we aim to constrain the fraction of these\nevents that can be explained by bound but wide-separation planets. We fit the\nobserved timescale distribution with a lens mass function comprised of brown\ndwarfs, main-sequence stars, and stellar remnants, finding and thus\ncorroborating the initial identification of an excess of STEs.

Recently,\nthe dressed gluon expansion was introduced that enables an expansion of the NGL\nseries in terms of a \"dressed gluon\" building block, defined by an all-orders\nfactorization theorem. Here, we clarify the nature of the dressed gluon\nexpansion, and prove that it has an infinite radius of convergence as a\nsolution to the leading logarithmic and large-$N_c$ master equation for NGLs,\nthe Banfi-Marchesini-Smye (BMS) equation. The dressed gluon expansion therefore\nprovides an expansion of the NGL series that can be truncated at any order,\nwith reliable uncertainty estimates. In contrast, manifest in the results of\nthe fixed-order expansion of the BMS equation up to 12-loops is a breakdown of\nconvergence at a finite value of $\\alpha_s$log. We explain this finite radius\nof convergence using the dressed gluon expansion, showing how the dynamics of\nthe buffer region, a region of phase space near the boundary of the jet that\nwas identified in early studies of NGLs, leads to large contributions to the\nfixed order expansion. We also use the dressed gluon expansion to discuss the\nconvergence of the next-to-leading NGL series, and the role of collinear\nlogarithms that appear at this order. Finally, we show how an understanding of\nthe analytic behavior obtained from the dressed gluon expansion allows us to\nimprove the fixed order NGL series using conformal transformations to extend\nthe domain of analyticity. This allows us to calculate the NGL distribution for\nall values of $\\alpha_s$log from the coefficients of the fixed order expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

This\nsuggests that the central black hole is surrounded by a subparsec-scale\naccretion disk with the density of >~ 10^5 cm^-3. The brightness of the\ncounterjet suggests that the disk is highly inhomogeneous.

Such a new pulsed\nplasma propulsion system driven with one thousand pulses per second would\nalready have thrust-to-area ratios (50-150 kN/m2) of modern jet engines. An\narray of thrusters could enable future aircrafts and airships to start from\nground and reach altitudes up to 50km and beyond. The needed high power could\nbe provided by future compact plasma fusion reactors already in development by\naerospace companies. The magneto-plasma compressor itself was originally\ndeveloped by Russian scientists as plasma fusion device and was later\nminiaturized for supersonic flow control applications. So the first\nbreakthrough is based on a spin-off plasma fusion technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 21:09:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 18:36:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-23"}

The performance of the PLLs is affected by the\nnon-ideal conditions in the sensed grid voltage such as harmonics, frequency\ndeviations and dc offsets in single-phase systems. In this paper, a\nsingle-phase PLL is presented to mitigate the effects of these non-idealities.\nThis PLL is based on the popular second order generalized integrator (SOGI)\nstructure. The SOGI structure is modified to eliminate of the effects of input\ndc offsets. The resulting SOGI structure has a high-pass filtering property.\nHence, this PLL is termed as high-pass generalized integrator based PLL\n(HGI-PLL). It has fixed parameters which reduces the implementation complexity\nand aids in the implementation in low-end digital controllers. The HGI-PLL is\nshown to have least resource utilization among the SOGI based PLLs with dc\ncancelling capability. Systematic design methods are evolved leading to the\ndesign that limits the unit vector THD to within 1% for given non-ideal input\nconditions in terms of frequency deviation and harmonic distortion. The\nproposed designs achieve the fastest transient response. The performance of\nthis PLL has been verified experimentally.

To this end, in this\nwork we firstly propose a general learning framework for jointly estimating\nhuman gender and age by specially attempting to formulate such semantic\nrelationships as a form of near-orthogonality regularization and then\nincorporate it into the objective of the joint learning framework. In order to\nevaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we exemplify it by\nrespectively taking the widely used binary-class SVM for gender classification,\nand two threshold-based ordinal regression methods (i.e., the discriminant\nlearning for ordinal regression and support vector ordinal regression) for age\nestimation, and crucially coupling both through the proposed semantic\nformulation. Moreover, we develop its kernelized nonlinear counterpart by\nderiving a representer theorem for the joint learning strategy.

These limitations\nprevent modelers from fully exploiting ubiquitous data in monitoring\ntransportation networks. Inverse optimization methods that capture network\nroute choice behavior can address this gap, but they are designed to take\nobservations of the same model to learn the parameters of that model, which is\nstatistically inefficient (e.g. requires estimating population route and link\nflows). New inverse optimization models and supporting algorithms are proposed\nto learn the parameters of heterogeneous travelers' route behavior to infer\nshared network state parameters (e.g. link capacity dual prices). The inferred\nvalues are consistent with observations of each agent's optimization behavior.\nWe prove that the method can obtain unique dual prices for a network shared by\nthese agents in polynomial time. Four experiments are conducted. The first one,\nconducted on a 4-node network, verifies the methodology to obtain heterogeneous\nlink cost parameters even when multinomial or mixed logit models would not be\nmeaningfully estimated. The second is a parameter recovery test on the\nNguyen-Dupuis network that shows that unique latent link capacity dual prices\ncan be inferred using the proposed method.

W. Anderson, excitations do not propagate freely in a\ndisordered lattice, but, due to destructive interference, they localise. As a\nconsequence when an atom interacts with a disordered lattice one indeed\nobserves, a non-trivial excitation exchange between atom and lattice. Such\nnon-trivial atomic dynamics will in general be characterised also by a\nnon-trivial quantum information backflow, a clear signature of non-Markovian\ndynamics. To investigate the above scenario we consider a quantum emitter, or\natom, weakly coupled to a uniform coupled-cavity array (CCA). If initially\nexcited, in the absence of disorder, the emitter undergoes a Markovian\nspontaneous emission by releasing all its excitation into the CCA (initially in\nits vacuum state). By introducing static disorder in the CCA the field normal\nmodes become Anderson-localized, giving rise to a non-Markovian atomic\ndynamics. We show the existence of a functional relationship between a rigorous\nmeasure of quantum non-Markovianity and the CCA localization. We furthermore\nshow that the average non-Markovianity of the atomic dynamics is well-described\nby a phenomenological model in which the atom is coupled, at the same time, to\na single mode and to a standard - Markovian - dissipative bath.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 07:52:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 10:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-20"}

Percolation theory provides a generic framework to study the behavior\nof the cluster distribution. In most cases the theory predicts a geometrical\ntransition at the percolation threshold, characterized in the percolative phase\nby the presence of a spanning cluster, which becomes infinite in the\nthermodynamic limit. Standard percolation usually deals with the problem when\nthe constitutive elements of the clusters are randomly distributed. However\ncorrelations cannot always be neglected. In this case correlated percolation is\nthe appropriate theory to study such systems. The origin of correlated\npercolation could be dated back to 1937 when Mayer [1] proposed a theory to\ndescribe the condensation from a gas to a liquid in terms of mathematical\nclusters (for a review of cluster theory in simple fluids see [2]). The\nlocation for the divergence of the size of these clusters was interpreted as\nthe condensation transition from a gas to a liquid. One of the major drawback\nof the theory was that the cluster number for some values of thermodynamic\nparameters could become negative. As a consequence the clusters did not have\nany physical interpretation [3]. This theory was followed by Frenkel's\nphenomenological model [4], in which the fluid was considered as made of non\ninteracting physical clusters with a given free energy. This model was later\nimproved by Fisher [3], who proposed a different free energy for the clusters,\nnow called droplets, and consequently a different scaling form for the droplet\nsize distribution. This distribution, which depends on two geometrical\nparameters, has the nice feature that the mean droplet size exhibits a\ndivergence at the liquid-gas critical point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 08:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-15"}

For the primary astrometric data set\nthe typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and\nabout 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of ~0.3 mas\nshould be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ~94000\nHipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more\nprecise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the\ntypical uncertainty of the positions is ~10 mas. The median uncertainties on\nthe mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to ~0.03 mag over the\nmagnitude range 5 to 20.7. Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping\nof the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin\nobservational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this\nfirst Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the\ndata quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions\nfrom the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 08:41:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-15"}

A stochastic model of\nsuch an algorithm is investigated in the case of the star network, in which $J$\nnodes can transmit simultaneously, but interfere with a central node $0$ in\nsuch a way that node $0$ cannot transmit while one of the other nodes does.

This is possible by transmitting a set of reference\ncamera views (anchor views), which are used by the clients to freely navigate\nin the scene and possibly synthesize additional viewpoints of interest. From a\nnetworking perspective, the big challenge in IMVS systems is to deliver to each\nclient the best set of anchor views that maximizes the navigation quality,\nminimizes the view-switching delay and yet satisfies the network constraints.\nIntegrating adaptive streaming solutions in free-viewpoint systems offers a\npromising solution to deploy IMVS in large and heterogeneous scenarios, as long\nas the multi-view video representations on the server are properly selected. We\ntherefore propose to optimize the multi-view data at the server by minimizing\nthe overall resource requirements, yet offering a good navigation quality to\nthe different users. We propose a video representation set optimization for\nmultiview adaptive streaming systems and we show that it is NP-hard. We\ntherefore introduce the concept of multi-view navigation segment that permits\nto cast the video representation set selection as an integer linear programming\nproblem with a bounded computational complexity. We then show that the proposed\nsolution reduces the computational complexity while preserving optimality in\nmost of the 3D scenes. We then provide simulation results for different classes\nof users and show the gain offered by an optimal multi-view video\nrepresentation selection compared to recommended representation sets (e.g.,\nNetflix and Apple ones) or to a baseline representation selection algorithm\nwhere the encoding parameters are decided a priori for all the views.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 10:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-15"}

However, the computational cost of performing exact\nBayesian inference over causal models grows rapidly as the number of relata\nincreases. This implies that the cognitive processes underlying causal learning\nmust be substantially approximate. A powerful class of approximations that\nfocuses on the sequential absorption of successive inputs is captured by the\nNeurath's ship metaphor in philosophy of science, where theory change is cast\nas a stochastic and gradual process shaped as much by people's limited\nwillingness to abandon their current theory when considering alternatives as by\nthe ground truth they hope to approach.

Unlike symmetric information dynamic games,\nwhere subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) is the natural equilibrium concept, to\ndate there does not exist a universal algorithm that decouples the\ninterdependence of strategies and beliefs over time in calculating PBE.

Forecasting age-specific mortality rates at\nthe national and sub-national levels plays an important role in developing\nsocial policy.

To address this issue, we\nconsider reconciling forecasts of age-specific mortality rates, extending the\nmethods of Hyndman et al.

The grouped functional time series methods are used\nto produce point forecasts of mortality rates that are aggregated appropriately\nacross different disaggregation factors.

It entails\nprocessing a time-ordered stream of documents that might be relevant to an\nentity in order to select only those that contain vital information.\nState-of-the-art approaches to document filtering for popular entities are\nentity-dependent: they rely on and are also trained on the specifics of\ndifferentiating features for each specific entity. Moreover, these approaches\ntend to use so-called extrinsic information such as Wikipedia page views and\nrelated entities which is typically only available only for popular head\nentities. Entity-dependent approaches based on such signals are therefore\nill-suited as filtering methods for long-tail entities. In this paper we\npropose a document filtering method for long-tail entities that is\nentity-independent and thus also generalizes to unseen or rarely seen entities.\nIt is based on intrinsic features, i.e., features that are derived from the\ndocuments in which the entities are mentioned. We propose a set of features\nthat capture informativeness, entity-saliency, and timeliness. In particular,\nwe introduce features based on entity aspect similarities, relation patterns,\nand temporal expressions and combine these with standard features for document\nfiltering. Experiments following the TREC KBA 2014 setup on a publicly\navailable dataset show that our model is able to improve the filtering\nperformance for long-tail entities over several baselines. Results of applying\nthe model to unseen entities are promising, indicating that the model is able\nto learn the general characteristics of a vital document. The overall\nperformance across all entities---i.e., not just long-tail entities---improves\nupon the state-of-the-art without depending on any entity-specific training\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 14:09:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-15"}

In the model presented\nhere we extend the bee population dynamics with mite viral epidemiology\nexamined in an earlier paper by allowing a bee-dependent mite population size.\nThe results of the analysis match field observations well and give a clear\nexplanation of how Varroa affects the epidemiology of certain naturally\noccurring bee viruses, causing considerable damages to colonies. The model\nallows only four possible stable equilibria, using known field parameters. The\nfirst one contains only the thriving healthy bees. Here the disease is\neradicated and also the mites are wiped out. Alternatively, we find the\nequilibrium still with no mite population, but with endemic disease among the\nthriving bee population. Thirdly, infected bees coexist with the mites in the\nVarroa invasion scenario; in this situation the disease invades the hive,\ndriving the healthy bees to extinction and therefore affecting all the bees.\nCoexistence is also possible, with both populations of bees and mites thriving\nand with the disease endemically affecting both species. The analysis is in\nline with field observations in natural honey bee colonies. Namely, these\ndiseases are endemic and if the mite population is present, necessarily the\nviral infection occurs. Further, in agreement with the fact that the presence\nof Varroa increments the viral transmission, the whole bee population may\nbecome infected when the disease vector is present in the beehive. Also, a low\nhorizontal transmission rate of the virus among the honey bees will help in\nprotecting the bee colonies from Varroa infestation and viral epidemics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 15:35:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-15"}

A very low noise\nlevel is required to observe extremely faint targets and to get high-precision\nflux measurements. Although CMOS technology offers many advantages over CCDs, a\nmajor bottleneck is still the read noise. To move from an industrial CMOS\nsensor to one suitable for scientific applications, an improved design that\noptimizes the noise level is essential. Here, we study the 1/f and thermal\nnoise performance of the source follower (SF) of a CMOS pixel in detail. We\nidentify the relevant design parameters, and analytically study their impact on\nthe noise level using the BSIM3v3 noise model with an enhanced model of gate\ncapacitance. Our detailed analysis shows that the dependence of the 1/f noise\non the geometrical size of the source follower is not limited to minimum\nchannel length, compared to the classical approach to achieve the minimum 1/f\nnoise. We derive the optimal gate dimensions (the width and the length) of the\nsource follower that minimize the 1/f noise, and validate our results using\nnumerical simulations. By considering the thermal noise or white noise along\nwith 1/f noise, the total input noise of the source follower depends on the\ncapacitor ratio CG/CFD and the drain current (Id). Here, CG is the total gate\ncapacitance of the source follower and CFD is the total floating diffusion\ncapacitor at the input of the source follower. We demonstrate that the optimum\ngate capacitance (CG) depends on the chosen bias current but ranges from CFD/3\nto CFD to achieve the minimum total noise of the source follower.

Surprise, a resolution-limit-free function\nrooted in discrete probability theory, has been recently introduced and applied\nto brain networks, revealing a wide size-distribution of functional modules, in\ncontrast with many previous reports.

These results\nsuggest that the usual measures to estimate both, the size of the state space\nand the size of the tree of legal moves, are not unique indicators of the\ncomplexity of the game, but that topological considerations are equally\nimportant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 10:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

A simple model based on\nlocal instantaneous screened interaction gives reasonable agreement with the\nmore rigorous calculations.
