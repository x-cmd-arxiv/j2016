In this paper, we\npropose a summarization method that combines itemset mining and domain\nknowledge to construct a concept-based model and to extract the main subtopics\nfrom an input document. Our summarizer quantifies the informativeness of each\nsentence using the support values of itemsets appearing in the sentence.\nMethods: To address the concept-level analysis of text, our method initially\nmaps the original document to biomedical concepts using the UMLS. Then, it\ndiscovers the essential subtopics of the text using a data mining technique,\nnamely itemset mining, and constructs the summarization model. The employed\nitemset mining algorithm extracts a set of frequent itemsets containing\ncorrelated and recurrent concepts of the input document. The summarizer selects\nthe most related and informative sentences and generates the final summary.\nResults: We evaluate the performance of our itemset-based summarizer using the\nRecall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) metrics, performing a\nset of experiments. The results show that the itemset-based summarizer performs\nbetter than the compared methods. The itemset-based summarizer achieves the\nbest scores for all the assessed ROUGE metrics . Conclusion: Compared to the\nstatistical, similarity, and word frequency methods, the proposed method\ndemonstrates that the summarization model obtained from the concept extraction\nand itemset mining provides the summarizer with an effective metric for\nmeasuring the informative content of sentences. This can lead to an improvement\nin the performance of biomedical literature summarization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2016 16:09:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 May 2017 04:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-26"}

This disruption phenomenon is investigated here in the context of\ntwo-dimensional, homogeneous, incompressible magnetohydrodynamics. We derive a\nsimple order of magnitude estimate for the magnetic stresses --- and thus the\ndegree of disruption --- that depends on the strength of the background\nmagnetic field (measured by the parameter $M$, a ratio between the Alfv\\'en\nspeed and a typical flow speed) and on the magnetic diffusivity (measured by\nthe magnetic Reynolds number $\\mbox{Rm}$).

An intrinsic challenge is\nthe uncertainty caused by the widespread repetitive elements. Here we get\naround the uncertainty using the notion of uniquely mapped (UM) reads, which\nmotivated the design of a new assembler BAUM. It mainly consists of two types\nof iterations. The first type of iterations constructs initial contigs from a\nreference, say a genome of a species that could be quite distant, by adaptive\nread mapping, filtration by the reference's unique regions, and reference\nupdating. A statistical test is proposed to split the layouts at possible\nstructural variation sites. The second type of iterations includes mapping,\nscaffolding/contig-extension, and contig merging. We extend each contig by\nlocally assembling the reads whose mates are uniquely mapped to an end of the\ncontig. Instead of the de Bruijn graph method, we take the\noverlap-layout-consensus (OLC) paradigm. The OLC is implemented by parallel\ncomputation, and has linear complexity with respect to the number of contigs.\nThe adjacent extended contigs are merged if their alignment is confirmed by the\nadjusted gap distance. Throughout the assembling, the mapping criterion is\nselected by probabilistic calculations. These innovations can be used\ncomplementary to the existing de novo assemblers. Applying this novel method to\nthe assembly of wild rice Oryza longistaminata genome, we achieved much\nimproved contig N50, 18.8k, compared with other assemblers.

The importance of polarisation was recognised early-on and\ndescribed by Cochran in 1959 [Philosophical Magazine 4 (1959) 1082-1086].\nHowever, dispersion forces are still treated at the two-body level and in the\ndipole limit, although the importance of three-body terms in the condensed\nphase was demonstrated by Barker in the 1980s [Phys.

The temperate Earth-mass planet Proxima b is the closest exoplanet\nto Earth and represents what may be our best ever opportunity to search for\nlife outside the Solar System. Aims. We aim at directly detecting Proxima b and\ncharacterizing its atmosphere by spatially resolving the planet and obtaining\nhigh-resolution reflected-light spectra. Methods. We propose to develop a\ncoupling interface between the SPHERE high-contrast imager and the new ESPRESSO\nspectrograph, both installed at ESO VLT. The angular separation of 37 mas\nbetween Proxima b and its host star requires the use of visible wavelengths to\nspatially resolve the planet on a 8.2-m telescope. At an estimated\nplanet-to-star contrast of ~10^-7 in reflected light, Proxima b is extremely\nchallenging to detect with SPHERE alone. However, the combination of a\n~10^3-10^4 contrast enhancement from SPHERE to the high spectral resolution of\nESPRESSO can reveal the planetary spectral features and disentangle them from\nthe stellar ones. Results. We find that significant but realistic upgrades to\nSPHERE and ESPRESSO would enable a 5-sigma detection of the planet and yield a\nmeasurement of its true mass and albedo in 20-40 nights of telescope time,\nassuming an Earth-like atmospheric composition. Moreover, it will be possible\nto probe the O2 bands at 627, 686 and 760 nm, the water vapour band at 717 nm,\nand the methane band at 715 nm.

In addition to\nimplementing their own version of HTM, the authors also designed a profiler\nwhich is capable of tracing all of the key parameters of the system.

Strong restrictions on how much\nclose it can get derive from the maximum temperature that the used materials\ncan stand, in order not to compromise the spacecraft's activity and\nfunctionalities. In other words, the minimum perihelion distance of a given\nmission can be determined based on the materials' temperature restrictions. The\ntemperature of an object in space depends on its optical properties:\nreflectivity, absorptivity, transmissivity, and emissivity. Usually, it is\nconsidered as an approximation that the optical properties of materials are\nconstant. However, emissivity depends on temperature. The consideration of the\ntemperature dependence of emissivity and conductivity of materials used in the\naerospace industry leads to the conclusion that the temperature dependence on\nthe heliocentric distance is different from the case of constant optical\nproperties [1]. Particularly, taking into account that emissivity is directly\nproportional to the temperature, the temperature of an object increases as\n$r{}^{-2/5}$ when the heliocentric distance $r$ decreases. This means that the\nsame temperature will actually be reached at a different distance and,\neventually, the spacecraft will be allowed to approach closer to the Sun\nwithout compromising its activities.

Away from the high-symmetry points, we find critical Weyl\nfermions present exactly at the boundary between the type-I and type-II Weyl\nfermions. This critical Weyl fermion transforms into the type-I or type-II Weyl\nfermion once the magnetic field is applied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2016 05:56:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

In the diffusive setting, this entails sampling\nthe path of Brownian motion as it uniformly exits a sequence of spheres\nmaximally inscribed in the domain. As this algorithm would otherwise never end,\nit is truncated when the `walk-on-spheres` comes within epsilon > 0 of the\nboundary. In the setting of the fractional Laplacian, the role of Brownian\nmotion is replaced by an isotropic alpha-stable process with alpha in (0, 2). A\nsignificant difference to the Brownian setting is that the stable processes\nwill exit spheres by a jump rather than hitting their boundary.

It increases the pressure inside the skull and reduces blood and oxygen\nsupply. To relieve the intracranial pressure, neurosurgeons remove part of the\nskull and allow the swollen brain to bulge outward, a procedure known as\ndecompressive craniectomy. Decompressive craniectomy has been preformed for\nmore than a century; yet, its effects on the swollen brain remain poorly\nunderstood. Here we characterize the deformation, strain, and stretch in\nbulging brains using the nonlinear field theories of mechanics.

Three different scenarios,\nthat only differ in the way the sail approaches the Sun, were analyzed and\ncompared. In every case once the perihelion is reached, the sail coat undergoes\nthermal desorption. When the desorption process ends, the sail then escapes the\nSolar System having the conventional acceleration due to solar radiation\npressure. Thermal desorption here comes as an additional source of solar sail\nacceleration beside traditional propulsion systems for extrasolar space\nexploration. The compared scenarios are the following: i. Hohmann transfer plus\nthermal desorption. In this scenario the sail would be carried as a payload to\nthe perihelion with a conventional propulsion system by an Hohmann transfer\nfrom Earth's orbit to an orbit very close to the Sun (almost at 0.1 AU) and\nthen be deployed there. ii. Elliptical transfer plus Slingshot plus thermal\ndesorption. In this scenario the transfer occurs from Earth's orbit to\nJupiter's orbit. A Jupiter's fly-by leads to the orbit close to the Sun, where\nthe sail is deployed. iii. Two stage acceleration of the solar sail through\nthermal desorption. The proposed sail has two coats of the materials that\nundergo thermal desorption at different temperatures depending on the\nheliocentric distance. The first desorption occurs at the Earth orbit and\nprovides the thrust needed to propel the solar sail toward the Sun. The second\ndesorption is equivalent to that of the other scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2016 07:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-13"}

Using a discrete\ncodebook consisting of multiple analog beams, each beam focuses on a certain\nrange of angles of arrival or departure and corresponds to a set of fixed phase\nshifts across frequency due to practical hardware considerations. However, for\nsufficiently large bandwidth, the gain provided by the phased array is actually\nfrequency dependent, which is an effect called beam squint, and this effect\noccurs even if the radiation pattern of the antenna elements is frequency\nindependent. This paper examines the nature of beam squint for a uniform linear\narray (ULA) and analyzes its impact on codebook design as a function of the\nnumber of antennas and system bandwidth normalized by the carrier frequency.\nThe criterion for codebook design is to guarantee that each beam's minimum gain\nfor a range of angles and for all frequencies in the wideband system exceeds a\ntarget threshold, for example 3 dB below the array's maximum gain. Analysis and\nnumerical examples suggest that a denser codebook is required to compensate for\nbeam squint. For example, 54% more beams are needed compared to a codebook\ndesign that ignores beam squint for a ULA with 32 antennas operating at a\ncarrier frequency of 73 GHz and bandwidth of 2.5 GHz. Furthermore, beam squint\nwith this design criterion limits the bandwidth or the number of antennas of\nthe array if the other one is fixed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2016 13:32:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 17:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-23"}

An important consequence of our results is that we\nare able to formalize model-selection using a \"hold-out\" procedure, where the\npolicy maker would first estimate various policies using half of the data, and\nthen select the policy which performs the best when evaluated on the other half\nof the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Sep 2016 15:09:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2016 14:43:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 17:42:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 16:21:13 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 2019 16:38:53 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 15:57:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

Objects with diameters as small as 10 nm can be located, and their\nposition tracked with nanometer precision. Multiple objects distributed either\non planes perpendicular to the incidence direction or along axial lines in the\nincidence direction are distinguishable. More precisely, the shape and size of\nplane sections perpendicular to the incidence direction can be clearly\ndetermined, even for asymmetric and non-convex scatterers. Axial resolution\nimproves as the size of the objects decreases. Initial reconstructions may\nproceed by glueing together 2D horizontal slices between axial peaks or by\nlocating objects at 3D peaks of topological energies, depending on the\neffective wavenumber. Below a threshold size, topological derivative based\niterative schemes improve initial predictions of the location, size and shape\nof objects by postprocessing fixed measured data. For larger sizes, tracking\nthe peaks of topological energy fields that average information from additional\nincident light beams seems to be more effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2016 23:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}
