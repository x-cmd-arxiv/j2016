In\nthe presence of local interference, for instance, potential outcomes of a unit\ndepend on its treatment as well as on the treatments of other local units, such\nas its neighbors according to the network. In observational studies, a further\ncomplication is that the typical unconfoundedness assumption must be extended -\nsay, to include the treatment of neighbors, and indi- vidual and neighborhood\ncovariates - to guarantee identification and valid inference. Here, we propose\nnew estimands that define treatment and interference effects. We then derive\nanalytical expressions for the bias of a naive estimator that wrongly assumes\naway interference.

This result, that we call the *generalized {\\L}o\\'s-Tarski theorem*,\nabbreviated $\\mathsf{GLT}(k)$, yields the classical {\\L}o\\'s-Tarski\npreservation theorem when $k$ equals 0. It also provides new characterizations\nof the $\\Sigma^0_2$ and $\\Pi^0_2$ prefix classes, that are finer than all\ncharacterizations of these classes in the literature. Further, our semantic\nnotions are finitary in nature, in contrast to those contained in the\nliterature characterizations.\n  In the context of finite structures, we formulate an abstract combinatorial\nproperty of structures, that when satisfied by a class, ensures that\n$\\mathsf{GLT}(k)$ holds over the class. This property, that we call the\n*Equivalent Bounded Substructure Property*, abbreviated $\\mathsf{EBSP}$,\nintuitively states that a large structure contains a small \"logically similar\"\nsubstructure. It turns out that this simply stated property is enjoyed by a\nvariety of classes of interest in computer science: examples include words,\ntrees (unordered, ordered or ranked), nested words, graph classes of bounded\ntree-depth/shrub-depth, and $m$-partite cographs. Further, $\\mathsf{EBSP}$\nremains preserved under various well-studied operations, such as\ncomplementation, transpose, the line-graph operation, disjoint union, cartesian\nand tensor products, etc. This enables constructing a wide spectrum of classes\nthat satisfy $\\mathsf{EBSP}$, and hence $\\mathsf{GLT}(k)$. Remarkably,\n$\\mathsf{EBSP}$ can be regarded as a finitary analogue of the classical\ndownward L\\\"owenheim-Skolem property.\n  In summary, this dissertation provides new notions and results in both\ncontexts, that of all structures and that of finite structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 19:24:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

First, for frequencies that differ from the\nsingle-particle energy by terms of order ${\\cal O}(q)$ (i.e., small deviations\ncompared to the single-particle energy), the dynamic structure factor is\ndescribed by the impulse approximation of Hohenberg and Platzman. Second,\ndeviations of order ${\\cal O}(q^2)$ (i.e., of the same order or larger than the\nsingle-particle energy) are described by the operator product expansion, with a\nuniversal crossover connecting both regimes. The scaling is consistent with a\nnumber of sum rules in the large momentum limit. Furthermore, we derive an\nexact expression for the shift and width of the single-particle peak at large\nmomentum due to interactions, thus extending a result by Beliaev [JETP 7, 299\n(1958)] for the low-density Bose gas to arbitrary values of the scattering\nlength $a$.

This coupling splits the exciton spectrum into a lower energy\nattractive exciton-polaron branch, normally identified as a trion branch, and a\nhigher energy repulsive exciton-polaron branch, normally identified as an\nexciton branch. We have calculated the frequency and doping dependence of the\noptical conductivity and found that: (i) the splitting varies linearly with the\nFermi energy of the excess quasiparticles; (ii) the trion peak is dominant at\nhigh carrier densities; (iii) and the trion peak width is considerably smaller\nthan that of the excitonic peak.

The efficacy of delay-coordinate mapping has long been\nsupported by Takens' embedding theorem, which guarantees that delay-coordinate\nmaps use the time-series output to provide a reconstruction of the hidden state\nspace that is a one-to-one embedding of the system's attractor. While this\ntopological guarantee ensures that distinct points in the reconstruction\ncorrespond to distinct points in the original state space, it does not\ncharacterize the quality of this embedding or illuminate how the specific\nparameters affect the reconstruction. In this paper, we extend Takens' result\nby establishing conditions under which delay-coordinate mapping is guaranteed\nto provide a stable embedding of a system's attractor. Beyond only preserving\nthe attractor topology, a stable embedding preserves the attractor geometry by\nensuring that distances between points in the state space are approximately\npreserved. In particular, we find that delay-coordinate mapping stably embeds\nan attractor of a dynamical system if the stable rank of the system is large\nenough to be proportional to the dimension of the attractor. The stable rank\nreflects the relation between the sampling interval and the number of delays in\ndelay-coordinate mapping.

Our simulations yield somewhat different constraints than two\ncomplementary models that have been invoked in similar analyses, emphasizing\nthe need for further observational constraints on the galaxy-halo connection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 20:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Since the thin-film\naluminum has a slightly elevated critical temperature ($T_\\mathrm{c} = 1.4 \\,\n\\mathrm{K}$), it therefore transitions before the package ($T_\\mathrm{c} = 1.2\n\\, \\mathrm{K}$), which also serves as a magnetic shield.

Motivated by these shortcomings, generalized Kalman smoothing\nformulations have been proposed in the last few years, replacing quadratic\nmodels with more suitable, often nonsmooth, convex functions. In contrast to\nclassical models, these general estimators require use of iterated algorithms,\nand these have received increased attention from control, signal processing,\nmachine learning, and optimization communities.\n  In this survey we show that the optimization viewpoint provides the control\nand signal processing community great freedom in the development of novel\nmodeling and inference frameworks for dynamical systems. We discuss general\nstatistical models for dynamic systems, making full use of nonsmooth convex\npenalties and constraints, and providing links to important models in signal\nprocessing and machine learning. We also survey optimization techniques for\nthese formulations, paying close attention to dynamic problem structure.\nModeling concepts and algorithms are illustrated with numerical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 21:58:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2016 12:37:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}

In many large-scale applications, the\nconstruction of the index and its usage need to be considered as one unit of\ncomputation. Efficient string indexing and analysis in small space lies also at\nthe core of a number of primitives in the data-intensive field of\nhigh-throughput DNA sequencing. We report the following advances in string\nindexing and analysis. We show that the BWT of a string $T\\in\n\\{1,\\ldots,\\sigma\\}^n$ can be built in deterministic $O(n)$ time using just\n$O(n\\log{\\sigma})$ bits of space, where $\\sigma \\leq n$.

We detected 30 frequencies with signal to noise amplitude ratios larger\nthan 4.0, of which six ($f_2$--$f_6$ and $f_{10}$) can be identified as\nhigh-order (17 $\\le n \\le$ 25) low-degree ($\\ell$ = 2) gravity-mode pulsations\nthat were stable during the observing run of 200 d. In contrast, the other\nfrequencies may be harmonic and combination terms. For the six frequencies, the\npulsation periods and pulsation constants are in the ranges of 0.352$-$0.506 d\nand 0.232$-$0.333 d, respectively. These values and the position on the HR\ndiagram demonstrate that the primary star is a $\\gamma$ Dor variable. The\nevolutionary status and the pulsation nature of KIC 6048106 are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 23:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

Such systems are well positioned to facilitate the detailed\nspectroscopic characterization of faint substellar companions at small angular\nseparations from the host star. Additionally, the increased light concentration\nof the point-spread function and the unprecedented stability create\nopportunities in other fields of astronomy as well, including spectroscopy.\nWith such Strehl ratios, efficient injection into single-mode fibers or\nphotonic lanterns becomes possible. With diffraction-limited components feeding\nthe instrument, calibrating a spectrograph's line profile becomes considerably\neasier, as modal noise or imperfect scrambling of the fiber output are no\nlonger an issue. It also opens up the possibility of exploiting photonic\ntechnologies for their advanced functionalities, inherent replicability, and\nsmall, lightweight footprint to design and build future instrumentation. In\nthis work, we outline how extreme adaptive optics systems will enable advanced\nphotonic and diffraction-limited technologies to be exploited in spectrograph\ndesign and the impact it will have on spectroscopy. We illustrate that the\nprecision of an instrument based on these technologies, would be limited by the\nspectral content and stellar noise on cool stars and capable of achieving a\nradial velocity precision of several m/s; the level required for detecting an\nexo-Earth in the HZ of a nearby M-dwarf.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 00:13:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 18:44:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

The reason\nis that the fluctuations around the average views are themselves heavy tailed.\nBased on these empirical observations, we propose a stochastic differential\nequation with L\\'evy noise as a model of the dynamics of videos. We show how\nthis model is substantially better in estimating the probability of an ordinary\nitem becoming a big hit, which is considerably underestimated in the\ntraditional proportional-growth models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 01:44:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 05:14:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-13"}

Safety conditions are\nspecified in terms of forward invariance of a set, and are verified via two\nnovel generalizations of barrier functions; in each case, the existence of a\nbarrier function satisfying Lyapunov-like conditions implies forward invariance\nof the set, and the relationship between these two classes of barrier functions\nis characterized. In addition, each of these formulations yields a notion of\ncontrol barrier function (CBF), providing inequality constraints in the control\ninput that, when satisfied, again imply forward invariance of the set. Through\nthese constructions, CBFs can naturally be unified with control Lyapunov\nfunctions (CLFs) in the context of a quadratic program (QP); this allows for\nthe achievement of control objectives (represented by CLFs) subject to\nconditions on the admissible states of the system (represented by CBFs).

Second, while a dead zone (a\nregion of low turbulence) in the disk is generally thought to be essential for\nplanet formation, it is most probably rare in disks around pulsars because of\nthe irradiation from the pulsar. The irradiation strongly heats the inner parts\nof the disk pushing the inner boundary of the dead zone out.

This unique phenomenon may be attributed to the combined effect of $f(R)$\ngravity and conformally invariant Maxwell field. It is also shown that the\nratio $P_cv_c/T_c$ differs from that of higher dimensional charged AdS black\nholes in Einstein gravity. However, the ratio for four-dimensional $f(R)$ black\nholes is the same as that of four-dimensional RN-AdS black holes, implying that\n$f(R)$ gravity does not influence the ratio. So the ratio may be related to\nconformally invariant Maxwell field. To probe the phase transition, we derive\nthe explicit expression of the Gibbs free energy with its graph plotted. Phase\ntransition analogous to the van der Waals liquid-gas system take place between\nthe small black hole and the large black hole.

A total of seven OB stars are identified towards the bubble N37 using\nphotometric criteria, and two of them are spectroscopically confirmed as O9V\nand B0V stars. Spectro-photometric distances of these two sources confirm their\nphysical association with the bubble. The O9V star is appeared to be the\nprimary ionizing source of the region, which is also in agreement with the\ndesired Lyman continuum flux analysis estimated from the 20 cm data. The\npresence of the expanding HII region is revealed in the N37 cloud which could\nbe responsible for the MIR bubble. Using the $^{13}$CO line data and\nphotometric data, several cold molecular condensations as well as clusters of\nyoung stellar objects (YSOs) are identified in the N37 cloud, revealing ongoing\nstar formation (SF) activities. However, the analysis of ages of YSOs and the\ndynamical age of the HII region do not support the origin of SF due to the\ninfluence of OB stars. The position-velocity analysis of $^{13}$CO data reveals\nthat two molecular clouds are inter-connected by a bridge-like structure,\nfavoring the onset of a cloud-cloud collision process. The SF activities (i.e.\nthe formation of YSOs clusters and OB stars) in the N37 cloud are possibly\ninfluenced by the cloud-cloud collision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 07:26:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

We compare the centroids of the different velocity\ncomponents to expectations based on orbital dynamics in the presence of bar and\nspiral potential perturbations. A model of the region as the interface of two\ngas-populated orbits families supporting the bar and the independently rotating\nspiral arms provides an overall good match to the data.

We\ninvestigate the physical conditions, structure and velocity field of the dense\nmolecular region of the planetary nebula NGC 6302 by means of ALMA band 7\ninterferometric maps. The high spatial resolution of the $^{12}$CO and\n$^{13}$CO J=3-2 ALMA data allows for an analysis of the geometry of the ejecta\nin unprecedented detail. We built a spatio-kinematical model of the molecular\nregion with the software SHAPE and performed detailed non-LTE calculations of\nexcitation and radiative transfer with the SHAPEMOL plug-in. We find that the\nmolecular region consists of a massive ring out of which a system of fragments\nof lobe walls emerge and enclose the base of the lobes visible in the optical.\nThe general properties of this region are in agreement with previous works,\nalthough the much greater spatial resolution of the data allows for a very\ndetailed description. We confirm that the mass of the molecular region is 0.1\nM$_{\\odot}$. Additionally, we report a previously undetected component at the\nnebular equator, an inner, younger ring inclined $\\sim$60$^\\circ$ with respect\nto the main ring, showing a characteristic radius of 7.5$\\times$10$^{16}$ cm, a\nmass of 2.7$\\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_{\\odot}$, and a counterpart in optical images\nof the nebula. This inner ring has the same kinematical age as the northwest\noptical lobes, implying it was ejected approximately at the same time, hundreds\nof years after the ejection of the bulk of the molecular ring-like region. We\ndiscuss a sequence of events leading to the formation of the molecular and\noptical nebulae, and briefly speculate on the origin of this intriguing inner\nring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 08:11:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-22"}

On the one hand it is yet unclear whether the\nasynchronous state observed in the brain is autonomously generated, or if it\nresults from the interplay between external drivings and internal dynamics. It\nis also not known, which kind of network variabilities will lead to irregular\nspiking and which to synchronous firing states. Here we show how isolated\nnetworks of purely excitatory neurons generically show asynchronous firing\nwhenever a minimal level of structural variability is present together with a\nrefractory period. Our autonomous networks are composed of excitable units, in\nthe form of leaky integrators spiking only in response to driving inputs. For a\nnon-uniform network, composed exclusively of excitatory neurons, we find a rich\nrepertoire of self-induced dynamical states, including asynchronous drifting\nstates, fully synchronized, or mixed, containing both drifting and synchronized\ncomponents. The individual neurons considered are excitable and hence do not\ndispose of intrinsic natural firing frequencies. An effective network-wide\ndistribution of natural frequencies is however generated autonomously through\nself-consistent feedback loops. We find two types of asynchronous activity,\nwith the individual neurons spiking regularly in the pure drifting state,\nalbeit with a continuous distribution of firing frequencies. The activity of\nthe drifting component, however, becomes irregular in the mixed state, due to\nthe periodic driving of the synchronized component. We propose a new tool for\nthe study of chaos in spiking neural networks, which consists of an analysis of\nthe time series of pairs of consecutive interspike intervals.

First, the bosonic partition function of\nprimes, or the generating function of unrestricted prime partitions in number\ntheory, is constructed. Next, the density of states is obtained using the\nsaddle-point method for Laplace inversion of the partition function in the\nlimit of large n. This directly gives the asymptotic number of prime partitions\nP_as(n). The leading term in the asymptotic expression grows exponentially as\nsqrt[n/ln(n)] and agrees with previous estimates. We calculate the\nnext-to-leading order term in the exponent, porportional to ln[ln(n)]/ln(n),\nand show that an earlier result in the literature for its coefficient is\nincorrect. Furthermore, we also calculate the next higher order correction,\nproportional to 1/ln(n) and given in Eq.(43), which so far has not been\navailable in the literature.

There are a number of\nefficient algorithms for segmentation in Euclidean space that depend on the\nvariational approach and partial differential equation modelling. Wavelets have\nbeen used successfully in various problems in image processing, including\nsegmentation, inpainting, noise removal, super-resolution image restoration,\nand many others. Wavelets on the sphere have been developed to solve such\nproblems for data defined on the sphere, which arise in numerous fields such as\ncosmology and geophysics. In this work, we propose a wavelet-based method to\nsegment images on the sphere, accounting for the underlying geometry of\nspherical data. Our method is a direct extension of the tight-frame based\nsegmentation method used to automatically identify tube-like structures such as\nblood vessels in medical imaging. It is compatible with any arbitrary type of\nwavelet frame defined on the sphere, such as axisymmetric wavelets, directional\nwavelets, curvelets, and hybrid wavelet constructions. Such an approach allows\nthe desirable properties of wavelets to be naturally inherited in the\nsegmentation process. In particular, directional wavelets and curvelets, which\nwere designed to efficiently capture directional signal content, provide\nadditional advantages in segmenting images containing prominent directional and\ncurvilinear features. We present several numerical experiments, applying our\nwavelet-based segmentation method, as well as the common K-means method, on\nreal-world spherical images. These experiments demonstrate the superiority of\nour method and show that it is capable of segmenting different kinds of\nspherical images, including those with prominent directional features.\nMoreover, our algorithm is efficient with convergence usually within a few\niterations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 11:20:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Nov 2019 18:16:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-12"}

Invariant mass distributions constructed out of these\nfinal states are characterized by the presence of kinematic edges, which are\nunique to the topology under consideration. Further, since all the final state\nparticles are SM states, the position in the edges of these invariant mass\ndistributions can be used to exclusively determine the masses of the\nresonances. Observation of these features are meant to serve as a trigger,\nthereby mandating a more detailed analysis in a particular direction of\nparameter space. The absence of these edge like features, in the specific\ninvariant mass distributions considered here, in minimal versions of\nsupersymmetric models (MSSM) also serves as a harbinger of such non MSSM-like\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 11:26:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2017 05:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

Even though the formal framework of data exchange for\nrelational database systems is well-established, it does not immediately carry\nover to the settings of temporal data, which necessitates reasoning over\nunbounded periods of time. In this work, we study data exchange for temporal\ndata. We first motivate the need for two views of temporal data: the concrete\nview, which depicts how temporal data is compactly represented and on which the\nimplementations are based, and the abstract view, which defines the semantics\nof temporal data as a sequence of snapshots. We first extend the chase\nprocedure for the abstract view to have a conceptual basis for the data\nexchange for temporal databases. Considering non-temporal source-to-target\ntuple generating dependencies and equality generating dependencies, the chase\nalgorithm can be applied on each snapshot independently. Then we define a chase\nprocedure (called c-chase) on concrete instances and show the result of c-chase\non a concrete instance is semantically aligned with the result of chase on the\ncorresponding abstract instance. In order to interpret intervals as constants\nwhile checking if a dependency or a query is satisfied by a concrete database,\nwe will normalize the instance with respect to the dependency or the query. To\nobtain the semantic alignment, the nulls in the concrete view are annotated\nwith temporal information. Furthermore, we show that the result of the concrete\nchase provides a foundation for query answering. We define naive evaluation on\nthe result of the c-chase and show it produces certain answers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 12:32:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 22:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}

The short coherence time of the\nelectronic quantum state that arises from coupling to the nuclei of the\nsubstrate is dramatically increased if the system is subjected to a magnetic\nfield and to repeated optical pulsing. This enhancement is due to mode locking:\nOscillation frequencies resonant with the pulsing frequencies are enhanced,\nwhile off-resonant oscillations eventually die out. Because the resonant\nfrequencies are determined by the pulsing frequency only, the system becomes\nimmune to frequency shifts caused by the nuclear coupling and by slight\nvariations between individual quantum dots. The effects remain even after the\noptical pulsing is terminated. In this work, we explore the phenomenon of mode\nlocking from a quantum mechanical perspective. We treat the dynamics using the\ncentral spin model, which includes coupling to 10-20 nuclei and incoherent\ndecay of the excited electronic state, in a perturbative framework.

However, the atmospheric mechanisms responsible for the\nformation of this super-rotation are still not fully understood. In this work,\nwe developed a new Venus general circulation model to study the most likely\nmechanisms driving the atmosphere to the current observed circulation. Our\nmodel includes a new radiative transfer, convection and suitably adapted\nboundary layer schemes and a dynamical core that takes into account the\ndependence of the heat capacity at constant pressure with temperature.\n  The new Venus model is able to simulate a super-rotation phenomenon in the\ncloud region quantitatively similar to the one observed. The mechanisms\nmaintaining the strong winds in the cloud region were found in the model\nresults to be a combination of zonal mean circulation, thermal tides and\ntransient waves. In this process, the semi-diurnal tide excited in the upper\nclouds has a key contribution in transporting axial angular momentum mainly\nfrom the upper atmosphere towards the cloud region. The magnitude of the\nsuper-rotation in the cloud region is sensitive to various radiative parameters\nsuch as the amount of solar radiative energy absorbed by the surface, which\ncontrols the static stability near the surface. In this work, we also discuss\nthe main difficulties in representing the flow below the cloud base in Venus\natmospheric models.\n  Our new radiative scheme is more suitable for 3D Venus climate models than\nthose used in previous work due to its easy adaptability to different\natmospheric conditions. This flexibility of the model was crucial to explore\nthe uncertainties in the lower atmospheric conditions and may also be used in\nthe future to explore, for example, dynamical-radiative-microphysical\nfeedbacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 13:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

We experiment with real-world mobility datasets obtained from the\nTransport For London authority and the San Francisco Cabs network, and present\na novel methodology based on time series modeling that is geared to forecast\ntraffic volumes in regions of interest and to detect mobility anomalies in\nthem. In the presence of anomalies, we also make enhanced traffic volume\npredictions by feeding our model with additional information from correlated\nregions. Finally, we present and evaluate a mobile app prototype, called\nMobility Data Donors (MDD), in terms of computation, communication, and energy\noverhead, demonstrating the real-world deployability of our techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 14:31:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2016 15:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-11"}

Arguably\nseveral thousands of papers are dedicated to image denoising. In the past\ndecade, sate-of-the-art denoising algorithm have been clearly dominated by\nnon-local patch-based methods, which explicitly exploit patch self-similarity\nwithin image. However, in recent two years, discriminatively trained local\napproaches have started to outperform previous non-local models and have been\nattracting increasing attentions due to the additional advantage of\ncomputational efficiency. Successful approaches include cascade of shrinkage\nfields (CSF) and trainable nonlinear reaction diffusion (TNRD). These two\nmethods are built on filter response of linear filters of small size using feed\nforward architectures. Due to the locality inherent in local approaches, the\nCSF and TNRD model become less effective when noise level is high and\nconsequently introduces some noise artifacts. In order to overcome this\nproblem, in this paper we introduce a multi-scale strategy. To be specific, we\nbuild on our newly-developed TNRD model, adopting the multi-scale pyramid image\nrepresentation to devise a multi-scale nonlinear diffusion process. As\nexpected, all the parameters in the proposed multi-scale diffusion model,\nincluding the filters and the influence functions across scales, are learned\nfrom training data through a loss based approach. Numerical results on Gaussian\nand Poisson denoising substantiate that the exploited multi-scale strategy can\nsuccessfully boost the performance of the original TNRD model with single\nscale. As a consequence, the resulting multi-scale diffusion models can\nsignificantly suppress the typical incorrect features for those noisy images\nwith heavy noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 14:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-22"}

Assessment of these\nfunctionalities often requires the detection of highly spatially resolved\nin-plane wavefields, which for reticulated or porous structural assemblies is\nan open challenge. A Digital Image Correlation approach is implemented that\ntracks small displacements of the lattice nodes by centering image subsets\nabout the lattice intersections. A high speed camera records the motion of the\npoints by properly interleaving subsequent frames thus artificially enhancing\nthe available sampling rate. This, along with an imaging stitching procedure,\nenables the capturing of a field of view that is sufficiently large for\nsubsequent processing. The transient response is recorded in the form of the\nfull wavefields, which are processed to unveil features of wave motion in a\nhexagonal lattice. Time snapshots and frequency contours in the spatial Fourier\ndomain are compared with numerical predictions to illustrate the accuracy of\nthe recorded wavefields and demonstrate the suitability of this technique for\nthe experimental characterization of wave properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 18:38:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-29"}

Adapting a technique developed in software testing to this\nproblem provides a simple way to produce useful partial verification problems,\nwith a resulting decrease in average time until a counterexample is produced.\nIf no counterexample is found, partial verification results can also be useful\nin practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 22:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}
