Here, we present such a physical mechanism (General growth law), which\nrepresents a new physical law of nature acting at cellular, organ, system and\nwhole organism levels, directing growth and reproduction together with\nbiomolecular mechanisms. It imposes uniquely defined constraints on\ndistribution of nutrients between biomass production and maintenance, thus\ndefining the composition of biochemical reactions, their change and\nirreversibility during the organismal life cycle. Mathematically, this law is\nrepresented by the growth equation. Using this equation, we introduce growth\nmodels and explain division mechanisms for unicellular organisms. High adequacy\nof obtained results to experiments proves validity of the General growth law\nand of the new physical paradigm of Life based on this law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2016 16:45:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2017 01:47:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2018 20:04:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 1 Jun 2018 21:24:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-05"}

Then, following the\nwork of Barlow, we find a succession of larger scales on which certain\nfunctional and elliptic estimates hold.

It was originally\nthought that managed lanes would improve the use of existing infrastructure\nthrough incentivization of demand-management behaviors like carpooling, but\nimplementations have often been characterized by unpredicted phenomena that is\noften to detrimental system performance.\n  This paper presents several macroscopic traffic modeling tools we have used\nfor study of freeways equipped with managed lanes, or \"managed lane-freeway\nnetworks.\" The proposed framework is based on the widely-used first-order\nkinematic wave theory. In this model, the GP and the managed lanes are modeled\nas parallel links connected by nodes, where certain type of traffic may switch\nbetween GP and managed lane links. Two types of managed lane topologies are\nconsidered: full-access, where vehicles can switch between the GP and the\nmanaged lanes anywhere; and separated, where such switching is allowed only at\ncertain locations called gates.\n  We also describe methods to incorporate in three phenomena into our model\nthat are particular to managed lane-freeway networks. The inertia effect\nreflects drivers' inclination to stay in their lane as long as possible and\nswitch only if this would obviously improve their travel condition. The\nfriction effect reflects the empirically-observed driver fear of moving fast in\na managed lane while traffic in the adjacent GP lanes moves slowly due to\ncongestion. The smoothing effect describes how managed lanes can increase\nthroughput at bottlenecks by reducing lane changes.

The\nsource, compact at Very Large Array (VLA) resolution, is resolved on the\nmilliarcsec scale, showing a central region plus two extended structures. The\nrelatively high brightness temperature of all components (5x10^6-1.3x10^8 K)\nsupports the hypothesis that the radio emission is non-thermal and likely\nproduced by a relativistic jet and/or small radio lobes. The observed radio\nmorphology, the lack of a significant core and the presence of a low frequency\n(230 MHz) spectral turnover are reminiscent of the Compact Steep Spectrum\nsources (CSS). However, the linear size of the source (~0.5kpc) measured from\nthe EVN map is lower than the value predicted using the turnover/size relation\nvalid for CSS sources (~6kpc). This discrepancy can be explained by an\nadditional component not detected in our observations, accounting for about a\nquarter of the total source flux density, combined to projection effects.

We aim to construct a method which takes into\naccount how the flaring shape of the scattering surface of an (optically thick)\nprotoplanetary disk projects onto the image plane of the observer. This allows\nus to map physical quantities (scattering radius and scattering angle) onto\nscattered light images and retrieve stellar irradiation corrected (r^2-scaled)\nimages and dust phase functions. We apply the method on archival polarized\nintensity images of the protoplanetary disk around HD 100546 that were obtained\nwith VLT/SPHERE in R'-band and VLT/NACO in H- and Ks-band. The brightest side\nof the r^2-scaled R'-band polarized intensity image of HD 100546 changes from\nthe far to the near side of the disk when a flaring instead of a geometrically\nflat disk surface is used for the r^2-scaling. The decrease in polarized\nsurface brightness in the scattering angle range of ~40-70 deg is likely a\nresult of the dust phase function and degree of polarization which peak in\ndifferent scattering angle regimes. The derived phase functions show part of a\nforward scattering peak which indicates that large, aggregate dust grains\ndominate the scattering opacity in the disk surface. Projection effects of a\nprotoplanetary disk surface need to be taken into account to correctly\ninterpret scattered light images. Applying the correct scaling for the\ncorrection of stellar irradiation is crucial for the interpretation of the\nimages and the derivation of the dust properties in the disk surface layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2016 20:00:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

We find that, without the presence of the\nAFM tip, the diffusions between the two HUCs are almost symmetric with the\nenergy barrier of about 1 eV in the both directions. The diffusion is a\ntwo-step process with an intermediate metastable configuration in which the Ag\natom is at the boundary of the HUCs. With the presence of the tip, we find that\nthe reaction pathways are essentially the same, but the energy barrier in one\ndirection is substantially reduced to be 0.2 - 0.4 eV by the tip, while that of\nthe diffusion in the reverse direction remains larger than 1 eV. The Si tip\nreduces the energy barrier more than the Pt tip due to the flexibility of the\ntip apex structure. In addition to the reduction of the barrier, the tip traps\nthe diffusing adatom preventing the diffusion in the reverse direction. Also we\nfind that the shape of the tip apex structure is important for the trapping\nability of the adatom. When the tip apex structure is blunt, the adatom\ninteracts with the tip atom other than the tip apex atom. The bond formation\nbetween the AFM tip atom and the surface adatom is essential for the atom\nmanipulation using the AFM tip. Our results show that the atom manipulation is\npossible with both the metallic and semiconducting AFM tips.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 02:36:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

Proper\ntraining can help naive subjects learn to modulate brain activity proficiently.\nHowever, training subjects typically involves abstract motor tasks and is\ntime-consuming. To improve the performance of naive subjects during motor\nimagery, a novel paradigm was presented that would guide naive subjects to\nmodulate brain activity effectively. In this new paradigm, pictures of the left\nor right hand were used as cues for subjects to finish the motor imagery task.\nFourteen healthy subjects (11 male, aged 22-25 years, mean 23.6+/-1.16)\nparticipated in this study.

Combining these two effects, we show a phase transition\nbehavior in the transmission rate required for stabilization using a given\nevent-triggering strategy. For small values of the delay, the timing\ninformation carried by the triggering events is substantial, and the system can\nbe stabilized with any positive rate. When the delay exceeds a critical\nthreshold, the timing information alone is not enough to achieve stabilization\nand the required rate grows. When the loss of information due to the\ncommunication delay perfectly compensates the implicit information carried by\nthe triggering events, the delay equals the inverse of the entropy rate of the\nplant, and we obtain the same rate requirement prescribed by the data-rate\ntheorem.

This\nmethodology is applied to 21 years of daily gridded sea-surface height (SSH)\ndata to obtain daily maps of the locations of the fronts. By forming\n`heat-maps' of the frontal occurrence frequency and then approximating these\nheat-maps by a superposition of simple functions, the time-mean locations of\nthe fronts, as well as a measure of their capacity to meander, are obtained and\nrelated to the frontal locations found by previous studies.\n  The spatial and temporal variability of the frontal structure is then\nconsidered. The number of fronts is found to be highly variable throughout the\nSouthern Ocean, increasing (`splitting') downstream of large bathymetric\nfeatures and decreasing (`merging') in regions where the fronts are tightly\ncontrolled by the underlying topography. In contrast, frontal meandering\nremains relatively constant. Contrary to many previous studies, little no\nsouthward migration of the fronts over the 1993-2014 time period is found, and\nthere is only weak sensitivity to atmospheric forcing related to SAM or ENSO.\nThe reasons for the discrepancy between this study and previous studies using\ncontour methods are investigated and it is shown that the spatial variability\nof the frontal structure is not tied to the underlying sea-surface height. It\nis argued that the results of studies using sea-surface height contours to\ndefine front must be interpreted with care.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 07:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-03"}

In particular, the Cassini mission\nto Saturn, which has been in orbit around the ringed planet since 2004, has\nrevolutionized our understanding of the planet. The current review updates a\nprevious review by Del Genio et al (2009; Saturn Atmospheric Structure and\nDynamics, Chapter 7 of \"Saturn from Cassini-Huygens\"), written after Cassini's\nprimary mission phase that ended in 2008, by focusing on the north polar region\nof Saturn and comparing it to the southern high latitudes. Two prominent\nfeatures in the northern high latitudes are the northern hexagon and the north\npolar vortex; we extensively review observational and theoretical\ninvestigations to date of both features. We also review the seasonal evolution\nof the polar regions using the observational data accumulated during the\nCassini mission since 2004 (shortly after the northern winter solstice in\n2002), through the equinox in 2009, and approaching the next solstice in 2017.\nWe conclude the current review by listing unanswered questions and describing\nthe observations of the polar regions planned for the Grand Finale phase of the\nCassini mission between 2016 and 2017.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 08:08:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2016 16:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

Explaining the accelerated expansion of the Universe is one of the\nfundamental challenges in physics today. Cosmography provides information about\nthe evolution of the universe derived from measured distances, assuming only\nthat the space time ge- ometry is described by the\nFriedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric, and adopting an approach that\neffectively uses only Taylor expansions of basic observables. Aims. We perform\na high-redshift analysis to constrain the cosmographic expansion up to the\nfifth order. It is based on the Union2 type Ia supernovae data set, the\ngamma-ray burst Hubble diagram, a data set of 28 independent measurements of\nthe Hubble param- eter, baryon acoustic oscillations measurements from galaxy\nclustering and the Lyman-{\\alpha} forest in the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (BOSS), and some Gaussian priors on h and {\\Omega}M .\nMethods. We performed a statistical analysis and explored the probability\ndistributions of the cosmographic parameters. By building up their regions of\nconfidence, we maximized our likelihood function using the Markov chain Monte\nCarlo method. Results. Our high-redshift analysis confirms that the expansion\nof the Universe currently accelerates; the estimation of the jerk parameter\nindicates a possible deviation from the standard {\\Lambda}CDM cosmological\nmodel. Moreover, we investigate implications of our results for the\nreconstruction of the dark energy equation of state (EOS) by comparing the\nstandard technique of cosmography with an alternative approach based on\ngeneralized Pad\\'e approximations of the same observables. Because these\nexpansions converge better, is possible to improve the constraints on the\ncosmographic parameters and also on the dark matter EOS. Conclusions.

This MA\nequation is a fully nonlinear PDE, with a source term that is a function of the\ngradient of the solution. This nonlinear source term is an additional\ncomputational challenge that has received little attention from MA applications\nin other fields. There are two major components needed to find a solution to\nthe MA equation: a spatial discretisation and an algorithm to find a solution\nof the resulting nonlinear algebraic equations. There have been a number of\ndifferent approaches proposed in the literature to solve the MA equation but\nnone of which perform consistent comparisons across both algorithmic and\ndiscretisation differences. In this study we explore different algorithmic\nmethods for the MA equation all within the context of a finite volume spatial\ndiscretisation. We introduce a new linearisation of the MA equation that\nneglects the nonlinearities arising from the source term and show that it leads\nto a method that is fast, robust and free of tuning parameters. We present\nnumerical experiments that show methods based on this linearisation of the MA\nequation are more computationally efficient than those that rely on other\ntechniques such as a parabolic relaxation. Further, the equations resulting\nfrom a full linearisation of the MA equation, equivalent to using Newton's\nmethod, can be seen as analogous to an advection-diffusion equation. This\nallows many tools that exist for computational fluid dynamics to be re-factored\neasily to solve the MA equation. The robustness and efficiency of the newly\nintroduced method gives hope that an adaptive solver for geophysical flows\nusing mesh redistribution can be computationally feasible in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 09:27:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-03"}

Determining gas\nand dust mass-loss rates (MLRs) is important in quantifying the contribution of\nevolved stars to the enrichment of the interstellar medium. Aims: Attempt to,\nfor the first time, spectrally resolve CO thermal line emission in a small\nsample of AGB stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Methods: ALMA was used to\nobserve 2 OH/IR stars and 4 carbon stars in the LMC in the CO J= 2-1 line.\nResults: We present the first measurement of expansion velocities in\nextragalactic carbon stars. All four C-stars are detected and wind expansion\nvelocities and stellar velocities are directly measured. Mass-loss rates are\nderived from modelling the spectral energy distribution and Spitzer/IRS\nspectrum with the DUSTY code. Gas-to-dust ratios are derived that make the\npredicted velocities agree with the observed ones. The expansion velocities and\nMLRs are compared to a Galactic sample of well-studied relatively low MLRs\nstars supplemented with \"extreme\" C-stars that have properties more similar to\nthe LMC targets. Gas MLRs derived from a simple formula are significantly\nsmaller than derived from the dust modelling, indicating an order of magnitude\nunderestimate of the estimated CO abundance, time-variable mass loss, or that\nthe CO intensities in LMC stars are lower than predicted by the formula derived\nfor Galactic objects. This could be related to a stronger interstellar\nradiation field in the LMC. Conclusions: Although the LMC sample is small and\nthe comparison to Galactic stars is non-trivial because of uncertainties in\ntheir distances it appears that for C stars the wind expansion velocities in\nthe LMC are lower than in the solar neighbourhood, while the MLRs appear\nsimilar. This is in agreement with dynamical dust-driven wind models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 09:29:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-30"}

This dust imaging traces the dust-obscured star\nformation in these z~2.5 galaxies on ~1.3 kpc scales. The emission has a median\neffective radius of $R_e=0.24\" \\pm 0.02\"$, corresponding to a typical physical\nsize of $R_{e}=1.8\\pm$0.2 kpc.

Unlike rays focused\nvia a double reflection by usual grazing-incidence geometries such as the\nWolter-I, stray rays coming from off-axis sources are reflected only once by\neither the parabolic or the hyperbolic segment. Although not focused, stray\nlight may represent a major source of background and ghost images especially\nwhen observing a field of faint sources in the vicinities of another, more\nintense, just outside the field of view of the telescope. The stray light\nproblem is faced by mounting a pre-collimator in front of the mirror module, in\norder to shade a part of the reflective surfaces that may give rise to\nsingly-reflected rays. Studying the expected stray light impact, and\nconsequently designing a pre-collimator, is a typical ray-tracing problem,\nusually time and computation consuming, especially if we consider that rays\npropagate throughout a densely nested structure. This in turn requires one to\npay attention to all the possible obstructions, increasing the complexity of\nthe simulation. In contrast, approaching the problems of stray light\ncalculation from an analytical viewpoint largely simplifies the problem, and\nmay also ease the task of designing an effective pre-collimator.

Such models\npossess relatively simple structure thus used as a benchmark to promote further\nresearch. With identifiability of the network guaranteed, this paper presents\nan identification method that infers both the Boolean structure of the network\nand the internal dynamics between nodes. Identification is performed directly\nfrom data without any prior knowledge of the system, including its order. The\nproposed method solves the identification problem using Maximum a posteriori\nestimation (MAP) but with inseparable penalties for complexity, both in terms\nof element (order of nonzero connections) and group sparsity (network\ntopology). Such an approach is widely applied in Compressive Sensing (CS) and\nknown as Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL).

If some moderate assumptions on a splitting sequence\nare satisfied, each vertex set of a train track in it will represent a vertex\nof a graph which is naturally quasi-isometric to the pants graph; moreover the\nsplitting sequence gives an edge-path in this graph so, more precisely, our\ndistance estimate holds between the extreme points of this path. The present\ndistance estimate is inspired by a result of Masur, Mosher and Schleimer for\ndistances in the marking graph. However, we can apply their line of proof only\nafter some manipulation of the splitting sequence: a rearrangement, changing\nthe order the elementary moves are performed in, so that the ones producing\nDehn twists are brought together; and then an untwisting, which suppresses the\nmajority of these latter moves to give a new sequence, which does not end with\nthe same track as before, but does not include any portion that is almost\nstationary in the pants graph. The required distance is then, up to constants,\nthe number of splits occurring in the untwisted sequence.

Due to its localised nature, a direct detection of\nthis mechanism is extremely difficult. Yet, it is the leading theory explaining\nthe observed fast damping of the global transverse waves. However, at odds with\nthis theoretical prediction, recent observations indicate that in the low\namplitude regime such transverse MHD waves can also appear decay-less, a yet\nunsolved phenomenon. Recent numerical work has shown that Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities (KHI) often accompany transverse MHD waves. In this work, we\ncombine 3D MHD simulations and forward modelling to show that for currently\nachieved spatial resolution and observed small amplitudes, an apparent\ndecay-less oscillation is obtained. This effect results from the combination of\nperiodic brightenings produced by the KHI and the coherent motion of the KHI\nvortices amplified by resonant absorption. Such effect is especially clear in\nemission lines forming at temperatures that capture the boundary dynamics\nrather than the core, and reflects the low damping character of the local\nazimuthal Alfv\\'en waves resonantly coupled to the kink mode. Due to phase\nmixing, the detected period can vary depending on the emission line, with those\nsensitive to the boundary having shorter periods than those sensitive to the\nloop core. This allows to estimate the density contrast at the boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 13:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

The\nPandaX-III experiment has recently proposed a 200 kg HPXe-TPC based on\nMicromegas readout planes, to be located at the Jinping Underground Laboratory\nin China. Its detection concept is based on two results obtained within the\nT-REX project: Micromegas readouts can be built with extremely low levels of\nradioactivity; and the operation in xenon-trimethylamine at 10 bar in realistic\nexperimental conditions has proven an energy resolution of 3% FWHM at the\nregion of interest. In this work, two discrimination methods are applied to\nsimulated signal and background data in a generic 200 kg HPXe-TPC, based on two\nwell-known algorithms of graph theory: the identification of connections and\nthe search for the longest path. Rejection factors greater than 100 are\nobtained for small pixel sizes and a signal efficiency of 40%. Moreover, a new\nobservable (the blob charge density) rejects better surface contaminations,\nwhich makes the use of a trigger signal ($T_0$) not imperative in this\nexperiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 13:56:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

The theory constructs a stacking diagram\nof all possible sequences of stacks under gravity in the limit of very high\n(infinite) sample heights.

The region of the\nstacking diagram occupied by a given sequence of stacks depends on h. Hence,\ntwo samples with different heights but identical colloidal concentrations can\ndevelop different stacking sequences. In addition, the stacking diagrams for\ndifferent heights can be qualitatively different since some stacking sequences\noccur only in a given interval of sample heights.

The indistinguishability of the emitted photons emitted at zero\ntemperature are found to be in very good agreement with a previously reported\nexact diagonalization approach [Phys.~Rev.~B~87,~081308~(2013)]. Besides, our\nmethod enables the calculations of photon indistinguishability at finite\ntemperatures and for strong electron-phonon interactions. More generally, our\nmethod opens new avenues in the study of open quantum system dynamics coupled\nto non-Markovian environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 14:34:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

The experiment is being designed with an\ninitial sensitivity to nuclear recoil cross sections ~ 1 x 10$^{-43}$ cm$^2$\nfor a dark matter particle mass of 1 GeV/c$^2$, and with capacity to continue\nexploration to both smaller masses and better sensitivities. The phonon\nsensitivity of the HV detectors will be sufficient to detect nuclear recoils\nfrom sub-GeV dark matter. A detailed calibration of the detector response to\nlow energy recoils will be needed to optimize running conditions of the HV\ndetectors and to interpret their data for dark matter searches. Low-activity\nshielding, and the depth of SNOLAB, will reduce most backgrounds, but\ncosmogenically produced $^{3}$H and naturally occurring $^{32}$Si will be\npresent in the detectors at some level. Even if these backgrounds are x10\nhigher than expected, the science reach of the HV detectors would be over three\norders of magnitude beyond current results for a dark matter mass of 1\nGeV/c$^2$. The iZIP detectors are relatively insensitive to variations in\ndetector response and backgrounds, and will provide better sensitivity for dark\nmatter particle masses (> 5 GeV/c$^2$). The mix of detector types (HV and\niZIP), and targets (germanium and silicon), planned for the experiment, as well\nas flexibility in how the detectors are operated, will allow us to maximize the\nlow-mass reach, and understand the backgrounds that the experiment will\nencounter. Upgrades to the experiment, perhaps with a variety of\nultra-low-background cryogenic detectors, will extend dark matter sensitivity\ndown to the \"neutrino floor\", where coherent scatters of solar neutrinos become\na limiting background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 12:30:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

Here we\nexplore in detail the dynamical aftermath of natal kicks in binary systems,\ndetermine their possible outcomes and characterize their relative frequency,\nmaking use of analytic arguments and detailed population synthesis models. In a\nfraction of the cases the kick may cast the NS in such a trajectory as to\ncollide with the binary companion, or pass sufficiently close to it as to\ndisrupt it (micro tidal disruption event; $\\mu$TDE), or alternatively it could\nbe tidally-captured into a close orbit, eventually forming an X-ray binary.

For increased laser intensity a secondary plateau emerges with\nquasi-continuous spectrum of harmonics extending beyond the 50th order.\nConsistently with experimental observations, we find that the cutoff energy for\nHHG scales linearly with the peak field strength and derivation of the cutoff\nlaw is provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 07:42:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 15:13:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2017 14:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-23"}

Mathematical modeling, computation and analysis of\nmembrane channel charge transport have become an emergent field and give rise\nto significant contributions to our understanding of ion channel gating and\nfunction. This review summarizes recent progresses and outlines remaining\nchallenges in mathematical modeling, simulation and analysis of ion channel\ncharge transport. One of our focuses is the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) model\nand its generalizations. Specifically, the basic framework of the PNP system\nand some of its extensions, including size effects, ion-water interactions,\ncoupling with density functional theory and relation to fluid flow models. A\nreduced theory, the Poisson- Boltzmann-Nernst-Planck (PBNP) model, and a\ndifferential geometry based ion transport model are also discussed. For proton\nchannel, a multiscale and multiphysics Poisson-Boltzmann-Kohn-Sham (PBKS) model\nis presented. We show that all of these ion channel models can be cast into a\nunified variational multiscale framework with a macroscopic continuum domain of\nthe solvent and a microscopic discrete domain of the solute. The main strategy\nis to construct a total energy functional of a charge transport system to\nencompass the polar and nonpolar free energies of solvation and chemical\npotential related energies. Current computational algorithms and tools for\nnumerical simulations and results from mathematical analysis of ion channel\nsystems are also surveyed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2016 16:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Time\nmultiplexing of reconfigurable hardware resources raises a number of new\nissues, ranging from run-time systems to complex programming models that\nusually form a Reconfigurable hardware Operating System (ROS). The Operating\nSystem performs online task scheduling and handles resource management. There\nare many challenges in adaptive computing and dynamic reconfigurable systems.\nOne of the major understudied challenges is estimating the required resources\nin terms of soft cores, Programmable Reconfigurable Regions (PRRs), the\nappropriate communication infrastructure, and to predict a near optimal layout\nand floorplan of the reconfigurable logic fabric. Some of these issues are\nspecific to the application being designed, while others are more general and\nrelate to the underlying run-time environment. Static resource allocation for\nRun- Time Reconfiguration (RTR) often leads to inferior and unacceptable\nresults. In this paper, we present a novel adaptive and dynamic methodology,\nbased on a Machine Learning approach, for predicting and estimating the\nnecessary resources for an application based on past historical information. An\nimportant feature of the proposed methodology is that the system is able to\nlearn and generalize and, therefore, is expected to improve its accuracy over\ntime. The goal of the entire process is to extract useful hidden knowledge from\nthe data. This knowledge is the prediction and estimation of the necessary\nresources for an unknown or not previously seen application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2016 21:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Similar to most e-commerce or digital entertainment\nfirms, arts presenters need to recommend the right performance to the right\ncustomer at the right time. As part of the Michigan Data Science Team (MDST),\nwe partnered with the University Musical Society (UMS), a non-profit performing\narts presenter housed in the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. We are\nproviding UMS with analysis and business intelligence, utilizing historical\nindividual-level sales data. We built a recommendation system based on\ncollaborative filtering, gaining insights into the artistic preferences of\ncustomers, along with the similarities between performances. To better\nunderstand audience behavior, we used statistical methods from customer-base\nanalysis. We characterized customer heterogeneity via segmentation, and we\nmodeled customer cohorts to understand and predict ticket purchasing patterns.\nFinally, we combined statistical modeling with natural language processing\n(NLP) to explore the impact of wording in program descriptions. These ongoing\nefforts provide a platform to launch targeted marketing campaigns, helping UMS\ncarry out its mission by allocating its resources more efficiently. Celebrating\nits 138th season, UMS is a 2014 recipient of the National Medal of Arts, and it\ncontinues to enrich communities by connecting world-renowned artists with\ndiverse audiences, especially students in their formative years.
