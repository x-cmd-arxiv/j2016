We\nreport on student numbers, programming paradigm, programming languages and\nenvironment/tools used, as well as the underpinning rationale for these\nchoices.

Computational chemistry has branched\ninto two major fields with methodologies based on quantum mechanics and\nclassical force fields. However, there are significant shadowy areas not\ncovered by any of the available methods. Many relevant systems are often too\nbig for traditional quantum chemical methods while being chemically too complex\nfor classical force fields. Examples include systems in nanomedicine, studies\nof metalloproteins, etc. There is an urgent need to develop fast quantum\nchemical methods able to study large and complex systems. This work is a\nproof-of-concept on the numerical techniques required to develop accurate and\ncomputationally efficient algorithms for the fast calculation of\nelectron-repulsion integrals, one of the most significant bottlenecks in the\nextension of quantum chemistry to large systems. All concepts and calculations\nwere developed for the three-center integral (pxApxB|pxCpxC) with all atoms\nbeing carbon. Starting with the analytical formulae, convenient decompositions\nwere tested to provide smooth two-dimensional surfaces that were easily fitted.\nThe approximating algorithm consisted of a multilayered approach based on\nmultiple fittings of two-dimensional surfaces. An important aspect of the new\nmethod is its independence on the number of contracted Gaussian primitives. The\nbasis set of choice was STO-6G. In future developments, larger basis sets will\nbe developed. This work is part of a large effort aimed at improving the\ninadequacies of existing computational chemistry methods, both based on quantum\nmechanics and classical force fields, in particular in describing large and\nheterogeneous systems (ex. metalloproteins).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 16:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-22"}

We present simulations that were designed to test\nthis idea by following the growth process from km-sized objects located between\n0.7 to 1.0 au up to terrestrial planets. The simulations explore initial\nconditions where the solids in the disk are planetesimals with radii initially\nbetween 3 and 300 km, alternately including effects from a dissipating gaseous\nsolar nebula and collisional fragmentation. We use a new Lagrangian code known\nas LIPAD (Levison et al. 2012), which is a particle-based code that models the\nfragmentation, accretion and dynamical evolution of a large number of\nplanetesimals, and can model the entire growth process from km-sizes up to\nplanets. A suite of large (Mars mass) planetary embryos is complete in only 1\nMyr, containing most of the system mass. A quiescent period then persists for\n10-20 Myr characterized by slow diffusion of the orbits and continued accretion\nof the remaining planetesimals. This is interupted by an instability that leads\nto embryos crossing orbits and embyro-embryo impacts that eventually produce\nthe final set of planets. While this evolution is different than that found in\nother works exploring an annulus, the final planetary systems are similar, with\nroughly the correct number of planets and good Mars-analogs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 17:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-22"}

In all real-world speech applications, the text\nnormalization engine is developed---in large part---by hand. For example, a\nhand-built grammar may be used to enumerate the possible ways of saying a given\ntoken in a given language, and a statistical model used to select the most\nappropriate pronunciation in context. In this study we examine the tradeoffs\nassociated with using more or less language-specific domain knowledge in a text\nnormalization engine. In the most data-rich scenario, we have access to a\ncarefully constructed hand-built normalization grammar that for any given token\nwill produce a set of all possible verbalizations for that token. We also\nassume a corpus of aligned written-spoken utterances, from which we can train a\nranking model that selects the appropriate verbalization for the given context.\nAs a substitute for the carefully constructed grammar, we also consider a\nscenario with a language-universal normalization \\emph{covering grammar}, where\nthe developer merely needs to provide a set of lexical items particular to the\nlanguage. As a substitute for the aligned corpus, we also consider a scenario\nwhere one only has the spoken side, and the corresponding written side is\n\"hallucinated\" by composing the spoken side with the inverted normalization\ngrammar.

A combined\nfit of the near-side peak and long-range correlations is applied to the data\nand the peak shape is quantified by the variance of the distributions.

Our approach is premised on a simple observation: applications view\nstorage systems as black-boxes that transition through a series of states, a\nsubset of which are observed by applications. For maximum clarity, isolation\nand consistency guarantees should be expressed as constraints on those states.\nInstead, these properties are currently expressed as constraints on operation\nhistories that are not visible to the application. We show that adopting a\nstate-based approach to expressing these guarantees brings forth several\nbenefits. First, it makes it easier to focus on the anomalies that a given\nisolation or consistency level allows (and that applications must deal with),\nrather than those that it proscribes. Second, it unifies the often disparate\ntheories of isolation and consistency and provides a structure for composing\nthese guarantees. We leverage this modularity to apply to transactions\n(independently of the isolation level under which they execute) the equivalence\nbetween causal consistency and session guarantees that Chockler et al. had\nproved for single operations. Third, it brings clarity to the increasingly\ncrowded field of proposed consistency and isolation properties by winnowing\nspurious distinctions: we find that the recently proposed parallel snapshot\nisolation introduced by Sovran et al. is in fact a specific implementation of\nan older guarantee, lazy consistency (or PL-2+), introduced by Adya et al.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 18:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-22"}

River\nbed-load transport is a kind of dense granular flow, and such flows are known\nto vertically segregate grains. The contribution of granular physics to\nriver-bed armoring, however, has not been investigated. Here we examine these\nconnections in a laboratory river with bimodal sediment size, by tracking the\nmotion of particles from the surface to deep inside the bed, and find that\narmor develops by two distinct mechanisms. Bed-load transport in the\nnear-surface layer drives rapid segregation, with a vertical advection rate\nproportional to the granular shear rate. Creeping grains beneath the bed-load\nlayer give rise to slow but persistent segregation, which is diffusion\ndominated and insensitive to shear rate. We verify these findings with a\ncontinuum phenomenological model and discrete element method simulations.

The density on each link has first order\ndynamics driven by the difference of its incoming and outgoing flows. A link\nirreversibly fails if it reaches its jam density. Such failures may propagate\nin the network and cause a systemic failure. We show that larger link\ncapacities do not necessarily help in preventing systemic failures under local\nrouting. Accordingly, we propose the use of variable speed limits to operate\nthe links below their capacities, when necessary, to compensate for the lack of\nglobal information and coordination in routing decisions. Our main result shows\nthat systemic failures under feasible external inflows can always be averted\nthrough a proper selection of speed limits if the routing decisions are\nsufficiently responsive to local congestion and the network is initially\nuncongested. This is an attractive feature as it is much easier in practice to\nadjust the speed limits than to build more physical capacity or to alter\nrouting decisions that are determined by social behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 19:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-22"}

Aims: We seek to constrain the surface\ndensity of warm gas in the disk of HD 139614, a Herbig Ae star with a\ntransition disk exhibiting a dust gap from 2.3 to 6 AU. Methods: We have\nobtained ESO/VLT CRIRES high-resolution spectra of CO ro-vibrational emission.\nWe derived constraints on the disk's structure by modeling the line-profiles,\nthe spectroastrometric signal, and the rotational diagrams using flat Keplerian\ndisk models. Results: We detected v=1-0 12CO, 2-1 12CO, 1-0 13CO, 1-0 C18O, and\n1-0 C17O ro-vibrational lines. 12CO v=1-0 lines have an average width of 14\nkm/s, Tgas of 450 K and an emitting region from 1 to 15 AU. 13CO and C18O lines\nare on average 70 and 100 K colder, 1 and 4 km/s narrower, and are dominated by\nemission at R>6 AU. The 12CO v=1-0 line-profile indicates that if there is a\ngap in the gas it must be narrower than 2 AU.

The first theory states\nthat a current has an electric charge relative to its moving observer. The\nsecond theory states that the magnetic force is an electric force in origin.\nThe new current representation characterizes a current as equal amounts of\npositive and negative point charges moving in opposite directions at the speed\nof light. Previous work regarded electricity and magnetism as different aspects\nof the same subject. One effort was made by Johnson to unify the origin of\nelectricity and magnetism, but this effort yielded a formula that is unequal to\nthe well-known magnetic force law. The explanation provided for the magnetic\nforce depends on three factors: 1) representing the electric current as charges\nmoving at the speed of light, 2) considering the relative velocity between\nmoving charges, and 3) analyzing the electric field spreading in the space due\nto the movement of charges inside current elements. The electric origin of the\nmagnetic force is proved by deriving the magnetic force law and Biot-Savart law\nusing the electric force law. This paper is helpful for unifying the concepts\nof magnetism and electricity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 20:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-23"}

Developing an efficient\nand accurate docking method that expands FFT based sampling to 5 rotational\ncoordinates is an extensively studied but still unsolved problem. The algorithm\npresented here retains the accuracy of earlier methods but yields at least\ntenfold speedup. The improvement is due to two innovations. First, the search\nspace is treated as the product manifold $\\mathbf{SO(3)x(SO(3)\\setminus S^1)}$,\nwhere $\\mathbf{SO(3)}$ is the rotation group representing the space of the\nrotating ligand, and $\\mathbf{(SO(3)\\setminus S^1)}$ is the space spanned by\nthe two Euler angles that define the orientation of the vector from the center\nof the fixed receptor toward the center of the ligand. This representation\nenables the use of efficient FFT methods developed for $\\mathbf{SO(3)}$.\nSecond, we select the centers of highly populated clusters of docked\nstructures, rather than the lowest energy conformations, as predictions of the\ncomplex, and hence there is no need for very high accuracy in energy\nevaluation. Therefore it is sufficient to use a limited number of spherical\nbasis functions in the Fourier space, which increases the efficiency of\nsampling while retaining the accuracy of docking results.

Flying insects such as honeybees perform\nvertical landings by keeping flow divergence constant. This leads to an\nexponential decay of both height and vertical velocity, and allows for smooth\nand safe landings. However, the presence of noise and delay in obtaining flow\ndivergence estimates will cause instability of the landing when the control\ngains are not adapted to the height. In this paper, we propose a strategy that\ndeals with this fundamental problem of optical flow control. The key to the\nstrategy lies in the use of a recent theory that allows the MAV to see distance\nby means of its control instability. At the start of a landing, the MAV detects\nthe height by means of an oscillating movement and sets the control gains\naccordingly. Then, during descent, the gains are reduced exponentially, with\nmechanisms in place to reduce or increase the gains if the actual trajectory\ndeviates too much from an ideal constant divergence landing. Real-world\nexperiments demonstrate stable landings of the MAV in both indoor and windy\noutdoor environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 22:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-23"}

The SSD approach used in this work employs a second-order closure which\nisolates the interaction between the streamwise mean and the equivalent of the\nperturbation covariance. This closure restricts nonlinearity in the SSD to that\nexplicitly retained in the streamwise constant mean together with nonlinear\ninteractions between the mean and the perturbation covariance. This dynamical\nrestriction, in which explicit perturbation-perturbation nonlinearity is\nremoved from the perturbation equation, results in a simplified dynamics\nreferred to as the restricted nonlinear (RNL) dynamics. RNL systems in which an\nensemble of a finite number of realizations of the perturbation equation share\nthe same mean flow provide tractable approximations to the equivalently\ninfinite ensemble RNL system. The infinite ensemble system, referred to as the\nS3T, introduces new analysis tools for studying turbulence. The RNL with a\nsingle ensemble member can be alternatively viewed as a realization of RNL\ndynamics. RNL systems provide computationally efficient means to approximate\nthe SSD, producing self-sustaining turbulence exhibiting qualitative features\nsimilar to those observed in direct numerical simulations (DNS) despite its\ngreatly simplified dynamics. Finally, we show that RNL turbulence can be\nsupported by as few as a single streamwise varying component interacting with\nthe streamwise constant mean flow and that judicious selection of this\ntruncated support, or \"band-limiting\", can be used to improve quantitative\naccuracy of RNL turbulence.

One approach is the attention-based encoder-decoder framework that\nlearns a mapping between variable-length input and output sequences in one step\nusing a purely data-driven method. The attention model has often been shown to\nimprove the performance over another end-to-end approach, the Connectionist\nTemporal Classification (CTC), mainly because it explicitly uses the history of\nthe target character without any conditional independence assumptions. However,\nwe observed that the performance of the attention has shown poor results in\nnoisy condition and is hard to learn in the initial training stage with long\ninput sequences. This is because the attention model is too flexible to predict\nproper alignments in such cases due to the lack of left-to-right constraints as\nused in CTC. This paper presents a novel method for end-to-end speech\nrecognition to improve robustness and achieve fast convergence by using a joint\nCTC-attention model within the multi-task learning framework, thereby\nmitigating the alignment issue.

However, the direct\nobservational study of MR at null-points is largely lacking. Here, we show the\nobservations of MR around a magnetic null associated with an eruption that\nresulted in an M1.7 flare and a coronal mass ejection. The GOES X- ray profile\nof the flare exhibited two peaks at 02:23 UT and 02:40 UT on 2012 November 8,\nrespectively. Based on the imaging observations, we find that the first and\nalso primary X- ray peak was originated from MR in the current sheet underneath\nthe erupting magnetic flux rope (MFR). On the other hand, the second and also\nweaker X-ray peak was caused by MR around a null-point located above the\npre-eruption MFR. The interaction of the null-point and the erupting MFR can be\ndescribed as a two-step process. During the first step, the erupting and fast\nexpanding MFR passed through the null-point, resulting in a significant\ndisplacement of the magnetic field surrounding the null. During the second\nstep, the displaced magnetic field started to move back, resulting in a\nconverging inflow and subsequently the MR around the null. The null-point\nreconnection is a different process from the current sheet reconnection in this\nflare; the latter is the cause of the main peak of the flare, while the former\nis the cause of the secondary peak of the flare and the conspicuous high-lying\ncusp structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 00:40:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 01:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

For each mesh, the CDG approximate solutions\non its dual mesh are used to calculate the flux values in the cell and on the\ncell boundary so that the approximate solutions on mutually dual meshes are\ncoupled with each other, and the use of numerical flux may be avoided. The WENO\nlimiter is adaptively implemented via two steps: the \"troubled\" cells are first\nidentified by using a modified TVB minmod function, and then the WENO technique\nis used to locally reconstruct new polynomials of degree $(2K+1)$ replacing the\nCDG solutions inside the \"troubled' cells by the cell average values of the CDG\nsolutions in the neighboring cells as well as the original cell averages of the\n\"troubled\" cells.

The\ncouplings between the ground and excited states of the two central qubits are\ninversely proportional making them fully asynchronized and allowing for\ncoherent manipulation and gate operations.

The coupling to the continuum is\ndiscussed using the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. At weak continuum\ncoupling, all internal states uniformly acquire small decay widths. This\nchanges dramatically as the coupling strength increases: the width distribution\nundergoes a sharp restructuring and is no longer uniformly divided among the\neigenstates. Two broad resonances localized at the ends of the wire are formed.\nThese superradiant states (analogous to Dicke states in quantum optics),\neffectively protect the remaining internal states from decaying into the\ncontinuum and hence increase the lifetime of the qubit.

We present a novel approach to detect sets of\nmost recent changepoints in such panel data which aims to pool information\nacross time-series, so that we preferentially infer a most recent change at the\nsame time-point in multiple series. Our approach is computationally efficient\nas it involves analysing each time-series independently to obtain a profile\nlikelihood like quantity that summarises the evidence for the series having\neither no change or a specific value for its most recent changepoint. We then\npost-process this output from each time-series to obtain a potentially small\nset of times for the most recent changepoints, and, for each time, the set of\nseries which has their most recent changepoint at that time.

These\ntwo results simplify, unify, and generalize results of [Arieli and Babichenko,\n2016] and [Babichenko and Barman, 2016], extending them from a binary state of\nnature to many states (modulo the additive loss in the latter result). Third,\nwe consider the binary-state case with a submodular objective, and simplify and\nslightly strengthen the result of [Babichenko and Barman, 2016] to obtain a\n(1-1/e)-approximation via an explicitly constructed scheme.\n  When only a public signal is allowed, our results are negative. First, we\nshow that it is NP-hard to approximate the optimal public scheme, within any\nconstant factor, even when the objective is additive. Second, we show that the\noptimal private scheme can outperform the optimal public scheme, in terms of\nmaximizing the sender's objective, by a polynomial factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 05:39:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 May 2017 01:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-16"}

In doing so,\nextra uncertainties may arise during the inversion processes. The proposed SHM\nframework avoids such intermediate inversion processes by adopting amplitude\nversus angle (AVA) data. In addition, SHM typically involves assimilating a\nlarge amount of observed seismic attributes into reservoir models. To handle\nthe big-data problem in SHM, the proposed framework adopts the following\nwavelet-based sparse representation procedure: First, a discrete wavelet\ntransform is applied to observed seismic attributes. Then, uncertainty analysis\nis conducted in the wavelet domain to estimate noise in the resulting wavelet\ncoefficients, and to calculate a corresponding threshold value. Wavelet\ncoefficients above the threshold value, called leading wavelet coefficients\nhereafter, are used as the data for history matching. The retained leading\nwavelet coefficients preserve the most salient features of the observed seismic\nattributes, whereas rendering a substantially smaller data size.

Our main contribution is a framework for\nnon-discriminatory pricing in the presence of production costs: the framework\nyields posted price mechanisms with O(1)-approximation factors for fractionally\nsubadditive (XoS) buyers, logarithmic approximations for subadditive buyers,\nand also extends to settings where the seller is oblivious to buyer valuations.\nOur work presents the first known results for Bayesian settings with production\ncosts and is among the few posted price mechanisms that do not charge buyers\ndifferently for the same good.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 07:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-23"}

Convergecast is a many-to-one\ncooperative scheme where each node of the network transmits data towards the\nsame sink. Our contribution is threefold. First, we stress existing WBAN\nconvergecast strategies with respect to their capacity to be reliable and to\nensure the total order delivery at sink. That is, packets sent in a specific\norder should be received in the same order by the sink. When stressed with\ntransmission rates up to 500 packets per second the performances of these\nstrategies decrease dramatically (more than 90% of packets lost). Secondly, we\npropose a new posture-centric model for WBAN. This model offers a good\ncharacterization of the path availability which is further used to fine tune\nthe retransmission rate thresholds. Third, based on our model we propose a new\nmechanism for reliability and a new converge-cast strategy that outperforms\nWBAN dedicated strategies but also strategies adapted from DTN and WSN areas.\nOur extensive performance evaluations use essential parameters for WBAN: packet\nlost, total order reliability (messages sent in a specific order should be\ndelivered in that specific order) and various human body postures.

I explain how this field theory\nleads to dynamical equations which contain an infinite number of fields defined\non a space time with an infinite number of coordinates. I then show that these\nunique dynamical equations, when truncated to low level fields and the usual\ncoordinates of space time, lead to precisely the equations of motion of eleven\ndimensional supergravity theory. By taking different group decompositions of\nE11 we find all the maximal supergravity theories, including the gauged maximal\nsupergravities, and as a result the non-linear realisation should be thought of\nas a unified theory that is the low energy effective action for type II strings\nand branes.

If the\neffect of ambipolar diffusion is considered, these filaments lose magnetic\nsupport initiating cloud collapse. The filaments do not lose magnetic flux.\nRather the magnetic flux is redistributed within the filament from the centre\ntowards the envelope.\n  The rate of the collapse is inversely proportional to the fractional\nionisation and two gravitationally-driven ambipolar diffusion regimes for the\ncollapse are observed as predicted in Mouschovias & Morton (1991). For high\nvalues of the ionisation coefficient, that is $X \\geq 10^{-7}$, the gas is\nstrongly coupled to the magnetic field and the Jeans length is larger than the\nambipolar diffusion length scale. Then the collapse is governed by\nmagnetically-regulated ambipolar diffusion. For $X \\lesssim 10^{-8}$, the gas\nis weakly coupled to the magnetic field and the magnetic support is removed by\ngravitationally-dominated ambipolar diffusion. Here, neutrals and ions only\ncollide sporadically, that is the ambipolar diffusion length scale is larger\nthan the Jeans length.\n  When decaying turbulence is included, additional support is provided to the\nfilament. This slows down the collapse of the filament even in the absence of a\nmagnetic field. When a magnetic field is present, the collapse rate increases\nby a ratio smaller than for the non-magnetic case. This is because of a\nspeed-up of the ambipolar diffusion due to larger magnetic field gradients\ngenerated by the turbulence and because the ambipolar diffusion aids the\ndissipation of turbulence below the ambipolar diffusion length scale.

The approach is\ndemonstrated by performing long term annealing on sputtered Zr/Nb nanoscale\nmetallic multilayers and investigating the evolution of their microstructure\nand mechanical properties by combining analytical transmission electron\nmicroscopy, nano-mechanical tests and finite element models. As-deposited\nmultilayers were annealed at 350 C in air for times ranging between 1 - 336\nhours. The elastic modulus increased by approx. 20% and the hardness by approx.\n42% after 15 hours of annealing. Longer annealing times did not lead to changes\nin hardness, although the elastic modulus increased up to 35% after 336 hrs.\nThe hcp Zr layers were rapidly transformed into monoclinic ZrO2 (in the first\n15 hours), while the Nb layers were progressively oxidised, from top surface\ndown towards the substrate, to form an amorphous oxide phase at a much lower\nrate. The sequential oxidation of Zr and Nb layers was key for the oxidation to\ntake place without rupture of the multi-layered structure and without coating\nspallation, as the plastic deformation of the metallic Nb layers allowed for\nthe partial relieve of the residual stresses developed as a result of the\nvolumetric expansion of the Zr layers upon oxidation. Moreover, the development\nof residual stresses induced further changes in mechanical properties in\nrelation to the annealing time, as revealed by finite element simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 09:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-23"}

The objective function of the optimization problem encodes the merit\nfunction of the algorithm, e.g., the computational cost (possibly also\nincluding a cost component for memory requirements) of the algorithm execution.\nThe constraints of the optimization problem ensure convergence of the\nalgorithm, i.e., solution of the problem at hand.

The source exhibits diverse levels of\nvariability with many flaring/active states in the continuously sampled\n$\\gamma$-ray light curve which are also reflected in the NIR-optical light\ncurves and the sparsely sampled X-ray light curve by the \\emph{Swift}-XRT.\nMulti-band correlation analysis of this continuous segment during different\nactivity periods shows a change of state from no lags between IR and\n$\\gamma$-ray, optical and $\\gamma$-ray, and IR and optical to a state where\n$\\gamma$-ray lags the IR/optical by $\\sim$3 days. The results are consistent\nwith the previous studies of the same during various $\\gamma$-ray flaring and\nactive episodes of the source. This consistency, in turn, suggests an extended\nlocalized emission region with almost similar conditions during various\n$\\gamma$-ray activity states. On the other hand, the delay of $\\gamma$-ray with\nrespect to IR/optical and a trend similar to IR/optical in X-rays along with\nstrong broadband correlations favor magnetic field related origin with X-ray\nand $\\gamma$-ray being inverse Comptonized of IR/optical photons and external\nradiation field, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 13:10:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

In a second regime, where residences are\nconverted into another use (such as offices or stores for example), the\npopulation decreases while the number of buildings stays approximatively\nconstant. In another subsequent phase, the number of buildings and the\npopulation grow again and correspond to a re-densification of cities. We\npropose a stochastic model based on these simple mechanisms to reproduce the\nfirst two regimes and show that it is in excellent agreement with empirical\nobservations. These results bring evidences for the possibility of constructing\na minimal model that could serve as a tool for understanding quantitatively\nurbanization and the future evolution of cities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 13:53:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 14:32:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-20"}

For situations with time-dependent electromagnetic fields, which is\ndifficult to handle in traditional construction procedures of symplectic\nalgorithms, LCCSA provides a perfect explicit canonical symplectic solution by\nimplementing the discretization in 4-spacetime. We also show that LCCSA has\nbuilt-in energy-based adaptive time steps, which can optimize the computation\nperformance when the Lorentz factor varies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 15:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

The authors derive a Liouville theorem that\ndetermines the underlying phase space statistical measure, but then, through\nsome physical arguments, actually compute the equilibrium statistics using a\nmeasure that \\emph{violates} this theorem. Here, using a more convenient, but\nessentially equivalent, grand canonical approach, the full statistical theory\nconsistent with the Liouville theorem is derived. The results reveal several\nsignificant differences from the previous results: (1) The microscale wave\nmotions lead to a strongly fluctuating thermodynamics, including long-ranged\ncorrelations, in contrast to the mean-field-like behavior found by RVB. The\nfinal effective model is equivalent to that of an elastic membrane with a\nnonlinear wave-renormalized surface tension. (2) Even when a mean field\napproximation is made, a rather more complex joint probability distribution is\nrevealed. Alternative physical arguments fully support the consistency of the\nresults. Of course, the true fluid final steady state relies on dissipative\nprocesses not included in the shallow water equations, such as wave breaking\nand viscous effects, but it is argued that the current theory provides a more\nmathematically consistent starting point for future work aimed at assessing\ntheir impacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 15:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-23"}

The aim is to\ndesign schemes that minimise communication between the user and the servers.\nMore recently, there have been moves to consider more realistic models where\nthe total storage of the set of servers, or the per server storage, should be\nminimised (possibly using techniques from distributed storage), and where the\ndatabase is divided into $R$-bit records with $R>1$, and the user wishes to\nretrieve one record rather than one bit.

The nature of the bandgap becomes\nincreasingly more direct, resulting in five times faster charge carrier\nrecombination, and a doubling of the radiative efficiency. At hydrostatic\npressures above 325 MPa, MAPI undergoes a reversible phase transition resulting\nin a purely direct bandgap semiconductor. The pressure-induced changes suggest\nepitaxial and synthetic routes to higher efficiency optoelectronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 15:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-27"}

The transition is a function of the shape and\nprofile of a special cusp magnetic field which is a function of radius and\nazimuth angle, the geometry of the source, the discharge current, and pressure.\nCharacteristic atomic and molecular emission lines and bands in the C(3)\ndischarge transform into broad bands emitted by the excited soot. We identify\nfour prominent emission bands between 300 to 400 nm to be the hallmark of the\nsooting plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Sep 2016 07:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}
