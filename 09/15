This new satellite, Virgo I, which is located in the\nconstellation of Virgo, has been identified as a statistically significant (5.5\nsigma) spatial overdensity of star-like objects with a well-defined main\nsequence and red giant branch in their color-magnitude diagram. The\nsignificance of this overdensity increases to 10.8 sigma when the relevant\nisochrone filter is adopted for the search. Based on the distribution of the\nstars around the likely main sequence turn-off at r ~ 24 mag, the distance to\nVirgo I is estimated as 87 kpc, and its most likely absolute magnitude\ncalculated from a Monte Carlo analysis is M_V = -0.8 +/- 0.9 mag. This stellar\nsystem has an extended spatial distribution with a half-light radius of 38\n+12/-11 pc, which clearly distinguishes it from a globular cluster with\ncomparable luminosity. Thus, Virgo I is one of the faintest dwarf satellites\nknown and is located beyond the reach of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This\ndemonstrates the power of this survey program to identify very faint dwarf\nsatellites. This discovery of VirgoI is based only on about 100 square degrees\nof data, thus a large number of faint dwarf satellites are likely to exist in\nthe outer halo of the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 16:58:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 05:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

In this paper, we formulate a novel time-variant graph\nclassification task and propose a new graph feature, called a graph-shapelet\npattern, for learning and classifying time-variant graphs.

A\ngraph-shapelet pattern can be regarded as a graphical extension of a shapelet\n-- a class of discriminative features designed for vector-based temporal data\nclassification.

This family contains all\nof the known breaking wave equations, including the integrable ones:\nCamassa-Holm equation, Degasperis-Procesi equation, Novikov equation, and\nFORQ/modified Camassa-Holm equation. One main result is to show that all of the\nequations in the general family possess weak solutions given by multi-peakons\nwhich are a linear superposition of peakons with time-dependent amplitudes and\npositions. In particular, neither an integrability structure nor a Hamiltonian\nstructure is needed to derive $N$-peakon weak solutions for arbitrary $N>1$. As\na further result, single peakon travelling-wave solutions are shown to exist\nunder a simple condition on one of the two arbitrary functions in the general\nfamily of equations, and when this condition fails, generalized single peakon\nsolutions that have a time-dependent amplitude and a time-dependent speed are\nshown to exist. Wave breaking criteria are outlined for this general family of\npeakon equations.

The OH and CH+ lines correlate well with the high-J CO\nemission and delineate the warm and dense molecular region.

Solid\nobstacles are described using a discrete forcing approach for boundary\nconditions. Unlike traditional approaches encompassing the presence of a solid\nbody using conformal meshes and imposing no-slip boundary conditions on the\nboundary faces of the mesh, the solid body is here represented on the Eulerian\nCartesian mesh through an ad-hoc body force evaluated on a set of Lagrangian\nmarkers. The markers can move across the Eulerian mesh, hence allowing for a\nstraightforward analysis of motion or deformation of the body. The IBM method\nis described and implemented in PisoFOAM, whose Pressure-Implicit\nSplit-Operator (PISO) solver is modified accordingly. The presence of the solid\nbody and the divergence-free of the fluid velocity are imposed simultaneously\nby sub-iterating between IBM and the pressure correction step. This scheme\nallows for the use of fast optimized Poisson solvers while granting excellent\naccuracy with respect to the previously mentioned constraints. Various 2D and\n3D well-documented test cases of flows around fixed or moving circular\ncylinders are simulated and carefully validated against existing data from the\nliterature. The capability of the new solver is discussed in terms of accuracy\nand numerical performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 17:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-15"}

Far from the edge, near the center of the trap (the so\ncalled \"bulk regime\"), physical properties of the fermions have traditionally\nbeen understood using the Local Density Approximation. However, this\napproximation drastically fails near the edge where the density vanishes. In\nthis paper we show that, even near the edge, novel universal properties emerge,\nindependently of the details of the confining potential. We show that for large\n$N$, these fermions in a confining trap, in arbitrary dimensions and at finite\ntemperature, form a determinantal point process. As a result, any $n$-point\ncorrelation function can be expressed as an $n \\times n$ determinant whose\nentry is called the kernel. Near the edge, we derive the large $N$ scaling form\nof the kernels. In $d=1$ and $T=0$, this reduces to the so called Airy kernel,\nthat appears in the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE) of random matrix theory. In\n$d=1$ and $T>0$ we show a remarkable connection between our kernel and the one\nappearing in the $1+1$-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation at finite time.\nConsequently our result provides a finite $T$ generalization of the Tracy-Widom\ndistribution, that describes the fluctuations of the rightmost fermion at\n$T=0$. In $d>1$ and $T \\geq 0$, while the connection to GUE no longer holds,\nthe process is still determinantal whose analysis provides a new class of\nkernels, generalizing the $1d$ Airy kernel at $T=0$ obtained in random matrix\ntheory. Some of our finite temperature results should be testable in\npresent-day cold atom experiments, most notably our detailed predictions for\nthe temperature dependence of the fluctuations near the edge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 17:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-20"}

Pulsed\nfield gradient (PFG) techniques have been increasingly used to study anomalous\ndiffusion in NMR and MRI. However, the interpretation of PFG anomalous\ndiffusion is complicated. Moreover, there is not an exact signal attenuation\nexpression based on fractional derivatives for PFG anomalous diffusion, which\nincludes the finite gradient pulse width effect. In this paper, a new method, a\nMainardi-Luchko-Pagnini (MLP) phase distribution approximation, is proposed to\ndescribe PFG fractional diffusion. MLP phase distribution is a non-Gaussian\nphase distribution. From the fractional diffusion equation based on fractional\nderivatives in both real space and phase space, the obtained probability\ndistribution function is a MLP distribution. The MLP distribution leads to a\nMittag-Leffler function based PFG signal attenuation rather than the\nexponential or stretched exponential attenuation that is obtained from a\nGaussian phase distribution (GPD) under a short gradient pulse approximation.\nThe MLP phase distribution approximation is employed to get a complete signal\nattenuation expression E{\\alpha}(-Dfb*{\\alpha},\\b{eta}) that includes the\nfinite gradient pulse width effect for all three types of PFG fractional\ndiffusion.

We therefore contend that REGCOIL should be used\ninstead of NESCOIL for applications in which a fast and robust method for coil\ncalculation is needed, such as when targeting coil complexity in fixed-boundary\nplasma optimization, or for scoping new stellarator geometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 18:52:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2017 11:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-10"}

We\npresent a phenomenological scenario where gas in such flows -- if it is shocked\nas it enters the halo as we assume -- become biphasic and, as a result,\nturbulent. We consider a collimated stream of warm gas that flows into a halo\nfrom an over dense filament of the cosmic web. The post-shock streaming gas\nexpands because it has a higher pressure than the ambient halo gas, and\nfragments as it cools. The fragmented stream forms a two phase medium: a warm\ncloudy phase embedded in hot post-shock gas. We argue that the hot phase\nsustains the accretion shock. A fraction of the initial kinetic energy of the\ninfalling gas is converted into turbulence among and within the warm clouds.\nThe thermodynamic evolution of the post-shock gas is largely determined by the\nrelative timescales of several processes -- the cooling, the expansion of the\npost-shock gas, the amount of turbulence in the clouds, and the halo dynamics.\nWe expect the gas to become multiphase when the cooling and dynamical times are\nof the same order-of-magnitude. In this framework, we show that this occurs in\nthe important mass range of ~$10^{11}$ to $10^{13}$ M$_\\odot$ , where the bulk\nof stars have formed in galaxies. Gas accreting along cosmic web filaments may\neventually lose coherence and mix with the ambient halo gas.

In order to fully characterize this, one has to consider multipartite\nentanglement as, for instance, bipartite entanglement between individual\nparticles fails to signal this effect. However, quantification of multipartite\nentanglement is very hard and detecting it may not be possible due to the lack\nof accessibility to all individual particles. For these reasons it will be more\nsensible to partition the system into relevant subsystems, each containing few\nto many spins, and study entanglement between those constituents as a\ncoarse-grain picture of multipartite entanglement between individual particles.\nIn impurity systems, famously exemplified by two-impurity and two-channel Kondo\nmodels, it is natural to divide the system into three parts, namely, impurities\nand the left and right bulks. By exploiting two tripartite entanglement\nmeasures, based on negativity, we show that at impurity quantum phase\ntransitions the tripartite entanglement diverges and shows scaling behavior.\nWhile the critical exponents are different for each tripartite entanglement\nmeasure they both provide very similar critical exponents for the two-impurity\nand the two-channel Kondo models suggesting that they belong to the same\nuniversality class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 20:06:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 11:05:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

The transient was detected in a dusty spiral arm\nof IC 2163 ($D\\approx35.5$ Mpc). Pre-discovery ground-based imaging revealed an\nassociated, shorter-duration transient in the optical and near-IR (NIR).

Assuming $A_V = 2.2$ mag of extinction in SPIRITS 15c\nprovides a good match between their optical light curves.

A black pebbling is a sequence\n$P_0,\\ldots, P_t \\subseteq V$ of sets of nodes which must satisfy the following\nproperties: $P_0 = \\emptyset$ (we start off with no pebbles on $G$),\n$\\mathsf{sinks}(G) \\subseteq \\bigcup_{j \\leq t} P_j$ (every sink node was\npebbled at some point) and $\\mathsf{parents}\\big(P_{i+1}\\backslash P_i\\big)\n\\subseteq P_i$ (we can only place a new pebble on a node $v$ if all of $v$'s\nparents had a pebble during the last round). The cumulative cost of a pebbling\n$P_0,P_1,\\ldots, P_t \\subseteq V$ is $\\mathsf{cc}(P) = | P_1| + \\ldots + |\nP_t|$. The cumulative pebbling cost is an especially important security metric\nfor data-independent memory hard functions, an important primitive for password\nhashing. Thus, an efficient (approximation) algorithm would be an invaluable\ntool for the cryptanalysis of password hash functions as it would provide an\nautomated tool to establish tight bounds on the amortized space-time cost of\ncomputing the function. We show that such a tool is unlikely to exist. In\nparticular, we prove the following results. (1) It is\n$\\texttt{NP}\\mbox{-}\\texttt{Hard}$ to find a pebbling minimizing cumulative\ncost.

However, these theories are\nformulated consistently only in 10 spacetime dimensions. Therefore, to connect\nto the observable world, it is required to compactify 6 out of those 10\ndimensions in a suitable fashion.\n  In this thesis, we mainly consider compactifications of type II string\ntheories on Calabi-Yau threefolds. As a consequence, the resulting four\ndimensional theories preserve $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry. In these cases the\nmetrics on the moduli spaces of the matter multiplets, vector and\nhypermultiplets, completely determine the low energy theories. Whereas the\nformer are very well understood by now, the complete description of\nhypermultiplets is more complicated. In fact, hypermultiplets receive both\nperturbative and non-perturbative corrections. The thesis mainly pertains to\nthe understanding of the non-perturbative corrections.

We focus on the case of four\nspacetime dimensions, but formulate our results in a manner applicable to\nhigher spacetime dimensions. The twisted self-duality conditions are redundant\nand we exhibit a non-redundant subset of conditions, which have the remarkable\nproperty to involve only first-order derivatives with respect to time. This\nnon-redundant subset equates the electric field of the spin-$s$ field (which we\ndefine) to the magnetic field of its dual (which we also define), and vice\nversa. The non-redundant subset of twisted self-duality conditions involve the\npurely spatial components of the spin-$s$ field and its dual, and also the\ncomponents of the fields with one zero index. One can get rid of these gauge\ncomponents by taking the curl of the equations, which does not change their\nphysical content. In this form, the twisted self-duality conditions can be\nderived from a variational principle that involves prepotentials, which are the\nhigher spin generalizations of the prepotentials previously found in the spins\n2 and 3 cases.

We\nconstruct a probabilistic generative model for the dusty distribution of\nextinguished absolute magnitudes and apparent colors as the convolution of a\nintrinsic SN Ia color-magnitude distribution and a host galaxy dust\nreddening-extinction distribution. If the intrinsic color-magnitude ($M_B$ vs.\n$B-V$) slope $\\beta_{int}$ differs from the host galaxy dust law $R_B$, this\nconvolution results in a specific curve of mean extinguished absolute magnitude\nvs. apparent color. The derivative of this curve smoothly transitions from\n$\\beta_{int}$ in the blue tail to $R_B$ in the red tail of the apparent color\ndistribution. The conventional linear fit approximates this effective curve\nnear the average apparent color, resulting in an apparent slope $\\beta_{app}$\nbetween $\\beta_{int}$ and $R_B$. We incorporate these effects into a\nhierarchical Bayesian statistical model for SN Ia light curve measurements, and\nanalyze a dataset of SALT2 optical light curve fits of 248 nearby SN Ia at z <\n0.10.

Finally, we extend our model to examine the SN Ia luminosity-host\nmass dependence in terms of intrinsic and dust components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 22:49:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2016 21:16:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Feb 2017 14:44:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

An example of this is QCD at low temperature\nand high density, where various exotic fermion condensates are conjectured to\nform. Another example is the Euclidean version of the type IIB matrix model for\n10d superstring theory, where spontaneous breaking of the SO(10) rotational\nsymmetry down to SO(4) is expected to occur. When one applies the complex\nLangevin method to these systems, one encounters the singular-drift problem\nassociated with the appearance of nearly zero eigenvalues of the Dirac\noperator. Here we propose to avoid this problem by deforming the action with a\nfermion bilinear term. The results for the original system are obtained by\nextrapolations with respect to the deformation parameter. We demonstrate the\npower of this approach by applying it to a simple matrix model, in which\nspontaneous symmetry breaking from SO(4) to SO(2) is expected to occur due to\nthe phase of the complex fermion determinant.

For the\noptimal control, which requires running multiple propagations to determine the\noptimal pulse sequence, we used the computationally inexpensive time-dependent\nconfiguration interaction singles (TDCIS) method. TDCIS captures all of the\nnecessary correlation of the desired processes but assumes that ionization\npathways reached via double excitations are not present. MCTDHF includes these\npathways and all multiparticle correlations in a set of time-dependent\norbitals. The mechanism that was determined to be optimal in the Raman\nexcitation of the Ne $1s^22s^22p^53p^1$ valence state via the metastable\n$1s^22s^12p^63p^1$ resonance state involves a sequential resonance-valence\nexcitation. First, a long pump pulse excites the core-hole state, and then a\nshorter Stokes pulse transfers the population to the valence state. This\nprocess represents the first step in a multidimensional x-ray spectroscopy\nscheme that will provide a local probe of valence electronic correlations.\nAlthough at the optimal pulse intensities at the TDCIS level of theory the\nMCTDHF method predicts multiple ionization of the atom, at slightly lower\nintensities (reduced by a factor of about 4) the TDCIS mechanism is shown to\nhold qualitatively.

These assertions are\nmade to pinpoint that there is a foundational gap in this field, and one should\nconsider revisiting the concepts from the ground up. Moreover, Insider threats,\nwhich are an increasing threat vector against organizations are also associated\nwith the failure of access control. Access control models derived from access\ncontrol matrix encompass three sets of entities, Subjects, Objects and\nOperations. Typically, objects are considered to be files and operations are\nregarded as Read, Write, and Execute. This implies an `open sesame' approach\nwhen granting access to data, i.e. once access is granted, there is no\nrestriction on command executions. Inspired by Functional Encryption, we\npropose applying access authorizations at a much finer granularity, but instead\nof an ad-hoc or computationally hard cryptographic approach, we postulate a\nfoundational transformation to access control. From an abstract viewpoint, we\nsuggest storing access authorizations as a three-dimensional tensor, which we\ncall Access Control Tensor (ACT). In Function-based Access Control (FBAC),\napplications do not give blind folded execution right and can only invoke\ncommands that have been authorized for data segments. In other words, one might\nbe authorized to use a certain command on one object, while being forbidden to\nuse exactly the same command on another object.

A critical analysis of the advantages of deploying FBAC,\nhow it will result in developing a new generation of applications, and\ncompatibility with existing models and systems is also included. Finally, a\nproof of concept implementation of FBAC is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2016 05:17:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-16"}

C-Share is based on a scalable and decoupled\nSDN-based elephant flow rerouting method comprised of elephant flow detection,\ntagging and identification, which is utilized by using a prevalent network\nsampling method (e.g., sFlow).

Despite a wide range of theoretical models and\nexperimental efforts, the origin of these surface TLS still remains largely\nunknown, making further mitigation of TLS induced decoherence extremely\nchallenging. Here we use a recently developed on-chip electron spin resonance\n(ESR) technique that allows us to detect spins with a very low surface\ncoverage. We combine this technique with various surface treatments\nspecifically to reveal the nature of native surface spins on Al$_2$O$_3$ -- the\nmainstay of almost all solid state quantum devices. On a large number of\nsamples we resolve three ESR peaks with the measured total paramagnetic spin\ndensity $n=2.2\\times 10^{17}$m$^{-2}$, which matches the density inferred from\nthe flux noise in SQUIDs. We show that two of these peaks originate from\nphysisorbed atomic hydrogen which appears on the surface as a by-product of\nwater dissociation. We suggest that the third peak is due to molecular oxygen\non the Al$_2$O$_3$ surface captured at strong Lewis base defect sites,\nproducing charged O$_2^-$.

We address it here using\nscale-free models, for which self-similarity provides a powerful tool to\ncontrol resolution. Such models also provide a robust testing ground for the\nso-called stable clustering approximation, which gives simple predictions for\nthem. Studying large N-body simulations of such models with different force\nsmoothing, we find that these two issues are in fact very closely related: our\nconclusion is that the accuracy of two point statistics in the non-linear\nregime starts to degrade strongly around the scale at which their behaviour\ndeviates from that predicted by the stable clustering hypothesis. Physically\nthe association of the two scales is in fact simple to understand: stable\nclustering fails to be a good approximation when there are strong interactions\nof structures (in particular merging) and it is precisely such non-linear\nprocesses which are sensitive to fluctuations at the smaller scales affected by\ndiscretisation. Resolution may be further degraded if the short distance\ngravitational smoothing scale is larger than the scale to which stable\nclustering can propagate. We examine in detail the very different conclusions\nof studies by Smith et al. (2003) and Widrow et al.

We say\nthat an IFS is approximation regular if we observe Khintchine type behaviour,\ni.e., if the size of certain limsup sets defined using the IFS is determined by\nthe convergence/divergence of naturally occurring sums. We prove that an IFS is\napproximation regular if it consists of conformal mappings and satisfies the\nopen set condition.

The analysis of the\nmodel allows for detailed understanding of the role played by different\nparameters of the model in the physics of interest. As an example of the\napproach we present the study of the effect of silicon atoms substitution by\nthe iron atoms and vice versa on the magnetic properties in the iron silicide\nalpha-FeSi2. The DFT+GGA calculations are mapped to the model with intraatomic\nCoulomb and exchange interactions, hoppings to nearest and next nearest atoms\nand exchange of the delocalized electrons between iron atoms; the magnetic\nmoments on atoms and charge densities of the material are found\nself-consistently within the Hartree-Fock approximation.

For example, the substitution of three Si atoms by the Fe\natoms results in the ferrimagnetic structure whereas the substitution of four\nSi atoms by Fe atoms gives rise to either the nonmagnetic or the ferromagnetic\nstate depending on the type of local enviroment of the substitutional Fe atoms.\nBesides, contrary to the commonly accepted statement that the destruction of\nthe magnetic moment is controlled only by the number of Fe-Si nearest\nneighbors, we find that actually it is controlled by the Fe-Fe\nnext-nearest-neighbors.

In this\npaper, a fractal derivative model based modified Gaussian phase distribution\nmethod is proposed to describe PFG anomalous diffusion. By using the phase\ndistribution obtained from the effective phase shift diffusion method based on\nfractal derivatives, and employing some of the traditional Gaussian phase\ndistribution approximation techniques, a general signal attenuation expression\nfor free fractional diffusion is derived. This expression describes a stretched\nexponential function based attenuation, which is distinct from both the\nexponential attenuation for normal diffusion obtained from conventional\nGaussian phase distribution approximation, and the Mittag-Leffler function\nbased attenuation for anomalous diffusion obtained from fractional derivative.\nThe obtained signal attenuation expression can analyze the finite gradient\npulse width (FGPW) effect. Additionally, it can generally be applied to all\nthree types of PFG fractional diffusions classified based on time derivative\norder alpha and space derivative order beta. These three types of fractional\ndiffusions include time-fractional diffusion, space-fractional diffusion, and\ngeneral fractional diffusion. The results in this paper are consistent with\nreported results based on effective phase shift diffusion equation method and\ninstantaneous signal attenuation method.

The coordination number\nof the entering cations was found to play an important role in dictating the\nreaction pathways. The exchanges with tetrahedrally coordinated cations (i.e.\nwith coordination number 4), such as Cd2+ or Hg2+, yielded monocrystalline CdTe\nor HgTe nanocrystals with Cu2-xTe/CdTe or Cu2-xTe/HgTe Janus-like\nheterostructures as intermediates. The formation of Janus-like architectures\nwas attributed to the high diffusion rate of the relatively small tetrahedrally\ncoordinated cations, which could rapidly diffuse in the Cu2-xTe NCs and\nnucleate the CdTe (or HgTe) phase in a preferred region of the host structure.\nAlso, with both Cd2+ and Hg2+ ions the exchange led to wurtzite CdTe and HgTe\nphases rather than the more stable zinc-blende ones, indicating that the anion\nframework of the starting Cu2- xTe particles could be more easily deformed to\nmatch the anion framework of the metastable wurtzite structures. As hexagonal\nHgTe had never been reported to date, this represents another case of\nmetastable new phases that can only be accessed by cation exchange. On the\nother hand, the exchanges involving octahedrally coordinated ions (i.e. with\ncoordination number 6), such as Pb2+ or Sn2+, yielded rock-salt polycrystalline\nPbTe or SnTe nanocrystals with Cu2-xTe@PbTe or Cu2-xTe@SnTe core@shell\narchitectures at the early stages of the exchange process. In this case, the\noctahedrally coordinated ions are probably too large to diffuse easily through\nthe Cu2-xTe structure: their limited diffusion rate restricts their initial\nreaction to the surface of the nanocrystals, where cation exchange is initiated\nunselectively, leading to core@shell architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2016 14:45:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-16"}

For model of inflation, we compute the inflationary\nparameters and confront them with recent Planck 2015 data.

We evaluate the proposed technique\nin HEVC HM 16.7 using 4:4:4, 4:2:2 and 4:2:0 YCbCr sequences. Both subjective\nand objective evaluations are undertaken during which we compare C-BAQ with\nAdaptiveQP. The objective evaluation reveals that C-BAQ attains a maximum\nBD-Rate reduction of 15.9% (Y), 13.1% (Cr) and 16.1% (Cb) in addition to a\nmaximum decoding time reduction of 11.0%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Sep 2016 15:28:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2016 10:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-08"}

The straightforward answer to this problem is to\ncompare the query with all items in the dataset, but this is practical only for\nsmall datasets. One potential solution to enhance the search time and achieve\nsublinear cost is to use a hash table populated with binary codes of the\ndataset and then look up the nearby buckets to the query to retrieve the\nnearest neighbors. However, if codes are compared in terms of cosine similarity\nrather than the Hamming distance, then the main issue is that the order of\nbuckets to probe is not evident. To examine this issue, we first elaborate on\nthe connection between the Hamming distance and the cosine similarity. Doing\nthis allows us to systematically find the probing sequence in the hash table.\nHowever, solving the nearest neighbor search with a single table is only\npractical for short binary codes. To address this issue, we propose the angular\nmulti-index hashing search algorithm which relies on building multiple hash\ntables on binary code substrings. The proposed search algorithm solves the\nexact angular $K$ nearest neighbor problem in a time that is often orders of\nmagnitude faster than the linear scan baseline and even approximation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2016 23:16:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2018 12:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-19"}

Subsequently, the\ndown-conversion of second harmonic phonons into first harmonic phonons and\nconversion of first and second harmonic phonons into third harmonic phonons\noccur. On the similar lines, an eventual conversion of third harmonic phonons\nto high orders is also observed to commence.
