TCP has continuously been improved for\ngreedy traffic sources to achieve high throughput over networks with large\nbandwidth delay products. Recently, the increasing use for streaming and\ninteractive applications, such as voice and video, has shifted the focus\ntowards its delay performance. Given the need for real-time communication of\nnon-greedy sources via TCP, we present an estimation method for performance\nevaluation of closed-loop flow control protocols. We characterize an end-to-end\nconnection by a transfer function that provides statistical service guarantees\nfor arbitrary traffic. The estimation is based on end-to-end measurements at\nthe application level that include all effects induced by the network and by\nthe protocol stacks of the end systems. From our measurements, we identify\ndifferent causes for delays. We show that significant delays are due to\nqueueing in protocol stacks. Notably, this occurs even if the utilization is\nmoderate. Using our estimation method, we compare the impact of fundamental\nmechanisms of TCP on delays at the application level: In detail, we analyze\nparameters relevant for network dimensioning, including buffer provisioning and\nactive queue management, and parameters for server configuration, such as the\ncongestion control algorithm. By applying our method as a benchmark, we find\nthat a good selection can largely improve the delay performance of TCP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2016 16:20:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-05"}

However nature and\nproperties of magnetism at this interface are not well understood so far. In\nthis paper, we focus on transport effects driven by spin-orbit coupling and\nintentionally neglect possible strong correlations. The electrical resistivity\ntensor is calculated as a function of the magnitude and orientation of an\nexternal magnetic field parallel to the interface. The semiclassical Boltzmann\nequation is solved numerically for the two-dimensional system of spin-orbit\ncoupled electrons accelerated by an electric field and scattered by\nspatially-correlated impurities. At temperatures of a few Kelvin and densities\nsuch that the chemical potential crosses the second pair of spin-orbit split\nbands, we find a strongly anisotropic modulation of the (negative)\nmagnetoresistance above 10 T, characterized by multiple maxima and minima away\nfrom the crystalline axes. Along with the drop of the magnetoresistance, an\nabrupt enhancement of the transverse resistivity occurs. The angular modulation\nof the latter considerably deviates from a (low-field) sinusoidal dependence to\na (high-field) step-like behaviour. These peculiar features are the\nconsequences of the anisotropy of both (intra-band and inter-band )\nscattering-amplitudes in the Brillouin zone when the relevant energy scales in\nthe system - chemical potential, spin-orbit interaction and Zeeman energy - are\nall comparable to each other.

We\nhere introduce the $\\textit{inflation technique}$ for tackling this problem. An\ninflation of a causal structure is a new causal structure that can contain\nmultiple copies of each of the original variables, but where the ancestry of\neach copy mirrors that of the original. To every distribution of the observed\nvariables that is compatible with the original causal structure, we assign a\nfamily of marginal distributions on certain subsets of the copies that are\ncompatible with the inflated causal structure. It follows that compatibility\nconstraints for the inflation can be translated into compatibility constraints\nfor the original causal structure. Even if the constraints at the level of\ninflation are weak, such as observable statistical independences implied by\ndisjoint causal ancestry, the translated constraints can be strong. We apply\nthis method to derive new inequalities whose violation by a distribution\nwitnesses that distribution's incompatibility with the causal structure (of\nwhich Bell inequalities and Pearl's instrumental inequality are prominent\nexamples). We describe an algorithm for deriving all such inequalities for the\noriginal causal structure that follow from ancestral independences in the\ninflation. For three observed binary variables with pairwise common causes, it\nyields inequalities that are stronger in at least some aspects than those\nobtainable by existing methods. We also describe an algorithm that derives a\nweaker set of inequalities but is more efficient. Finally, we discuss which\ninflations are such that the inequalities one obtains from them remain valid\neven for quantum (and post-quantum) generalizations of the notion of a causal\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2016 17:21:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 10:55:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2017 16:22:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2018 03:39:13 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2019 20:08:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

A natural prediction of the EFTofLSS is\ntherefore that by simply adding higher derivative biases, all tracers should\nperform comparably well.

However,\ncalculating QSL maps even for 2-dimensional slices through 3-dimensional models\nof coronal magnetic fields is a non-trivial task as it usually involves tracing\nout millions of magnetic field lines with immense precision. Thus, extending\nQSL calculations to three dimensions has rarely been done until now. In order\nto address this challenge, we present QSL Squasher -- a public, open-source\ncode, which is optimized for calculating QSL maps in both two and three\ndimensions on GPUs. The code achieves large processing speeds for three\nreasons, each of which results in an order-of-magnitude speed-up. 1) The code\nis parallelized using OpenCL. 2) The precision requirements for the QSL\ncalculation are drastically reduced by using perturbation theory. 3) A new\nboundary detection criterion between quasi-connectivity domains is used, which\nquickly identifies possible QSL locations which need to be finely sampled by\nthe code. That boundary detection criterion relies on finding the locations of\nabrupt field-line length changes, which we do by introducing a new Field-line\nLength Edge (FLEDGE) map.

Employing hydrodynamic\nsimulations in full general relativity, we find that the one-arm instability is\ngeneric in that it can develop in HMNSs within a few tens of milliseconds after\nmerger for all equations of state in our survey. We find that mergers with\nstiffer equations of state tend to produce HMNSs with stronger $m=2$ azimuthal\nmode density deformations, and weaker $m=1$ components, relative to softer\nequations of state. We also find that for equations of state that can give rise\nto double-core HMNSs, large $m=1$ density modes can already be present due to\nasymmetries in the two cores. This results in the generation of $l=2$, $m=1$\ngravitational wave modes even before the dominance of a one-arm mode that\nultimately arises following merger of the two cores. Our results further\nsuggest that stiffer equations of state give rise to HMNSs generating lower\n$m=1$ gravitational wave frequencies.

The ambitious concept is to\nforge `genetically modified' haloes with some desired properties after the\nnon-linear evolution.

This technique allows us to explore the\nfreedom around the original algorithm for genetic modification.

However, only a few previous\ncomputational studies have claimed success in revealing genome-wide regulatory\nlandscapes from temporal gene expression data, especially for complex\neukaryotes like human. Moreover, recent work suggests that these methods still\nsuffer from the curse of dimensionality if network size increases to 100 or\nhigher.\n  Result: We present a novel scalable algorithm for identifying genome-wide\nregulatory network structures.

These\nproperties of strong gravitational lensing are different from those in the\nJohannsen-Psaltis rotating non-Kerr spacetime and in the Janis-Newman-Winicour\nspacetime. Modeling the supermassive central object of the Milk Way Galaxy as a\nKonoplya-Zhidenko rotating non-Kerr compact object, we estimated the numerical\nvalues of observables for the strong gravitational lensing including the time\ndelay between two relativistic images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2016 09:06:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 Oct 2016 00:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-11"}

In fact, qubits are usually not needed during the entire computation\nbut only between their initialization and measurement. Before and after that,\ncorresponding wires may be used by other qubits. In this work, we propose a\nsolution which exploits this fact in order to optimize the design of quantum\ncircuits with respect to the required wires. To this end, we introduce a\nrepresentation of the lifetimes of all qubits which is used to analyze the\nrespective need for wires. Based on this analysis, a method is proposed which\n\"recycles\" the available wires and, by this, reduces the size of the resulting\ncircuit.

Interestingly, randomization has also been\nproposed to improve security of learning algorithms against evasion attacks, as\nit results in hiding information about the classifier to the attacker.

Dealing with impulsive noise environments comes\nwith an added complexity with respect to the standard Gaussian environment: the\nalpha-stable probability density functions have an infinite second moment and\nthe \"nice\" Hilbert space structure of the space of random variables having a\nfinite second moment is lost along with its tools and methodologies. This is\nindeed the case in estimation theory where classical tools to quantify\nperformance of an estimator are tightly related to the assumption of finite\nvariance variables. In alpha-stable environments, expressions such as the mean\nsquare error and the Cramer-Rao bound are hence problematic. In this work, we\ntackle the parameter estimation problem in impulsive noise environments and\ndevelop novel tools that are tailored to the alpha-stable and heavy-tailed\nnoise environments, tools that coincide with the standard ones adopted in the\nGaussian setup, namely a generalized \"power\" measure and a generalized Fisher\ninformation.

Nevertheless, relevant functional features such as\ntime-localised or short scale fluctuations may indeed be rough relative to the\nglobal scale, but still smooth at shorter scales. These may be confounded with\nthe global smooth components of variation by the smoothing and PCA, potentially\ndistorting the parsimony and interpretability of the analysis. The goal of this\npaper is to investigate how both smooth and rough variations can be recovered\non the basis of discretely observed functional data. Assuming that a functional\ndatum arises as the sum of two uncorrelated components, one smooth and one\nrough, we develop identifiability conditions for the recovery of the two\ncorresponding covariance operators. The key insight is that they should possess\ncomplementary forms of parsimony: one smooth and finite rank (large scale), and\nthe other banded and potentially infinite rank (small scale). Our conditions\nelucidate the precise interplay between rank, bandwidth, and grid resolution.\nUnder these conditions, we show that the recovery problem is equivalent to\nrank-constrained matrix completion, and exploit this to construct estimators of\nthe two covariances, without assuming knowledge of the true bandwidth or rank;\nwe study their asymptotic behaviour, and then use them to recover the smooth\nand rough components of each functional datum by best linear prediction.

This model has been used to describe, in various limits,\nproperties of relativistic bosons at finite chemical potential, type II su-\nperconductors, magnetic materials and aspects of cosmology. We characterise the\nthermodynamic second-order phase transition in different ways. We study the\nequilibrium vortex configurations and their statistical and geometrical\nproperties in equilibrium at all temperatures. We show that at very high\ntemperature the statistics of the filaments is the one of fully-packed loop\nmodels. We identify the temperature, within the ordered phase, at which the\nnumber density of vortex lengths falls-off algebraically and we associate it to\na geometric percolation transition that we characterise in various ways. We\nmeasure the fractal properties of the vortex tangle at this threshold. Next, we\nperform infinite rate quenches from equilibrium in the disordered phase, across\nthe thermo- dynamic critical point, and deep into the ordered phase. We show\nthat three time regimes can be distinguished: a first approach towards a state\nthat, within numerical accuracy, shares many features with the one at the\npercolation threshold, a later coarsening process that does not alter, at\nsufficiently low temperature, the fractal properties of the long vortex loops,\nand a final approach to equilibrium. These features are independent of the\nreconnection rule used to build the vortex lines. In each of these regimes we\nidentify the various length-scales of the vortices in the system. We also study\nthe scaling properties of the ordering process and the progressive annihilation\nof topological defects and we prove that the time-dependence of the\ntime-evolving vortex tangle can be described within the dynamic scaling\nframework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2016 07:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

The\nsubmicroscopic concept determines the notion of mass in the tessellattice and\nintroduces excitations of space, which appear at the motion of particles (mass\nparticles are determined as local deformations of the tessellattice). These\nexcitations are associated with carriers of the field of inertia. In the\nuniverse the gravitation is induced by standing inerton waves of mass objects,\nwhich oscillate around the objects with the speed of light. An overlapping of\nthese standing inerton waves generates an elastic interaction between masses\nbringing them to a formation of clusters in which masses are characterised by\nboth the Newtonian and elastic interaction. It is this elastic interaction that\ncancels the necessity of introduction of mystical dark matter. At the same\ntime, inertons, carriers of inert properties of objects, can be treated as an\nanalogous of hypothetic weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP) or axions,\nwhich some astronomers try to associate with dark matter particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Sep 2016 07:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}
