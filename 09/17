Two types of the \"opposites\" have been\ndefined in the literature, namely \\textit{type-I} and \\textit{type-II}. The\nformer are linear in nature and applicable to the variable space, hence easy to\ncalculate. On the other hand, type-II opposites capture the \"oppositeness\" in\nthe output space. In fact, type-I opposites are considered a special case of\ntype-II opposites where inputs and outputs have a linear relationship. However,\nin many real-world problems, inputs and outputs do in fact exhibit a nonlinear\nrelationship. Therefore, type-II opposites are expected to be better in\ncapturing the sense of \"opposition\" in terms of the input-output relation. In\nthe absence of any knowledge about the problem at hand, there seems to be no\nintuitive way to calculate the type-II opposites. In this paper, we introduce\nan approach to learn type-II opposites from the given inputs and their outputs\nusing the artificial neural networks (ANNs). We first perform \\emph{opposition\nmining} on the sample data, and then use the mined data to learn the\nrelationship between input $x$ and its opposite $\\breve{x}$. We have validated\nour algorithm using various benchmark functions to compare it against an\nevolving fuzzy inference approach that has been recently introduced. The\nresults show the better performance of a neural approach to learn the\nopposites. This will create new possibilities for integrating oppositional\nschemes within existing algorithms promising a potential increase in\nconvergence speed and/or accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 16:19:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-19"}

While supergranulation is only weakly influenced by\nrotation, larger spatial scales of convection sample the deep convection zone\nand are presumably rotationally influenced. We present numerical results from a\nseries of nonlinear, 3-D simulations of rotating convection and examine the\nvelocity power distribution realized under a range of Rossby numbers. When\nrotation is present, the convective power distribution possesses a pronounced\npeak, at characteristic wavenumber $\\ell_\\mathrm{peak}$, whose value increases\nas the Rossby number is decreased. This distribution of power contrasts with\nthat realized in non-rotating convection, where power increases monotonically\nfrom high to low wavenumbers. We find that spatial scales smaller than\n$\\ell_\\mathrm{peak}$ behave in analogy to non-rotating convection. Spatial\nscales larger than $\\ell_\\mathrm{peak}$ are rotationally-constrained and\npossess substantially reduced power relative to the non-rotating system. We\nargue that the supergranular scale emerges due to a suppression of power on\nspatial scales larger than $\\ell\\approx100$ owing to the presence of deep,\nrotationally-constrained convection. Supergranulation thus represents the\nlargest non-rotationally-constrained mode of solar convection. We conclude that\nthe characteristic spatial scale of supergranulation bounds that of the deep\nconvective motions from above, making supergranulation an indirect measure of\nthe deep-seated dynamics at work in the solar dynamo.

Several nanolasers smaller than the diffraction\nlimit have been theoretically proposed and experimentally demonstrated using\nplasmonic cavities to confine optical fields. Such compact cavities exhibit\nlarge Purcell factors, thereby enhancing spontaneous emission, which feeds into\nthe lasing mode. However, most plasmonic nanolasers reported so far have\nemployed resonant nanostructures and therefore had the lasing restricted to the\nproximity of the resonance wavelength. Here, we report on an approach based on\ngold nanorod hyperbolic metamaterials for lasing. Hyperbolic metamaterials\nprovide broadband Purcell enhancement due to large photonic density of optical\nstates, while also supporting surface plasmon modes to deliver optical feedback\nfor lasing due to nonlocal effects in nanorod media. We experimentally\ndemonstrate the advantage of hyperbolic metamaterials in achieving lasing\naction by its comparison with that obtained in a metamaterial with elliptic\ndispersion. The conclusions from the experimental results are supported with\nnumerical simulations comparing the Purcell factors and surface plasmon modes\nfor the metamaterials with different dispersions. We show that although the\nmetamaterials of both types support lasing, emission with hyperbolic samples is\nabout twice as strong with 35% lower threshold vs. the elliptic ones. Hence,\nhyperbolic metamaterials can serve as a convenient platform of choice for\nnanoscale coherent photon sources in a broad wavelength range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 18:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-19"}

If interpreted as an independent calibration of the Cepheid luminosities\nand assumed to be otherwise free of systematic uncertainties, DR1 parallaxes\nwould imply a decrease of 0.3% in the current estimate of the local Hubble\nconstant, well within their statistical uncertainty, and corresponding to a\nvalue 2.5 sigma (3.5 sigma if the errors are scaled) higher than the value\ninferred from Planck CMB data used in conjunction with Lambda-CDM. We also test\nfor a zeropoint error in Gaia parallaxes and find none to a precision of ~20\nmuas. We caution however that with this early release, the complete systematic\nproperties of the measurements may not be fully understood at the statistical\nlevel of the Cepheid sample mean, a level an order of magnitude below the\nindividual uncertainties. The early results from DR1 demonstrate again the\nenormous impact that the full mission will likely have on fundamental questions\nin astrophysics and cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 18:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

Therefore, the identification of spatial scales associated with\nhealth effects can inform on pollution sources responsible for these effects,\nresulting in more targeted regulatory policy. Recently, prediction methods that\nyield high-resolution spatial estimates of PM2.5 exposures allow one to\nevaluate such scale-specific associations. We propose a two-dimensional wavelet\ndecomposition that alleviates restrictive assumptions required for standard\nwavelet decompositions. Using this method we decompose daily surfaces of PM2.5\nto identify which scales of pollution are most associated with adverse health\noutcomes. A key feature of the approach is that it can remove the purely\ntemporal component of variability in PM2.5 levels and calculate effect\nestimates derived solely from spatial contrasts. This eliminates the potential\nfor unmeasured confounding of the exposure - outcome associations by temporal\nfactors, such as season. We apply our method to a study of birth weights in\nMassachusetts, U.S.A from 2003-2008 and find that both local and urban sources\nof pollution are strongly negatively associated with birth weight.

The star formation efficiency, i.e. the ratio of final stellar mass\nto initial core mass, is dominated by radiative forces and the ratio of outflow\nto accretion rates. Increasing this ratio has three effects: First, the\nprotostar grows slower with a lower luminosity at any given time, lowering\nradiative feedback. Second, bipolar cavities cleared by the outflow are larger,\nfurther diminishing radiative feedback on disk and core scales. Third, the\nhigher momentum outflow sweeps up more material from the collapsing envelope,\ndecreasing the protostar's potential mass reservoir via entrainment. The star\nformation efficiency varies with the ratio of ejection to accretion rates from\n50% in the case of very weak outflows to as low as 20% for very strong\noutflows. At latitudes between the low density bipolar cavity and the high\ndensity accretion disk, wide angle disk winds remove some of the gas, which\notherwise would be part of the accretion flow onto the disk; varying the\nstrength of these wide angle disk winds, however, alters the final star\nformation efficiency by only +/-6%. For all cases, the opening angle of the\nbipolar outflow cavity remains below 20 degree during early protostellar\naccretion phases, increasing rapidly up to 65 degree at the onset of radiation\npressure feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

The majority of wired network designs are stuck with OSPF\n(guaranteeing dynamic routing exchange on network layer) and RSTP (securing\nloop-free data-link layer topology). Recently, more use-case specific routing\nprotocols, such as Babel, have appeared. These technologies claim to have\nbetter characteristic than current industry standards. Babel is a fresh\ncontribution to the family of distance-vector routing protocols, which is\ngaining its momentum for small double-stack (IPv6 and IPv4) networks.

It is shown that the phase diagrams obtained using the\nempirical values contain clear contradictions with the experimental phase\ndiagrams at the well known limits of low or high temperatures. Realistic phase\ndiagrams, with a good agreement with the experimental observations, are\nachieved only when the computed lattice stability values are used. At\nintermediate temperatures, the computed phase diagrams resolve the controversy\nregarding the shape of the solvus in these systems, predicting a complex\nstructure with a eutectoid transition and a miscibility gap between two bcc\nphases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 20:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}

We present a chemical vapor deposition method to\npattern mica surfaces with regions of high-quality aminosilane\n(3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, APTES) monolayers. The approach relies on the\nvapor deposition of an aminosilane through a patterned array of through-holes\nin a PDMS (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) membrane that acts as a mask. In aqueous\nsolutions the surfaces have regular patterns of charge heterogeneities with\nminimal topographical variations over large areas. This versatile dry lift-off\ndeposition method alleviates issues with multilayer formation and can be used\nto create charge patterns on curved surfaces. We identify the necessary steps\nto achieve high quality monolayers and charge reversal of the underlying mica\nsurface: 1) hexane extraction to remove unreacted PDMS oligomers from the\nmembrane that would otherwise deposit on and contaminate the substrate, 2)\noxygen plasma treatment of the top of the membrane surfaces to generate a\nbarrier layer that blocks APTES transport through the PDMS, and 3) decrease of\nthe vapor pressure of APTES during deposition to minimize APTES condensation at\nthe mica-membrane-vapor contact lines and to prevent multilayer formation.\nUnder these conditions, AFM imaging shows that the monolayers have a height of\n0.9nm with an increase in height up to 3nm at the mica-membrane-vapor contact\nlines. Fluorescence imaging demonstrates pattern fidelity on both flat and\ncurved surfaces, for feature sizes that vary between 6.5-40 um.

This method has been\nsuccessfully applied to many low-dimensional dynamical system models such as\ncoarse models of aircraft and quadrotors in order to provide safety guarantees\nin potentially dangerous scenarios. These guarantees can be provided by the\ncomputation of a backward reachable set (BRS), which represents the set of\nstates from which the system may be driven into violating safety properties\ndespite the system's best effort to remain safe. Unfortunately, HJ reachability\nis not practical for high-dimensional systems because the complexity of the BRS\ncomputation scales exponentially with the number of state dimensions.

We assume two scenarios for the battery\nof the EH source. In the first scenario, we assume that the EH source is not\nequipped with a battery and thereby cannot store energy. As a result, the RF\nenergy harvested during one symbol interval can only be used in the following\nsymbol interval. In the second scenario, we assume that the EH source is\nequipped with a battery having unlimited storage capacity in which it can store\nthe harvested RF energy.

They are\nespecially useful for the representation of correlations among the dimensions,\nwhich identify relationships and interdependencies between variables. However,\nwithin these high-dimensional spaces, PCPs face difficulties in displaying the\ncorrelation between combinations of dimensions and generally require additional\ndisplay space as the number of dimensions increases. In this paper, we present\na new technique for high-dimensional data visualization in which a set of\nlow-dimensional PCPs are interactively constructed by sampling user-selected\nsubsets of the high-dimensional data space. In our technique, we first\nconstruct a graph visualization of sets of well-correlated dimensions. Users\nobserve this graph and are able to interactively select the dimensions by\nsampling from its cliques, thereby dynamically specifying the most relevant\nlower dimensional data to be used for the construction of focused PCPs. Our\ninteractive sampling overcomes the shortcomings of the PCPs by enabling the\nvisualization of the most meaningful dimensions (i.e., the most relevant\ninformation) from high-dimensional spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour technique through two case studies, where we show that the proposed\ninteractive low-dimensional space constructions were pivotal for visualizing\nthe high-dimensional data and discovering new patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2016 01:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}

The molecule switches its magnetization\ndirection from in-plane to out-of-plane when it is charged. In other words, the\nmagnetic anisotropy of the molecule changes from easy plane to easy axis when\nthe molecule is charged. By solving the master equation based on model\nHamiltonian, we find that current through the molecule is highly suppressed at\nlow bias independently of gate voltage due to the interplay between spin\nselection rules and the change in the type of magnetic anisotropy. Transitions\nbetween the lowest magnetic levels in successive charge states are forbidden\nbecause the magnetic levels differ by $|\\Delta M| > 1/2$ due to the change in\nthe type of magnetic anisotropy, although the total spins differ by $|\\Delta\nS|=1/2$. This current suppression can be lifted by significant B field, and the\nthreshold B field varies as a function of the field direction and the strength\nof magnetic anisotropy. The spin blockade effect shed light on switching the\nmagnetization direction by non-spin-polarized current and on exploring effects\nof this property coupled to other molecular degrees of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2016 01:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

We identify a class of 17 \"turnover\" galaxies whose central\nregion present significant drop in D$_n$(4000), and most of them\ncorrespondingly show a central upturn in EW(H$\\delta_A$) and EW(H$\\alpha$).\nThis indicates that the central region of the turnover galaxies has experienced\nstar formation in the past 1-2 Gyr, which makes the bulge younger and more\nstar-forming than surrounding regions. We find almost all (15/17) the turnover\ngalaxies are barred, while only half of the barred galaxies in our sample\n(15/32) are classified as a turnover galaxy. This finding provides strong\nevidence in support of the theoretical expectation that the bar may drive gas\nfrom the disc inward to trigger star formation in galaxy center, an important\nchannel for the growth/rejuvenation of pseudobulges in disc galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2016 07:12:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 08:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

The current scheme is a direct modeling\nmethod, where the time evolution solutions from the Vlasov-BGK equations of\nelectron and ion and the Maxwell equations are used to construct a\nscale-dependent plasma simulation model. As a result, with the changing of\nmodeling scales of mesh size and time step and with a variation of Knudsen\nnumber and Larmor radius, the discretized governing equations for a wide range\nof plasma evolution regimes can be obtained. The physics recovered in UGKS\nranges from the Vlasov equation in the kinetic scale to different-type\nmagneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations in the hydrodynamic scale. The key\ndynamics in UGKS is the un-splitting treatment of particle collision,\nacceleration, and transport in the construction of numerical flux across a cell\ninterface. At the same time, the plasma evolution is coupled with the Maxwell\nequations in an implicit way, which automatically provides a smooth transition\nbetween the Ampere's law and the Ohm's law for the calculation of electric\nfield. The time step of UGKS is not limited by the relaxation time, the\ncyclotron period, and the speed of light in the MHD regime. The UGKS is\nvalidated by numerical test cases, such as the Landau damping and two stream\ninstability in the kinetic regime, and the Brio-Wu shock tube problem and the\nOrszag- Tang MHD turbulence problem in the hydrodynamic regime. The scheme is\nalso used to study the geospace environment modeling (GEM), such as the\nchallenging magnetic reconnection problem in the transition regime.

Finally, we\nestimate the counting function for the zeros of this family of approximations,\nshow that these zeros cluster near those of the associated $L$-function, and\nthat, when the parameter is not too large, almost all the zeros of the\napproximations are simple.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2016 12:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

The theory accounts\nfor one-loop level electrostatic correlation effects such as the ionic cloud\ndeformation around the strongly charged DNA molecule as well as image-charge\nforces induced by the low DNA permittivity. Our model can reproduce and explain\nvarious characteristics of the experimental phase diagrams for polymer\nsolutions. First, the addition of polyvalent cations to the electrolyte\nsolution results in the attraction of the negatively charged polymer by the DNA\nmolecule. The glue of the like-charge attraction is the enhanced shielding of\nthe polymer charges by the dense counterion layer at the DNA surface. Secondly,\nthrough the shielding of the DNA-induced electrostatic potential, mono- and\npolyvalent cations of large concentration both suppress the like-charge\nattraction. Within the same formalism, we also predict a new opposite-charge\nrepulsion effect between the DNA molecule and a positively charged polymer. In\nthe presence of polyvalent anions such as sulfate or phosphate, their repulsion\nby the DNA charges leads to the charge screening deficiency of the region\naround the DNA molecule. This translates into a repulsive force that results in\nthe decomplexation of the polymer from DNA.

Through extensive experiments we show not only that the efficacy\nof these approaches is equal to that of the state of the art SNMF algorithm,\nbut also that the latter of our algorithms is extremely fast being one to two\norders of magnitude faster in terms of total computation time than the state of\nthe art approach, outperforming even spectral clustering in terms of\ncomputation time on large data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2016 14:41:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}

We analyze its role in the thermodynamic functioning of\ninformation ratchets---a form of autonomous Maxwellian Demon capable of\nexploiting fluctuations in an external information reservoir to harvest useful\nwork from a thermal bath. This establishes a quantitative paradigm for\nunderstanding how adaptive agents leverage structured thermal environments for\ntheir own thermodynamic benefit. General ratchets behave as memoryful\ncommunication channels, interacting with their environment sequentially and\nstoring results to an output. The bulk of thermal ratchets analyzed to date,\nhowever, assume memoryless environments that generate input signals without\ntemporal correlations. Employing computational mechanics and a new\ninformation-processing Second Law of Thermodynamics (IPSL) we remove these\nrestrictions, analyzing general finite-state ratchets interacting with\nstructured environments that generate correlated input signals. On the one\nhand, we demonstrate that a ratchet need not have memory to exploit an\nuncorrelated environment. On the other, and more appropriate to biological\nadaptation, we show that a ratchet must have memory to most effectively\nleverage structure and correlation in its environment. The lesson is that to\noptimally harvest work a ratchet's memory must reflect the input generator's\nmemory. Finally, we investigate achieving the IPSL bounds on the amount of work\na ratchet can extract from its environment, discovering that finite-state,\noptimal ratchets are unable to reach these bounds. In contrast, we show that\ninfinite-state ratchets can go well beyond these bounds by utilizing their own\ninfinite \"negentropy\". We conclude with an outline of the collective\nthermodynamics of information-ratchet swarms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Sep 2016 15:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

Considering the case of a wave-packet shaped\nby a Gaussian distribution, we compute the HWF and the probability ${\\cal\n{P}}_{BH}$ that the source is a (quantum) black hole, i.e., that it lies within\nits horizon radius. The case $\\beta<0$ is qualitatively similar to the standard\nSchwarzschild case, and the general shape of ${\\cal {P}}_{BH}$ is maintained\nwhen decreasing the free parameter, but shifted to reduce the probability for\nthe particle to be a black hole accordingly. The probability grows with\nincreasing mass slowly for more negative $\\beta$, and drops to 0 for a minimum\nmass value. The scenario differs in significantly for increasing $\\beta>0$,\nwhere a minimum in ${\\cal {P}}_{BH}$ is encountered, thus meaning that every\nparticle has some probability of decaying to a black hole. Furthermore, for\nsufficiently large $\\beta$ we find that every particle is a quantum black hole,\nin agreement with the intuitive effect of increasing $\\beta$, which creates\nlarger $M$ and $R_{H}$ terms. This is likely due to a \"dimensional reduction\"\nfeature of the model, where the black hole characteristics for sub-Planckian\nblack holes mimic those in $(1+1)$-dimensions and the horizon size grows as\n$R_H \\sim M^{-1}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2016 20:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-02"}
