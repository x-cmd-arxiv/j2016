A number of methods have been\ndeveloped to perform this inference.

It combines the\ncrystallization of a many-body system with dissipationless flow of the atoms it\nis built of. This quantum phase requires the breaking of two continuous\nsymmetries, the phase invariance of a superfluid and the continuous\ntranslational invariance to form the crystal,. Proposed for helium almost 50\nyears ago, experimental verification of supersolidity remains elusive. A\nvariant with only discrete translational symmetry breaking on a preimposed\nlattice structure, the `lattice supersolid', has been realized based on\nself-organization of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). However, lattice\nsupersolids do not feature the continuous ground state degeneracy that\ncharacterizes the supersolid state as originally proposed. Here we report the\nrealization of a supersolid with continuous translational symmetry breaking.\nThe continuous symmetry emerges from two discrete spatial ones by symmetrically\ncoupling a BEC to the modes of two optical cavities. We establish the phase\ncoherence of the supersolid and find a high ground-state degeneracy by\nmeasuring the crystal position over many realizations through the light fields\nleaking from the cavities.

Our algorithm was also a top performer at the 2016 3D Face\nAlignment in the Wild Challenge competition (done in conjunction with the\nEuropean Conference on Computer Vision, ECCV) that required the reconstruction\nof 3D face shape from a single image. The derived algorithm can be trained in a\ncouple hours and testing runs at more than 1, 000 frames/s on an i7 desktop. We\nalso present an innovative data augmentation approach that allows us to train\nthe system efficiently with small number of samples. And the system is robust\nto noise (e.g., imprecise landmark points) and missing data (e.g., occluded or\nundetected landmark points).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 19:58:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-29"}

There are two UV completions that can give\nrise to the effective Lagrangian: (i) $VB$: a vector boson that transforms as\nan $SU(2)_L$ triplet, as in the SM, (ii) $U_1$: an $SU(2)_L$-singlet vector\nleptoquark.

In this paper, we focus on the subset of WIMP models in which the\ndark matter annihilates in the early universe through couplings to either the\nStandard Model $Z$ or the Standard Model Higgs boson. Considering fermionic,\nscalar, and vector dark matter candidates within a model-independent context,\nwe find that the overwhelming majority of these dark matter candidates are\nalready ruled out by existing experiments. In the case of $Z$ mediated dark\nmatter, the only scenarios that are not currently excluded are those in which\nthe dark matter is a fermion with an axial coupling and with a mass either\nwithin a few GeV of the $Z$ resonance ($m_{\\rm DM} \\simeq m_Z/2$) or greater\nthan 200 GeV, or with a vector coupling and with $m_{\\rm DM} > 6$ TeV. Several\nHiggs mediated scenarios are currently viable if the mass of the dark matter is\nnear the Higgs pole ($m_{\\rm DM} \\simeq m_H/2$). Otherwise, the only scenarios\nthat are not excluded are those in which the dark matter is a scalar (vector)\nheavier than 400 GeV (1160 GeV) with a Higgs portal coupling, or a fermion with\na pseudoscalar (CP violating) coupling to the Standard Model Higgs boson. With\nthe exception of dark matter with a purely pseudoscalar coupling to the Higgs,\nit is anticipated that planned direct detection experiments will probe nearly\nthe entire range of models considered in this study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 21:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

(ii) what information is really contained in the Maltese cross?\n  We solve direct numerical simulations of the MHD equations including the\ntransverse stretching exerted by the solar wind flow and study the genuine 3D\nanisotropy of turbulence as well as that one resulting from the assumption of\naxisymmetry about B0. We show that the evolution of the turbulent spectrum from\n0.2 to 1 AU depends strongly on its initial anisotropy. An axisymmetric\nspectrum with respect to B0 keeps its axisymmetry, i.e., resists stretching\nperpendicular to radial, while an isotropic spectrum becomes essentially\naxisymmetric with respect to the radial direction.\n  We conclude that close to the Sun, slow-wind turbulence has a spectrum that\nis axisymmetric around B0 and the measured 2D component at 1 AU describes the\nreal shape of turbulent structures. On the contrary, fast-wind turbulence has a\nmore isotropic spectrum at the source and becomes radially symmetric at 1 AU.\nSuch structure is hidden by the symmetrization applied to the data that instead\nreturns a slab geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 20:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

We aim at determining the effect of the radial\nmigration of the solar orbit on the rate of stellar encounters. As a first step\nwe integrate the orbit of the Sun backwards in time in an analytical potential\nof the Milky Way. We use the present-day phase-space coordinates of the Sun,\naccording to the measured uncertainties. The resulting orbits are inserted in\nan N-body simulation of the Galaxy, where the stellar velocity dispersion is\ncalculated at each position along the orbit of the Sun. We compute the rate of\nGalactic stellar encounters by employing three different solar orbits\n---migrating from the inner disk, without any substantial migration, and\nmigrating from the outer disk. We find that the rate for encounters within\n$4\\times10^5$ AU from the Sun is approximately 21, 39 and 63 Myr$^{-1}$,\nrespectively. The stronger encounters establish the outer limit of the\nso-called parking zone, which is the region in the plane of the orbital\neccentricities and semi-major axes where the planetesimals of the Solar system\nhave been perturbed only by interactions with stars belonging to the Sun's\nbirth cluster. We estimate the outer edge of the parking zone at semi-major\naxes of 250--1300 AU (the outward and inward migrating orbits reaching the\nsmallest and largest values, respectively), which is one order of magnitude\nsmaller than the determination made by Portegies Zwart & J\\'ilkov\\'a (2015).

For this, we have constructed an N-body code that\nincludes tides in the affine approximation, where stars are modeled as\nself-similar ellipsoidal polytropes, and GR corrections using the commonly-used\npost-Newtonian formalism. Using this numerical formalism, we are able resolve\nthe leading effect from tides and GR across several orders of magnitude in both\nstellar radius and initial target binary separation. We find that the main\neffect from tides is the formation of two-body tidal captures that form during\nthe chaotic and resonant evolution of the triple system. The two stars\nundergoing the capture spiral in and merge. The inclusion of tides can thus\nlead to an increase on the stellar coalescence rate. We also develop an\nanalytical framework for calculating the cross section of tidal inspirals\nbetween any pair of objects with similar mass. From our analytical and\nnumerical estimates we find that the rate of tidal inspirals relative to\ncollisions increases as the initial semi-major axis of the target binary\nincreases and the radius of the interacting tidal objects decreases. The\nlargest effect is therefore found for triple systems hosting white dwarfs and\nneutron stars. In this case, we find the rate of highly eccentric white dwarf -\nneutron star mergers to likely be dominated by tidal inspirals. While tidal\ninspirals occur rarely, we note that they can give rise to a plethora of\nthermonuclear transients such as Ca-rich transients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 20:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

It allows one to control the spin dynamics on a\nfemtosecond time scale. The discipline, commonly called femtomagnetism, started\nwith the pioneering experiment by Beaurepaire and coworkers in 1996, who showed\nsubpicosecond demagnetization occurs in magnetic Ni thin films. This finding\nhas motivated extensive research worldwide. All-optical helicity-dependent spin\nswitching (AOS) represents a new frontier in femtomagnetism, where a single\nultrafast laser pulse can permanently switch spin without any assistance from a\nmagnetic field. This review summarizes some of the crucial aspects of this new\ndiscipline: key experimental findings, leading mechanisms, controversial\nissues, and possible future directions. The emphasis is on our latest\ninvestigation. We first develop the all-optical spin switching rule that\ndetermines how the switchability depends on the light helicity. This rule\nallows one to understand microscopically how the spin is reversed and why the\ncircularly polarized light appears more powerful than the linearly polarized\nlight. Then we invoke our latest spin-orbit coupled harmonic oscillator model\nto simulate single spin reversal. We consider both cw excitation and pulsed\nlaser excitation. The results are in a good agreement with the experimental\nresult. We then extend the code to include the exchange interaction among\ndifferent spin sites. We show where the \"inverse Faraday field\" comes from and\nhow the laser affects the spin reversal nonlinearly. Our hope is that this\nreview will motivate new experimental and theoretical investigations and\ndiscussions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 22:22:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 00:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-17"}

Also, we show that to achieve high contrast with a\npoint source, tuning the source size and its distance to the element is\ncrucial.We furthermore indicate and explore the possibility of realizing highly\ncomplex light patterns by using a periodic transmission element. These patterns\ncan have more spots in the far field than the number of diffraction orders of\nthe periodic element. We predict that the ultimate image contrast is smaller\nfor a point source compared to a plane wave. Our simulations confirm that the\nsmallest achievable spot size in the image is imposed by diffraction regardless\nof the imaging regime. Our research can be applied to similar domains e.g.\nquantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 23:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

In order to predict user actions such as the next product to purchase,\nmovie to watch, or place to visit, it is essential to take into account both\nlong-term user preferences and sequential patterns (i.e., short-term dynamics).\nMatrix Factorization and Markov Chain methods have emerged as two separate but\npowerful paradigms for modeling the two respectively.

In\nrecent years, similarity-based methods have been proposed for\n(sequentially-unaware) item recommendation with promising results on sparse\ndatasets.

But\nit is equipped with a rechargeable battery such that it can harvest and\naccumulate the harvested energy from RF signals sent by the source and\nco-channel interferers to support its operation. Leveraging the inherent\nfeature of the considered system, we develop a novel accumulate-then-forward\n(ATF) protocol to eliminate the harmful effect of CCI.

Each method is a form of Bayesian\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo that allows us to calculate a joint posterior\ndistribution for all parameters and hence the household reproduction number and\nthe early growth rate of the epidemic. The first method performs exact Bayesian\ninference using a standard data-augmentation approach; the second performs\napproximate Bayesian inference based on a likelihood approximation derived from\nbranching processes. These methods are compared for computational efficiency\nand posteriors from each are compared. The branching process is shown to be an\nexcellent approximation and remains computationally efficient as the amount of\ndata is increased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2016 01:52:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 03:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

Specifically, we treat every state in Markov\nmodel as a node, and use a graph to represent the privacy policy, in which\n\"indistinguishability\" between states is denoted by edges between nodes. Due to\nthe temporal correlations in Markov model, we show that the graph may be\nreduced to a subgraph with disconnected nodes, which become unprotected and\nmight be exposed. To detect such privacy risk, we define sensitivity hull and\ndegree of protection based on the graph to capture the condition of information\nexposure.

However, most of the existing\nmodels typically treat each word in a sentence equally. In contrast, extensive\nstudies have proven that human read sentences efficiently by making a sequence\nof fixation and saccades. This motivates us to improve sentence representations\nby assigning different weights to the vectors of the component words, which can\nbe treated as an attention mechanism on single sentences. To that end, we\npropose two novel attention models, in which the attention weights are derived\nusing significant predictors of human reading time, i.e., Surprisal, POS tags\nand CCG supertags. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nmethods significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art sentence representation\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2016 03:26:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 10:48:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

The key\nregulatory factors involved in transcriptional and translational regulation are\nArcA and ArcB proteins and ArcZ sRNA, respectively. Phosphorylated ArcA, in a\nfeedforward mechanism, represses the transcriptions sigma^s and ArcZ sRNA with\nthe latter being a post-transcriptional activator for sigma^s. Through a\nfeedback mechanisms, ArcZ sRNA destabilises ArcB mRNA and regulates the level\nof ArcB protein, a kinase that phosphorylates ArcA. The oxygen and energy\navailability is expected to influence the ArcA phosphorylation rate and, as a\nconsequence, in equilibrium, the system is likely to be in either a high ArcB\n(low ArcZ) or a low ArcB (high ArcZ) state. Kinetic modelling studies suggest\nthat the rate of destabilisation of ArcB mRNA by ArcZ sRNA must be\nappropriately tuned for achieving the desired state. In particular, for a high\nphosphorylation rate, the transition from a low to a high ArcZ synthesis regime\nwith the increase in sRNA-mRNA interaction is similar to the threshold-linear\nresponse observed earlier. Further, we show that the mRNA destabilisation by\nsRNA might be, in particular, beneficial in the low phosphorylation state for\nhaving the right concentration levels of ArcZ and ArcB.

However, to fully\nrealise these goals a major challenge is the ability to non-invasively image\ncharge currents in monolayer graphene structures and devices. Typically,\nelectronic transport in graphene has been investigated via resistivity\nmeasurements, however, such measurements are generally blind to spatial\ninformation critical to observing and studying landmark transport phenomena\nsuch as electron guiding and focusing, topological currents and viscous\nelectron backflow in real space, and in realistic imperfect devices. Here we\nbring quantum imaging to bear on the problem and demonstrate high-resolution\nimaging of current flow in graphene structures. Our method utilises an\nengineered array of near-surface, atomic-sized quantum sensors in diamond, to\nmap the vector magnetic field and reconstruct the vector current density over\ngraphene geometries of varying complexity, from mono-ribbons to junctions, with\nspatial resolution at the diffraction limit and a projected sensitivity to\ncurrents as small as 1 {\\mu}A. The measured current maps reveal strong spatial\nvariations corresponding to physical defects at the sub-{\\mu}m scale. The\ndemonstrated method opens up an important new avenue to investigate fundamental\nelectronic and spin transport in graphene structures and devices, and more\ngenerally in emerging two-dimensional materials and thin film systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2016 05:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-02"}

Proliferation of these\nhand held devices has made them a common means to access and process digital\ninformation. Most web based applications are today available in a form that can\nconveniently be accessed over mobile devices. However, webservices\n(applications meant for consumption by other applications rather than humans)\nare not as commonly provided and consumed over mobile devices. Facilitating\nthis and in effect realizing a service-oriented system over mobile devices has\nthe potential to further enhance the potential of mobile devices. One of the\nmajor challenges in this integration is the lack of an efficient service\nregistry system that caters to issues associated with the dynamic and volatile\nmobile environments. Existing service registry technologies designed for\ntraditional systems fall short of accommodating such issues. In this paper, we\npropose a novel approach to manage service registry systems provided 'solely'\nover mobile devices, and thus realising an SOA without the need for high-end\ncomputing systems. The approach manages a dynamic service registry system in\nthe form of light weight and distributed registries. We assess the feasibility\nof our approach by engineering and deploying a working prototype of the\nproposed registry system over actual mobile devices. A comparative study of the\nproposed approach and the traditional UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery,\nand Integration) registry is also included.

Nowadays, information\ncredibility evaluation has drawn attention from academic and industrial\ncommunities. Current methods mainly focus on feature engineering and achieve\nsome success. However, feature engineering based methods require a lot of labor\nand cannot fully reveal the underlying relations among data. In our viewpoint,\nthe key elements of user behaviors for evaluating credibility are concluded as\n\"who\", \"what\", \"when\", and \"how\". These existing methods cannot model the\ncorrelation among different key elements during the spreading of microblogs. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel representation learning method, Information\nCredibility Evaluation (ICE), to learn representations of information\ncredibility on social media. In ICE, latent representations are learnt for\nmodeling user credibility, behavior types, temporal properties, and comment\nattitudes.

This work for the\nfirst time proposes the second approach to directly training a linear\ngraph-based parse (LGPar) and a linear transition-based parser (LTPar) with PA\nbased on the idea of constrained decoding. We conduct extensive experiments on\nPenn Treebank under three different settings for simulating PA, i.e., random\ndependencies, most uncertain dependencies, and dependencies with divergent\noutputs from the three parsers. The results show that LLGPar is most effective\nin learning from PA and LTPar lags behind the graph-based counterparts by large\nmargin. Moreover, LGPar and LTPar can achieve best performance by using LLGPar\nto complete PA into full annotation (FA).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2016 08:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-30"}

We have carried out two dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with\nradiative cooling to study CPDs, and suggested a new mechanism to drive the\ndisk accretion. Two spiral shocks are present in CPDs, excited by the central\nstar. We find that spiral shocks can at least contribute to, if not dominate\nthe angular momentum transport and energy dissipation in CPDs. Meanwhile,\ndissipation and heating by spiral shocks have a positive feedback on\nshock-driven accretion itself. As the disk is heated up by spiral shocks, the\nshocks become more open, leading to more efficient angular momentum transport.\nThis shock driven accretion is, on the other hand, unsteady on a timescale of\nmonths/years due to production and destruction of vortices in disks. After\nbeing averaged over time, a quasi-steady accretion is reached from the planet's\nHill radius all the way to the planet surface, and the disk\n$\\alpha$-coefficient characterizing angular momentum transport due to spiral\nshocks is $\\sim$0.001-0.02.

Theoretically, we provide a finite-dimensional\napproximation of the Log-Hilbert-Schmidt (Log-HS) distance between covariance\noperators that is scalable to large datasets, while maintaining an effective\ndiscriminating capability. This allows us to efficiently approximate any\ncontinuous shift-invariant kernel defined using the Log-HS distance.

We\ndenote by $\\mathbf{CP}$ the space of all continuous polynomials of $\\omega$.\nFor $f^{(n)}\\in C_0(\\mathbb R_+^n)$, the orthogonal polynomial $\\langle\nP^{(n)}(\\omega),f^{(n)}\\rangle$ is defined as the orthogonal projection of the\nmonomial $\\langle\\omega^{\\otimes n},f^{(n)}\\rangle$ onto the subspace of\n$L^2(\\tau)$ that is orthogonal to all continuous polynomials of $\\omega$ of\norder $\\le n-1$. We denote by $\\mathbf{OCP}$ the linear span of the orthogonal\npolynomials. Each orthogonal polynomial $\\langle\nP^{(n)}(\\omega),f^{(n)}\\rangle$ depends only on the restriction of the function\n$f^{(n)}$ to the set $\\{(t_1,\\dots,t_n)\\in\\mathbb R_+^n\\mid t_1\\ge\nt_2\\ge\\dots\\ge t_n\\}$. The orthogonal polynomials allow us to construct a\nunitary operator $J:L^2(\\tau)\\to\\mathbb F$, where $\\mathbb F$ is an extended\nmonotone Fock space. Thus, we may think of the monotone noise $\\omega$ as a\ndistribution of linear operators acting in $\\mathbb F$. We say that the\northogonal polynomials belong to the Meixner class if\n$\\mathbf{CP}=\\mathbf{OCP}$. We prove that each system of orthogonal polynomials\nfrom the Meixner class is characterized by two parameters: $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb\nR$ and $\\eta\\ge0$. In this case, the monotone L\\'evy noise has the\nrepresentation\n$\\omega(t)=\\partial_t^\\dag+\\lambda\\partial_t^\\dag\\partial_t+\\partial_t+\\eta\\partial_t^\\dag\\partial_t\\partial_t$.\nHere, $\\partial_t^\\dag$ and $\\partial_t$ are the (formal) creation and\nannihilation operators at $t\\in\\mathbb R_+$ acting in $\\mathbb F$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2016 09:04:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-30"}

In\naddition, the SPDEs are either modulated by a continuous-time Markov chain with\na finite state space or have an addition fast jump component. The inclusion of\nthe Markov chain is for the needs of treating random environment, whereas the\naddition of the fast jump process enables the consideration of discontinuity in\nthe sample paths of the fast processes. Assuming either a fast changing Markov\nswitching or an additional fast-varying jump process, this work aims to obtain\nthe averaging principles for such systems. There are several distinct\ndifficulties. First, the noise is not square integrable. Second, in our setup,\nfor the underlying SPDE, there is only a unique mild solution and as a result,\nthere is only mild It\\^{o}'s formula that can be used. Moreover, another new\naspect is the addition of the fast regime switching and the addition of the\nfast varying jump processes in the formulation, which enlarges the\napplicability of the underlying systems.

Consequently there has been significant interest\nin understanding how cardiac activity is influenced by the circadian clock,\ni.e., temporal oscillations in physiological activity with a period close to 24\nhours and synchronized with the day-night cycle. Although studies have\nidentified the genetic basis of circadian rhythms at the intracellular level,\nthe mechanisms by which they influence cardiac pathologies are not yet fully\nunderstood. Evidence has suggested that diurnal variations in the conductance\nproperties of ion channel proteins that govern the excitation dynamics of\ncardiac cells may provide the crucial link. In this paper, we investigate the\nrelationship between the circadian rhythm as manifested in modulations of ion\nchannel properties and the susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias by using a\nmathematical model that describes electrical activity in ventricular tissue.

We model the dangers\nof long GRBs to planets in the Milky Way and utilize a static statistical model\nof the Galaxy that matches major observable properties, such as the inside-out\nstar formation history, metallicity evolution, and 3-dimensional stellar number\ndensity distribution. The GRB formation rate is a function of both the star\nformation history and metallicity; however, the extent to which chemical\nevolution reduces the GRB rate over time in the Milky Way is still an open\nquestion. Therefore, we compare the damaging effects of GRBs to biospheres in\nthe Milky Way using two models. One model generates GRBs as a function of the\ninside-out star formation history. The other model follows the star formation\nhistory, but generates GRB progenitors as a function of metallicity, thereby\nfavoring metal-poor host regions of the Galaxy over time. If the GRB rate only\nfollows the star formation history, the majority of the GRBs occur in the inner\nGalaxy. However, if GRB progenitors are constrained to low metallicity\nenvironments, then GRBs only form in the metal-poor outskirts at recent epochs.\nInterestingly, over the past 1 Gyr, the surface density of stars (and their\ncorresponding planets) that survive a GRB is still greatest in the inner galaxy\nin both models. The present day danger of long GRBs to life at the solar radius\n($R_\\odot=8$ kpc) is low. We find that at least $\\sim$65% of stars survive a\nGRB over the past 1 Gyr.

Such strong models assume: (i) adversary's physical proximity to the\nvictim, (ii) precise profiling of the victim's typing style and keyboard,\nand/or (iii) significant amount of victim's typed information (and its\ncorresponding sounds) available to the adversary.\n  This paper presents and explores a new keyboard acoustic eavesdropping attack\nthat involves Voice-over-IP (VoIP), called Skype & Type (S&T), while avoiding\nprior strong adversary assumptions. This work is motivated by the simple\nobservation that people often engage in secondary activities (including typing)\nwhile participating in VoIP calls.

Our\nresults demonstrate that, given some knowledge on the victim's typing style and\nkeyboard model, the attacker attains top-5 accuracy of 91.7% in guessing a\nrandom key pressed by the victim.\n  Furthermore, we demonstrate that S&T is robust to various VoIP issues (e.g.,\nInternet bandwidth fluctuations and presence of voice over keystrokes), thus\nconfirming feasibility of this attack.

Two models are considered which dynamically generate N*-like\nstates close to the phi N threshold.

Yet in\nisolated gas-free spherical stellar systems, the hardening of the binary stalls\nat parsec-scale separations owing to the inefficiency of relaxation-driven\nloss-cone refilling. Repopulation via collisionless orbit diffusion in triaxial\nsystems is more efficient, but published simulation results are contradictory.\nWhile sustained hardening has been reported in simulations of galaxy mergers\nwith $N \\sim 10^6$ stars and in early simulations of rotating models, in\nisolated non-rotating triaxial models the hardening rate continues to fall with\nincreasing N, a signature of spurious two-body relaxation. We present a novel\napproach for studying loss cone repopulation in galactic nuclei. Since loss\ncone repopulation in triaxial systems owes to orbit diffusion, it is a purely\ncollisionless phenomenon and can be studied with an approximated force\ncalculation technique, provided the force errors are well behaved and\nsufficiently small. We achieve this using an accurate fast multipole method and\ndefine a proxy for the hardening rate that depends only on stellar angular\nmomenta. We find that the loss cone is efficiently replenished even in very\nmildly triaxial models (with axis ratios 1 : 0.9 : 0.8). Such triaxiality is\nunavoidable following galactic mergers and can drive binaries into the\ngravitational wave regime. We conclude that there is no final parsec problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2016 15:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

Here we design an ultra-stable molecular junction of two/three\ndimensional (2D/3D) perovskites.

Aiming at the up-scaling of this technology, we realize 10x10 cm2\nlarge-area photovoltaic modules by a low-cost, fully printable,\nindustrial-scale process delivering 11.2% PCE.

Here we establish the statistical mechanics of human weight\nchange, providing a fundamental new understanding of human weight\ndistributions. By compiling and analysing the largest data set so far of\nyear-over-year BMI changes, we find, strikingly, that heavy people on average\nstrongly decrease their weight year-over-year, and light people increase their\nweight. This drift towards the centre of the BMI distribution is balanced by\ndiffusion resulting from random fluctuations in diet and physical activity that\nare, notably, proportional in size to BMI. We formulate a stochastic\nmathematical model for BMI dynamics, deriving a theoretical shape for the BMI\ndistribution and offering a mechanism to explain the ongoing right-skewed\nbroadening of BMI distributions over time. The model also provides new\nquantitative support for the hypothesis that peer-to-peer social influence\nplays a measurable role in BMI dynamics. More broadly, our results demonstrate\na remarkable analogy with drift-diffusion mechanisms that are well-known from\nthe physical sciences and finance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Sep 2016 12:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-07"}

While the generation mechanisms of AGWs have been\nstudied from the perspective of vertical oscillations of seafloor and triad\nwave-wave interaction, in the current study we are interested in their\ngeneration by wave-structure interaction with possible implication to the\nenergy sector. Here, we develop two wavemaker theories to analyze different\nwave modes generated by impermeable (the classic Havelock's theory) and porous\n(porous wavemaker theory) plates in weakly compressible fluids. Slight\nmodification has been made to the porous theory so that, unlike the previous\ntheory, the new solution depends on the geometry of the plate. The expressions\nfor three different types of plates (piston, flap, delta-function) are\nintroduced. Analytical solutions are also derived for the potential amplitude\nof the gravity, acoustic-gravity, evanescent waves, as well as the surface\nelevation, velocity distribution, and pressure for AGWs. Both theories reduce\nto previous results for incompressible flow when the compressibility is\nneglected. We also show numerical examples for AGWs generated in a wave flume\nas well as in deep ocean.
