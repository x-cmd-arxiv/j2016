The competitions are open to all\nacademic and industrial institutions which have a solution for either\nsoftwarebased or system-based fingerprint liveness detection. The LivDet\ncompetitions have been hosted in 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015 and have shown\nthemselves to provide a crucial look at the current state of the art in\nliveness detection schemes. There has been a noticeable increase in the number\nof participants in LivDet competitions as well as a noticeable decrease in\nerror rates across competitions. Participants have grown from four to the most\nrecent thirteen submissions for Fingerprint Part 1. Fingerprints Part 2 has\nheld steady at two submissions each competition in 2011 and 2013 and only one\nfor the 2015 edition. The continuous increase of competitors demonstrates a\ngrowing interest in the topic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 16:39:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

Inherent limitations of statistics impose\nconstrains on reliability of conclusions drawn from data but misuse of\nstatistical methods is a growing concern. Significance, hypothesis testing and\nthe accompanying P-values are being scrutinized as representing most widely\napplied and abused practices. One line of critique is that P-values are\ninherently unfit to fulfill their ostensible role as measures of scientific\nhypothesis's credibility. It has also been suggested that while P-values may\nhave their role as summary measures of effect, researchers underappreciate the\ndegree of randomness in the P-value. High variability of P-values would suggest\nthat having obtained a small P-value in one study, one is, nevertheless, likely\nto obtain a much larger P-value in a similarly powered replication study. Thus,\n\"replicability of P-value\" is itself questionable. To characterize P-value\nvariability one can use prediction intervals whose endpoints reflect the likely\nspread of P-values that could have been obtained by a replication study.\nUnfortunately, the intervals currently in use, the P-intervals, are based on\nunrealistic implicit assumptions. Namely, P-intervals are constructed with the\nassumptions that imply substantial chances of encountering large values of\neffect size in an observational study, which leads to bias. As an alternative\nto P-intervals, we develop a method that gives researchers flexibility by\nproviding them with the means to control these assumptions. Unlike endpoints of\nP-intervals, endpoints of our intervals are directly interpreted as\nprobabilistic bounds for replication P-values and are resistant to selection\nbias contingent upon approximate prior knowledge of the effect size\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 17:35:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 21:10:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2016 15:28:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-13"}

Most color constancy (CC) models have been\ndesigned to first estimate the illuminant color, which is then removed from the\ncolor biased image to obtain an image taken under white light, without the\nexplicit consideration of CSS effect on CC. This paper first studies the CSS\neffect on illuminant estimation arising in the inter-dataset-based CC\n(inter-CC), i.e., training a CC model on one dataset and then testing on\nanother dataset captured by a distinct CSS. We show the clear degradation of\nexisting CC models for inter-CC application. Then a simple way is proposed to\novercome such degradation by first learning quickly a transform matrix between\nthe two distinct CSSs (CSS-1 and CSS-2). The learned matrix is then used to\nconvert the data (including the illuminant ground truth and the color biased\nimages) rendered under CSS-1 into CSS-2, and then train and apply the CC model\non the color biased images under CSS-2, without the need of burdensome\nacquiring of training set under CSS-2. Extensive experiments on synthetic and\nreal images show that our method can clearly improve the inter-CC performance\nfor traditional CC algorithms. We suggest that by taking the CSS effect into\naccount, it is more likely to obtain the truly color constant images invariant\nto the changes of both illuminant and camera sensors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 17:50:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 15:33:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

In particular, the dispersion of the\ncomposite fermion exciton, which is the lowest energy spin conserving neutral\nexcitation, displays filling-factor-specific minima called \"magnetoroton\"\nminima. Simon and Halperin employed the Chern-Simons field theory of composite\nfermions [Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 48}, 17368 (1993)] to predict the magnetoroton\nminima positions. Recently, Golkar \\emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 117},\n216403 (2016)] have modeled the neutral excitations as deformations of the\ncomposite fermion Fermi sea, which results in a prediction for the positions of\nthe magnetoroton minima. Using methods of the microscopic composite fermion\ntheory we calculate the positions of the roton minima for filling factors up to\n5/11 along the sequence $s/(2s+1)$ and find them to be in reasonably good\nagreement with both the Chern-Simons field theory of composite fermions and\nGolkar \\emph{et al.}'s theory. We also find that the positions of the roton\nminima are insensitive to the microscopic interaction in agreement with Golkar\n\\emph{et al.}'s theory. As a byproduct of our calculations, we obtain the\ncharge and neutral gaps for the fully spin polarized states along the sequence\n$s/(2s\\pm 1)$ in the lowest Landau level and the $n=1$ Landau level of\ngraphene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 19:30:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2017 09:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-26"}

Using simulated mock catalogs, we demonstrate that fiber\ncollisions have a significant impact on the power spectrum, $P(k)$, monopole\nand quadrupole that exceeds sample variance at scales smaller than\n$k\\sim0.1~h/Mpc$.\n  We present two methods to account for fiber collisions in the power spectrum.\nThe first, statistically reconstructs the clustering of fiber collided galaxy\npairs by modeling the distribution of the line-of-sight displacements between\nthem.

Using this method, we recover the true\n$P(k)$ monopole of the mock catalogs with residuals of $<0.5\\%$ at\n$k=0.3~h/Mpc$ and $<4\\%$ at $k=0.83~h/Mpc$ -- a significant improvement over\nexisting correction methods. The quadrupole, however, does not improve\nsignificantly.\n  The second method models the effect of fiber collisions on the power spectrum\nas a convolution with a configuration space top-hat function that depends on\nthe physical scale of fiber collisions. It directly computes theoretical\npredictions of the fiber-collided $P(k)$ multipoles and reduces the influence\nof smaller scales to a set of nuisance parameters. Using this method, we\nreliably model the effect of fiber collisions on the monopole and quadrupole\ndown to the scale limits of theoretical predictions.

In particular, we provide the expected mass function of EMRIs, given an\ninitial mass function of stellar BHs (SBHs), and relate it to the\nmass-dependent detection rate of EMRIs. We then consider the role of star\nformation on the distribution of compact objects and its implication on EMRI\nrates.

However, it also leads to a relative quenching of EMRI rates\nfrom lower-mass SBHs, and together produces a steep dependence of the EMRI mass\nfunction on the highest-mass SBHs. Star-formation history plays a relatively\nsmall role in determining the EMRI rates of SBHs, since most of them migrate\nclose to the MBH through mass-segregation rather than forming in-situ. However,\nthe EMRI rate of neutron stars can be significantly increased when they form\nin-situ close to the MBH, as they can inspiral before relaxation processes\nsignificantly segregates them outwards.

LIERs are\nubiquitous in both quiescent galaxies and in the central regions of galaxies\nwhere star formation takes place at larger radii. We refer to these two classes\nof galaxies as extended LIER (eLIER) and central LIER (cLIER) galaxies\nrespectively. cLIERs are late type galaxies located around the green valley, in\nthe transition region between the star formation main sequence and quiescent\ngalaxies. These galaxies display regular disc rotation in both stars and gas,\nalthough featuring a higher central stellar velocity dispersion than star\nforming galaxies of the same mass. cLIERs are consistent with being slowly\nquenched inside-out; the transformation is associated with massive bulges,\npointing towards the importance of bulge growth via secular evolution. eLIERs\nare morphologically early types and are indistinguishable from passive galaxies\ndevoid of line emission in terms of their stellar populations, morphology and\ncentral stellar velocity dispersion. Ionised gas in eLIERs shows both disturbed\nand disc-like kinematics. When a large-scale flow/rotation is observed in the\ngas, it is often misaligned relative to the stellar component. These features\nindicate that eLIERs are passive galaxies harbouring a residual cold gas\ncomponent, acquired mostly via external accretion. Importantly, quiescent\ngalaxies devoid of line emission reside in denser environments and have\nsignificantly higher satellite fraction than eLIERs.

We obtained the first ever far-infrared\n(FIR) line observations of a GRB host, namely Herschel/PACS resolved [CII] 158\num and [OI] 63 um spectroscopy, as well as APEX CO(2-1) and ALMA CO(1-0)\nobservations of the GRB 980425 host. It has elevated [CII]/FIR and [OI]/FIR\nratios and higher values of star formation rate (SFR) derived from line ([CII],\n[OI], Ha) than from continuum (UV, IR, radio) indicators. [CII] emission\nexhibits a normal morphology, peaking at the galaxy center, whereas [OI] is\nconcentrated close to the GRB position and the nearby Wolf-Rayet region. The\nhigh [OI] flux indicates high radiation field and gas density. The [CII]/CO\nluminosity ratio of the GRB 980425 host is close to the highest values found\nfor local star-forming galaxies. Its CO-derived molecular gas mass is low given\nits SFR and metallicity, but the [CII]-derived molecular gas mass is close to\nthe expected value. The [OI] and HI concentrations, and the high radiation\nfield and density are consistent with the hypothesis of a very recent (at most\na few tens of Myr ago) inflow of atomic gas triggering star formation. Dust has\nnot had time to build up (explaining high line-to-continuum ratios). Such a\nrecent enhancement of star-formation would indeed manifest itself in high\nSFR_line/SFR_continuum ratios, because the line indicators are sensitive only\nto recent (<10 Myr) activity, whereas the continuum indicators measure the SFR\naveraged over much longer periods (~100 Myr). Other GRB hosts exhibit a mean\nSFR_line/SFR_continuum of 1.74+-0.32. This is consistent with a very recent\nenhancement of star formation being common among GRB hosts, so galaxies which\nhave recently experienced inflow of gas may preferentially host stars exploding\nas GRBs. Hence GRB hosts may be used to investigate recent gas accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 20:23:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

The benefits of the proposed architecture are multi-fold: It\nguides the network where to focus in the image and effectively encodes part\nconstraints and context. More importantly, it can effectively cope with\nocclusions because part detection heatmaps for occluded parts provide low\nconfidence scores which subsequently guide the regression part of our network\nto rely on contextual information in order to predict the location of these\nparts.

We assume that the metric\nbesides mass $M$ contains an additional parameter $\\ell$, which determines the\nscale where modification of the solution of the Einstein equations becomes\nsignificant. We require that the modified metric obeys the limiting curvature\ncondition, that is its curvature is uniformly restricted by the value $\\sim\n\\ell^{-2}$. We also make a \"more technical\" assumption that the metric\ncoefficients are rational functions of $r$. In particular, the invariant\n$(\\nabla r)^2$ has the form $P_n(r)/\\tilde{P}_n(r)$, where $P_n$ and\n$\\tilde{P}_n$ are polynomials of the order of $n$. We discuss first the case of\nfour dimensions. We show that when $n\\le 2$ such a metric cannot describe a\nnon-singular black hole. For $n=3$ we find a suitable metric, which besides $M$\nand $\\ell$ contains a dimensionless numerical parameter. When this parameter\nvanishes the obtained metric coincides with Hayward's one. The characteristic\nproperty of such spacetimes is $-\\xi^2=(\\nabla r)^2$, where $\\xi^2$ is a\ntime-like at infinity Killing vector. We describe a possible generalization of\na non-singular black-hole metric to the case when this equality is violated. We\nalso obtain a metric for a charged non-singular black hole obeying similar\nrestrictions as the neutral one, and construct higher dimensional models of\nneutral and charged black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 20:56:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2016 19:46:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

But one of the \"black art\" of data mining is setting the\ntunings that control the miner. Objective:We seek simple, automatic, and very\neffective method for finding those tunings. Method: For each experiment with\ndifferent data sets (from open source JAVA systems), we ran differential\nevolution as anoptimizer to explore the tuning space (as a first step) then\ntested the tunings using hold-out data. Results: Contrary to our prior\nexpectations, we found these tunings were remarkably simple: it only required\ntens, not thousands,of attempts to obtain very good results. For example, when\nlearning software defect predictors, this method can quickly find tuningsthat\nalter detection precision from 0% to 60%.

Many common models in use\nin political science, including the linear model, are not necessarily\nparametric -- rather they may be semiparametric. Common estimators of model\nparameters such as ordinary least squares have both robust (corresponding to a\nsemiparametric model) and classical (corresponding to a more restrictive model)\nstandard error estimates.

Once the planets have,\nfor the most part, assembled after a giant impact phase, they continue to be\nbombarded by a multitude of planetesimals left over from accretion. Here we\nplace limits on the mass and evolution of these planetesimals based on\nconstraints from the highly siderophile element (HSE) budget of the Moon.\nOutcomes from a combination of N-body and Monte Carlo simulations of planet\nformation lead us to four key conclusions about the nature of this early epoch.\nFirst, matching the terrestrial to lunar HSE ratio requires either that the\nlate veneer on Earth consisted of a single lunar-size impactor striking the\nEarth before 4.45 Ga, or that it originated from the impact that created the\nMoon. An added complication is that analysis of lunar samples indicates the\nMoon does not preserve convincing evidence for a late veneer like Earth.\nSecond, the expected chondritic veneer component on Mars is 0.06 weight\npercent. Third, the flux of terrestrial impactors must have been low (\n<=10^(-6) M_earth/Myr) to avoid wholesale melting of Earth's crust after\n4.4~Ga, and to simultaneously match the number of observed lunar basins. This\nconclusion leads to an Hadean eon which is more clement than assumed\npreviously. Last, after the terrestrial planets had fully formed, the mass in\nremnant planetesimals was ~10^(-3) M_earth, lower by at least an order of\nmagnitude than most previous models suggest. Our dynamically and geochemically\nself-consistent scenario requires that future N-body simulations of rocky\nplanet formation either directly incorporate collisional grinding or rely on\npebble accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 23:44:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

We argue that this capability is crucial not\nonly for metrological purposes, as it provides access to the asymmetric spectra\nassociated with non-classical environments, but ultimately for achieving\nquantum fault-tolerance, as it enables the characterization of bath correlation\nfunctions. Our result relies on (i) an exact analytic solution for the reduced\nmultiqubit dynamics that holds in the presence of an arbitrary Gaussian\nenvironment and dephasing-preserving control; (ii) the use of specific timing\nsymmetries in the control, which allow for a frequency comb to be engineered\nfor all filter functions of interest, and for the spectra to be related to\nexperimentally accessible qubit observables.

As such, the sample complexity in uniform\nmatrix completion---using uniform random sampling---increases to\n$O(\\eta(M)\\cdot rn\\log^{2}n)$, where $\\eta(M)$ is the largest leverage score of\n$M$. In this paper, we propose a two-phase algorithm called MC$^2$ for matrix\ncompletion: in the first phase, the leverage scores are estimated based on\nuniform random samples, and then in the second phase the matrix is resampled\nnonuniformly based on the estimated leverage scores and then completed. For\nwell-conditioned matrices, the total sample complexity of MC$^2$ is no worse\nthan uniform matrix completion, and for certain classes of well-conditioned\nmatrices---namely, reasonably coherent matrices whose leverage scores exhibit\nmild decay---MC$^2$ requires substantially fewer samples.

In this paper, we propose a novel data detection algorithm referred\nto as Triangular Approximate SEmidefinite Relaxation (TASER), which is suitable\nfor two application scenarios: (i) coherent data detection in large multi-user\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) wireless systems and (ii) joint\nchannel estimation and data detection in large single-input multiple-output\n(SIMO) wireless systems.

First, its\ndistance-based structure allows us to exploit the duality between powers of the\nEuclidean distance and its Fourier transform for theoretical analysis. Using\nthis duality, we show that support points converge in distribution to $F$, and\nenjoy an improved error rate to Monte Carlo for integrating a large class of\nfunctions. Second, the minimization of the energy distance can be formulated as\na difference-of-convex program, which we manipulate using two algorithms to\nefficiently generate representative point sets. In simulation studies, support\npoints provide improved integration performance to both Monte Carlo and a\nspecific Quasi-Monte Carlo method. Two important applications of support points\nare then highlighted: (a) as a way to quantify the propagation of uncertainty\nin expensive simulations, and (b) as a method to optimally compact Markov chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) samples in Bayesian computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 02:59:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Oct 2016 04:23:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2017 05:37:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 22:50:44 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 14:57:50 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2017 17:38:15 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sun, 9 Sep 2018 17:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-11"}

Eight subjects with different\nskill in driving real cars participated in these experiments. They were\ninstructed to drive a virtual car without overtaking the lead car driven by\ncomputer at a fixed speed and not to lose sight of it. Moreover, these\nexperiments were conducted with four different speed including 60km/h, 80km/h,\n100km/h, and 120km/h. Based on the collected data the distribution of the\nheadway, velocity, acceleration, and jerk are constructed and compared with\navailable experimental data collected previously by the analysis of the real\ntraffic flow. A new model for car-following is proposed capture the found\nproperties. As the main results we draw a conclusion that the human behavior in\ncar driving should be categorized as a generalized intermittent control with\nnoise-driven activation of the active phase. Besides, we hypothesize that the\nextended phase space required for modeling human actions in car driving has to\ncomprise four phase variables, namely, the headway distance, the velocity of\ncar, its acceleration, and the car jerk, i.e., the time derivative of the car\nacceleration. This time, the time pattern of pedal pushing and the distribution\nof time derivative of pedal was utilized in addition to previous variables.\nMoreover, all subjects' driving data were categorized as some styles with their\nshapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 03:05:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

With the advancements in shoe technology, running shoes have grown in\npopularity among runners, as well as non-runners, because they reduce the risk\nof injuries from the impact felt by the foot. The purpose of this report is to\nanalyze the effect of running shoes on impact forces on the foot. This is\nachieved through the use of three force pads fixed at different locations on\nthe foot The force measured by each sensor is then used to estimate the\nvertical ground reaction force, using the sensors' calibrations equations .\nBased on the ground reaction force, the effective mass corresponding to the\nmomentum change occurring during the transient phase of the impact is\nestimated.

Yet,\none of major issues is the apparent contradiction between linear stability\nanalysis quoting a flow to be stable and results from experiments and\nsimulations proving it to be otherwise. There is some success, in particular in\nastrophysical systems, based on Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI). However,\nMRI requires the system to be weakly magnetized, which is not a feature of\ngeneral magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows. Nevertheless, linear perturbations of\nsuch flows are nonnormal in nature which argues for an origin of nonlinearity\ntherein. The idea is, nonnormal perturbations could produce huge transient\nenergy growth (TEG), which may lead to non-linearity and further turbulence.\nHowever, so far, nonnormal effects in shear flows have not been explored much\nin the presence of magnetic fields. Here, we consider the perturbed\nvisco-resistive incompressible MHD shear flows with rotation in general.\nBasically we consider the magnetized version of Orr-Sommerfeld and Squire\nequations and their magnetic analogues in the presence of Coriolis effect. We\nsolve the equations using a pseudospectral eigenvalue approach. We investigate\nthe possible emergence of instability and large TEG in three different flows:\nthe Keplerian, constant angular momentum and plane Couette flows.

Rotating\nshear flows are ubiquitous in astrophysics, especially accretion disks, where\nmolecular viscosity is too low to account for observed data.

Amidst their complexity, one\noften find order specified by not more than a few parameters. Key to such a\nreductionistic description is an appropriate choice of basis, two of which I\nshall describe in this thesis.\n  The first, an exact mapping known as the Wannier State Representation (WSR),\nprovides an exact Hilbert space correspondence between two intensely-studied\ntopological systems, the Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) and Fractional Chern\nInsulator (FCI) systems. FQH states exist within the partially filled Landau\nlevels of interacting 2D electron gases under strong magnetic fields, where\nquasiparticles exhibit topologically nontrivial braiding statistics. FCI\nsystems, which are novel lattice realizations of FQH systems without orbital\nmagnetic field, are still not completely understood and will benefit from a\nbasis that explicitly connects them to the much better understood FQH systems.\n  The second basis mapping, the Exact Holographic Mapping (EHM), maps any\nlattice system to a holographic 'bulk' with an additional emergent dimension\nrepresenting energy scale. Devised in the spirit of the highly popular AdS-CFT\ncorrespondence, it attempts to understand the relationship between a given\nsystem and its equivalent dual geometry. In particular, we found excellent\ntheoretical agreement of certain dual geometries from EHM with those expected\nfrom the Ryu-Takanayagi formula relating the bulk geometry with entanglement\nentropy. Additionally, the EHM also proves useful in providing a link between\ndifferent topological quantities, such as relating the Chern number of the\nabovementioned Chern Insulators with the Axion angle of 3D topological\ninsulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 07:12:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

We first show that tag based annotation\nlacks consistency and compactness for describing visually similar contents. We\nthen learn the visual similarity between tags based on the visual features of\nthe images containing the tags.

We furthermore gradually\nchange the hopping parameter of the heaviest quark from strange to charm to\nstudy how the properties of the $\\Lambda$ baryons evolve as a function of the\nheavy quark mass. It is found that the baryon energy levels increase almost\nlinearly with the quark mass. Meanwhile, the flavor structure of most of the\nstates remains stable, with the exception of the lowest $\\frac{1}{2}^{-}$\nstate, which changes from a flavor singlet $\\Lambda$ to a $\\Lambda_c$ state\nwith singlet and octet components of comparable size. Finally, we discuss\nwhether our findings can be interpreted with the help of a simple quark model\nand find that the negative-parity $\\Lambda_c$ states can be naturally explained\nas diquark excitations of the light $u$ and $d$ quarks. On the other hand, the\nquark-model picture does not appear to be adequate for the negative-parity\n$\\Lambda$ states, suggesting the importance of other degrees of freedom to\ndescribe them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 09:01:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2017 05:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-09"}

In this study we first introduce a new model of dynamics on a\nsymbolic space, the versatile shift, showing that it supports the real-time\nsimulation of a range of automata. We then show that the Goedelization of\nversatile shifts defines nonlinear dynamical automata, dynamical systems\nevolving on a vectorial space. Finally, we present a mapping between nonlinear\ndynamical automata and recurrent artificial neural networks. The mapping\ndefines an architecture characterized by its granular modularity, where data,\nsymbolic operations and their control are not only distinguishable in\nactivation space, but also spatially localizable in the network itself, while\nmaintaining a distributed encoding of symbolic representations. The resulting\nnetworks simulate automata in real-time and are programmed directly, in absence\nof network training. To discuss the unique characteristics of the architecture\nand their consequences, we present two examples: i) the design of a Central\nPattern Generator from a finite-state locomotive controller, and ii) the\ncreation of a network simulating a system of interactive automata that supports\nthe parsing of garden-path sentences as investigated in psycholinguistics\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 10:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

In this paper, we propose a novel Wi-Fi monetization\nmodel for venue owners (VOs) deploying public Wi-Fi hotspots, where the VOs can\ngenerate revenue by providing two different Wi-Fi access schemes for mobile\nusers (MUs): (i) the premium access, in which MUs directly pay VOs for their\nWi-Fi usage, and (ii) the advertising sponsored access, in which MUs watch\nadvertisements in exchange of the free usage of Wi-Fi. VOs sell their ad spaces\nto advertisers (ADs) via an ad platform, and share the ADs' payments with the\nad platform. We formulate the economic interactions among the ad platform, VOs,\nMUs, and ADs as a three-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, the ad platform\nannounces its advertising revenue sharing policy. In Stage II, VOs determine\nthe Wi-Fi prices (for MUs) and advertising prices (for ADs). In Stage III, MUs\nmake access choices and ADs purchase advertising spaces. We analyze the\nsub-game perfect equilibrium (SPE) of the proposed game systematically, and our\nanalysis shows the following useful observations. First, the ad platform's\nadvertising revenue sharing policy in Stage I will affect only the VOs' Wi-Fi\nprices but not the VOs' advertising prices in Stage II. Second, both the VOs'\nWi-Fi prices and advertising prices are non-decreasing in the advertising\nconcentration level and non-increasing in the MU visiting frequency. Numerical\nresults further show that the VOs are capable of generating large revenues\nthrough mainly providing one type of Wi-Fi access (the premium access or\nadvertising sponsored access), depending on their advertising concentration\nlevels and MU visiting frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 12:07:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2017 07:22:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2017 13:15:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

We have\ndeveloped a demonstrator system suitable for such applications. The system\ncombines a 961 pixel imaging array based upon Microwave Kinetic Inductance\nDetectors (MKIDs) with a readout system capable of reading out all pixels\nsimultaneously with only one readout cable pair and a single cryogenic\namplifier. We evaluate, in a representative environment, the system performance\nin terms of sensitivity, dynamic range, optical efficiency, cosmic ray\nrejection, pixel-pixel crosstalk and overall yield at at an observation centre\nfrequency of 850 GHz and 20% fractional bandwidth. The overall system has an\nexcellent sensitivity, with an average detector sensitivity NEPdet=3x10^-19\nW/rt(Hz) measured using a thermal calibration source. At a loading power per\npixel of 50fW we demonstrate white, photon noise limited detector noise down to\n300 mHz.

Because the LTE network works in an\ninterference-free manner in the cooperation mode, it can achieve a much larger\ndata rate than that in the competition mode, which allows it to effectively\nserve both its own users and the Wi-Fi users. We design a second-price reverse\nauction mechanism, which enables the LTE provider and the Wi-Fi access point\nowners (APOs) to effectively negotiate the operation mode. Specifically, the\nLTE provider is the auctioneer (buyer), and the APOs are the bidders (sellers)\nwho compete to sell their channel access opportunities to the LTE provider. In\nStage I of the auction, the LTE provider announces a reserve rate. In Stage II\nof the auction, the APOs submit their bids. We show that the auction involves\nallocative externalities, i.e., the cooperation between the LTE provider and\none APO benefits other APOs who are not directly involved in this cooperation.\nAs a result, a particular APO's willingness to cooperate is affected by its\nbelief about other APOs' willingness to cooperate. This makes our analysis much\nmore challenging than that of the conventional second-price auction, where\nbidding truthfully is a weakly dominant strategy. We show that the APOs have a\nunique form of the equilibrium bidding strategies in Stage II, based on which\nwe analyze the LTE provider's optimal reserve rate in Stage I.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 12:30:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 06:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

It is a\nrobust entanglement-enhanced sensing scheme whose 6 dB performance advantage\nover a coherent-state sensor of the same average transmitted photon number\nsurvives the initial entanglement's eradication by loss and noise.\nUnfortunately, an implementation of the optimum quantum receiver that would\nreap QI's full performance advantage has remained elusive, owing to its having\nto deal with a huge number of very noisy optical modes. We show how\nsum-frequency generation (SFG) can be fruitfully applied to optimum multi-mode\nGaussian-mixed-state discrimination. Applied to QI, our analysis and numerical\nevaluations demonstrate that our SFG receiver saturates QI's quantum Chernoff\nbound.

The majority of bright extragalactic gamma-ray sources are blazars.\nOnly a few radio galaxies have been detected by Fermi/LAT. Recently, the\nGHz-peaked spectrum source PKS 1718-649 was confirmed to be gamma-ray bright,\nproviding further evidence for the existence of a population of gamma-ray loud,\ncompact radio galaxies. A spectral turnover in the radio spectrum in the MHz to\nGHz range is a characteristic feature of these objects, which are thought to be\nyoung due to their small linear sizes. The multiwavelength properties of the\ngamma-ray source PMN J1603-4904 suggest that it is a member of this source\nclass. Aims. The known radio spectrum of PMN J1603-4904 can be described by a\npower law above 1 GHz. Using observations from the Giant Metrewave Radio\nTelescope (GMRT) at 150, 325, and 610 MHz, we investigate the behaviour of the\nspectrum at lower frequencies to search for a low-frequency turnover. Methods.\nData from the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS ADR) catalogue and archival GMRT\nobservations were used to construct the first MHz to GHz spectrum of PMN\nJ1603-4904. Results. We detect a low-frequency turnover of the spectrum and\nmeasure the peak position at about 490 MHz (rest-frame), which, using the known\nrelation of peak frequency and linear size, translates into a maximum linear\nsource size of ~1.4 kpc. Conclusions. The detection of the MHz peak indicates\nthat PMN J1603-4904 is part of this population of radio galaxies with turnover\nfrequencies in the MHz to GHz regime. Therefore it can be considered the\nsecond, confirmed object of this kind detected in gamma-rays. Establishing this\ngamma-ray source class will help to investigate the gamma-ray production sites\nand to test broadband emission models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 14:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

Subsequently, while\nmaintaining the semantics of the aforementioned standards but rejecting the ER\nas a conceptual framework for bibliographic data, this paper builds on the RDF\n(Resource Description Framework) potential and documents how both the RDF and\nLinked Data's rationale can affect the way we model bibliographic data.

Thus, instead of describing indivisible resources, we could\ndescribe entities that appear in a variety of names on various resources.

Lossy compression of interferometric\nradio-astronomical data is considered to reduce the volume of visibility data\nand to speed up processing.\n  A new compression technique named \"Dysco\" is introduced that consists of two\nsteps: a normalization step, in which grouped visibilities are normalized to\nhave a similar distribution; and a quantization and encoding step, which rounds\nvalues to a given quantization scheme using a dithering scheme. Several\nnon-linear quantization schemes are tested and combined with different methods\nfor normalizing the data. Four data sets with observations from the LOFAR and\nMWA telescopes are processed with different processing strategies and different\ncombinations of normalization and quantization. The effects of compression are\nmeasured in image plane.\n  The noise added by the lossy compression technique acts like normal system\nnoise. The accuracy of Dysco is depending on the signal-to-noise ratio of the\ndata: noisy data can be compressed with a smaller loss of image quality. Data\nwith typical correlator time and frequency resolutions can be compressed by a\nfactor of 6.4 for LOFAR and 5.3 for MWA observations with less than 1% added\nsystem noise. An implementation of the compression technique is released that\nprovides a Casacore storage manager and allows transparent encoding and\ndecoding. Encoding and decoding is faster than the read/write speed of typical\ndisks.\n  The technique can be used for LOFAR and MWA to reduce the archival space\nrequirements for storing observed data. Data from SKA-low will likely be\ncompressible by the same amount as LOFAR. The same technique can be used to\ncompress data from other telescopes, but a different bit-rate might be\nrequired.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 15:28:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

High SiO and low HNCO indicated a fast shock, while\nhigh HNCO and low SiO indicates either a slow shock or warm, dense, non-shocked\ngas.

This paper presents a new framework, particularly designed for\nvideo dehazing, to output coherent results in real time, with two novel\ntechniques. Firstly, we decompose the dehazing algorithms into three generic\ncomponents, namely transmission map estimator, atmospheric light estimator and\nhaze-free image generator. They can be simultaneously processed by multiple\nthreads in the distributed system, such that the processing efficiency is\noptimized by automatic CPU resource allocation based on the workloads.\nSecondly, a cross-frame normalization scheme is proposed to enhance the\ncoherence among consecutive frames, by sharing the parameters of atmospheric\nlight from consecutive frames in the distributed computation platform. The\ncombination of these techniques enables our framework to generate highly\nconsistent and accurate dehazing results in real-time, by using only 3 PCs\nconnected by Ethernet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 15:56:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2016 16:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-12"}

In this paper, we move beyond\nsuch limitations, and propose a novel MRF model that uses fully-connected\nneurons to express the complex interactions among pixels. Through theoretical\nanalysis, we reveal an inherent connection between this model and recurrent\nneural networks, and thereon derive an approximated feed-forward network that\ncouples multiple RNNs along opposite directions. This formulation combines the\nexpressive power of deep neural networks and the cyclic dependency structure of\nMRF in a unified model, bringing the modeling capability to a new level.

Uncertainties about the triggering\nmechanisms and their underlying pathophysiology have led to various\nclassifications of patients exhibiting this symptom. This study presents a new\nway to classify syncope types using machine learning. Method: we hypothesize\nthat syncope types can be characterized by analyzing blood pressure and heart\nrate time series data obtained from the head-up tilt test procedure. By\noptimizing classification rates, we identify a small number of determining\nmarkers which enable data clustering. Results: We apply the proposed method to\nclinical data from 157 subjects; each subject was identified by an expert as\nbeing either healthy or suffering from one of three conditions:\ncardioinhibitory syncope, vasodepressor syncope and postural orthostatic\ntachycardia. Clustering confirms the three disease groups and identifies two\ndistinct subgroups within the healthy controls. Conclusion: The proposed method\nprovides evidence to question current syncope classifications; it also offers\nmeans to refine them. Significance: Current syncope classifications are not\nbased on pathophysiology and have not led to significant improvements in\npatient care. It is expected that a more faithful classification will\nfacilitate our understanding of the autonomic system for healthy subjects,\nwhich is essential in analyzing pathophysiology of the disease groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 19:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

It has not only drawn numerous surprising connections between\nphysical systems under the guise of holographic duality, but has also inspired\nthe development of wavelet theory now widely used in signal processing.\nSynergizing on these two developments, we describe in this paper a generalized\nexact holographic mapping that maps a generic N-dimensional lattice system to a\nN+1-dimensional holographic dual, with the emergent dimension representing\nscale. In previous works, this was achieved via the iterations of the simplest\nof all unitary mappings, the Haar mapping, which fails to preserve the form of\nmost Hamiltonians. By taking advantage of the full generality of biorthogonal\nwavelets, our new generalized holographic mapping framework is able to preserve\nthe form of a large class of lattice Hamiltonians. By explicitly separating\nfeatures that are fundamentally associated with the physical system from those\nthat are basis-specific, we also obtain a clearer understanding of how the\nresultant bulk geometry arises. For instance, the number of nonvanishing\nmoments of the high pass wavelet filter is revealed to be proportional to the\nradius of the dual Anti deSitter (AdS) space geometry. We conclude by proposing\nmodifications to the mapping for systems with generic Fermi pockets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 13:35:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 11:43:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 07:34:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-13"}

On the other hand, using good analysis\ntools, the trial and error of policy could be done in the analysis level. Once\nthe analysis could prove a good performance, the implementation of the policy\nis straightforward. The problem is how to evaluate the impact of the policy\nquantitatively toward the behavior of pedestrians before its implementation.\nSince the interaction of pedestrians cannot be well address using a macroscopic\nlevel of analysis, a microscopic level of analysis is the choice. However, the\nanalytical solution of the microscopic pedestrian model is very difficult and\nsimulation models are more practical approach. To evaluate the impact of the\npolicy quantitatively toward the behavior of pedestrians before its\nimplementation, a microscopic pedestrian simulation model was developed.
