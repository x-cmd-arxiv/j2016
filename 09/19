We focus on a model for CTCs due to\nDeutsch, which imposes a probabilistic consistency condition to avoid\ngrandfather paradoxes. Our main result is that computers with CTCs can solve\nexactly the problems that are Turing-reducible to the halting problem, and that\nthis is true whether we consider classical or quantum computers. Previous work,\nby Aaronson and Watrous, studied CTC computers with a polynomial size\nrestriction, and showed that they solve exactly the problems in PSPACE, again\nin both the classical and quantum cases.\n  Compared to the complexity setting, the main novelty of the computability\nsetting is that not all CTCs have fixed-points, even probabilistically. Despite\nthis, we show that the CTCs that do have fixed-points suffice to solve the\nhalting problem, by considering fixed-point distributions involving infinite\ngeometric series. The tricky part is to show that even quantum computers with\nCTCs can be simulated using a Halt oracle. For that, we need the Riesz\nrepresentation theorem from functional analysis, among other tools.\n  We also study an alternative model of CTCs, due to Lloyd et al., which uses\npostselection to \"simulate\" a consistency condition, and which yields BPP_path\nin the classical case or PP in the quantum case when subject to a polynomial\nsize restriction. With no size limit, we show that postselected CTCs yield only\nthe computable languages if we impose a certain finiteness condition, or all\nlanguages nonadaptively reducible to the halting problem if we don't.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2016 16:08:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}

Cell size statistics and\nits relation to growth and division has been mostly studied separately from\nproteins and other cellular variables. Here we present experimental and\ntheoretical analyses of these phenotype components in a unified framework that\nreveals their correlations and interactions inside the cell. We measure these\ncomponents simultaneously in single cells over dozens of generations, quantify\ntheir correlations, and compare population to temporal statistics. We find that\ncell size and highly expressed proteins have very similar dynamics over growth\nand division cycles, which result in parallel statistical properties, both\nuniversal and individual. In particular, while distribution shapes of\nfluctuations along time are common to all cells and components, other\nproperties are variable and remain distinct in individual cells for a\nsurprisingly large number of generations. These include temporal averages of\ncell size and protein content, and the structure of their auto-correlation\nfunctions.

We do this in two different benchmark\nmodels. The first model is a discrete time framework with an information flow\nprocess, dealing with both permanent and temporary impact, minimizing the\nexpected cost of the trade. The second model is a continuous time framework\nwhere the objective function is the sum of the expected cost and a value at\nrisk (or expected shortfall) type risk criterion. Optimal adapted solutions are\nknown in both frameworks from the original works of Bertsimas and Lo (1998) and\nGatheral and Schied (2011). In this paper we derive the optimal static\nstrategies for both benchmark models and we study quantitatively the\nimprovement in optimality when moving from static strategies to fully adapted\nones. We conclude that, in the benchmark models we study, the difference is not\nrelevant, except for extreme unrealistic cases for the model or impact\nparameters. This indirectly confirms that in the similar framework of Almgren\nand Chriss (2000) one is fine deriving a static optimal solution, as done by\nthose authors, as opposed to a fully adapted one, since the static solution\nhappens to be tractable and known in closed form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2016 18:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}

In this work, we design a new ensemble approach for outlier\ndetection in multi-dimensional point data, which provides improved accuracy by\nreducing error through both bias and variance. Although classification and\noutlier detection appear as different problems, their theoretical underpinnings\nare quite similar in terms of the bias-variance trade-off [1], where outlier\ndetection is considered as a binary classification task with unobserved labels\nbut a similar bias-variance decomposition of error.\n  In this paper, we propose a sequential ensemble approach called CARE that\nemploys a two-phase aggregation of the intermediate results in each iteration\nto reach the final outcome. Unlike existing outlier ensembles which solely\nincorporate a parallel framework by aggregating the outcomes of independent\nbase detectors to reduce variance, our ensemble incorporates both the parallel\nand sequential building blocks to reduce bias as well as variance by ($i$)\nsuccessively eliminating outliers from the original dataset to build a better\ndata model on which outlierness is estimated (sequentially), and ($ii$)\ncombining the results from individual base detectors and across iterations\n(parallelly).

We argue that strong correlation effects occur\nat the surface of such systems for relatively small Hubbard interaction $U$,\ndue to the narrow bandwidth of the \"drumhead\" surface states. In the\nHartree-Fock approximation, at small $U$ we obtain a surface ferromagnetic\nphase through a continuous quantum phase transition characterized by the\nsurface-mode divergence of the spin susceptibility, while the bulk states\nremain very robust against local interactions and remain non-ordered. At\nslightly increased interaction strength, the system quickly changes from a\nsurface ferromagnetic phase to a surface charge-ordered phase through a\nfirst-order transition. When Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling is applied to the\nsurface states, a canted ferromagnetic phase occurs at the surface for\nintermediate values of $U$. The quantum critical behavior of the surface\nferromagnetic transition is nontrivial in the sense that the surface spin order\nparameter couple to Fermi-surface excitations from both surface and bulk\nstates. This leads to unconventional Landau damping and consequently a na\\\"ive\ndynamical critical exponent $z\\!\\approx\\!1$ when the Fermi level is close to\nthe bulk nodal energy. We also show that, already without interactions, quantum\noscillations arise due to bulk states, despite the absence of a Fermi surface\nwhen the chemical potential is tuned to the energy of the nodal loop. The bulk\nmagnetic susceptibility diverges logarithmically whenever the nodal loop\nexactly overlaps with a quantized magnetic orbit in the bulk Brillouin zone.\nThese correlation and transport phenomena are unique signatures of nodal loop\nstates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2016 19:14:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

In such games, contributions to the public good are made only\nby cooperators, while all players, including defectors, can reap public goods\nbenefits. Classic results of game theory show that mutual defection, as opposed\nto cooperation, is the Nash Equilibrium of PGGs in well-mixed populations,\nwhere each player interacts with all others. In this paper, we explore the\ncoevolutionary dynamics of a low information public goods game on a network\nwithout spatial constraints in which players adapt to their environment in\norder to increase individual payoffs.

Unfortunately, such a phenomenon induces bias to existing\nmetrics employed to evaluate the productivity and success of researchers.

The analysis of such patterns confirms that some aspects of the\nauthor ranking are in accordance with the expected convention, such as the fact\nthat the first and last authors are more likely to contribute more in a\nscientific work. Conversely, such analysis also revealed that authors in the\nintermediary positions of the rank contribute more in certain specific roles,\nsuch as the task of collecting data.

Method: Firstly, collect effort estimation methods ranging from\n\"classical\" COCOMO (parametric estimation over a pre-determined set of\nattributes) to \"modern\" (reasoning via analogy using spectral-based clustering\nplus instance and feature selection, and a recent \"baseline method\" proposed in\nACM Transactions on Software Engineering).Secondly, catalog the list of\nobjections that lead to the development of post-COCOMO estimation\nmethods.Thirdly, characterize each of those objections as a comparison between\nnewer and older estimation methods.Fourthly, using four COCOMO-style data sets\n(from 1991, 2000, 2005, 2010) and run those comparisons experiments.Fifthly,\ncompare the performance of the different estimators using a Scott-Knott\nprocedure using (i) the A12 effect size to rule out \"small\" differences and\n(ii) a 99% confident bootstrap procedure to check for statistically different\ngroupings of treatments).

We examine whether evolution of the\nshared species acts as a coexistence mechanism and to what extent the answer\ndepends on the genetic architecture underlying trait evolution. In our models\nof exploitative and apparent competition, the shared species evolves its\ndefense or prey use. Evolving species are either haploid or diploid. A single\nlocus pleiotropically determines prey nutritional quality and predator attack\nrates. When pleiotropy is sufficiently antagonistic (e.g. nutritional prey are\nharder to capture), eco-evolutionary assembly culminates in one of two stable\nstates supporting only two species. When pleiotropy is weakly antagonistic or\nsynergistic, assembly is intransitive: species-genotype pairs are cyclically\ndisplaced by rare invasions of the missing genotypes or species. This\nintransitivity allows for coexistence if, along its equilibria, the geometric\nmean of recovery rates exceeds the geometric mean of loss rates of the rare\ngenotypes or species. By affecting these rates, synergistic pleiotropy can\nmediate coexistence, while antagonistic pleiotropy does not. For diploid\npopulations experiencing weak antagonistic pleiotropy, superadditive allelic\ncontributions to fitness can mitigate coexistence via an eco-evolutionary\nstorage effect. Density-dependence and mutations also promote coexistence.\nThese results highlight how the efficacy of evolution as a coexistence\nmechanism may depend on the underlying genetic architecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 00:07:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2017 03:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

Millimeter wave (mmWave)\ncellular systems typically must rely on directional beamforming (BF) in order\nto create a viable connection. The beamforming direction must therefore be\nlearned-as well as used-in the initial access process for mmWave cellular\nnetworks. This paper considers four simple but representative initial access\nprotocols that use various combinations of directional beamforming and\nomnidirectional transmission and reception at the mobile and the BS, during the\nCS and RA phases. We provide a system-level analysis of the success probability\nfor CS and RA for each one, as well as of the initial access delay and\nuser-perceived downlink throughput (UPT).

A key\nchallenge in VQA is to require joint reasoning over the visual and text\ndomains. The predominant CNN/LSTM-based approach to VQA is limited by\nmonolithic vector representations that largely ignore structure in the scene\nand in the form of the question. CNN feature vectors cannot effectively capture\nsituations as simple as multiple object instances, and LSTMs process questions\nas series of words, which does not reflect the true complexity of language\nstructure. We instead propose to build graphs over the scene objects and over\nthe question words, and we describe a deep neural network that exploits the\nstructure in these representations. This shows significant benefit over the\nsequential processing of LSTMs. The overall efficacy of our approach is\ndemonstrated by significant improvements over the state-of-the-art, from 71.2%\nto 74.4% in accuracy on the \"abstract scenes\" multiple-choice benchmark, and\nfrom 34.7% to 39.1% in accuracy over pairs of \"balanced\" scenes, i.e. images\nwith fine-grained differences and opposite yes/no answers to a same question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 05:21:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2017 04:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-31"}

For the improved\nunderstanding of the process, the rates of the involved nuclear reactions must\nbe known. The reaction 128Ba(g,a)124Xe was found to affect the abundance of the\np nucleus 124Xe. Since the stellar rate for this reaction cannot be determined\nby a measurement directly, the aim of the present work was to measure the cross\nsection of the inverse 124Xe(a,g)128Ba reaction and to compare the results with\nstatistical model predictions. Of great importance is the fact that data below\nthe (a,n) threshold was obtained. Studying simultaneously the 124Xe(a,n)127Ba\nreaction channel at higher energy allowed to further identify the source of a\ndiscrepancy between data and prediction. The 124Xe + alpha cross sections were\nmeasured with the activation method using a thin window 124Xe gas cell. The\nstudied energy range was between E = 11 and 15 MeV close above the\nastrophysically relevant energy range. The obtained cross sections are compared\nwith statistical model calculations. The experimental cross sections are\nsmaller than standard predictions previously used in astrophysical\ncalculations. As dominating source of the difference, the theoretical alpha\nwidth was identified. The experimental data suggest an alpha width lower by at\nleast a factor of 0.125 in the astrophysical energy range. An upper limit for\nthe 128Ba(g,a)124Xe stellar rate was inferred from our measurement. The impact\nof this rate was studied in two different models for core-collapse supernova\nexplosions of 25 solar mass stars. A significant contribution to the 124Xe\nabundance via this reaction path would only be possible when the rate was\nincreased above the previous standard value. Since the experimental data rule\nthis out, they also demonstrate the closure of this production path.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 07:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-14"}

Here, we\nreport an ultrasensitive optical readout of monolayer TMD resonators that\nallows us to reveal their mechanical properties at cryogenic temperatures.

The Phonotactic and Acoustic VSMs, thus formed, are used\nfor the task of DID. The aim of this paper is to construct a single VSM that\nencodes information about spoken dialects from both the Phonotactic and\nAcoustic VSMs. Given the two views of the data, we make use of a well known\nmulti-view dimensionality reduction technique known as Canonical Correlation\nAnalysis (CCA), to form a single vector representation for each speech\nutterance that encodes dialect specific discriminative information from both\nthe phonetic and acoustic representations.

In heterogeneous\nnetworks (HetNets), the uncoordinated channel access by different types of base\nstations determine the interference statistics that further arbitrates the\ncoverage probability. Thus, the spectrum allocation techniques have major\nimpact on the performance of CCU and CEU. In this paper, the performance of\nCCUs and CEUs in a random two-tier network is studied for two spectrum\nallocation techniques namely: 1) co-channel (CSA), and 2) shared (SSA). For\nperformance analysis, the widely accepted conception of modeling the tiers of\nHetNet using independent homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) is considered\nto accommodate the spatial randomness in location of BSs. To incorporate the\nspatial randomness in the arrival of service and to aid the load-aware\nanalysis, the cellular traffic is modeled using spatio-temporal PPP. Under this\nscenario, we have developed an analytical framework to evaluate the load-aware\nperformance, including coverage and blocking probabilities, of CCUs and CEUs\nunder both spectrum allocation techniques. Further, we provide insight into\nachievable area energy efficiency for SSA and CSA. The developed analytical\nframework is validated through extensive simulations.

The motion of these particles can\nbe modeled as a one-dimensional movement along an ordered sequence of sites.\nThe biological particles (e.g., ribosomes, RNAPs, phosphate groups, motor\nproteins) have volume and cannot surpass one another. In some cases, there is a\npreferred direction of movement along the track, but in general the movement\nmay be two-directional, and furthermore the particles may attach or detach from\nvarious regions along the tracks (e.g. ribosomes may drop off the mRNA molecule\nbefore reaching a stop codon). We derive a new deterministic mathematical model\nfor such transport phenomena that may be interpreted as the dynamic mean-field\napproximation of an important model from mechanical statistics called the\nasymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with Langmuir kinetics.

State-of-the-art\napproaches are clearly dominated by patch-based non-local methods in recent\nyears. In this paper, we aim to propose a local Poisson denoising model with\nboth structure simplicity and good performance. To this end, we consider a\nvariational modeling to integrate the so-called Fields of Experts (FoE) image\nprior, that has proven an effective higher-order Markov Random Fields (MRF)\nmodel for many classic image restoration problems. We exploit several feasible\nvariational variants for this task. We start with a direct modeling in the\noriginal image domain by taking into account the Poisson noise statistics,\nwhich performs generally well for the cases of high SNR. However, this strategy\nencounters problem in cases of low SNR. Then we turn to an alternative modeling\nstrategy by using the Anscombe transform and Gaussian statistics derived data\nterm. We retrain the FoE prior model directly in the transform domain. With the\nnewly trained FoE model, we end up with a local variational model providing\nstrongly competitive results against state-of-the-art non-local approaches,\nmeanwhile bearing the property of simple structure. Furthermore, our proposed\nmodel comes along with an additional advantage, that the inference is very\nefficient as it is well-suited for parallel computation on GPUs.

It focuses on a Korteweg-de Vries equation,\nwhich is a nonlinear mathematical model of waves on shallow water surfaces. Two\ndifferent types of saturated controls are considered. The well-posedness is\nproven applying a Banach fixed point theorem, using some estimates of this\nequation and some properties of the saturation function. The proof of the\nasymptotic stability of the closed-loop system is separated in two cases: i)\nwhen the control acts on all the domain, a Lyapunov function together with a\nsector condition describing the saturating input is used to conclude on the\nstability, ii) when the control is localized, we argue by contradiction. Some\nnumerical simulations illustrate the stability of the closed-loop nonlinear\npartial differential equation. 1. Introduction. In recent decades, a great\neffort has been made to take into account input saturations in control designs\n(see e.g [39], [15] or more recently [17]). In most applications, actuators are\nlimited due to some physical constraints and the control input has to be\nbounded. Neglecting the amplitude actuator limitation can be source of\nundesirable and catastrophic behaviors for the closed-loop system. The standard\nmethod to analyze the stability with such nonlinear controls follows a two\nsteps design. First the design is carried out without taking into account the\nsaturation. In a second step, a nonlinear analysis of the closed-loop system is\nmade when adding the saturation. In this way, we often get local stabilization\nresults. Tackling this particular nonlinearity in the case of finite\ndimensional systems is already a difficult problem. However, nowadays, numerous\ntechniques are available (see e.g. [39, 41, 37]) and such systems can be\nanalyzed with an appropriate Lyapunov function and a sector condition of the\nsaturation map, as introduced in [39]. In the literature, there are few papers\nstudying this topic in the infinite dimensional case. Among them, we can cite\n[18], [29], where a wave equation equipped with a saturated distributed\nactuator is studied, and [12], where a coupled PDE/ODE system modeling a\nswitched power converter with a transmission line is considered. Due to some\nrestrictions on the system, a saturated feedback has to be designed in the\nlatter paper. There exist also some papers using the nonlinear semigroup theory\nand focusing on abstract systems ([20],[34],[36]). Let us note that in [36],\n[34] and [20], the study of a priori bounded controller is tackled using\nabstract nonlinear theory. To be more specific, for bounded ([36],[34]) and\nunbounded ([34]) control operators, some conditions are derived to deduce, from\nthe asymptotic stability of an infinite-dimensional linear system in abstract\nform, the asymptotic stability when closing the loop with saturating\ncontroller. These articles use the nonlinear semigroup theory (see e.g. [24] or\n[1]).

A node in the network represents a\nclone of B-lymphocytes and its antibodies of the same idiotype which is encoded\nby a bitstring. The links between nodes represent possible interactions between\nclones of almost complementary idiotype. A clone survives only if the number of\npopulated neighbored nodes is neither too small nor too large. The dynamics is\ndriven by the influx of lymphocytes with randomly generated idiotype from the\nbone marrow. Previous work has revealed that the network evolves towards a\nhighly organized modular architecture, characterized by groups of nodes which\nshare statistical properties. The structural properties of the architecture can\nbe described analytically, the statistical properties determined from\nsimulations are confirmed by a modular mean-field theory. To model the presence\nof self we permanently occupy one or several nodes. These nodes influence their\nlinked neighbors, the autoreactive clones, but are themselves not affected by\nidiotypic interactions. The architecture is very similar to the case without\nself, but organized such that the neighbors of self are only weakly occupied,\nthus providing self-tolerance.

In addition to improving students' understanding of the\nphysics content, lab courses often have an implicit or explicit goal of\nincreasing students' understanding and appreciation of the nature of\nexperimental physics. We examine students' responses to a laboratory-focused\nepistemological assessment -- the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science\nSurvey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS) -- to explore whether courses using\ntransformed curricula or pedagogy show more expert-like student epistemologies\nrelative to courses using traditional guided labs, as well as how this trend\nvaries based on student major or gender. Data for this study are drawn from an\nexisting data set of responses to the E-CLASS from multiple courses and\ninstitutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 14:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}

There are serious societal and\nethical concerns associated with the deployment of this technology that remain\nunaddressed. How can sufficient protection be afforded noncombatants? What\nabout civilian blowback, where this technology may end up being used in\npolicing operations against domestic groups? How can we protect the fundamental\nhuman rights of all involved? Considerable discussion is being conducted at an\ninternational level, including at the United Nations Convention on Certain\nConventional Weapons (CCW) over the past two years, debating if and how such\nsystems, particularly lethal platforms should be banned or regulated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 15:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}

Recently, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) based\nmethods have been successfully applied in several sequential modeling tasks.\nHowever, for real-world applications, these methods have difficulty in modeling\nthe contextual information, which has been proved to be very important for\nbehavior modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel model, named Context-Aware\nRecurrent Neural Networks (CA-RNN). Instead of using the constant input matrix\nand transition matrix in conventional RNN models, CA-RNN employs adaptive\ncontext-specific input matrices and adaptive context-specific transition\nmatrices. The adaptive context-specific input matrices capture external\nsituations where user behaviors happen, such as time, location, weather and so\non. And the adaptive context-specific transition matrices capture how lengths\nof time intervals between adjacent behaviors in historical sequences affect the\ntransition of global sequential features.

This study leads to (1) an improved recovery of the\nstress field, (2) an opportunity to minimize the estimator in the case of\nheterogeneous structures (in the parallel and sequential case), (3) a procedure\nto build admissible fields for FETI-DP and BDDC methods leading to an error\nbound which separates the contributions of the solver and of the\ndiscretization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 12:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

The ratio of\nadministration to total costs, referred to as the administration ratio, is\nhighly variable and within any single fund depends on many factors including\nthe number and average size of projects and the overall efficiency of the\nfunding agency. In this study, the standard agency activities have been\nidentified and used to develop a model of administration costs against expected\noutcomes. In particular, the model has been designed to estimate the optimum\nportfolio success rate and administration ratio as a function of a range of key\ninput variables including the project size, the complexity of proposal\nevaluation and project management, the risk tolerance of the sponsor and the\ntargeted research domain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Sep 2016 08:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-07"}
