A network of agents aim to track the minimizer of a global\ntime-varying convex function. The minimizer evolves according to a known\ndynamics corrupted by an unknown, unstructured noise. At each time, the global\nfunction can be cast as a sum of a finite number of local functions, each of\nwhich is assigned to one agent in the network. Moreover, the local functions\nbecome available to agents sequentially, and agents do not have a prior\nknowledge of the future cost functions. Therefore, agents must communicate with\neach other to build an online approximation of the global function. We propose\na decentralized variation of the celebrated Mirror Descent, developed by\nNemirovksi and Yudin. Using the notion of Bregman divergence in lieu of\nEuclidean distance for projection, Mirror Descent has been shown to be a\npowerful tool in large-scale optimization. Our algorithm builds on Mirror\nDescent, while ensuring that agents perform a consensus step to follow the\nglobal function and take into account the dynamics of the global minimizer. To\nmeasure the performance of the proposed online algorithm, we compare it to its\noffline counterpart, where the global functions are available a priori. The gap\nbetween the two is called dynamic regret. We establish a regret bound that\nscales inversely in the spectral gap of the network, and more notably it\nrepresents the deviation of minimizer sequence with respect to the given\ndynamics. We then show that our results subsume a number of results in\ndistributed optimization. We demonstrate the application of our method to\ndecentralized tracking of dynamic parameters and verify the results via\nnumerical experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2016 16:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-12"}

Considering the interplay of the cavity-EIT effect and\nthe quantum memory process, we demonstrated a controlled phase gate between two\nsingle photons. To this end, firstly one needs to store a (control) photon in\nthe ground atomic states. In the following, a second (target) photon must\nimpinge on the atom-cavity system. Depending on the atomic state, this second\nphoton will be either transmitted or reflected, acquiring different phase\nshifts.

We\nexplore the relevant parameter space in the atom-cavity system that allows the\nimplementation of quantum phase gates using the recent technologies.

Individual many-body contributions to the interaction\nenergies as well as vibrational spectra of water clusters calculated with\nMB-pol are in excellent agreement with reference data obtained at the coupled\ncluster level. Several structural, thermodynamic, and dynamical properties of\nthe liquid phase at atmospheric pressure are investigated through classical\nmolecular dynamics simulations as a function of temperature. The structural\nproperties of the liquid phase are in nearly quantitative agreement with X-ray\ndiffraction data available over the temperature range from 268 to 368 K. The\nanalysis of other thermodynamic and dynamical quantities emphasizes the\nimportance of explicitly including nuclear quantum effects in the simulations,\nespecially at low temperature, for a physically correct description of the\nproperties of liquid water. Furthermore, both densities and lattice energies of\nseveral ice phases are also correctly reproduced by MB-pol.

In a first paper, we showed\nthat the dynamics of the flow was dominated by coherent structures made of a\nsuperposition of nonlinear waves. (Mixed)-ribbons and (mixed)-cross-spirals are\ngenerated by interactions between a pair of linearly unstable helical modes of\nopposite `handedness', and appear to be responsible for the formation of\nwell-mixed layers and sharp density interfaces. In this paper, we show that\nthese structures are also fully accountable for the upwards buoyancy flux in\nthe simulations. The mechanism by which this occurs is a positive coupling\nbetween the density and vertical velocity components of the most energetic\nwaves. This coupling is primarily caused by diffusion of density at low Schmidt\nnumber Sc, but can also be a nonlinear effect at larger Sc. Turbulence was\nfound to contribute negatively to the buoyancy flux at Sc=1,10,16, which lead\nto the conclusion that mass upwelling is a consequence of chaotic advection,\neven at large Reynolds number. Artificially isolating the coherent structure\ntherefore leads to excellent estimates of the flux Richardson numbers Ri_f from\nthe DNS. We also used the theoretical framework of Winters et al.

Our data show that the\ntransient rebrightened substantially in the ultraviolet and that the spectrum\nwent through three different spectroscopic phases without ever becoming\nnebular. Our observations are more consistent with a tidal disruption event\nthan a superluminous supernova because of the temperature evolution, the\npresence of highly ionised CNO gas in the line of sight and our improved\nlocalisation of the transient in the nucleus of a passive galaxy, where the\npresence of massive stars is highly unlikely. While the supermassive black hole\nhas a mass $> 10^8 M_\\odot$, a star with the same mass as the Sun could be\ndisrupted outside the event horizon if the black hole were spinning rapidly.\nThe rapid spin and high black hole mass can explain the high luminosity of this\nevent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2016 20:06:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2016 20:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-13"}

Since CAVs are able to run with less spacing\nand headway compared with manual vehicles or mixed traffic, allocating a number\nof freeway lanes exclusive to CAVs may improve the overall performance of\nfreeways. In this paper, we propose an analytical managed lane model to\nevaluate the freeway flow in mixed traffic and to determine the optimal number\nof lanes to be allocated to CAVs. The proposed model is investigated in two\ndifferent operation environments: single-lane and managed lane environments. We\nfurther define three different CAV technology scenarios: neutral, conservative,\nand aggressive. In the single-lane problem, the influence of CAV penetration\nrates on mixed traffic capacity is examined in each scenario. In the managed\nlanes problem, we propose a method to determine the optimal number of dedicated\nlanes for CAVs under different settings. A number of numerical examples with\ndifferent geometries and demand levels are investigated for all three\nscenarios. A sensitivity analysis on the penetration rates is conducted.

The cavity forms a three electrode\nsection of a Penning-Malmberg trap and has a bulged cylindrical geometry with\nopen ends aligned with the magnetic trapping axis. This allows plasmas to be\ninjected and removed from the cavity without the need for moving parts while\nmaintaining high quality factors for resonant modes. The cavity includes unique\nsurface preparations for adjusting the cavity quality factor and achieving\nanti-static shielding using thin layers of nichrome and colloidal graphite\nrespectively. Geometric design considerations for a cavity with strong cooling\npower and low equilibrium plasma temperatures are discussed.

It is a natural object in the KPZ universality class:\nfor example, its highest curve, the Airy$_2$ process, describes after the\nsubtraction of a parabola the limiting law of the scaled energy of a geodesic\nrunning from the origin to a variable point on an anti-diagonal line in such\nproblems as Poissonian last passage percolation. The ensemble of curves\nresulting from the Airy line ensemble after the subtraction of the same\nparabola enjoys a simple and explicit spatial Markov property, the Brownian\nGibbs property. In this paper, we employ the Brownian Gibbs property to make a\nclose comparison between the Airy line ensemble's curves after affine shift and\nBrownian bridge, proving the finiteness of a superpolynomially growing moment\nbound on Radon-Nikodym derivatives.

Using\nappropriate contact, interface, and ferroelectric parameters, measured\ncurrent-voltage characteristic curves in both inorganic\n(Co/BaTiO$_{3}$/La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$) and organic (Au/PVDF/W)\nferroelectric tunnel junctions can be well described by the proposed approach.\nFurthermore, under this theoretical framework, the controversy of opposite TER\nsigns observed experimentally by different groups in\nCo/BaTiO$_{3}$/La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ systems is addressed by\nconsidering the interface termination effects using the effective contact\nratio, defined through the effective screening length and dielectric response\nat the metal/ferroelectric interfaces. Finally, our approach is extended to\ninvestigate the role of a CoO$_{x}$ buffer layer at the Co/BaTiO$_{3}$\ninterface in a ferroelectric tunnel memristor. It is shown that, to have a\nsignificant memristor behavior, not only the interface oxygen vacancies but\nalso the CoO$_{x}$ layer thickness may vary with the applied bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2016 02:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

Recently, we observed strongly enhanced\nmagnetization of SRO113 thin films grown on single crystals of the spin-triplet\nsuperconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ (SRO214). To clarify the origin of such an\nenhancement, we conducted systematic investigations of magnetic properties of\nSRO113 films deposited on a variety of oxide substrates. We carefully\nsubtracted the substrate contributions and found that the enhanced 2\nmagnetization occurs only for SRO113/SRO214 films.

The X-ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals that the\nsubstrate-induced strain does not switch the Ru4+ state from the low-spin to\nhigh-spin states. The film-thickness dependence of the magnetization of\nSRO113/SRO214 films strongly suggest that the additional magnetization arises\ndue to the induction of magnetic moment into the SRO214 substrate over 20-nm\ndepth.

In\nthis work we focus on a simple yet effective technique to improve the print\naccuracy for layered manufacturing by filament deposition. Our method works\nwith standard three-axis 3D filament printers (e.g. the typical, widely\navailable 3D printers), using standard extrusion nozzles. It better reproduces\nthe geometry of sloped surfaces without increasing the print time. Our key idea\nis to perform a local anti-aliasing, working at a sub-layer accuracy to produce\nslightly curved deposition paths and reduce approximation errors.

A common\ncharacteristic of wireless EEG sensors is that they are low powered devices,\nand hence an efficient usage of sensor energy resources is critical for any\npractical application. One way of minimizing energy consumption by the EEG\nsensors is by reducing the number of EEG channels participating in the\nclassification process. For the purpose of classifying EEG signals, we propose\na directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based channel selection algorithm. To achieve\nthis objective, the EEG sensor channels are first realized in a complete\nundirected graph, where each channel is represented by a node. An edge between\nany two nodes indicates the collaboration between these nodes in identifying\nthe system state; and the significance of this collaboration is quantified by a\nweight assigned to the edge. The complete graph is then reduced into a directed\nacyclic graph that encodes the knowledge of the non-increasing order of the\nchannel ranking for each cognitive task. The channel selection algorithm\nutilizes this directed graph to find a maximum path such that the total weight\nof this path satisfies a predefined threshold.

Five molecular lines, 12CO (J=1-0), 13CO (J=1-0),\nC18O(J=1-0), HCN (J=1-0), and HCO+ (J=1-0), were observed, and several publicly\navailable surveys, GLIMPSE, MIPSGAL, ATLASGAL, BGPS, VGPS, MAGPIS, and NVSS,\nwere used for comparison.

Observable physical properties can impose conditions on the\nselection of electromagnetic gauge (i.e. sets of potentials) that are explicit\nand restrictive. This is true both classically and quantum mechanically. The\nimplication that the choice of gauge carries physical information is confirmed\nby exhibiting a set of potentials that describes fields correctly, but that\nviolates physical constraints. The basic conclusions are that physical\nrequirements place limits on acceptable gauges; and that potentials are more\nfundamental than fields in both classical and quantum physics, representing a\nmajor generalization of the quantum-only Aharonov-Bohm effect. These important\nproperties are obscured if the dipole approximation is employed. The properties\ndemonstrated here relate directly to conditions that exist in strong-field\nlaser applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2016 18:36:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2016 19:27:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2016 14:22:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2016 19:47:29 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2017 17:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

Different MWI trees representing the same quantum events can\nhave different topologies, depending upon the observer. However, they are all\nisomorphic to the group of block universes containing all of the outcomes of\nall of the events, and so, in that sense, the group of block universes is a\nmore fundamental representation. Different branches of the MWI tree,\nrepresenting different universes in MWI, ultimately share the same quantum\nstate in a common ancestor branch. This branching topology is incompatible with\nthat of the Minkowski block universe; the resolution is to replace the branches\nwith discrete, parallel block universes, each of which extends from the trunk\nto the outermost twigs. The number of universes in a branch is proportional to\nits thickness which, in turn, depends upon the absolute square of the\nprobability amplitude for the state in that branch. Every quantum event may be\nrepresented by a kernel of universes, which is the smallest group of universes\nthat will reproduce the quantum probabilities of the outcomes of that event. By\nconsidering the ratios of the probabilities of the outcomes of any event, it\ncan be shown that the number of universes in every kernel must finite, as must\nbe the total number of universes in the multiverse. Further, every universe in\nthe multiverse must be finite both in space and time. Another consequence is\nthat quantum probabilities must be rational, which suggests that quantum\nmechanics is only an approximation to a discrete theory. A corollary is that\nnot every conceivable universe exists in the multiverse, no doubt to the\ndisappointment of those who enjoy alternate-history novels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2016 11:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-15"}
