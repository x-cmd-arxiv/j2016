This commentary clarifies\npoints of disagreement and unresolved issues, and addresses mis-applications of\nevolutionary theory that lead the authors to adopt a Darwinian (versus\nLamarckian) approach. To say that creativity is Darwinian is not to say that it\nconsists of variation plus selection---in the everyday sense of the term---as\nthe authors imply; it is to say that evolution is occurring because selection\nis affecting the distribution of randomly generated heritable variation across\ngenerations. In creative thought the distribution of variants is not key, i.e.,\none is not inclined toward idea A because 60% of one's candidate ideas are\nvariants of A while only 40% are variants of B; one is inclined toward\nwhichever seems best. The authors concede that creative variation is partly\ndirected; however, the greater the extent to which variants are generated\nnon-randomly, the greater the extent to which the distribution of variants can\nreflect not selection but the initial generation bias. Since each thought in a\ncreative process can alter the selective criteria against which the next is\nevaluated, there is no demarcation into generations as assumed in a Darwinian\nmodel. We address the authors' claim that reduced variability and individuality\nare more characteristic of Lamarckism than Darwinian evolution, and note that a\nLamarckian approach to creativity has addressed the challenge of modeling the\nemergent features associated with insight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 16:47:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-15"}

Very lately it is proposed that the three-dimensional Weyl\nsemimetals can be further classified into two types. In the type I Weyl\nsemimetals, a topologically protected linear crossing of two bands, i.e., a\nWeyl point, occurs at the Fermi level resulting in a point-like Fermi surface.\nIn the type II Weyl semimetals, the Weyl point emerges from a contact of an\nelectron and a hole pocket at the boundary resulting in a highly tilted Weyl\ncone. In type II Weyl semimetals, the Lorentz invariance is violated and a\nfundamentally new kind of Weyl Fermions is produced that leads to new physical\nproperties. WTe2 is interesting because it exhibits anomalously large\nmagnetoresistance. It has ignited a new excitement because it is proposed to be\nthe first candidate of realizing type II Weyl Fermions.

By utilizing our latest generation laser-based ARPES\nsystem with superior energy and momentum resolutions, we have revealed a full\npicture on the electronic structure of WTe2. Clear surface state has been\nidentified and its connection with the bulk electronic states in the momentum\nand energy space shows a good agreement with the calculated band structures\nwith the type II Weyl states. Our results provide spectroscopic evidence on the\nobservation of type II Weyl states in WTe2. It has laid a foundation for\nfurther exploration of novel phenomena and physical properties in the type II\nWeyl semimetals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 17:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

The mean squared error (MSE) distortion is minimized under\nan average power constraint assuming that the interference signal is known at\nthe transmitter. Optimality of simple linear transmission does not hold in this\nsetting due to the presence of the known interference signal. While the optimal\nencoder-decoder pair remains an open problem, various non-linear transmission\nschemes are proposed in this paper. In particular, interference concentration\n(ICO) and one-dimensional lattice (1DL) strategies, using both uniform and\nnon-uniform quantization of the interference signal, are studied. It is shown\nthat, in contrast to typical scalar quantization of Gaussian sources, a\nnon-uniform quantizer, whose quantization intervals become smaller as we go\nfurther from zero, improves the performance. Given that the optimal decoder is\nthe minimum MSE (MMSE) estimator, a necessary condition for the optimality of\nthe encoder is derived, and the numerically optimized encoder (NOE) satisfying\nthis condition is obtained.

More recently, thus, higher prices have been\nimposed. But a high-price system does not solve the problems. It helps, indeed,\na peasant to buy in the city non-edible products, but not to buy (more\nexpensive) food products from other peasants. The question is discussed here in\nmore detail starting from the simplest conceivable case of two peasants\nproducing each a different food product (bread and cheese, say), then\ngeneralizing to several food items and to any number of peasants producing a\ngiven food item j.

Here we aim at obtaining comprehensive and\nreliable star, galaxy and quasar catalogues based on automatic source\nclassification in full-sky WISE data. This means that the final classification\nwill employ only parameters available from WISE itself, in particular those\nreliably measured for a majority of sources. For the automatic classification\nwe applied the support vector machines (SVM) algorithm, which requires a\ntraining sample with relevant classes already identified, and we chose to use\nthe SDSS spectroscopic dataset for that purpose. By calibrating the classifier\non the test data drawn from SDSS, we first established that a polynomial kernel\nis preferred over a radial one for this particular dataset.

As the number of UEs\nincreases, while each UE intermittently accesses the network, the random access\nfunctionality becomes essential to share the limited number of pilots among the\nUEs. In this paper, we revisit the random access problem in the Massive MIMO\ncontext and develop a reengineered protocol, termed strongest-user collision\nresolution (SUCRe). An accessing UE asks for a dedicated pilot by sending an\nuncoordinated random access pilot, with a risk that other UEs send the same\npilot. The favorable propagation of Massive MIMO channels is utilized to enable\ndistributed collision detection at each UE, thereby determining the strength of\nthe contenders' signals and deciding to repeat the pilot if the UE judges that\nits signal at the receiver is the strongest.

Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS)\ntechnologies have enabled the identification of single nucleotide variants\n(SNVs) in mixed samples with high resolution. Yet, the noise inherent in the\nbiological processes involved in next-generation sequencing necessitates the\nuse of statistical methods to identify true rare variants. We propose a novel\nBayesian statistical model and a variational expectation-maximization (EM)\nalgorithm to estimate non-reference allele frequency (NRAF) and identify SNVs\nin heterogeneous cell populations. We demonstrate that our variational EM\nalgorithm has comparable sensitivity and specificity compared with a Markov\nChain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling inference algorithm, and is more\ncomputationally efficient on tests of low coverage ($27\\times$ and $298\\times$)\ndata.

Striking visual and empirical\nvalidation is observed for a broad, global macroeconomic sigma-convergence in\nthe period immediately following the end of the Cold War.

Anomalies can take the form of a new or missing edge or abnormal\nrates of interaction. However, often it is not possible to observe the entire\nnetwork traffic directly due to some constraints such as cost, physical\nlimitations, or laws.

We provide simulation results of a simple network of facilities and\nshow that our estimators have superior performance over existing alternatives.\nAdditionally, we establish that while a good estimate of the network traffic is\nnecessary, perfect reconstruction is not required to effectively detect\nanomalous network activity.

This wind is the most convincing case for magnetic driving in\nblack hole binaries, as it has an inferred launch radius which is a factor of\n10 smaller than the thermal wind prediction. However, the optical and\nnear-infrared fluxes monotonically increase around the Chandra observation,\nwhereas the X-ray flux monotonically decreases from 10 days beforehand.

However, most studies have focused on the\ncomplete information setting, wherein the manipulators know the votes of the\nnon-manipulators. While this assumption is reasonable for purposes of showing\nintractability, it is unrealistic for algorithmic considerations. In most\nreal-world scenarios, it is impractical for the manipulators to have accurate\nknowledge of all the other votes. In this paper, we investigate manipulation\nwith incomplete information. In our framework, the manipulators know a partial\norder for each voter that is consistent with the true preference of that voter.\nIn this setting, we formulate three natural computational notions of\nmanipulation, namely weak, opportunistic, and strong manipulation. We say that\nan extension of a partial order is if there exists a manipulative vote for that\nextension.\n  1. Weak Manipulation (WM): the manipulators seek to vote in a way that makes\ntheir preferred candidate win in at least one extension of the partial votes of\nthe non-manipulators.\n  2.

Based on this idea, we propose a novel deep architecture, namely\nMatch-SRNN, to model the recursive matching structure. Firstly, a tensor is\nconstructed to capture the word level interactions. Then a spatial RNN is\napplied to integrate the local interactions recursively, with importance\ndetermined by four types of gates. Finally, the matching score is calculated\nbased on the global interaction.

This allows\ntransmission of information (such as phonemes) segment by segment that\ndecreases the bit rate. However, the encoder based on a phoneme speech\nrecognition may create bursts of segmental errors. Segmental errors are further\npropagated to optional suprasegmental (such as syllable) information coding.\nTogether with the errors of voicing detection in pitch parametrization,\nHMM-based speech coding creates speech discontinuities and unnatural speech\nsound artefacts.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel VLBR speech coding framework based on\nneural networks (NNs) for end-to-end speech analysis and synthesis without\nHMMs. The speech coding framework relies on phonological (sub-phonetic)\nrepresentation of speech, and it is designed as a composition of deep and\nspiking NNs: a bank of phonological analysers at the transmitter, and a\nphonological synthesizer at the receiver, both realised as deep NNs, and a\nspiking NN as an incremental and robust encoder of syllable boundaries for\ncoding of continuous fundamental frequency (F0). A combination of phonological\nfeatures defines much more sound patterns than phonetic features defined by\nHMM-based speech coders, and the finer analysis/synthesis code contributes into\nsmoother encoded speech. Listeners significantly prefer the NN-based approach\ndue to fewer discontinuities and speech artefacts of the encoded speech. A\nsingle forward pass is required during the speech encoding and decoding. The\nproposed VLBR speech coding operates at a bit rate of approximately 360 bits/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2016 07:35:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2016 20:38:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 07:56:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-16"}

In this paper, a popular theoretical\nmodel with it's origins in statistical physics and social dynamics, known as\nthe Deffuant-Weisbuch model, is applied to the image segmentation problem. The\nDeffuant-Weisbuch model has been found to be useful in modelling the evolution\nof a closed system of interacting agents characterised by their opinions or\nbeliefs, leading to the formation of clusters of agents who share a similar\nopinion or belief at steady state. In the context of image segmentation, this\npaper considers a pixel as an agent and it's colour property as it's opinion,\nwith opinion updates as per the Deffuant-Weisbuch model. Apart from applying\nthe basic model to image segmentation, this paper incorporates adjacency and\nneighbourhood information in the model, which factors in the local similarity\nand smoothness properties of images. Convergence is reached when the number of\nunique pixel opinions, i.e., the number of colour centres, matches the\npre-specified number of clusters. Experiments are performed on a set of images\nfrom the Berkeley Image Segmentation Dataset and the results are analysed both\nqualitatively and quantitatively, which indicate that this simple and intuitive\nmethod is promising for image segmentation.

Accurate modelling of the blast wave evolution is therefore\nessential for ISM and galaxy formation simulations. We present an efficient\nmethod to compute the input of momentum, thermal energy, and the velocity\ndistribution of the shock-accelerated gas for ambient media with uniform (and\nwith stellar wind blown bubbles), power-law, and turbulent density\ndistributions. Assuming solar metallicity cooling, the blast wave evolution is\nfollowed to the beginning of the momentum conserving snowplough phase. The\nmodel recovers previous results for uniform ambient media. The momentum\ninjection in wind-blown bubbles depend on the swept-up mass and the efficiency\nof cooling, when the blast wave hits the wind shell. For power-law density\ndistributions with $n(r) \\sim$ $r^{-2}$ (for $n(r) > n_{_{\\rm floor}}$) the\namount of momentum injection is solely regulated by the background density\n$n_{_{\\rm floor}}$ and compares to $n_{_{\\rm uni}}$ = $n_{_{\\rm floor}}$.\nHowever, in turbulent ambient media with log-normal density distributions the\nmomentum input can increase by a factor of 2 (compared to the homogeneous case)\nfor high Mach numbers.

We extend this line of research and study preference\nelicitation for single peaked preferences on trees which is a strict superset\nof the domain of single peaked preferences. We show that the query complexity\ncrucially depends on the number of leaves, the path cover number, and the\ndistance from path of the underlying single peaked tree, whereas the other\nnatural parameters like maximum degree, diameter, pathwidth do not play any\ndirect role in determining query complexity.

However, the state-of-the-art inspection systems\ndo not reflect well the interests of the different involved autonomous roles.\nFor example, employees in an enterprise, or a company outsourcing its network\nmanagement to a specialized third party, may require that their traffic remains\nconfidential, even from the system administrator.

One notable\nunderlying assumption of the FV framework is that local descriptors are well\ndecorrelated within each cluster so that the covariance matrix for each\nGaussian can be simplified to be diagonal. Though the FV usually relies on the\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) to decorrelate local features, the PCA is\napplied to the entire training data and hence it only diagonalizes the\n\\textit{universal} covariance matrix, rather than those w.r.t. the local\ncomponents. As a result, the local decorrelation assumption is usually not\nsupported in practice.\n  To relax this assumption, this paper proposes a completed model of the Fisher\nvector, which is termed as the Completed Fisher vector (CFV). The CFV is a more\ngeneral framework of the FV, since it encodes not only the variances but also\nthe correlations of the whitened local descriptors. The CFV thus leads to\nimproved discriminative power. We take the task of material categorization as\nan example and experimentally show that: 1) the CFV outperforms the FV under\nall parameter settings; 2) the CFV is robust to the changes in the number of\ncomponents in the mixture; 3) even with a relatively small visual vocabulary\nthe CFV still works well on two challenging datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2016 12:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-18"}

Due to privacy concerns, however, access to this data is\nlimited to a few trusted individuals, greatly reducing its impact on biomedical\nresearch. Privacy preserving methods have been suggested as a way of allowing\nmore people access to this precious data while protecting patients. In\nparticular, there has been growing interest in applying the concept of\ndifferential privacy to GWAS results. Unfortunately, previous approaches for\nperforming differentially private GWAS are based on rather simple statistics\nthat have some major limitations. In particular, they do not correct for\npopulation stratification, a major issue when dealing with the genetically\ndiverse populations present in modern GWAS. To address this concern we\nintroduce a novel computational framework for performing GWAS that tailors\nideas from differential privacy to protect private phenotype information, while\nat the same time correcting for population stratification. This framework\nallows us to produce privacy preserving GWAS results based on two of the most\ncommonly used GWAS statistics: EIGENSTRAT and linear mixed model (LMM) based\nstatistics. We test our differentially private statistics, PrivSTRAT and\nPrivLMM, on both simulated and real GWAS datasets and find that they are able\nto protect privacy while returning meaningful GWAS results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2016 13:06:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-18"}

In this\npaper, we target privacy-sensitive users and provide them with fine-grained\ncontrol over tracking.

Therefore,\nour proposed approach consists in providing users with an option to specify the\ncategories of web pages that are privacy-sensitive to them and block trackers\npresent on such web pages only. As tracking is prevented by blocking network\nconnections of third-party domains, we avoid not only tracking but also\nthird-party ads. Since users will continue receiving ads on web pages belonging\nto non-sensitive categories, our approach essentially provides a trade-off\nbetween privacy and economy. To test the viability of our solution, we\nimplemented it as a Google Chrome extension, named MyTrackingChoices (available\non Chrome Web Store).

Nevertheless, many practitioners often use\nthe classical Gaussian RBF kernel or certain Sobolev kernels with good success.\nThe goal of this short note is to offer one possible theoretical explanation\nfor this empirical fact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2016 13:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-18"}

The exception is the $^{13}$CO\ncolumn density method. It is affected by chemical and optical depth issues, and\nit measures both the true H$_{2}$ column density distribution and the molecular\nmass poorly. The virial mass estimate seems to work the best in the considered\nmetallicity and radiation field strength range, even when the overall virial\nparameter of the cloud is above the equilibrium value. This is explained by a\nsystematically lower virial parameter (i.e. closer to equilibrium) in the\nCO-emitting regions; in CO emission, clouds might seem (sub-)virial, even when,\nin fact, they are expanding or being dispersed. A single CO-to-H$_{2}$\nconversion factor appears to be a robust choice over relatively wide ranges of\ncloud conditions, unless the metallicity is low. The methods which try to take\nthe metallicity dependence of the conversion factor into account tend to\nsystematically overestimate the true cloud masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2016 15:46:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-25"}

We\nconsider two distinct situations: when an ordering of the voters with respect\nto which the profile is single crossing is known versus when it is unknown. We\nalso consider different access models: when the votes can be accessed at\nrandom, as opposed to when they are coming in a pre-defined sequence.

By means of Quantum\nHydrodynamic Model in the electrostatic limit it is found that the equilibrium\ndensity profile is a smooth continuous function which, in the linear regime,\nsupports multiple non-normal surface modes. Defining a spectrum function and\nusing a cutting condition, the dispersion relations of these modes and their\nrelevance for realistic dynamics are computed. It is found that the multiple\nsurface plasmons present a significant red-shift with respect to the case of\nfully bounded quantum plasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2016 10:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}

The mixed-event\ntechnique is generally used as a standard method to correct for\nfinite-acceptance effects. We demonstrate that event mixing only provides an\napproximate acceptance correction, and propose new methods for\nfinite-acceptance corrections. Starting from discussions about 2-dimensional\ncorrection procedures, new methods are derived for specific assumptions on the\nproperties of the signal, such as uniform signal distribution or\n$\\delta$-function-like trigger particle distribution, and suitable for\ntwo-particle correlation analyses from particles at mid-rapidity and jet-hadron\nor high $p_{\\text{T}}$-triggered hadron-hadron correlations. Per-trigger\nassociated particle yields from the mixed-event method and the new methods are\ncompared through Monte Carlo simulations containing well-defined correlation\nsignals. Significant differences are observed at large pseudorapidity\ndifferences in general and especially for asymmetric particle distribution like\nthat produced in proton--nucleus collisions. The applicability and validity of\nthe new methods are discussed in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2016 14:02:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 16:06:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-18"}

We study the network lifetime\nfrom the perspective of network science. In our dynamic network, nodes are\nassigned a fixed amount of energy initially and consume the energy in the\ndelivery of packets. We divided the network traffic flow into four states: no,\nslow, fast, and absolute congestion states. We derive the network lifetime by\nconsidering the state of the traffic flow. We find that the network lifetime is\ngenerally opposite to traffic congestion in that the more congested traffic,\nthe less network lifetime. We also find the impacts of factors such as packet\ngeneration rate, communication radius, node moving speed, etc., on network\nlifetime and traffic congestion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2016 03:20:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-24"}
