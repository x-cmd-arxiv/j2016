Estimating the\nsupport of a set of signals and their DOAs is crucial to many signal processing\napplications, such as Cognitive Radio (CR). A challenging scenario, faced by\nCRs, is that of multiband signals, composed of several narrowband transmissions\nspread over a wide spectrum each with unknown carrier frequencies and DOAs. The\nNyquist rate of such signals is high and constitutes a bottleneck both in the\nanalog and digital domains. To alleviate the sampling rate issue, several\nsub-Nyquist sampling methods, such as multicoset sampling or the modulated\nwideband converter (MWC), have been proposed in the context of spectrum\nsensing. In this work, we first suggest an alternative sub-Nyquist sampling and\nsignal reconstruction method to the MWC, based on a uniform linear array (ULA).\nWe then extend our approach to joint spectrum sensing and DOA estimation and\npropose the CompreSsed CArrier and DOA Estimation (CaSCADE) system, composed of\nan L-shaped array with two ULAs. In both cases, we derive perfect recovery\nconditions of the signal parameters (carrier frequencies and DOAs if relevant)\nand the signal itself and provide two reconstruction algorithms, one based on\nthe ESPRIT method and the second on compressed sensing techniques. Both our\njoint carriers and DOAs recovery algorithms overcome the well-known pairing\nissue between the two parameters. Simulations demonstrate that our alternative\nspectrum sensing system outperforms the MWC in terms of recovery error and\ndesign complexity and show joint carrier frequencies and DOAs from our CaSCADE\nsystem's sub-Nyquist samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2016 18:54:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

Many inferential procedures employed in the analysis of such data\ninvolve the long run covariance function or operator, which is analogous to the\nlong run covariance matrix familiar to finite dimensional time series analysis\nand econometrics. This function may be naturally estimated using a smoothed\nperiodogram type estimator evaluated at frequency zero that relies crucially on\nthe choice of a bandwidth parameter. Motivated by a number of prior\ncontributions in the finite dimensional setting, we propose a bandwidth\nselection method that aims to minimize the estimator's asymptotic mean squared\nnormed error (AMSNE) in $L^2[0,1]^2$. As the AMSNE depends on unknown\npopulation quantities including the long run covariance function itself,\nestimates for these are plugged in in an initial step after which the estimated\nAMSNE can be minimized to produce an empirical optimal bandwidth. We show that\nthe bandwidth produced in this way is asymptotically consistent with the AMSNE\noptimal bandwidth, with quantifiable rates, under mild stationarity and moment\nconditions. These results and the efficacy of the proposed methodology are\nevaluated by means of a comprehensive simulation study, from which we can offer\npractical advice on how to select the bandwidth parameter in this setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2016 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

The largest adsorption energy values are found to be\nalong the edges between two neighbouring (111)/(111) and (111)/(100) facets;\nwhile FCC and HCP sites located on the (111) facets may show a chemisorption\nvalue lower 0.3 eV where often fast O$_2$ dissociation easily occurs. Our\nresults show that, even though it is difficult to disentangle the geometrical\nand electronic effects on the oxygen molecule adsorption, there is a strong\ncorrelation between the calculated general coordination number (GCN) and the\nchemisorp- tion map. Finally, the inclusion of dispersion corrections (DFT-D)\nleads to an overall increase on the calculated adsorption energy values but\nwith a negligible alteration on the general O$_2$ adsorption trends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2016 20:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

We also study cooperative mechanisms to help small\ncells collaborate efficiently in order to reduce mutual interference.\nSimulations show that our proposed scheme achieves good performance and\noutperforms the existing ABSF frameworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2016 22:12:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-15"}

In this paper, we will consider cellular automata that arise from\npolynomial transition rules, where the symbols in the automaton are integers\nmodulo some prime $p$. We are principally concerned with the asymptotic\nbehavior of the line complexity sequence $a_T(k)$, which counts, for each $k$,\nthe number of coefficient strings of length $k$ that occur in the automaton. We\nbegin with the modulo $2$ case. For a given polynomial $T(x) = c_0 + c_1x + ...\n+ c_nx^n$ with $c_0,c_n\\neq 0$, we construct odd and even parts of the\npolynomial from the strings $0c_1c_3c_5...$ and $c_0c_2c_4...$, respectively.\nWe prove that for polynomials for which the odd and even parts are relatively\nprime, $a_T(k)$ satisfies recursions of a specific form.

We show that the property of \"having a recursion of some order\" is\npreserved when the transition rule is raised to a positive integer power.\nExtending to a more general setting, we investigate the asymptotics of $a_T(k)$\nby considering an abstract generating function\n$\\phi(z)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty\\alpha(k)z^k$ which satisfies a general functional\nequation relating $\\phi(z)$ and $\\phi(z^p)$ for some prime $p$.

First, for\nprobabilistic query evaluation, we show that MSO tractability cannot extend\nbeyond bounded treewidth: there are even FO queries that are hard on any\nefficiently constructible unbounded-treewidth class of graphs. This dichotomy\nrelies on recent polynomial bounds on the extraction of planar graphs as\nminors, and implies lower bounds in non-probabilistic settings, for query\nevaluation and match counting in subinstance-closed families. Second, we show\nhow to explain our tractability result in terms of lineage: the lineage of MSO\nqueries on bounded-treewidth instances can be represented as bounded-treewidth\ncircuits, polynomial-size OBDDs, and linear-size d-DNNFs. By contrast, we can\nstrengthen the previous dichotomy to lineages, and show that there are even\nUCQs with disequalities that have superpolynomial OBDDs on all\nunbounded-treewidth graph classes; we give a characterization of such queries.\nLast, we show how bounded-treewidth tractability explains the tractability of\nthe inversion-free safe queries: we can rewrite their input instances to have\nbounded-treewidth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2016 23:43:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2023 21:12:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-14"}

However, a Web search can\nbe a threat to the privacy of the searcher because the queries may reveal\nsensitive information about the searcher. Private Web search (PWS) solutions\nallow users to find information on the Internet while preserving their privacy.\nHere, privacy means maintaining the confidentiality of the identity of the\ncommunicating users. According to their underlying technology, existing PWS\nsolutions can be divided into three types: proxy-based solutions,\nobfuscation-based solutions, and cryptography-based solutions. Of these,\ncryptography-based PWS (CB-PWS) systems are particularly interesting because\nthey provide strong privacy guarantees in the cryptographic sense. In this\npaper, we present a round-efficient CB-PWS protocol that preserves\ncomputational efficiency compared to other known CB-PWS systems. Assuming a\nbroadcast channel, our protocol is a \\emph{four-round} cryptographic scheme\nthat requires $O(n)$ communication complexity. However, if only point-to-point\ninteraction is available, with the users emulating the broadcast channel, our\nprotocol requires an expected $O(1)$-round complexity and the same computation\nand communication overhead. Further analyzing the efficiency of our protocol\nshows that our proposal requires only $3n$ modular exponentiations for $n$\nusers.

They develop from internal compressive waves and can be of different\ntypes depending on the composition of the outflow: (1) Shocks in \"photon gas,\"\nwith negligible plasma inertia, have a unique structure determined by the\nforce-free condition---zero radiation flux in the plasma rest frame. Radiation\ndominance over plasma inertia suppresses formation of collisionless shocks\nmediated by collective electromagnetic fields. (2) If the outflow is\nsufficiently magnetized, a strong collisionless subshock develops, which is\nembedded in a thicker radiation-mediated structure. (3) Waves in outflows with\na free neutron component lead to dissipation through nuclear collisions. At\nlarge optical depths, shocks have a thickness comparable to the neutron free\npath, with an embedded radiation-mediated and collisionless subshocks.

The $H$ and $K_{s}$-band light curves subtracted by those of SN 2009dc\ndisplayed plateaued evolutions, indicating a NIR echo from the surrounding\ndust. The distance to the inner boundary of the dust shell is limited to be\n$4.8 - 6.4\\times10^{-2}$ pc.

While there has been much work on different regularizers\nmany modern algorithms still use a data cost that is not very different from\nthe ones used over 30 years ago: a robust version of brightness constancy or\ngradient constancy. In this paper we leverage the recent availability of\nground-truth optical flow databases in order to learn a data cost. Specifically\nwe take a generative approach in which the data cost models the distribution of\nnoise after warping an image according to the flow and we measure the\n\"goodness\" of a data cost by how well it matches the true distribution of flow\nwarp error. Consistent with current practice, we find that robust versions of\ngradient constancy are better models than simple brightness constancy but a\nlearned GMM that models the density of patches of warp error gives a much\nbetter fit than any existing assumption of constancy. This significant\nadvantage of the GMM is due to an explicit modeling of the spatial structure of\nwarp errors, a feature which is missing from almost all existing data costs in\noptical flow. Finally, we show how a good density model of warp error patches\ncan be used for optical flow estimation on whole images. We replace the data\ncost by the expected patch log-likelihood (EPLL), and show how this cost can be\noptimized iteratively using an additional step of denoising the warp error\nimage. The results of our experiments are promising and show that patch models\nwith higher likelihood lead to better optical flow estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 07:23:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

In\nthis work we systematically study the influence of the arrangement of the\nphases by correlating the microstructure of a two-phase material to the onset\nof ductile failure. A single topological feature is identified in which\ncritical levels of damage are consistently indicated. It consists of a small\nregion of the matrix phase with particles of the hard phase on both sides in a\ndirection that depends on the applied deformation. Due to this configuration, a\nlarge tensile hydrostatic stress and plastic strain is observed inside the\nmatrix, indicating high damage.

Computer video games have existed for\ndecades, with a reusable game engine to drive them. If pervasive games can be\nunderstood as computer games interfacing with the physical world, can computer\ngame engines be used to stage pervasive games? Considering the use of\nnon-standard input devices in pervasive games and the rise of IoT, how will\nthis affect the architectures supporting the broader set of pervasive\napplications? The use of a game engine can be found in some existing pervasive\ngame projects, but general research into how the domain of pervasive games\noverlaps with that of video games is lacking. When an engine is used, a\ndiscussion of, what type of engine is most suitable and what properties are\nbeing fulfilled by the engine, is often not part of the discourse.

A non-parametric probabilistic\nsegmentation provides a certainty measure on the pixel belonging to foreground\nor background, based on which a dictionary is formed for use in sparse coding.\nBy removing the restriction to conform to (F,B) pairs, this method allows for\nbetter alpha estimation from multiple F and B samples.

The discovery of small non-coding\nRNAs (miRNAs) in specific motifs of the genetic regulatory network has led to\nidentifying noise buffering as the possible key function they exert in\nregulation. Recent in vitro} and in silico studies have corroborated this\nhypothesis. It is however also known that miRNA-mediated noise reduction is\nhampered by transcriptional bursting in simple topologies. Here, using\nstochastic simulations validated by analytical calculations based on van\nKampen's expansion, we revisit the noise-buffering capacity of the\nmiRNA-mediated Incoherent Feed Forward Loop (IFFL), a small module that is\nwidespread in the gene regulatory networks of higher eukaryotes, in order to\naccount for the effects of intermittency in the transcriptional activity of the\nmodulator gene. We show that bursting considerably alters the circuit's ability\nto control static protein noise. By comparing with other regulatory\narchitectures, we find that direct transcriptional regulation significantly\noutperforms the IFFL in a broad range of kinetic parameters. This suggests\nthat, under pulsatile inputs, static noise reduction may be less important than\ndynamical aspects of noise and information processing in characterising the\nperformance of regulatory elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 12:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

The main question appears in the context of scalable quantum\ncomputing, where multiple subcircuits are used for the construction of a larger\nfault-tolerant one: can the same circular representation be used by multiple\nsubcircuits? The circular circuits are sufficient for constructing\ncomputationally universal, fault-tolerant circuits formed entirely of qubit\ninitialisation, CNOT gates and qubit measurements. The main result of modelling\ncircular CNOT circuits is that a derived Boolean representation allows to\ndefine a set of equations for $X$ and $Z$ stabiliser transformations. Through a\nwell defined set of steps it is possible to reduce the initial equations to a\nset of stabiliser transformations given a series of cuts through the circular\ncircuit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 13:06:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

The developed paradigm accounts for signal\nretransmission upon decoding errors, in which the temporal correlation among\nthe signal-to-interference plus-noise-ratio (SINR) of the original and\nretransmitted signals is captured. In addition to modeling the effect of\nretransmission on the network performance, the developed mathematical model\npresents twofold analysis unification for MIMO cellular networks literature.\nFirst, it integrates the tangible decoding error probability and the abstracted\n(i.e., modulation scheme and receiver type agnostic) outage probability\nanalysis, which are largely disjoint in the literature. Second, it unifies the\nanalysis for different MIMO configurations. The unified MIMO analysis is\nachieved by abstracting unnecessary information conveyed within the interfering\nsignals by Gaussian signaling approximation along with an equivalent SISO\nrepresentation for the per-data stream SINR in MIMO cellular networks. We show\nthat the proposed unification simplifies the analysis without sacrificing the\nmodel accuracy. To this end, we discuss the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff\nimposed by different MIMO schemes and shed light on the diversity loss due to\nthe temporal correlation among the SINRs of the original and retransmitted\nsignals.

Tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs), made of gas ejected during\ngalaxy interactions, seem to be devoid of dark matter and have a near-solar\nmetallicity. The latter makes it possible to study molecular gas and its link\nto SF using standard tracers (CO, dust) in a peculiar environment. We present a\ndetailed study of a nearby TDG in the Virgo Cluster, VCC 2062, using new\nhigh-resolution CO(1--0) data from the Plateau de Bure, deep optical imaging\nfrom the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS), and complementary\nmultiwavelength data. Until now, there was some doubt whether VCC 2062 was a\ntrue TDG, but the new deep optical images from the NGVS reveal a stellar bridge\nbetween VCC 2062 and its parent galaxy, NGC 4694, which is clear proof of its\ntidal origin. Several high-resolution tracers (\\halpha, UV, 8~\\mi, and 24~\\mi)\nof the star formation rate (SFR) are compared to the molecular gas distribution\nas traced by the CO(1-0). Coupled with the SFR tracers, the NGVS data are used\nwith the CIGALE code to model the stellar populations throughout VCC 2062,\nyielding a declining SFR in the recent past, consistent with the low \\halpha/UV\nratio, and a high burst strength. HI emission covers VCC 2062, whereas the CO\nis concentrated near the HI maxima. The CO peaks correspond to two very\ndistinct regions: one with moderate SF to the NE and one with only slightly\nweaker CO emission but with nearly no SF. Even where SF is clearly present, the\nSFR is below the value expected from the surface density of the molecular and\nthe total gas as compared to spiral galaxies and other TDGs. After discussing\ndifferent possible explanations, we conclude that the low surface brightness is\na crucial parameter to understand the low SFR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 14:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

One\ncommon approach for reconstructing a species tree consists in first\nconstructing several phylogenetic trees from primary data (e.g. DNA sequences\noriginating from some species in $X$), and then constructing a single\nphylogenetic tree maximizing the \"concordance\" with the input trees. The\nso-obtained tree is our estimation of the species tree and, when the input\ntrees are defined on overlapping -- but not identical -- sets of labels, is\ncalled \"supertree\". In this paper, we focus on two problems that are central\nwhen combining phylogenetic trees into a supertree: the compatibility and the\nstrict compatibility problems for unrooted phylogenetic trees. These problems\nare strongly related, respectively, to the notions of \"containing as a minor\"\nand \"containing as a topological minor\" in the graph community. Both problems\nare known to be fixed-parameter tractable in the number of input trees $k$, by\nusing their expressibility in Monadic Second Order Logic and a reduction to\ngraphs of bounded treewidth. Motivated by the fact that the dependency on $k$\nof these algorithms is prohibitively large, we give the first explicit dynamic\nprogramming algorithms for solving these problems, both running in time\n$2^{O(k^2)} \\cdot n$, where $n$ is the total size of the input.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 15:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

A stream of weighted items arrive one at a time at the entrance of a\nbuffer with two holding locations. A processor (or observer) can process\n(observe) an item at the buffer location it chooses, deriving this way the\nweight of the observed item as profit. The main constraint is that the\nprocessor can only move {\\em synchronously} with the item stream; as a result,\nmoving from the end of the buffer to the entrance, it crosses paths with the\nitem already there, and will never have the chance to process or even identify\nit. \\textsc{Persistence}\\ is the online problem of scheduling the processor\nmovements through the buffer so that its total derived value is maximized under\nthis constraint.\n  We study the performance of the straight-forward heuristic {\\em Threshold},\ni.e., forcing the processor to \"follow\" an item through the whole buffer only\nif its value is above a threshold.

While standards and tools exist to express and verify some\nof these assumptions, in practice most of them end up being either sifted off\nor hidden between the lines of our codes. Across the system layers, a complex\nand at times obscure web of assumptions determines the quality of the match of\nour software with its deployment platforms and run-time environments. Our\nposition is that it becomes increasingly important being able to design\nsoftware systems with architectural and structuring techniques that allow\nsoftware to be decomposed to reduce its complexity, but without hiding in the\nprocess vital hypotheses and assumptions. In this paper we discuss this\nproblem, introduce three potentially dangerous consequences of its denial, and\npropose three strategies to facilitate their treatment. Finally we propose our\nvision towards a new holistic approach to software development to overcome the\nshortcomings offered by fragmented views to the problem of assumption failures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 12:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-09"}

There are numerous QAS based\non the user documents present today, but they all are limited to providing\nobjective answers and process simple questions only. Complex questions cannot\nbe answered by the existing QAS, as they require interpretation of the current\nand old data as well as the question asked by the user. The above limitations\ncan be overcome by using deep cases and neural network. Hence we propose a\nmodified QAS in which we create a deep artificial neural network with\nassociative memory from text documents. The modified QAS processes the contents\nof the text document provided to it and find the answer to even complex\nquestions in the documents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 06:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-02"}
