We demonstrate that the tetrad-based\nmethod does not suffer from the gauge freedoms inherent to the LTB model,\nnaturally accommodates non-zero pressure and has a more transparent physical\ninterpretation. We further apply our tetrad-based method to a generalised form\nof 'Swiss cheese' model, which consists of an interior spherical region\nsurrounded by a spherical shell of vacuum that is embedded in an exterior\nbackground universe. In general, we allow the fluid in the interior and\nexterior regions to support pressure, and do not demand that the interior\nregion be compensated. We pay particular attention to the form of the solution\nin the intervening vacuum region and verify the validity of Birkhoff's theorem\nat both the metric and tetrad level.

An algorithm\nthat knows the service probabilities (the \"genie\") can always choose the server\nof highest service probability. We study algorithms that learn the unknown\nservice probabilities. Our goal is to minimize queue-regret: the (expected)\ndifference between the queue-lengths obtained by the algorithm, and those\nobtained by the \"genie.\"\n  Since queue-regret cannot be larger than classical regret, results for the\nstandard multi-armed bandit problem give algorithms for which queue-regret\nincreases no more than logarithmically in time.

These strong\ncorrelations have often been taken to indicate that the internal structure of a\ngalaxy must play a major physical role, directly or indirectly, in the control\nof star-formation. In this paper we show by means of a very simple toy model\nthat these correlations can arise naturally without any such physical role once\nthe observed evolution of the size-mass relation for star-forming galaxies is\ntaken into account. In particular, the model reproduces the sharp threshold in\n{\\Sigma} between galaxies that are star-forming and those that are quenched,\nand the evolution of this threshold with redshift. Similarly, it produces\niso-quenched-fraction contours in the ${f_Q(m,R_e)}$ plane that are almost\nexactly parallel to lines of constant {\\Sigma} for centrals and shallower for\nsatellites. It does so without any dependence on quenching on size or {\\Sigma},\nand without invoking any differences between centrals and satellites, beyond\nthe different mass-dependences of their quenching laws. The toy-model also\nreproduces several other observations, including the sSFR gradients within\ngalaxies and the appearance of inside-out build-up of passive galaxies.\nFinally, it is shown that curvature in the Main Sequence sSFR-mass relation can\nproduce curvature in the apparent B/T ratios with mass. Our analysis therefore\nsuggests that many of the strong correlations that are observed between galaxy\nstructure and sSFR may well be a consequence of things unrelated to quenching\nand should not be taken as evidence of the physical processes that drive\nquenching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2016 20:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

We further provide the first\nempirical constraints on the redshift evolution of X-ray emission from both\nlow-mass XRB (LMXB) and high-mass XRB (HMXB) populations and their scalings\nwith $M_\\star$ and SFR, respectively. We find $L_{\\rm 2-10 keV}({\\rm\nLMXB})/M_\\star \\propto (1 + z)^{2-3}$ and $L_{\\rm 2-10 keV}({\\rm HMXB})$/SFR\n$\\propto (1 + z)$, and show that these relations are consistent with XRB\npopulation-synthesis model predictions, which attribute the increase in LMXB\nand HMXB scaling relations with redshift as being due to declining host galaxy\nstellar ages and metallicities, respectively. We discuss how emission from XRBs\ncould provide an important source of heating to the intergalactic medium in the\nearly Universe, exceeding that of active galactic nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2016 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

Our method uses a part of\nthese subproblems as a simple sample as defined in statistics for comparing\nsome strategies in order to select the most promising one that will be used for\nsolving the remaining subproblems. For each subproblem of the sample, the\nparallelism helps us to control the running time of the strategies because it\ngives us the possibility to introduce timeouts by stopping a strategy when it\nrequires more than twice the time of the best one. Thus, we can deal with the\ngreat disparity in solving times for the strategies.

Although it is thought that the presence of\ncontinuous bands lead to premature failure, it has not been possible to verify\nthis link.

Humans are notoriously good at it, even if some variations\nare presumably more difficult to handle than others (e.g. 3D rotations). Humans\nare thought to solve the problem through hierarchical processing along the\nventral stream, which progressively extracts more and more invariant visual\nfeatures. This feed-forward architecture has inspired a new generation of\nbio-inspired computer vision systems called deep convolutional neural networks\n(DCNN), which are currently the best algorithms for object recognition in\nnatural images. Here, for the first time, we systematically compared human\nfeed-forward vision and DCNNs at view-invariant object recognition using the\nsame images and controlling for both the kinds of transformation as well as\ntheir magnitude. We used four object categories and images were rendered from\n3D computer models. In total, 89 human subjects participated in 10 experiments\nin which they had to discriminate between two or four categories after rapid\npresentation with backward masking. We also tested two recent DCNNs on the same\ntasks. We found that humans and DCNNs largely agreed on the relative\ndifficulties of each kind of variation: rotation in depth is by far the hardest\ntransformation to handle, followed by scale, then rotation in plane, and\nfinally position. This suggests that humans recognize objects mainly through 2D\ntemplate matching, rather than by constructing 3D object models, and that DCNNs\nare not too unreasonable models of human feed-forward vision. Also, our results\nshow that the variation levels in rotation in depth and scale strongly modulate\nboth humans' and DCNNs' recognition performances. We thus argue that these\nvariations should be controlled in the image datasets used in vision research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2016 20:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-13"}

With\nhigh-dimensional sparse data, however, the method suffers from slow convergence\nand high variance due to the heterogeneity in feature sparsity. To mitigate\nthis issue, we introduce a stabilized truncated stochastic gradient descent\nalgorithm. We employ a soft-thresholding scheme on the weight vector where the\nimposed shrinkage is adaptive to the amount of information available in each\nfeature. The variability in the resulted sparse weight vector is further\ncontrolled by stability selection integrated with the informative truncation.\nTo facilitate better convergence, we adopt an annealing strategy on the\ntruncation rate, which leads to a balanced trade-off between exploration and\nexploitation in learning a sparse weight vector. Numerical experiments show\nthat our algorithm compares favorably with the original algorithm in terms of\nprediction accuracy, achieved sparsity and stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2016 21:34:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 22:41:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 00:50:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

Sparse models not only\nimprove computation and memory usage, but also enhance the generalization\ncapacity, a principle that concurs with the law of parsimony. However,\ninappropriate sparsity modeling may also significantly degrade the performance.\nIn this paper, we propose Approximation Vector Machine (AVM), a model that can\nsimultaneously encourage the sparsity and safeguard its risk in compromising\nthe performance. When an incoming instance arrives, we approximate this\ninstance by one of its neighbors whose distance to it is less than a predefined\nthreshold. Our key intuition is that since the newly seen instance is expressed\nby its nearby neighbor the optimal performance can be analytically formulated\nand maintained.

Based on these studies we propose a\nnew ConvNet architecture for spatiotemporal fusion of video snippets, and\nevaluate its performance on standard benchmarks where this architecture\nachieves state-of-the-art results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2016 08:51:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Sep 2016 10:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}

We also introduce the\nclass of partial feed-forward staircase codes, which allows parity-propagation\nto occur over a given number of blocks. By amortizing the complexity of\nself-protection over several standard staircase blocks, the encoding complexity\nof these codes is made comparable to staircase codes. Partial feed-forward\nstaircase codes have the same error-floor as staircase codes.

Since cell phone data can be captured in a passive way\nfor a large user population, they can be harnessed to collect well-sampled\nmobility information. In this paper, we propose CT-Mapper, an unsupervised\nalgorithm that enables the mapping of mobile phone traces over a multimodal\ntransport network. One of the main strengths of CT-Mapper is its capability to\nmap noisy sparse cellular multimodal trajectories over a multilayer\ntransportation network where the layers have different physical properties and\nnot only to map trajectories associated with a single layer. Such a network is\nmodeled by a large multilayer graph in which the nodes correspond to\nmetro/train stations or road intersections and edges correspond to connections\nbetween them. The mapping problem is modeled by an unsupervised HMM where the\nobservations correspond to sparse user mobile trajectories and the hidden\nstates to the multilayer graph nodes. The HMM is unsupervised as the transition\nand emission probabilities are inferred using respectively the physical\ntransportation properties and the information on the spatial coverage of\nantenna base stations. To evaluate CT-Mapper we collected cellular traces with\ntheir corresponding GPS trajectories for a group of volunteer users in Paris\nand vicinity (France). We show that CT-Mapper is able to accurately retrieve\nthe real cell phone user paths despite the sparsity of the observed trace\ntrajectories. Furthermore our transition probability model is up to 20% more\naccurate than other naive models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2016 08:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-25"}

To analyse their expected behaviour, new ideas are often evaluated with\nsimulators in production IaaS system-like scenarios.

Unfortunately,\ncurrent cloud simulators are hard to employ and they often have performance\nissues when several layers of schedulers interact in them.

In response to the requirements of\nsuch scenarios, the new simulator introduces concepts such as: a unified model\nfor resource sharing and a new energy metering framework with hierarchical and\nindirect metering options. Then, the comparison of several simulated situations\nto real-life IaaS behaviour is used to validate the simulator's functionality.\nFinally, a performance comparison is presented between DISSECT-CF and some\ncurrently available simulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2016 09:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-25"}

The three dwarf spheroidal satellites (NGC147, NGC185, and\nNGC205) of the Andromeda galaxy are characterised by very different\ninterstellar medium (ISM) properties, which might suggest them being at\ndifferent galaxy evolutionary stages. While the dust content of NGC205 has been\nstudied in detail by De Looze et al. (2012), we present new Herschel dust\ncontinuum observations of NGC147 and NGC185. The non-detection of NGC147 in\nHerschel SPIRE maps puts a strong constraint on its dust mass (< 128 Msun). For\nNGC185, we derive a total dust mass M_d = 5.1 x 10^3 Msun, which is a factor of\n~2-3 higher than that derived from ISO and Spitzer observations and confirms\nthe need for longer wavelength observations to trace more massive cold dust\nreservoirs. We, furthermore, estimate the dust production by asymptotic giant\nbranch (AGB) stars and supernovae (SNe). For NGC147, the upper limit on the\ndust mass is consistent with expectations of the material injected by the\nevolved stellar population. In NGC185 and NGC205, the observed dust content is\none order of magnitude higher compared to the estimated dust production by AGBs\nand SNe. Efficient grain growth, and potentially longer dust survival times\n(3-6 Gyr) are required to account for their current dust content. Our study\nconfirms the importance of grain growth in the gas phase to account for the\ncurrent dust reservoir in galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2016 10:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

The wave resistance in the presence of shear current is\ncalculated for the first time, containing in general a non-zero lateral\ncomponent. While formally apparently a straightforward extension of existing\ndeep water theory, the introduction of finite water depth is physically\nnon-trivial, since the surface waves are now affected by a subtle interplay of\nthe effects of the current and the sea bed. This becomes particularly\npronounced when considering the phenomenon of critical velocity, the velocity\nat which transversely propagating waves become unable to keep up with the\nmoving source. The phenomenon is well known for shallow water, and was recently\nshown to exist also in deep water in the presence of a shear current\n[Ellingsen, J.~Fluid Mech.\\ {\\bf 742} R2 (2014)]. We derive the exact criterion\nfor criticality as a function of an intrinsic shear Froude number $S\\sqrt{b/g}$\n($S$ is uniform vorticity, $b$ size of source), the water depth, and the angle\nbetween the shear current and the ship's motion. Formulae for both the normal\nand lateral wave resistance force are derived, and we analyse its dependence on\nthe source velocity (or Froude number $Fr$) for different amounts of shear and\ndifferent directions of motion.

Without resetting, the interface\nwidth grows unbounded with time as $t^\\beta$, where $\\beta$ is the so-called\ngrowth exponent. We show that introducing resetting induces for $\\alpha>1$ and\nat long times fluctuations that are bounded in time.

On the other hand, solvency constraints may force banks to recover\nlost fundings by selling their illiquid assets, resulting in effective losses\nin the presence of fire sales - that is, when funding shortcomings are\nwidespread over the market. Because of the complex structure of the network of\ninterbank exposures, these losses reverberate among banks and eventually get\namplified, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the whole financial\nsystem. Building on Debt Rank [Battiston et al., 2012], in this work we define\na systemic risk metric that estimates the potential amplification of losses in\ninterbank markets accounting for both credit and liquidity contagion channels:\nthe Debt-Solvency Rank. We implement this framework on a dataset of 183\nEuropean banks that were publicly traded between 2004 and 2013, showing indeed\nthat liquidity spillovers substantially increase systemic risk, and thus cannot\nbe neglected in stress-test scenarios.

Usually\nthese lines can be produced by Starburts, shocks and/or radiation from an\nactive galactic nucleus (AGN). Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRG) represent\nideal and challenging objects to investigate the origin of the H2 emission, as\nall processes above can be observed in a single object. In this work, we use\nK-band integral field spectroscopy to map the emission line flux distributions\nand kinematics and investigate the origin of the molecular and ionized gas line\nemission from inner 1.4x2.4 kpc2 of the LIRG NGC6240, known to be the galaxy\nwith strongest H2 line emission. The emission lines show complex profiles at\nlocations between both nuclei and surrounding the northern nucleus, while at\nlocations near the southern nucleus and at 1\" west of the northern nucleus,\nthey can be reproduced by a single gaussian component. We found that the H2\nemission is originated mainly by thermal processes, possible being dominated by\nheating of the gas by X-rays from the AGN at locations near both nuclei. For\nthe region between the northern and southern nuclei shocks due to the\ninteracting process may be the main excitation mechanism, as indicated by the\nhigh values of the H2l2.12um/Brg line ratio. A contribution of fluorescent\nexcitation may also be important at locations near 1\" west of the northern\nnucleus, which show the lowest line ratios. The [FeII]l2.072um/Brg ratio show a\nsimilar trend as observed for H2l2.12um/Brg, suggesting that [FeII] and H2 line\nemission have similar origins.

The other two samples,\npristine and ion irradiated (without annealing), however, do not show acceptor\nrelated PL emission in the nearby energy region. Electron transition from\nshallow donor (most probable site is interstitial zinc for undoped ZnO) to such\nnewly formed shallow acceptor state creates new donor-acceptor pair (DAP)\nluminescence peak ~ 3.229 eV. ABX and DAP peak energy positions confirm that\nthe acceptor is N related. The acceptor exciton binding energy has been\nestimated to be 180 +/- 15 meV which is in conformity with earlier reports. The\nactivation of shallow acceptors without any source of atomic nitrogen can only\nbe possible through diffusion of molecular nitrogen inside the sample during\nannealing.

This leads to deviation of the estimated force FC\nfrom the real force F of electrostatic interaction, thus imposing the task to\nevaluate the disparity. In the present paper the problem is being solved\ntheoretically for two charged conductive spheres of equal radii and arbitrary\nelectric charges. Assessment of the deviation is given as a function of the\nratio of the distance R between the spheres centers to the sum of their radii.\nFor the purpose, relations between FC and F derived in a preceding work of\nours, are employed to generalize the Coulomb's interactions. At relatively\nshort distances between the spheres, the Coulomb force FC, as estimated to be\ninduced by charges situated at the centers of the spheres, differ significantly\nfrom the real force F of interaction between the spheres.

A direct implementation by summation of traces with different moveouts\nis computationally expensive for large data sets. In this paper we present a\nnew method for fast computation of the hyperbolic Radon transforms. It is based\non using a log-polar sampling with which the main computational parts reduce to\ncomputing convolutions. This allows for fast implementations by means of FFT.\nIn addition to the FFT operations, interpolation procedures are required for\nswitching between coordinates in the time-offset; Radon; and log-polar domains.\nGraphical Processor Units (GPUs) are suitable to use as a computational\nplatform for this purpose, due to the hardware supported interpolation routines\nas well as optimized routines for FFT. Performance tests show large speed-ups\nof the proposed algorithm. Hence, it is suitable to use in iterative methods,\nand we provide examples for data interpolation and multiple removal using this\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2016 05:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

Trans-cis photo-isomerization is generally known to be\nmost intense at 'parallel illumination' (polarization parallel to LC director),\nas light-medium interactions are active when polarization aligns with\ntrainsition dipole moment. We show that at parallel illumination though cis\nisomers are converted from trans the most near surface, they can be the least\nbelow certain light propagation depth. Membrane force, an average effect of\ntrans-cis conversion over propagation depths, shows a monotonic polarization\ndependence, i.e. maximum at parallel illumination, which agrees well with\nexperiment [1]. However, under strong illumination, cis\nfraction/photo-contraction distribution through depths shows deep penetration,\nswitching over the polarization dependence in photo-moment, which is related to\nphoto-contraction gradient ---- photo-moment can be maximum at 'perpendicular\nillumination' (polarization perpendicular to director) under strong light.
