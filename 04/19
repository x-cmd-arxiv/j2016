Although such setting\ngives convenience for comparing different methods, it is not the natural way\nthat humans annotate images. The number of annotated tags should depend on\nimage contents. Inspired by the recent progress in machine translation and\nimage captioning, we propose a novel Recurrent Image Annotator (RIA) model that\nforms image annotation task as a sequence generation problem so that RIA can\nnatively predict the proper length of tags according to image contents.

The approach is based on converting some selected check nodes\ninvolving a trapping set into super checks corresponding to a 2-error\ncorrecting component code. Specifically, we follow two main purposes to\nconstruct the check-hybrid codes; first, based on the knowledge of the trapping\nsets of the global LDPC code, single parity checks are replaced by super checks\nto disable the trapping sets. We show that by converting specified single check\nnodes, denoted as critical checks, to super checks in a trapping set, the\nparallel bit flipping (PBF) decoder corrects the errors on a trapping set and\nhence eliminates the trapping set. The second purpose is to minimize the rate\nloss caused by replacing the super checks through finding the minimum number of\nsuch critical checks. We also present an algorithm to find critical checks in a\ntrapping set of column-weight 3 LDPC code and then provide upper bounds on the\nminimum number of such critical checks such that the decoder corrects all error\npatterns on elementary trapping sets. Moreover, we provide a fixed set for a\nclass of constructed check-hybrid codes. The guaranteed error correction\ncapability of the CH-GLDPC codes is also studied. We show that a CH-GLDPC code\nin which each variable node is connected to 2 super checks corresponding to a\n2-error correcting component code corrects up to 5 errors. The results are also\nextended to column-weight 4 LDPC codes. Finally, we investigate the eliminating\nof trapping sets of a column-weight 3 LDPC code using the Gallager B decoding\nalgorithm and generalize the results obtained for the PBF for the Gallager B\ndecoding algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 17:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}

Each team was\ncharacterized by 26 predictor variables and one binary response variable taking\non a value of \"TRUE\" if a team had made the playoffs, and value of \"FALSE\" if a\nteam had missed the playoffs. After fitting an initial classification tree to\nthis problem, this tree was then pruned which decreased the test error rate.\nFurther to this, a random forest of classification trees was grown which\nprovided a very accurate model from which a variable importance plot was\ngenerated to determine which predictor variables had the greatest influence on\nthe response variable. The result of this work was the conclusion that the most\nimportant factors in characterizing a team's playoff eligibility are a team's\nopponent number of assists per game, a team's opponent number of made two point\nshots per game, and a team's number of steals per game. This seems to suggest\nthat defensive factors as opposed to offensive factors are the most important\ncharacteristics shared among NBA playoff teams. We then use neural networks to\nclassify championship teams based on regular season data.

In steels, the most common\nmodels of ORs are the ones by Nishiyama-Wassermann (NW) and Kurdjumov-Sachs\n(KS). The defining feature of these and other OR models is the matching of\ndirections and planes in the parent face-centred cubic $\\gamma$-phase to ones\nin the product body-centred cubic/tetragonal $\\alpha/\\alpha'$-phase.\n  In this paper a novel method that identifies transformation strains with ORs\nis introduced and used to develop a new strain-based approach to phase\ntransformation models in steels.

The\nprimary focus is on the accretion rate of stars by the black hole (equivalent\nto their tidal disruption rate for black holes in the small to medium mass\nrange) and the eccentricity distribution of these stars. Our simulations vary\nnot only the particle number, but disc model (two models examined), spatial\nresolution at the centre (characterised by the numerical accretion radius) and\nsoftening length.

We show that the Doppler measurement obtained\nby a parametric least-squares fitting of the spectrum accounting for continuum\nvariability is insensitive to changes in the slope of the SED, suggesting that\nforward modeling techniques to measure moments of the line profile are the\noptimal way to achieve higher accuracy. Remaining residual variability at ~1\nm/s suggests that for M-stars Doppler surveys the current noise floor still has\nan instrumental origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

However, the initial mass\nfunction cannot be precisely monochromatic and even a tiny spread of mass\naround M_* would generate a current low-mass tail of PBHs below M_*. This tail\nwould be the main contributor to the Galactic background, so we consider its\nform and the associated constraints for a variety of scenarios with both\nextended and nearly-monochromatic initial mass functions. In particular, we\nconsider a scenario in which the PBHs form from critical collapse and have a\nmass function which peaks well above M_*. In this case, the largest PBHs could\nprovide the dark matter without the M_* ones exceeding the gamma-ray background\nlimits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 20:56:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

The framework generalizes\nideas of Alvarez and Seidel, who used them to count triangulations in time\n$O(2^nn^2)$ where $n$ is the number of points. The main idea is to reduce the\nproblem of counting geometric graphs to counting source-sink paths in a\ndirected acyclic graph.\n  The following new results will emerge. The number of all crossing-free\ngeometric graphs can be computed in time $O(c^nn^4)$ for some $c < 2.83929$.\nThe number of crossing-free convex partitions can be computed in time\n$O(2^nn^4)$. The number of crossing-free perfect matchings can be computed in\ntime $O(2^nn^4)$. The number of convex subdivisions can be computed in time\n$O(2^nn^4)$. The number of crossing-free spanning trees can be computed in time\n$O(c^nn^4)$ for some $c < 7.04313$. The number of crossing-free spanning cycles\ncan be computed in time $O(c^nn^4)$ for some $c < 5.61804$.\n  With the same bounds on the running time we can construct data structures\nwhich allow fast enumeration of the respective classes. For example, after\n$O(2^nn^4)$ time of preprocessing we can enumerate the set of all crossing-free\nperfect matchings using polynomial time per enumerated object. For\ncrossing-free perfect matchings and convex partitions we further obtain\nenumeration algorithms where the time delay for each (in particular, the first)\noutput is bounded by a polynomial in $n$.\n  All described algorithms are comparatively simple, both in terms of their\nanalysis and implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 21:03:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

Its dependence on communication of remote measurement\nsignals makes the closed-loop system vulnerable to cyber attacks. This paper\ndevelops a framework to analyze and quantify resilience of a given wide-area\ncontroller under disruptive attacks on certain communication links. Resilience\nof a given controller is measured in terms of closed-loop eigenvalues under the\nworst possible attack strategy. The computation of such a resilience index is\nchallenging especially for large-scale power systems due to the discrete nature\nof the attack strategies. To address the challenge, we propose an\noptimization-based formulation and a convex relaxation approach to facilitate\nthe computation. Conditions under which the relaxation is exact are derived and\nan efficient algorithm with guaranteed convergence is also developed. The\nproposed framework and the algorithm allow us to quantify resilience for given\nwide-area controllers and also provide sufficient conditions to guarantee\nclosed-loop stability under all possible communication attacks.

This effects a change of the\nenergy eigenbasis of the state to a basis that does not commute with the\noriginal, and a subsequent measurement of the energy now reveals a completely\ndifferent spectrum, which we call the {interference energy spectrum} of the\nstate. This name is appropriate because the same splitting procedure applied at\nthe stationary nodes of any eigenstate does not change the measurable energy of\nthe state. Of particular interest, this procedure can result in measurable\nenergies that are greater than the energy of the highest mode in the original\nsuperposition, raising questions about the conservation of energy akin to those\nthat have been raised in the study of superoscillations. An analytic derivation\nis given for the interference spectrum of a given wavefunction $\\Psi(x,t)$ with\n$N$ known zeros located at points $s_i = (x_i, t_i)$.

Specifically, the effects of simple\nspring-damper walls are contrasted with the effects of more complex walls\nincorporating tension, stiffness and anisotropy. In addition, varying mass\nratios are tested to provide insight into differences between aerodynamic and\nhydrodynamic applications. Despite the differing physical responses, all the\nwalls tested exhibit some important common features. First, the effect of the\nwalls (positive or negative) is greatest at conditions close to resonance, with\nsharp transitions in performance across the resonant frequency or phase speed.\nSecond, compliant walls are predicted to have a more pronounced effect on\nslower-moving structures because such structures generally have larger\nwall-pressure signatures. Third, two-dimensional (spanwise constant) structures\nare particularly susceptible to further amplification. These features are\nconsistent with many previous experiments and simulations, suggesting that\nmitigating the rise of such two-dimensional structures is essential to\ndesigning performance-improving walls. For instance, it is shown that further\namplification of such large-scale two-dimensional structures explains why the\noptimal anisotropic walls identified by Fukagata et al. via DNS (J.

The above observations\nare used to develop design and methodology guidelines for future research on\ncompliant walls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 00:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

Its physical origin lies in the kpc-scale interaction of AGN jets\nwith the intracluster medium. Large-scale jet simulations often initiate light\ninternally-supersonic jets with density contrast $0.01<\\eta<1$. Here we argue\nfor the first time for the importance of very-light ($\\eta<0.01$)\ninternally-subsonic jets. We investigated the shapes of young X-ray cavities\nproduced in a suite of hydrodynamic simulations, and found that bottom-wide\ncavities are always produced by internally-subsonic jets, while\ninternally-supersonic jets inflate cylindrical, center-wide, or top-wide\ncavities. We found examples of real cavities with shapes analogous to those\ninflated in our simulations by internally-subsonic and internally-supersonic\njets, suggesting a dichotomy of AGN jets according to their internal Mach\nnumbers. We further studied the long-term cavity evolution, and found that old\ncavities resulted from light jets spread along the jet direction, while those\nproduced by very light jets are significantly elongated along the perpendicular\ndirection. The northwestern ghost cavity in Perseus is pancake-shaped,\nproviding tentative evidence for the existence of very light jets. Our\nsimulations show that very-light internally-subsonic jets decelerate faster and\nrise much slower in the ICM than light internally-supersonic jets, possibly\ndepositing a larger fraction of jet energy to cluster cores and alleviating the\nproblem of low coupling efficiencies found previously. The internal Mach number\npoints to the jet's energy content, and internally-subsonic jets are\nenergetically dominated by non-kinetic energy, such as thermal energy, cosmic\nrays, or magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 02:25:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 15:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

Specifically, just as the Harper Identity provides a recipe for\ndefining the belief set resulting from contracting A in terms of (i) the\ninitial belief set and (ii) the belief set resulting from revision by not-A, we\nlook at ways to define the plausibility ordering over worlds resulting from\ncontracting A in terms of (iii) the initial plausibility ordering, and (iv) the\nplausibility ordering resulting from revision by not-A. After noting that the\nmost straightforward such extension leads to a trivialisation of the space of\npermissible orderings, we provide a family of operators for combining\nplausibility orderings that avoid such a result. These operators are\ncharacterised in our domain of interest by a pair of intuitively compelling\nproperties, which turn out to enable the derivation of a number of iterated\ncontraction postulates from postulates for iterated revision.

We identify that an information\ndissemination technique that exploits the throwbox infrastructure can cover\nonly a fixed number of popular places irrespective of the time spent.

Many molecular\nline observations toward young stellar objects indicate that radial\ndistributions of the specific angular momentum $j$ are more or less universal.\nIn small scales, typically $R\\lesssim$ 100 AU, the specific angular momenta\ndistribute like $j\\propto r^{1/2}$, indicating existence of rotationally\nsupported disk. In outer regions, $R\\gtrsim$ 5000 AU, $j$ increases as the\nradius increases and the slope is steeper than unity, which is supposed to\nreflect the original angular momentum distributions in the maternal molecular\nclouds. And lastly there is a connecting region, 100 AU $\\lesssim R \\lesssim$\n5000 AU, in which $j$-distribution looks almost flat. While this is often\ninterpreted as a consequence of conservation of the specific angular momentum,\nit actually is insufficient and requires a stronger condition that the initial\ndistribution of $j$ must be spatially uniform. However, this requirement is\nunrealistic and inconsistent with observations. In this work, we propose a\nsimple alternative explanation; the flat $j$ profile is produced by strong\nprolongation due to the large velocity gradient in the accreting flow no matter\nwhat the initial $j$ distribution is. We provide a simple analytic model for\ngravitational collapse of molecular clouds. This model can be used to estimate\nages of protostars based solely on the observed rotation profile.

The locations\nof dimming are sometimes considered to map footpoints of the erupting flux\nrope. As the emitting material expands in the corona, the decreased plasma\ndensity leads to reduced emission observed in spectral and irradiance\nmeasurements. Therefore, signatures of dimming may reflect properties of CMEs\nin the early phase of its eruption. In this study, we analyze the event of\nflare, CME, and coronal dimming on December 26, 2011. We use the data from the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on Solar Dynamics Observatories (SDO) for\ndisk observations of the dimming, and analyze images taken by EUVI, COR1, and\nCOR2 onboard the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatories to obtain the height\nand velocity of the associated CMEs observed at the limb. We also measure\nmagnetic reconnection rate from flare observations. Dimming occurs in a few\nlocations next to the flare ribbons, and it is observed in multiple EUV\npassbands. Rapid dimming starts after the onset of fast reconnection and CME\nacceleration, and its evolution well tracks the CME height and flare\nreconnection. The spatial distribution of dimming exhibits cores of deep\ndimming with a rapid growth, and their light curves are approximately linearly\nscaled with the CME height profile. From the dimming analysis, we infer the\nprocess of the CME expansion, and estimate properties of the CME.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 06:46:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

For a number of reasons, one often seeks an\napproximation whose rows are sampled from those of $A$. Row sampling improves\ninterpretability, saves space when $A$ is sparse, and preserves row structure,\nwhich is especially important, for example, when $A$ represents a graph.\n  However, correctly sampling rows from $A$ can be costly when the matrix is\nlarge and cannot be stored and processed in memory. Hence, a number of recent\npublications focus on row sampling in the streaming setting, using little more\nspace than what is required to store the outputted approximation [KL13,\nKLM+14].\n  Inspired by a growing body of work on online algorithms for machine learning\nand data analysis, we extend this work to a more restrictive online setting: we\nread rows of $A$ one by one and immediately decide whether each row should be\nkept in the spectral approximation or discarded, without ever retracting these\ndecisions.

In this\narticle, we reanalyze the viability of secular GI by adopting the physical\nvalues inferred from the observations. We derive the radial distributions of\nthe most unstable wavelength and the growth timescale of secular GI and verify\nthat secular GI can form the ring structures observed in HL Tau. When a\nturbulent viscosity coefficient $\\alpha$ remains small in inner region of the\ndisk, secular GI grows in the whole disk. Thus, the formation of planetary mass\nobjects should occur first in the inner region as a result of gravitational\nfragmentation after the non-linear growth of secular GI. In this case,\nresulting objects are expected to create the gaps at $r$ ~ 10 AU and ~ 30 AU.\nAs a result, all ring structures in HL Tau can be created by secular GI. If\nthis scenario is realized in HL Tau, the outer region corresponds to the\nearlier growth phase of the most unstable mode of secular GI, and the inner\nregion corresponds to the outcome of the non-linear growth of secular GI.\nTherefore, this interpretation suggests that we are possibly witnessing both\nthe beginning and end of planet formation in HL Tau.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 07:13:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jul 2016 13:02:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Sep 2016 06:46:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

The liquid is a sparsely interconnected huge recurrent network of\nspiking neurons. The proposed learning rule is inspired from structural\nplasticity and trains the liquid through formation and elimination of synaptic\nconnections. Hence, the learning involves rewiring of the reservoir connections\nsimilar to structural plasticity observed in biological neural networks. The\nnetwork connections can be stored as a connection matrix and updated in memory\nby using Address Event Representation (AER) protocols which are generally\nemployed in neuromorphic systems. On investigating the 'pairwise separation\nproperty' we find that trained liquids provide 1.36 $\\pm$ 0.18 times more\ninter-class separation while retaining similar intra-class separation as\ncompared to random liquids. Moreover, analysis of the 'linear separation\nproperty' reveals that trained liquids are 2.05 $\\pm$ 0.27 times better than\nrandom liquids. Furthermore, we show that our liquids are able to retain the\n'generalization' ability and 'generality' of random liquids.

Although the duration of the planetary signal for this\nevent was one of the shortest seen for a planetary event, the anomaly was well\ncovered thanks to high cadence observations taken by the survey groups OGLE and\nMOA. By analyzing the light curve, this planetary system is found to have a\nmass ratio $q=(1.58\\pm0.15)\\times10^{-3}$.

However, recent observations, such as the\ntemperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, the\nmotion of galaxies in the universe, the polarization of quasars and the\nacceleration of the cosmic expansion, indicate preferred directions in the sky.\nIf these directions have a cosmological origin, the cosmological principle\nwould be violated, and modern cosmology should be reconsidered.

In addition, the\npreferred directions in the velocity flows, quasar alignment, anisotropy of the\ncosmic acceleration, the handedness of spiral galaxies, and the angular\ndistribution of the fine-structure constant are also claimed to be aligned with\nthe CMB kinematic dipole. Since CMB dipole was confirmed to be caused by the\nmotion of our local group of galaxies relative to the reference frame of the\nCMB, the coincidence of all these preferred directions hints that these\nanomalies have a common origin, which is not cosmological or due to a\ngravitational effect.

Global behaviors generally emerge\nfrom the interplay between the structure of the interconnection topology and\nthe local agents' interactions. We focus on the Linear Threshold Model (LTM) of\ncascades first introduced by Granovetter (1978). This can be interpreted as the\nbest response dynamics in a network game whereby agents choose strategically\nbetween two actions and their payoff is an increasing function of the number of\ntheir neighbors choosing the same action. Each agent is equipped with an\nindividual threshold representing the number of her neighbors who must have\nadopted a certain action for that to become the agent's best response. We\nanalyze the LTM dynamics on large-scale networks with heterogeneous agents.\nThrough a local mean-field approach, we obtain a nonlinear, one-dimensional,\nrecursive equation that approximates the evolution of the LTM dynamics on most\nof the networks of a given size and distribution of degrees and thresholds.\nSpecifically, we prove that, on all but a fraction of networks with given\ndegree and threshold statistics that is vanishing as the network size grows\nlarge, the actual fraction of adopters of a given action in the LTM dynamics is\narbitrarily close to the output of the aforementioned recursion. We then\nanalyze the dynamic behavior of this recursion and its bifurcations from a\ndynamical systems viewpoint.

We analyze the effects of flattening on the\nannihilation (J) and decay (D) factors of dwarf spheroidal galaxies with both\nanalytic and numerical methods. Flattening has two consequences: first, there\nis a geometric effect as the squeezing (or stretching) of the dark matter\ndistribution enhances (or diminishes) the J-factor; second, the line of sight\nvelocity dispersion of stars must hold up the flattened baryonic component in\nthe flattened dark matter halo. We provide analytic formulae and a simple\nnumerical approach to estimate the correction to the J- and D-factors required\nover simple spherical modeling. The formulae are validated with a series of\nequilibrium models of flattened stellar distributions embedded in flattened\ndark-matter distributions. We compute corrections to the J- and D-factors for\nthe Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies under the assumption that they are all\nprolate or all oblate and find that the hierarchy of J-factors for the dwarf\nspheroidals is slightly altered (typical correction factors for an ellipticity\nof $0.4$ are $0.75$ for the oblate case and $1.6$ for the prolate case).

Recently, Chan (2013) showed\nthat the reversible pebble game number of any DAG is the same as its\nDymond-Tompa pebble number and Raz-Mckenzie pebble number.\n  We show, as our main result, that for any rooted directed tree T, its\nreversible pebble game number is always just one more than the edge rank\ncoloring number of the underlying undirected tree U of T. It is known that\ngiven a DAG G as input, determining its reversible pebble game number is\nPSPACE-hard. Our result implies that the reversible pebble game number of trees\ncan be computed in polynomial time.\n  We also address the question of finding the number of steps required to\noptimally pebble various families of trees. It is known that trees can be\npebbled in $n^{O(\\log(n))}$ steps where $n$ is the number of nodes in the tree.\nUsing the equivalence between reversible pebble game and the Dymond-Tompa\npebble game (Chan, 2013), we show that complete binary trees can be pebbled in\n$n^{O(\\log\\log(n))}$ steps, a substantial improvement over the naive upper\nbound of $n^{O(\\log(n))}$. It remains open whether complete binary trees can be\npebbled in polynomial (in $n$) number of steps. Towards this end, we show that\nalmost optimal (i.e., within a factor of $(1 + \\epsilon)$ for any constant\n$\\epsilon > 0$) pebblings of complete binary trees can be done in polynomial\nnumber of steps.\n  We also show a time-space trade-off for reversible pebbling for families of\nbounded degree trees by a divide-and-conquer approach: for any constant\n$\\epsilon > 0$, such families can be pebbled using $O(n^\\epsilon)$ pebbles in\n$O(n)$ steps. This generalizes an analogous result of Kralovic (2001) for\nchains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 10:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

The first topology consists of a single bottleneck\nrouter, and the second consists of two distinct sets of TCP flows, regulated by\ntwo edge routers, feeding into a common core router. We focus on some dynamical\nand statistical properties of the underlying system. From a dynamical\nperspective, we develop fluid models in a regime wherein the number of flows is\nlarge, bandwidth-delay product is high, buffers are dimensioned small\n(independent of the bandwidth-delay product) and routers deploy a Drop-Tail\nqueue policy. A detailed local stability analysis for these models yields the\nfollowing key insight: smaller buffers favour stability. Additionally, we\nhighlight that larger buffers, in addition to increasing latency, are prone to\ninducing limit cycles in the system dynamics, via a Hopf bifurcation. These\nlimit cycles in turn cause synchronisation among the TCP flows, and also result\nin a loss of link utilisation. For the topologies considered, we also\nempirically analyse some statistical properties of the bottleneck queues. These\nstatistical analyses serve to validate an important modelling assumption: that\nin the regime considered, each bottleneck queue may be approximated as either\nan $M/M/1/B$ or an $M/D/1/B$ queue. This immediately makes the modelling\nperspective attractive and the analysis tractable.

This part of the SP theory -- \"SP-neural\" -- is a tentative\nand partial model for the representation and processing of knowledge in the\nbrain. In the SP theory (apart from SP-neural), all kinds of knowledge are\nrepresented with \"patterns\", where a pattern is an array of atomic symbols in\none or two dimensions. In SP-neural, the concept of a \"pattern\" is realised as\nan array of neurons called a \"pattern assembly\", similar to Hebb's concept of a\n\"cell assembly\" but with important differences. Central to the processing of\ninformation in the SP system is the powerful concept of \"multiple alignment\",\nborrowed and adapted from bioinformatics. Processes such as pattern\nrecognition, reasoning and problem solving are achieved via the building of\nmultiple alignments, while unsupervised learning -- significantly different\nfrom the \"Hebbian\" kinds of learning -- is achieved by creating patterns from\nsensory information and also by creating patterns from multiple alignments in\nwhich there is a partial match between one pattern and another.

A generation-based strategy is employed in which source packets are\ngrouped into overlapping subsets called generations. RLNC is performed only\namongst packets belonging to the same generation throughout the network so that\nsparseness can be maintained. In this paper, generation-based network codes\nwith low reception overheads and decoding costs are designed for transmitting\nof the order of $10^2$-$10^3$ source packets. A low-complexity\noverhead-optimized decoder is proposed that exploits \"overlaps\" between\ngenerations.

Step-by-step assembly promises an interesting\nhandle on the emergence of quantum collective behavior as one goes from one, to\nfew, to many constituents. To achieve this, one must however maintain the\nability to tune and measure local properties as the system size increases.\nHere, we use low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy to construct arrays\nof magnetic atoms on a surface, designed to behave like spin-1/2 XXZ Heisenberg\nchains in a transverse field, for which a quantum phase transition from an\nantiferromagnetic to a paramagnetic phase is predicted in the thermodynamic\nlimit.

The observations were interpreted using a\ngas-grain chemistry model combined with radiative transfer calculations. The\nchemistry model distinguishes between the different nuclear spin states of\nlight hydrogen molecules, ammonia, and their deuterated forms. High deuterium\nfractionation ratios with NH2D/NH3=0.4, NHD2/NH2D=0.2, and ND3/NHD2=0.06 were\nfound in the core. The observed ortho/para ratios of NH2D and NHD2 are close to\nthe corresponding nuclear spin statistical weights. The chemistry model can\napproximately reproduce the observed abundances, but predicts uniformly too low\northo/para-NH2D, and too large ortho/para-NHD2 ratios. The longevity of N2H+\nand NH3 in dense gas, which is prerequisite to their strong deuteration, can be\nattributed to the chemical inertia of N2 on grain surfaces. The discrepancies\nbetween the chemistry model and the observations are likely to be caused by the\nfact that the model assumes complete scrambling in principal gas-phase\ndeuteration reactions of ammonia, which means that all the nuclei are mixed in\nreactive collisions. If, instead, these reactions occur through proton\nhop/hydrogen abstraction processes, statistical spin ratios are to be expected.\nThe present results suggest that while the deuteration of ammonia changes with\nphysical conditions and time, the nuclear spin ratios of ammonia isotopologues\ndo not probe the evolutionary stage of a cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 14:44:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 12:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

This\ntopological theory can be readily extended to periodically-driven systems. In\nthe limit of fast driving, the topology of the system can still be captured by\nthe topological invariants used to describe static systems. In the limit of\nslow driving, however, situations can arise where standard topological\ninvariants are zero, but yet, topologically protected edge modes are still\nobserved. These \"anomalous\" topological edge modes have no static analogue, and\nare associated with a distinct topological invariant, which takes into account\nthe full time-evolution over a driving period.

Moreover, due to the absence of a length scale in 2 of its\ndimensions, it can outperform higher dimensional crystals on some measures.\nThis includes allowing only negative refraction over large frequency ranges and\nserving as a near-omnidirectional high-pass filter up to a large frequency\nvalue. First we provide a theoretical discussion on the salient characteristics\nof the dispersion relation of a laminate and formulate the solution of an\ninterface problem by the application of the normal mode decomposition\ntechnique. We present a methodology with which to induce a pure negative\nrefraction in the laminate. As a corollary to our approach of negative\nrefraction, we show how the laminate can be used to steer beams over large\nangles for small changes in the incident angles (beam steering). Furthermore,\nwe clarify how the transmitted modes in the laminate can be switched on and off\nby varying the angle of the incident wave by a small amount. Finally, we show\nthat the laminate can be used as a remarkably efficient high-pass frequency\nfilter. An appropriately designed laminate will reflect all plane waves from\nquasi-static to a large frequency, incident at it from all angles except for a\nsmall set of near-normal incidences. This will be true even if the homogeneous\nmedium is impedance matched with the laminate. Due to the similarities between\nSH waves and EM waves it is expected that some or all of these results may also\napply to EM waves in a layered periodic dielectric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 15:45:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

As in the case of accelerators with Siberian snakes, the\nspin tune is energy independent but is equal to zero instead of one half. The\nfigure-8 topology eliminates the effect of arcs on the spin motion. There\nappears a unique opportunity to control the polarization of any particle\nspecies including deuterons, using longitudinal fields of small integrated\nstrength (weak solenoids). Contrary to existing schemes, using weak solenoids\nin figure-8 colliders, one can control the polarization at the interaction\npoints without essentially any effect on the beam's orbital characteristics. A\nuniversal scheme for control of the polarization using weak solenoids provides\nan elegant solution to the problem of ion acceleration completely eliminating\nresonant beam depolarization. It allows one to easily adjust the polarization\nin any direction at any orbital location, which becomes necessary when\ntransferring the beam from one ring into another or when measuring the\npolarization by polarimeters. It also allows for an easy manipulation of the\nspin direction at an interaction point during an experiment. The latter feature\nallows one to set up a spin-flipping system with a spin reversal time of less\nthan a second. By compensating the coherent part of the zero-integer spin\nresonance strength, which arises due to errors in alignment of the magnetic\nelement of the lattice, one can reduce the field integrals of the control\nsolenoids by a few orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 15:50:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}
