The comparison of low- and mid-$J$ CO rotational\nlines is a powerful tool to assess the temperature gradient in the warm\nmolecular layer of disks. Spectrally resolved high-$J$ ($J_{\\rm u} > 14$) CO\nlines probe intermediate distances and heights from the star that are not\nsampled by (sub-)millimeter CO spectroscopy. This paper presents new {\\it\nHerschel}/HIFI and archival PACS observations of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and \\cii\n\\ emission in 4 Herbig AeBe (HD 100546, HD 97048, IRS 48, HD 163296) and 3 T\nTauri (AS 205, S CrA, TW Hya) disks. In the case of the T Tauri systems AS 205\nand S CrA, the CO emission has a single-peaked profile, likely due to a slow\nwind. For all other systems, the {\\it Herschel} CO spectra are consistent with\npure disk emission and the spectrally-resolved lines (HIFI) and the CO\nrotational ladder (PACS) are analyzed simultaneously assuming power-law\ntemperature and column density profiles, using the velocity profile to locate\nthe emission in the disk. The temperature profile varies substantially from\ndisk to disk. In particular, $T_{\\rm gas}$ in the disk surface layers can\ndiffer by up to an order of magnitude among the 4 Herbig AeBe systems with HD\n100546 being the hottest and HD 163296 the coldest disk of the sample.

Previous studies have led to the\nconclusion that the internal structure of Spica's primary star may be more\ncentrally condensed than predicted by theoretical models of single stars,\nraising the possibility that the interactions could lead to effects that are\ncurrently neglected in structure and evolution calculations. The key parameters\nin confirming this result are the values of the orbital eccentricity $e$, the\napsidal period $U$, and the primary star's radius, R_1. We analyze the impact\nthat line profile variability has on the derivation of its orbital elements and\nR_1. We use high SNR observations obtained in 2000, 2008, and 2013 to derive\nthe orbital elements from fits to the radial velocity curves. We produce\nsynthetic line profiles using an ab initio tidal interaction model. Results:\nThe variations in the line profiles can be understood in terms of the tidal\nflows, whose large-scale structure is relatively fixed in the rotating binary\nsystem reference frame. Fits to the radial velocity curves yield\n$e$=0.108$\\pm$0.014. However, the analogous RV curves from theoretical line\nprofiles indicate that the distortion in the lines causes the fitted value of\n$e$ to depend on the argument of periastron; i.e., on the epoch of observation.\nAs a result, the actual value of $e$ may be as high as 0.125. We find that\n$U$=117.9$\\pm$1.8, which is in agreement with previous determinations. Using\nthe value $R_1=6.8 R_\\odot$ derived by Palate et al. (2013) the value of the\nobservational internal structure constant $k_{2,obs}$ is consistent with\ntheory.

Ultracold atomic\ngases in optical lattices are promising new platforms for topological states of\nmatter, though the observation of edge states has so far been restricted in\nthese systems to the state space imposed by the internal atomic structure.

Given the complexity of jet-star interactions, the\nproperties of the resulting emission are strongly linked to those of the\nemitting flows. We simulate the interaction between a stellar wind and a\nrelativistic extragalactic jet and use the hydrodynamic results to compute the\nNT emission under different conditions. We perform relativistic axisymmetric\nhydrodynamical simulations of a relativistic jet interacting with a supersonic,\nnon-relativistic stellar wind. We compute the corresponding streamlines out of\nthe simulation results, and calculate the injection, evolution, and emission of\nNT particles accelerated in the jet shock, focusing on electrons or\n$e^\\pm$-pairs. Several cases are explored, considering different jet-star\ninteraction locations, magnetic fields and observer lines of sight. The jet\nluminosity and star properties are fixed, but the results are easily scalable\nunder changes of these parameters. Individual jet-star interactions produce\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) emission that peaks from X-rays to MeV\nenergies (depending on the magnetic field), and at $\\sim 100-1000$ GeV\n(depending on the stellar type), respectively. The radiation spectrum is hard\nin the scenarios explored here due to non-radiative cooling dominance, as\nlow-energy electrons are efficiently advected even under relatively high\nmagnetic fields. Interactions of jets with cold stars lead to an even harder IC\nspectrum because of the Klein-Nishina effect in the cross-section. Doppler\nboosting has a strong impact on the observer luminosity. The emission levels\nfor individual interactions found here are in the line of previous, more\napproximate, estimates, strengthening the hypothesis that collective jet-star\ninteractions could significantly contribute at high energies under efficient\nparticle acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2016 16:38:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 10:44:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 09:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-16"}

First, in the context of population genetics, we show that a\nhorizontally-transmissible element that increases fitness, such as viral DNA,\nspreads superexponentially through a population, more quickly than a beneficial\nmutation.

It can also be used to\npredict new functional interactions between cancer driving genes and uncover\nnovel cancer drivers. Currently, most of mutual exclusivity analyses are\npreformed focusing on a limited set of genes in part due to the computational\ncost required to rigorously compute p-values. To reduce the computing cost and\nperform less restricted mutual exclusivity analysis, we developed an efficient\nmethod to estimate p-values while controlling the mutation rates of individual\npatients and genes similar to the permutation test. A comprehensive mutual\nexclusivity analysis allowed us to uncover mutually exclusive pairs, some of\nwhich may have relatively low mutation rates. These pairs often included likely\ncancer drivers that have been missed in previous analyses. More importantly,\nour results demonstrated that mutual exclusivity can also provide information\nthat goes beyond the interactions between cancer drivers and can, for example,\nelucidate different mutagenic processes in different cancer groups. In\nparticular, including frequently mutated, long genes such as TTN in our\nanalysis allowed us to observe interesting patterns of APOBEC activity in\nbreast cancer and identify a set of related driver genes that are highly\npredictive of patient survival. In addition, we utilized our mutual exclusivity\nanalysis in support of a previously proposed model where APOBEC activity is the\nunderlying process that causes TP53 mutations in a subset of breast cancer\ncases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2016 18:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-08"}

Agents that operate in this environment intend to select\nactions that are feasible for all times while minimizing the cost's time\naverage. Such action is said optimal and can be computed offline if the cost\nand the environment are known a priori. An online policy is one that depends\ncausally on the cost and the environment. To compare online policies to the\noptimal offline action define the fit of a trajectory as a vector that\nintegrates the constraint violations over time and its regret as the cost\ndifference with the optimal action accumulated over time. Fit measures the\nextent to which an online policy succeeds in learning feasible actions while\nregret measures its success in learning optimal actions. This paper proposes\nthe use of online policies computed from a saddle point controller which are\nshown to have fit and regret that are either bounded or grow at a sublinear\nrate.

Contemporary\nmobile operating systems fail to prevent such misuse of I/O devices by\nauthorized apps due to lack of binding between users' interactions and accesses\nto I/O devices performed by these apps. In this paper, we propose Aware, a\nsecurity framework for authorizing app requests to perform operations using I/O\ndevices, which binds app requests with user intentions to make all uses of\ncertain I/O devices explicit. We evaluate our defense mechanisms through\nlaboratory-based experimentation and a user study, involving 74 human subjects,\nwhose ability to identify undesired operations targeting I/O devices increased\nsignificantly.

Given a set of\ndata points, the goal of SNN is to design a data structure that, given a\ncollection of queries, finds a collection of close points that are compatible\nwith each other. Formally, we are given $k$ query points $Q=q_1,\\cdots,q_k$,\nand a compatibility graph $G$ with vertices in $Q$, and the goal is to return\ndata points $p_1,\\cdots,p_k$ that minimize (i) the weighted sum of the\ndistances from $q_i$ to $p_i$ and (ii) the weighted sum, over all edges $(i,j)$\nin the compatibility graph $G$, of the distances between $p_i$ and $p_j$. The\nproblem has several applications, where one wants to return a set of consistent\nanswers to multiple related queries. This generalizes well-studied\ncomputational problems, including NN, Aggregate NN and the 0-extension problem.\n  In this paper we propose and analyze the following general two-step method\nfor designing efficient data structures for SNN. In the first step, for each\nquery point $q_i$ we find its (approximate) nearest neighbor point $\\hat{p}_i$;\nthis can be done efficiently using existing approximate nearest neighbor\nstructures. In the second step, we solve an off-line optimization problem over\nsets $q_1,\\cdots,q_k$ and $\\hat{p}_1,\\cdots,\\hat{p}_k$; this can be done\nefficiently given that $k$ is much smaller than $n$. Even though\n$\\hat{p}_1,\\cdots,\\hat{p}_k$ might not constitute the optimal answers to\nqueries $q_1,\\cdots,q_k$, we show that, for the unweighted case, the resulting\nalgorithm is $O(\\log k/\\log \\log k)$-approximation. Also, we show that the\napproximation factor can be in fact reduced to a constant for compatibility\ngraphs frequently occurring in practice.\n  Finally, we show that the \"empirical approximation factor\" provided by the\nabove approach is very close to 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2016 22:31:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-11"}

In this paper we first point out that the set of\ndistributions should be chosen to be appropriate for the application at hand,\nand that some of the choices that have been popular until recently are, for\nmany applications, not good choices. We next consider sets of distributions\nthat are within a chosen Wasserstein distance from a nominal distribution. Such\na choice of sets has two advantages: (1) The resulting distributions hedged\nagainst are more reasonable than those resulting from other popular choices of\nsets. (2) The problem of determining the worst-case expectation over the\nresulting set of distributions has desirable tractability properties. We derive\na strong duality reformulation of the corresponding DRSO problem and construct\napproximate worst-case distributions explicitly via the first-order optimality\nconditions of the dual problem.\n  Our contributions are four-fold. (i) We identify necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the existence of a worst-case distribution, which are naturally\nrelated to the growth rate of the objective function. (ii) We show that the\nworst-case distributions resulting from an appropriate Wasserstein distance\nhave a concise structure and a clear interpretation. (iii) Using this\nstructure, we show that data-driven DRSO problems can be approximated to any\naccuracy by robust optimization problems, and thereby many DRSO problems become\ntractable by using tools from robust optimization. (iv) Our strong duality\nresult holds in a very general setting. As examples, we show that it can be\napplied to infinite-dimensional process control and intensity estimation for\npoint processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2016 00:11:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Jul 2016 13:50:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 22:39:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

The classical dual\ngradient algorithm is an example of Lagrangian dual type methods and has\nconvergence rate $O(1/\\sqrt{t})$. Recently, a new Lagrangian dual type\nalgorithm with faster $O(1/t)$ convergence is proposed in Yu and Neely (2015).\nHowever, if the objective or constraint functions are not separable, each\niteration of the Lagrangian dual type method in Yu and Neely (2015) requires to\nsolve a large scale unconstrained convex program, which can have huge\ncomplexity. This paper proposes a new primal-dual type algorithm, which only\ninvolves simple gradient updates at each iteration and has the $O(1/t)$\nconvergence rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2016 03:25:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-02"}

This process is accelerated by the\nnoise-induced dephasing through a variant of the quantum Zeno effect, without\nsacrificing the coherence of the entangled state. Our finding brings insight\ninto the spin dynamics in open quantum systems coupled to noisy environments,\nopening an avenue to quantum state manipulation utilizing decoherence effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2016 05:50:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 13:35:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-01"}

For this, alap and bandish parts of two\ndifferent Ragas sung by the four artists were analyzed with the help of non\nlinear multifractal analysis (MFDFA) technique. The multifractal spectral width\nobtained from the MFDFA method gives an estimate of the complexity of the\nsignal. The observations from the variation of spectral width give a cue\ntowards the scientific recognition of Guru-Shisya Parampara (teacher-student\ntradition) - a hitherto much-heard philosophical term. From a quantitative\napproach this study succeeds in analyzing the evolution of singing styles\nwithin a particular Gharana over generations of artists as well as the effect\nof globalization in the field of classical music.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2016 07:20:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 08:44:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 May 2021 17:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

Below the breaking energy, the Band function\nreduces to a cut-off power law, while above the breaking energy it is a simple\npower law. However, for some detectors (such as the Swift-BAT) whose working\nenergy is well below or just near the breaking energy, the observed spectra can\nbe fitted to cut-off power law with enough precision. Besides, since the energy\nband of Swift-BAT is very narrow, the spectra of most GRBs can be fitted well\neven using a simple power law. In this paper, with the most up-to-date sample\nof Swift-BAT GRBs, we study the effect of different spectral models on the\nempirical luminosity correlations, and further investigate the effect on the\nreconstruction of GRB Hubble diagram. We mainly focus on two luminosity\ncorrelations, i.e., the Amati relation and Yonetoku relation. We calculate\nthese two luminosity correlations on both the case that the GRB spectra are\nmodeled by Band function and cut-off power law. It is found that both\nluminosity correlations only moderately depend on the choice of GRB spectra.\nMonte Carlo simulations show that Amati relation is insensitive to the\nhigh-energy power-law index of the Band function. As a result, the GRB Hubble\ndiagram calibrated using luminosity correlations is almost independent on the\nGRB spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2016 09:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

In this\npaper, we perform large scale investigations of the QWERTY effect on the web.\nUsing data from eleven web platforms related to products, movies, books, and\nvideos, we conduct observational tests whether a hand-meaning relationship can\nbe found in decoding text on the web.

In these cases,\nstandard reconstruction methods tend to produce artifacts that can make further\nanalysis difficult. Advanced regularized iterative methods, such as total\nvariation minimization, are often able to achieve a higher reconstruction\nquality by exploiting prior knowledge about the scanned object. In practice,\nhowever, these methods often have prohibitively long computation times or large\nmemory requirements. Furthermore, since they are based on minimizing a global\nobjective function, regularized iterative methods need to reconstruct the\nentire scanned object, even when one is only interested in a (small) region of\nthe reconstructed image.\n  In this paper, we present a method to approximate regularized iterative\nreconstruction methods inside a (small) region of the scanned object. The\nmethod only performs computations inside the region of interest, ensuring low\ncomputational requirements. Reconstruction results for different phantom images\nand types of regularization are given, showing that reconstructions of the\nproposed local method are almost identical to those of the global regularized\niterative methods that are approximated, even for relatively small regions of\ninterest. Furthermore, we show that larger regions can be reconstructed\nefficiently by reconstructing several small regions in parallel and combining\nthem into a single reconstruction afterwards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2016 10:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-11"}

The decoders' objective is to\nrecover a function of the source and the side information.

But the\nimplied new physics (NP) patterns in $\\Delta F=1$ observables depend\nsensitively on the value of $|V_{cb}|$. Concentrating the analysis on three 331\nmodels that have been selected by us previously on the basis of their\nperformance in electroweak precision tests and $\\varepsilon^\\prime/\\varepsilon$\nwe illustrate this for $|V_{cb}|=0.042$ and $|V_{cb}|=0.040$.

NP\neffects in $B_s\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ and in the Wilson coefficient $C_9$ are\nsignificantly larger in all three models for the case of $|V_{cb}|=0.040$.

The density-matching technique for\noptimization under uncertainty was applied to this problem. This involved RANS\nand adjoint flow solves of a full fan stage carried out at two different\nleakage conditions. Here a detailed analysis of the fan stage aerodynamics is\ncarried out to determine why exactly the new design is more insensitive to the\neffects of leakage flows. Specifically, it is shown that this insensitivity is\nattributed to three main factors: a slight rearward shift in loading, and thus\na reduction in incidence; a reduction in the cross-passage pressure gradient;\nand a re-acceleration of the flow towards the trailing edge, which prevented\nany corner separation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2016 13:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-11"}

In that case, for little viscous\nsamples ($\\eta_0 <\\sim 30$ mPa.s), the maximal expansion of the sheet,\n$d_{\\rm{max}}$, is independent of $\\eta_0$, whereas for more viscous samples,\n$d_{\\rm{max}}$ decreases as $\\eta_0$ increases. We provide a simple model to\naccount for the dependence of the maximal expansion of the sheet with the\nviscosity that is based on an energy balance between inertia, surface tension\nand viscous shear dissipation on the solid target, and which accounts well for\nour experimental data. By contrast, when $\\tau$ is longer than the typical\nlifetime of the sheet, the behavior drastically differs. The sheet expansion is\nstrongly enhanced as compared to that of viscous samples with comparable\nzero-shear viscosity, but is heterogeneous with the occurrence of cracks,\nrevealing the elastic nature of the viscoelastic fluid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2016 14:28:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2017 08:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-05"}

This model generalizes the packet erasure model studied in\nliterature for wireless broadcast channels. For \"state-dependent Gaussian\"\nwireless broadcast channels, we propose an achievability scheme based on a\nmulti-layer wiretap code. Finding the best achievable secret key generation\nrate leads to solving a non-convex power allocation problem. We show that using\na dynamic programming algorithm, one can obtain the best power allocation for\nthis problem. Moreover, we prove the optimality of the proposed achievability\nscheme for the regime of high-SNR and large-dynamic range over the channel\nstates in the (generalized) degrees of freedom sense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2016 15:41:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-11"}

Now, a\nnatural question arises, how this model could explain the oscillation of\nuniverse between contraction and expansion branches? We try to address this\nissue in the framework of BIonic system. In this model, $M0$-branes join to\neach other and give rise to a pair of $M1$-anti-$M1$-branes. The fields which\nlive on these branes play the roles of massive gravitons that cause the\nemergence of a wormhole between them and formation of a BIon system. This\nwormhole dissolves into M1-branes and causes a divergence between the number of\ndegrees of freedom on the boundary surface of $M1$ and the bulk leading to an\nexpansion of $M1$-branes. When $M1$-branes become close to each other, the\nsquare energy of their system becomes negative and some tachyonic states\nemerge. To removes these states, $M1$-branes compact, the sign of compacted\ngravity changes, causing the arising of anti-gravity: in this case, branes get\naway from each other. By articulating $M1$-BIons, an M3-brane and an\nanti-$M3$-brane are created and connected by three wormholes forming an\n$M3$-BIon. This new system behaves like the initial system and by closing\nbranes to each other, they compact and, by getting away from each other, they\nopen. Our universe is located on one of these M3-branes and, by compacting\n$M3$-brane, it contracts and, by opening it, it expands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2016 08:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}
