Leptonic flavour mixing originates from the\nmisalignment of flavon vacuum expectation values which respect different\nresidual symmetries in the charged lepton and neutrino sectors. Flavon cross\ncouplings are usually forbidden, in order to protect these symmetries. Contrary\nto this approach, we show that cross couplings can play a key role and give\nraise to necessary corrections to flavour-mixing patterns, including a non-zero\nvalue for the reactor angle and CP violation. For definiteness, we present two\nmodels based on $A_4$. In the first model, all flavons are assumed to be real\nor pseudo-real, with 7 real degrees of freedom in the flavon sector in total. A\nsizable reactor angle associated with nearly maximal CP violation is achieved,\nand, as both originate from the same cross coupling, a sum rule results with a\nprecise prediction for the value of the Dirac CP-violating phase. In the second\nmodel, the flavons are taken to be complex scalars, which can be connected with\nsupersymmetric models and multi-Higgs models. The complexity properties of\nflavons provide new sources for generating the reactor angle. Models in this\nnew approach introduce very few degrees of freedom beyond the Standard Model\nand can be more economical than those in the framework of extra dimension or\nsupersymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 16:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jun 2016 13:52:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-14"}

For\nMIMO MAC/BC, the algorithm finds optimal signals to achieve the capacity region\nboundary. For interference channels with Gaussian input assumption, two of the\nprevious state-of-the-art algorithms are the WMMSE algorithm and the polite\nwater-filling (PWF) algorithm. The WMMSE algorithm is provably convergent,\nwhile the PWF algorithm takes the advantage of the optimal transmit signal\nstructure and converges the fastest in most situations but is not guaranteed to\nconverge in all situations. It is highly desirable to design an algorithm that\nhas the advantages of both algorithms. The dual link algorithm is such an\nalgorithm.

What happens when a cluster\nencounters an interface between two different environments has implications for\nits function and fate.

To each event it attributes weights: the spin\neffects of tau-lepton production or decay, or the production mechanism are\nmodified. There is no need to repeat the detector response simulation. We\ndocument the extension to 2 to 4 processes in which the matrix elements for the\nparton-parton scattering amplitudes into a tau-lepton pair and two outgoing\npartons are used. Tree-level matrix elements for the Standard Model processes,\nincluding the Higgs boson production are used. Automatically generated codes by\nMadGraph5 have been adapted. Tests of the matrix elements, reweighting\nalgorithm and numerical results are presented. For averaged tau lepton\npolarisation, we perform comparison of 2 to 2 and 2 to 4 matrix elements used\nto calculate the spin weight in pp to tau tau j j events. We show, that for\nevents with tau-lepton pair close to the Z-boson peak, the tau-lepton\npolarisation calculated using 2 to 4 matrix elements is very close to the one\ncalculated using 2 to 2 Born process only. For the m_(tautau) masses above the\nZ-boson peak, the effect from including 2 to 4 matrix elements is also\nmarginal, however when restricting into subprocesses qq,q bar q to tau tau j j\nonly, it can lead to a 10% difference on the predicted tau-lepton polarisation.\nChoice of electroweak scheme can have significant impact. The modification of\nthe electroweak or strong interaction can be performed with the re-weighting\ntechnique. TauSpinner v.2.0.0, allows to introduce non-standard couplings for\nthe Higgs boson and study their effects in the vector-boson-fusion.

In recent\nyears great progress has been made by augmenting `traditional' network theory.\nHowever, existing network representations still lack crucial features in order\nto serve as a general data analysis tool. These include, most importantly, an\nexplicit association of information with possibly heterogeneous types of\nobjects and relations, and a conclusive representation of the properties of\ngroups of nodes as well as the interactions between such groups on different\nscales. In this paper, we introduce a collection of definitions resulting in a\nframework that, on the one hand, entails and unifies existing network\nrepresentations (e.g., network of networks, multilayer networks), and on the\nother hand, generalizes and extends them by incorporating the above features.\nTo implement these features, we first specify the nodes and edges of a finite\ngraph as sets of properties. Second, the mathematical concept of partition\nlattices is transferred to network theory in order to demonstrate how\npartitioning the node and edge set of a graph into supernodes and superedges\nallows to aggregate, compute and allocate information on and between arbitrary\ngroups of nodes. The derived partition lattice of a graph, which we denote by\ndeep graph, constitutes a concise, yet comprehensive representation that\nenables the expression and analysis of heterogeneous properties, relations and\ninteractions on all scales of a complex system in a self-contained manner.\nFurthermore, to be able to utilize existing network-based methods and models,\nwe derive different representations of multilayer networks from our framework\nand demonstrate the advantages of our representation.

We cluster up to 123 million face\nimages into over 10 million clusters, and analyze the results in terms of both\nexternal cluster quality measures (known face labels) and internal cluster\nquality measures (unknown face labels) and run-time.

However, in degraded imaging conditions such as low\nlight, low texture, blur and specular reflections, feature extraction is often\nunreliable. In contrast, direct VSLAM methods which estimate the camera pose by\nminimizing the photometric error using raw pixel intensities are often more\nrobust to low textured environments and blur. Nonetheless, at the core of\ndirect VSLAM is the reliance on a consistent photometric appearance across\nimages, otherwise known as the brightness constancy assumption. Unfortunately,\nbrightness constancy seldom holds in real world applications.\n  In this work, we overcome brightness constancy by incorporating feature\ndescriptors into a direct visual odometry framework. This combination results\nin an efficient algorithm that combines the strength of both feature-based\nalgorithms and direct methods. Namely, we achieve robustness to arbitrary\nphotometric variations while operating in low-textured and poorly lit\nenvironments. Our approach utilizes an efficient binary descriptor, which we\ncall Bit-Planes, and show how it can be used in the gradient-based optimization\nrequired by direct methods. Moreover, we show that the squared Euclidean\ndistance between Bit-Planes is equivalent to the Hamming distance. Hence, the\ndescriptor may be used in least squares optimization without sacrificing its\nphotometric invariance.

The goal of lead-free bullets is\nto gain the advantages of reduced lead use in the environment while maintaining\nequal or better terminal performance. Accepting reduced terminal performance\nwould foolishly risk the lives of military and law enforcement personnel. This\npaper uses the established technique of studying bullet impacts in ballistic\ngelatin to characterize the terminal performance of eight commercial off-the-\nshelf lead-free handgun bullets for comparison with earlier analysis of\njacketed lead bullets. Peak retarding force and energy deposit in calibrated\nballistic gelatin are quantified using high speed video. The temporary stretch\ncavities and permanent wound cavities are also characterized. Two factors tend\nto reduce the terminal performance of these lead-free projectiles compared to\nsimilar jacketed lead designs. First, solid copper construction increase barrel\nfriction, which reduces muzzle velocity and energy, and thus reduces the\nability of the bullet to exert damaging forces in tissue simulant. Second, the\nlower density of copper requires a longer bullet for a given mass and caliber,\nwhich reduces remaining powder volume in the brass cartridge case, which also\ntends to reduce muzzle velocity and energy. The results of the present study\nare consistent with earlier analysis showing that expansion is necessary to\nmaximize the potential for rapid incapacitation of enemy combatants. In spite\nof some new non-expanding nose designs that moderately increase forces between\nbullet and tissue, the largest retarding forces and highest incapacitation\npotential requires expanding bullets which maximize frontal area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 19:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-05"}

This impacts studies which match\nmassive galaxies to dark matter halos. Although systematics which arise from\ndifferent treatments of the stellar population remain of order < 0.5 dex, our\nfinding that systematics in photometry now amount to only about 0.1 dex in the\nstellar mass density is a significant improvement with respect to a decade ago.\nOur results highlight the importance of using the same stellar population and\nphotometric models whenever low and high redshift samples are compared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 20:00:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2017 21:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

For low mass planetary\nsystems, multi-planet interactions play an important role in setting system\narchitecture. In this paper, we explore the stability of these high mass,\nmulti-planet systems. While empirical relationships exist that predict how\nsystem stability scales with planet spacing at low masses, we show that\nextrapolating to super-Jupiter masses can lead to up to an order of magnitude\noverestimate of stability for massive, tightly packed systems. We show that at\nboth low and high planet masses, overlapping mean motion resonances trigger\nchaotic orbital evolution, which leads to system instability. We attribute some\nof the difference in behavior as a function of mass to the increasing\nimportance of second order resonances at high planet-star mass ratios.

The\ncluster hosts a truncated cool core, with a temperature increasing from kT~1\nkeV in the core to kT~9 keV at r~30 kpc. Beyond r~30 kpc the intra-cluster\nmedium (ICM) appears remarkably isothermal. The core is dynamically disturbed\nwith multiple sloshing induced cold fronts, with indications for both\nRayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The sloshing is the result\nof the strongly perturbed gravitational potential in the cluster core, with the\ncentral brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) being displaced southward from the\nglobal center of mass. The residual image reveals a likely subcluster south of\nthe core at the projected distance of r~280 kpc. The cluster also harbors a\nlikely radio phoenix, a source revived by adiabatic compression by gas motions\nin the ICM. Even though the Ophiuchus cluster is strongly dynamically active,\nthe amplitude of density fluctuations outside of the cooling core is low,\nindicating velocities smaller than ~100 km/s. The density fluctuations might be\ndamped by thermal conduction in the hot and remarkably isothermal ICM,\nresulting in our underestimate of gas velocities. We find a surprising, sharp\nsurface brightness discontinuity, that is curved away from the core, at r~120\nkpc to the southeast of the cluster center. We conclude that this feature is\nmost likely due to gas dynamics associated with a merger and not a result of an\nextraordinary active galactic nucleus (AGN) outburst. The cooling core lacks\nany observable X-ray cavities and the AGN only displays weak, point-like radio\nemission, lacking lobes or jets, indicating that currently it may be largely\ndormant. The lack of strong AGN activity may be due to the bulk of the cooling\ntaking place offset from the central supermassive black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 20:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

In particular, the azimuthal\nvariations -- between spiral arm and interarm regions -- are analyzed without\nany explicit definition of spiral arm locations. We show that the molecular gas\nmass fraction, i.e., fmol=H2/ (HI+H2) in mass, varies predominantly in the\nradial direction: starting from ~100% at the center, remaining ~>50% (~>60%) to\nR~6kpc, and decreasing to ~10-20% (~50%) at R=8.5 kpc when averaged over the\nwhole disk thickness (in the mid plane). Azimuthal, arm-interarm variations are\nsecondary: only ~20%, in the globally molecule-dominated inner MW, but becoming\nlarger, ~40-50%, in the atom-dominated outskirts. This suggests that in the\ninner MW, the gas stays highly molecular (fmol>50%) as it goes from an interarm\nregion, into a spiral arm, and back into the next interarm region. Stellar\nfeedback does not dissociate molecules much, and the coagulation and\nfragmentation of molecular clouds dominate the evolution of the ISM at these\nradii. The trend differs in the outskirts, where the gas phase is globally\natomic (fmol<50%). The HI and H2 phases cycle through spiral arm passage there.\nThese different regimes of ISM evolution are also seen in external galaxies\n(e.g., LMC, M33, and M51).

For this purpose we use two techniques. We first\nstudy the shadow cast on the nucleus surface by the ejecta cloud and\ninvestigate how areas of different brightness are related to the varying\noptical thickness or albedo of the ejecta cloud. The shadow was seen during the\nfirst 2.0 seconds after the impact (afterward it became obscured by the ejecta\ncloud). We have found that all brightness variations in the shadow are the\nresult of the surface inhomogeneities, indicating that during first 2.0 seconds\nthe ejecta cloud was homogeneous within the MRI spatial resolution. Our second\ntechnique is to study the obscuration of the nucleus limb by the ejecta. This\nstudy covers the period 0.76- 68.8 seconds after impact and is based on\ncomparison of the ejecta cloud brightness on the limb and just beyond the limb.\nAt this stage we do see inhomogeneities in the ejecta cloud that relate to the\nalbedo and optical thickness variations in the ejected dust. Specifically, we\nhave found two distinct bands of low optical thickness and one band of a high\noptical thickness. Based on crater formation ideas we estimate the depth of\nexcavation of the ejected material for the found inhomogeneities and, thus,\ndefine a potential layering structure for the comet nucleus, Our estimates\nsuggest that the low-optical thickness material was excavated from a depth of\n15-18 and 30-32 meters in the case the porous nucleus material and 37-46 and\n87-93 meters in the case of a non-porous nucleus material, and a layer of high\noptical thickness originated from the depth 9-11 m for porous material or 20-23\nm for non-porous material. Based on the crater diameter estimates, we expect\nthat the real depth of the layers is between these two cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 21:33:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

But there is a \"dual\" progression. The notion of\na partition (or quotient set or equivalence relation) is dual (in a\ncategory-theoretic sense) to the notion of a subset. Hence the Boolean logic of\nsubsets has a dual logic of partitions.

From the analysis of\nSOAR spectroscopic data and related optical-NIR photometry, we confirm the\nexistence of several very massive stars in the periphery of NGC 3603. The first\ngroup of objects (MTT58, WR42e and RFS7) is compound by three new Galactic\nexemplars of the OIf*/WN type, all of them with probable initial masses well\nabove 100 Msun and estimated ages of about 1 Myr. Based on Goodman blue-optical\nspectrum of MTT68, we can confirm the previous finding in the NIR of the only\nother Galactic exemplar (besides HD93129A) of the O2If* type known to date.\nBased on its position relative to a set of theoretical isochrons in a\nHertzprung-Russel diagram, we concluded that the new O2If* star could be one of\nthe most massive (150 Msun) and luminous (Mv=-7.3) O-star in the Galaxy. Also,\nanother remarkable result is the discovery of a new O2V star (MTT31) that is\nthe first exemplar of the class so far identified in the Milk Way. From its\nposition in the Hertzprung-Russel diagram it is found that this new star\nprobably had an initial mass of 80 Msun, as well as an absolute magnitude\nMv=-6.0 corresponding to a luminosity similar to other known O2V stars in the\nLMC.

Indeed, It is located far to the south of the\nNGC 3603 center, in apparent isolation at a large radial projected linear\ndistance of 62 pc. Its derived luminosity is similar to that of the other\nO3.5If* (Sh18) found in the NGC 3603's innermost region.

The period of these superhumps is longer than\nthe orbital period by 6.0(1)% and can be interpreted to reflect the dynamical\nprecession rate at the 3:1 resonance for a mass ratio of 0.172(4). These\nsuperhumps smoothly evolved into those in the main superoutburst. These\nobservations provide the clearest evidence that the 3:1 resonance is triggered\nby the precursor outburst, even if it is well separated, and the resonance\neventually causes the main superoutburst as predicted by the thermal-tidal\ninstability model. The presence of superhumps well before the superoutburst\ncannot be explained by alternative models (the enhanced mass-transfer model and\nthe pure thermal instability model) and the present observations give a clear\nsupport to the thermal-tidal instability model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 01:03:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

This consideration motivates us to design a simple-but-effective\nzero-shot learning method capable of suppressing noise in the text.\n  More specifically, we propose an $l_{2,1}$-norm based objective function\nwhich can simultaneously suppress the noisy signal in the text and learn a\nfunction to match the text document and visual features.

State-of-the-art techniques, e.g,\nstochastic optimization or sampling average approximation, fail to learn\nexploitable patterns from collected data and require an excessive number of\nobjective function evaluations. There is a need for techniques that alleviate\nthe high cost of information acquisition and select sequential simulations\noptimally. In the field of deterministic single-objective unconstrained global\noptimization, the Bayesian global optimization (BGO) approach has been\nrelatively successful in addressing the information acquisition problem. BGO\nbuilds a probabilistic surrogate of the expensive objective function and uses\nit to define an information acquisition function (IAF) whose role is to\nquantify the merit of making new objective evaluations. Specifically, BGO\niterates between making the observations with the largest expected IAF and\nrebuilding the probabilistic surrogate, until a convergence criterion is met.\nIn this work, we extend the expected improvement (EI) IAF to the case of design\noptimization under uncertainty wherein the EI policy is reformulated to filter\nout parametric and measurement uncertainties. To increase the robustness of our\napproach in the low sample regime, we employ a fully Bayesian interpretation of\nGaussian processes by constructing a particle approximation of the posterior of\nits hyperparameters using adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo.

By contrast, for all nanopatterned films\n$\\rho_\\perp^-$ is nonzero in a broader temperature range below $T_c$, allowing\nus to discriminate between two contributions in $\\rho_\\perp^-$, namely one\ncontribution originating from the guided vortex motion and the other one caused\nby the Hall anomaly just as in as-grown Nb films. All four measured resistivity\ncomponents are successfully fitted to analytical expressions derived within the\nframework of a stochastic model of competing isotropic and anisotropic pinning.\nThis provides evidence of the model validity for the description of the\nresistive response of superconductor thin films with washboard pinning\nnanolandscapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 07:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

We consider this problem in an approximate\nsetting. Given an approximation parameter $\\varepsilon$, the query can be\nanswered either way if the distance from $q$ to $K$'s boundary is at most\n$\\varepsilon$ times $K$'s diameter. We assume that the dimension $d$ is fixed,\nand $K$ is presented as the intersection of $n$ halfspaces. Previous solutions\nto approximate polytope membership were based on straightforward applications\nof classic polytope approximation techniques by Dudley (1974) and Bentley et\nal. (1982). The former is optimal in the worst-case with respect to space, and\nthe latter is optimal with respect to query time.\n  We present four main results. First, we show how to combine the two above\ntechniques to obtain a simple space-time trade-off. Second, we present an\nalgorithm that dramatically improves this trade-off. In particular, for any\nconstant $\\alpha \\ge 4$, this data structure achieves query time\n$O(1/\\varepsilon^{(d-1)/\\alpha})$ and space roughly $O(1/\\varepsilon^{(d-1)(1 -\nO(\\log \\alpha)/\\alpha)})$.

Our fourth result shows\nthat it is possible to reduce approximate Euclidean nearest neighbor searching\nto approximate polytope membership queries.

If the relative uncertainties on measurements are small\nenough, uncertainties can be propagated analytically using simplifying\nassumptions, but for large normally distributed uncertainties, the probability\ndistribution of the ratio become skewed, with a modal value offset from that\nexpected in Gaussian uncertainty propagation. Furthermore, the most likely\nvalue of a ratio A/B is not equal to the reciprocal of the most likely value of\nB/A. The effect is most pronounced when the uncertainty on the denominator is\nlarger than that on the numerator.\n  We show that this effect is seen in an analysis of 12,126 spectra from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey. The intrinsically fixed ratio of the [O III] lines at\n4959 and 5007 ${\\AA}$ is conventionally expressed as the ratio of the stronger\nline to the weaker line.

Our main interest is in correlations\nbetween properties of the product of closed order intervals in C(K) and\nproperties of the underlying space K.

Amongst these\nalternatives, spintronics physics and devices have recently attracted a rapidly\nincreasing interest by exploiting the additional degree of electron's spins.\nFor example, magnetic domain-wall racetrack-memory and logic devices have been\nrealized via manipulating domain-wall motion. As compared to domain-wall based\ndevices, magnetic skyrmions have the advantages of ultra-small size (typically\n5-100 nm in diameter), facile current-driven motion, topological stability and\npeculiar emergent electrodynamics, promising for next-generation electronics\napplications in the more-than-Moore regime. In this work, a magnetic meron\ndiode, which behaves like a PN-junction diode, is demonstrated for the first\ntime, by tailoring the current-controlled unidirectional motion of edge-merons\n(i.e., fractional skyrmions) in a nanotrack with interfacial\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The working principles of the meron diode,\ntheoretically expected from the Thiele equation for topological magnetic\nobjects, are further verified by micromagnetic simulations. The present study\nreveals topology-independent transport property of magnetic objects, and is\nexpected to open the vista toward integrated composite circuitry, with unified\ndata storage and processing, based on a single magnetic chip, as the meron\ndiode can be used either, as a building block, to develop complex logic\ncomponents or, as a signal controller, to interconnect skyrmion, domain-wall,\nand even spin-wave devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 12:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-03"}

Such low Mg/Al ratios are seen only among the second-generation\npopulation of globular clusters, and are not present among Galactic disk field\nstars.

The classical \"planetesimal\" accretion scenario for the formation of\nplanets has recently evolved with the idea that \"pebbles\", centimeter- to\nmeter-sized icy grains migrating in protoplanetary disks, can control\nplanetesimal and/or planetary growth.\n  Aims. We investigate how pebble accretion depends on disk properties and\naffects the formation of planetary systems\n  Methods. We construct analytical models of pebble accretion onto planetary\nembryos that consistently account for the mass and orbital evolution of the\npebble flow and reflect disk structure.\n  Results. We derive simple formulas for pebble accretion rates in the\nso-called \"settling\" regime for planetary embryos with more than 100 km in\nsize. For relatively smaller embryos or in outer disk regions, the accretion\nmode is 3D, meaning that the thickness of the pebble flow must be taken into\naccount, and resulting in an accretion rate that is independent of the embryo\nmass. For larger embryos or in inner regions, the accretion is in a 2D mode,\ni.e., the pebble disk may be considered to be infinitely thin. We show that the\nradial dependence of the pebble accretion rata is different (even the sign of\nthe power-law exponent changes) for different disk conditions such as the disk\nheating source (viscous heating or stellar irradiation), the drag law (Stokes\nor Epstein, and weak or strong coupling), and in the 2D or 3D accretion modes.\nWe also discuss the effect of the sublimation/destruction of icy pebbles inside\nthe snow line.\n  Conclusions.

Here, we address the natural corollary question: Given\nthe best available mixer, what is the optimal initial tracer pattern that leads\nto the most homogeneous mixture after a prescribed finite time? For ideal\npassive tracers, we show that this optimal initial condition coincides with the\nright singular vector (corresponding to the smallest singular value) of a\nsuitably truncated Perron-Frobenius (PF) operator. The truncation of the PF\noperator is made under the assumption that there is a small length-scale\nthreshold $\\ell_\\nu$ under which the tracer blobs are considered, for all\npractical purposes, completely mixed. We demonstrate our results on two\nexamples: a prototypical model known as the sine flow and a direct numerical\nsimulation of two-dimensional turbulence.

For a random placement of consumers and generators on the grid,\nthe probability to find more than a certain number of unsupplied consumers\ndecays as a power law and obeys a scaling law with respect to system size.\nVarying the transmitted power threshold above which a transmission line fails\ndoes not seem to change the power law exponent $q \\approx 1.6$.

Applying the\ndynamic AC model and considering a random placement of consumers, we find that\nthe probability to disconnect more than a certain number of consumers depends\nstrongly on the threshold.
