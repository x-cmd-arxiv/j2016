In particular, I identify a gauge invariance in the\ntheory, whereby the energies associated to strain-gradient elasticity and\nflexoelectrically induced electric fields are individually reference-dependent,\nand only when summed up they yield a well-defined result.

Using a rigorous fluctuational electrodynamics approach, we predict\nthat ultra-thin films of plasmonic materials can be used to dramatically\nenhance near-field heat transfer. The total spectrally integrated film-to-film\nheat transfer is over an order of magnitude larger than between the same\nmaterials in bulk form and also exceeds the levels achievable with polar\ndielectrics such as SiC. We attribute this enhancement to the significant\nspectral broadening of radiative heat transfer due to coupling between surface\nplasmon polaritons (SPPs) on both sides of each thin film. We show that the\nradiative heat flux spectrum can be further shaped by the choice of the\nsubstrate onto which the thin film is deposited. In particular, substrates\nsupporting surface phonon polaritons (SPhP) strongly modify the heat flux\nspectrum owing to the interactions between SPPs on thin films and SPhPs of the\nsubstrate. The use of thin film phase change materials on polar dielectric\nsubstrates allows for dynamic switching of the heat flux spectrum between\nSPP-mediated and SPhP-mediated peaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 16:22:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-28"}

The presence of this minimization term is\nkey to enforcing some specific discrete choice by each individual agent. The\ntheory of mean field games is invoked to generate a class of decentralized\nagent feedback control strategies which are then shown to converge to an exact\nNash equilibrium of the game as the number of players increases to infinity.

A tensor field can be decomposed into\ncomplex-valued functions by taking contractions with tangent vectors on the\nsphere and the normal to the sphere. These component functions are usually\npresented as functions on the sphere itself, but this requires an implicit\nchoice of distinguished tangent vectors with which to contract. Thus, we may\nmore accurately say that spin-weighted spherical functions are functions of\nboth a point on the sphere and a choice of frame in the tangent space at that\npoint. The distinction becomes extremely important when transforming the\ncoordinates in which these functions are expressed, because the implicit choice\nof frame will also transform. Here, it is proposed that spin-weighted spherical\nfunctions should be treated as functions on the spin group. This approach more\ncleanly reflects the geometry involved, and allows for a more elegant\ndescription of the behavior of spin-weighted functions. In this form, the\nspin-weighted spherical harmonics have simple expressions as elements of the\nWigner $\\mathfrak{D}$ representations, and transformations under rotation are\nsimple. Two variants of the angular-momentum operator are defined directly in\nterms of the spin group; one is the standard angular-momentum operator\n$\\mathbf{L}$, while the other is shown to be related to the spin-raising\noperator $\\eth$. Computer code is also included, providing an explicit\nimplementation of the spin-weighted spherical harmonics in this form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 16:54:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 May 2016 17:56:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 13:53:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-26"}

A disadvantage of\nthis setting is that the marketer is forced to select all the seeds based\nsolely on a diffusion model. If some of the selected seeds do not perform well,\nthere is no opportunity to course-correct. A more practical setting is the\nadaptive setting in which the marketer initially selects a batch of users and\nobserves how well seeding those users leads to a diffusion of product\nadoptions. Based on this market feedback, she formulates a policy for choosing\nthe remaining seeds. In this paper, we study adaptive offline strategies for\ntwo problems: (a) MAXSPREAD -- given a budget on number of seeds and a time\nhorizon, maximize the spread of influence and (b) MINTSS -- given a time\nhorizon and an expected number of target users to be influenced, minimize the\nnumber of seeds that will be required. In particular, we present theoretical\nbounds and empirical results for an adaptive strategy and quantify its\npractical benefit over the non-adaptive strategy. We evaluate adaptive and\nnon-adaptive policies on three real data sets.

It is well known that entanglement with an ancillary system\ncan help in this task, and furthermore that an ancilla with the same dimension\nas the input of the channels is always sufficient for optimal discrimination of\ntwo channels. A natural question to ask is whether the same holds true for the\noutput dimension. That is, in cases when the output dimension of the channels\nis (possibly much) smaller than the input dimension, is an ancilla with\ndimension equal to the output dimension always sufficient for optimal\ndiscrimination? We show that the answer to this question is \"no\" by\nconstruction of a family of counterexamples. This family contains instances\nwith arbitrary finite gap between the input and output dimensions, and still\nhas the property that in every case, for optimal discrimination, it is\nnecessary to use an ancilla with dimension equal to that of the input.\n  The proof relies on a characterization of all operators on the trace norm\nunit sphere that maximize entanglement negativity. In the case of density\noperators we generalize this characterization to a broad class of entanglement\nmeasures, which we call weak entanglement measures. This characterization\nallows us to conclude that a quantum channel is reversible if and only if it\npreserves entanglement as measured by any weak entanglement measure, with the\nstructure of maximally entangled states being equivalent to the structure of\nreversible maps via the Choi isomorphism.

Results: DNN achieves classification\naccuracies comparable to those of CSP-LDA. In subjects with low performance\nsubject-to-subject transfer of trained DNNs can improve the results. The\nsingle-trial LRP heatmaps reveal neurophysiologically plausible patterns,\nresembling CSP-derived scalp maps. Critically, while CSP patterns represent\nclass-wise aggregated information, LRP heatmaps pinpoint neural patterns to\nsingle time points in single trials. Comparison with Existing Method(s): We\ncompare the classification performance of DNNs to that of linear CSP-LDA on two\ndata sets related to motor-imaginery BCI. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that\nDNN is a powerful non-linear tool for EEG analysis. With LRP a new quality of\nhigh-resolution assessment of neural activity can be reached. LRP is a\npotential remedy for the lack of interpretability of DNNs that has limited\ntheir utility in neuroscientific applications. The extreme specificity of the\nLRP-derived heatmaps opens up new avenues for investigating neural activity\nunderlying complex perception or decision-related processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 19:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-28"}

Exploring this connection will\nbe crucial to understanding the triggering mechanisms of AGNs and how these\nprocesses manifest in observations at all wavelengths. In anticipation of\nupcoming wide-field X-ray surveys that will allow quantitative analysis of AGN\nenvironments, this paper presents a method to observationally constrain the\nConditional Luminosity Function (CLF) of AGNs at a specific $z$. Once measured,\nthe CLF allows the calculation of the AGN bias, mean dark matter halo mass, AGN\nlifetime, halo occupation number, and AGN correlation function -- all as a\nfunction of luminosity. The CLF can be constrained using a measurement of the\nX-ray luminosity function and the correlation length at different luminosities.\nThe method is illustrated at $z \\approx 0$ and $0.9$ using the limited data\nthat is currently available, and a clear luminosity dependence in the AGN bias\nand mean halo mass is predicted at both $z$, supporting the idea that there are\nat least two different modes of AGN triggering.

It is one of the rare and intriguing\ncombinatorial problems that lie in ${\\sf NP} \\cap {\\sf co\\mbox{-}NP}$, but are\nnot known to be in ${\\sf P}$. The existence of polynomial-time algorithms has\nbeen a major open problem for decades and apart from pseudopolynomial\nalgorithms there is no algorithm that solves any non-trivial subclass in\npolynomial time.\n  In this paper, we give several results based on the weight structures of the\ngraph. First, we identify a notion of penalty and present a polynomial-time\nalgorithm when the penalty is large. Our algorithm is the first polynomial-time\nalgorithm on a large class of weighted graphs. It includes several worst-case\ninstances on which previous algorithms, such as value iteration and random\nfacet algorithms, require at least sub-exponential time. Our main technique is\ndeveloping the first non-trivial approximation algorithm and showing how to\nconvert it to an exact algorithm. Moreover, we show that in a practical case in\nverification where weights are clustered around a constant number of values,\nthe energy game problem can be solved in polynomial time. We also show that the\nproblem is still as hard as in general when the clique-width is bounded or the\ngraph is strongly ergodic, suggesting that restricting the graph structure does\nnot necessarily help.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 20:36:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2016 17:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-02"}

This is motivated by the fact that early detection of diseases such as\ncancer play a crucial role in their successful treatment. The proposed NADS is\nin fact a two-tier network of sensor nano-machines (SNMs) in the first tier and\na data-gathering node (DGN) at the sink. The SNMs detect the presence of\ncompetitor cells (abnormality) by variations in input and/or parameters of a\nnano-communications channel (NCC). The noise of SNMs as their nature suggest is\nconsidered correlated in time and space and herein assumed additive Gaussian.\nIn the second step, the SNMs transmit micro-scale messages over a noisy micro\ncommunications channel (MCC) to the DGN, where a decision is made upon fusing\nthe received signals. We find an optimum design of detectors for each of the\nNADS tiers based on the end-to-end NADS performance. The detection performance\nof each SNM is analyzed by setting up a generalized likelihood ratio test.\nNext, taking into account the effect of the MCC, the overall performance of the\nNADS is analyzed in terms of probabilities of misdetection and false alarm. In\naddition, computationally efficient expressions to quantify the NADS\nperformance is derived by providing respectively an approximation and an upper\nbound for the probabilities of misdetection and false alarm. This in turn\nenables formulating a design problem, where the optimized concentration of SNMs\nin a sample is obtained for a high probability of detection and a limited\nprobability of false alarm.

Reduced order models (ROMs) of\ngravitational waveforms can significantly reduce the computational cost of\ninference by removing redundant computations.

In favourable cases, given only the first 20 coefficients, the next\n100 coefficients are predicted with useful accuracy.

Team members take on an egalitarian\nrole, and stay voluntarily logged into so-called AA sessions for part of their\ntime (e.g. 2 hours per day), during which they create periodical logs - short\ntext sentences - they wish to share about their activity with the team. These\nlogs are publicly aggregated in a website and are peer-validated after the end\nof a session, as in code review. A short screencast is ideally recorded at the\nend of each session to make AA logs more understandable. This methodology has\nshown to be well-suited for increasing the efficiency of distributed teams\nworking on Global Software Development (GSD), as observed in our reported\nexperience in actual real-world situations. This efficiency boost is mainly\nachieved through 1) built-in asynchronous on-demand communication in\nconjunction with documentation of work, products, and processes, and 2) reduced\nneed for central management, meetings or time-consuming reports. Hence, the AA\nmethodology legitimizes and facilitates the activities of a distributed\nsoftware team. It thus enables other entities to have a solid means to fund\nthese activities, allowing for new and concrete business models to emerge for\nvery distributed software development. AA has been proposed, at its core, as a\nway of sustaining self-replicating hacker initiatives. These claims are\ndiscussed in a real case-study of running a distributed free software hacker\nteam called Lab Macambira.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 21:47:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-29"}

Point features, however,\nare not available in certain applications and result in unstructured point\ncloud reconstructions. General image curves provide a complementary feature\nwhen keypoints are scarce, and result in 3D curve geometry, but face challenges\nnot addressed by the usual projective geometry of points and algebraic curves.\nWe address these challenges by laying the theoretical foundations of a\nframework based on the differential geometry of general curves, including\nstationary curves, occluding contours, and non-rigid curves, aiming at stereo\ncorrespondence, camera estimation (including calibration, pose, and multiview\nepipolar geometry), and 3D reconstruction given measured image curves. By\ngathering previous results into a cohesive theory, novel results were made\npossible, yielding three contributions. First we derive the differential\ngeometry of an image curve (tangent, curvature, curvature derivative) from that\nof the underlying space curve (tangent, curvature, curvature derivative,\ntorsion). Second, we derive the differential geometry of a space curve from\nthat of two corresponding image curves. Third, the differential motion of an\nimage curve is derived from camera motion and the differential geometry and\nmotion of the space curve. The availability of such a theory enables novel\ncurve-based multiview reconstruction and camera estimation systems to augment\nexisting point-based approaches. This theory has been used to reconstruct a \"3D\ncurve sketch\", to determine camera pose from local curve geometry, and\ntracking; other developments are underway.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 21:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-29"}

Such\ninputs are crafted by adding carefully selected perturbations to legitimate\ninputs so as to force the machine learning model to misbehave, for instance by\noutputting a wrong class if the machine learning task of interest is\nclassification. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, all previous work on\nadversarial samples crafting for neural network considered models used to solve\nclassification tasks, most frequently in computer vision applications. In this\npaper, we contribute to the field of adversarial machine learning by\ninvestigating adversarial input sequences for recurrent neural networks\nprocessing sequential data.

Motivated in part by these experiments, we\nperformed simulations using a coarse-grained model of RNA to describe the\nresponse of a PK over a range of mechanical forces ($f$s) and monovalent salt\nconcentrations ($C$s). The coarse-grained simulations quantitatively reproduce\nthe multistep thermal melting observed in experiments, thus validating our\nmodel.

Here we suggest a\nnear-surface reservoir could explain this variability. Using the temperature\nand humidity measurements from the rover, we find that perchlorate salts in the\nregolith deliquesce to form liquid solutions, and deliquescence progresses to\ndeeper subsurface in the season of the methane spikes. We therefore formulate\nthe following three testable hypotheses. The first scenario is that the\nregolith in Gale Crater adsorbs methane when dry and releases this methane to\nthe atmosphere upon deliquescence. The adsorption energy needs to be 36 kJ/mol\nto explain the magnitude of the methane spikes, higher than existing laboratory\nmeasurements. The second scenario is that microorganisms convert organic matter\nin the soil to methane when they are in liquid solutions. This scenario does\nnot require regolith adsorption, but entails extant life on Mars. The third\nscenario is that deep subsurface aquifers produce the bursts of methane.\nContinued in situ measurements of methane and water, as well as laboratory\nstudies of adsorption and deliquescence, will test these hypotheses and inform\nthe existence of the near-surface reservoir and its exchange with the\natmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 01:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}

This sort of analysis\nstrongly depends on understanding the thermal effects of a medium like the\nplasma on the states of heavy mesons. In particular, it is crucial to know the\ntemperature ranges where they undergo a thermal dissociation, or melting.\nAdS/QCD models are know to provide an important tool for the calculation of\nhadronic masses, but in general are not consistent with the observation that\ndecay constants of heavy vector mesons decrease with excitation level. It has\nrecently been shown that this problem can be overcome using a soft wall\nbackground and introducing an extra energy parameter, through the calculation\nof correlation functions at a finite position of anti-de Sitter space. This\napproach leads to the evaluation of masses and decay constants of S wave\nquarkonium states with just one flavor dependent and one flavor independent\nparameters. Here we extend this more realistic model to finite temperatures and\nanalyse the thermal behavior of the states $1S, 2S$ and $ 3S$ of bottomonium\nand charmonium. The corresponding spectral function exhibits a consistent\npicture for the melting of the states where, for each flavor, the higher\nexcitations melt at lower temperatures. We estimate for these six states, the\nenergy ranges in which the heavy vector mesons undergo a transition from a well\ndefined peak in the spectral function to complete melting in the thermal\nmedium. A very clear distinction between the heavy flavors emerges, with\nbottomonium state $\\Upsilon (1S)$ surviving deconfinemet transition at\ntemperatures much larger than the critical deconfinement temperature of the\nmedium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 03:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

In this work, we propose that the cosmic rays\nare accelerated up to $>$PeV in GC.

However, in many cases,\nthese methods can quickly become extremely computationally intensive with\nincreasing particle numbers. An alternative description of many of these\nsystems can be derived in the diffusive limit as a deterministic, continuum\nsystem of partial differential equations. Although the numerical solution of\nsuch partial differential equations is, in general, much more efficient than\nthe full stochastic simulation, the deterministic continuum description is\ngenerally not valid when copy numbers are low and stochastic effects dominate.\nTherefore, to take advantage of the benefits of both of these types of models,\neach of which may be appropriate in different parts of a spatial domain, we\nhave developed an algorithm that can be used to couple these two types of model\ntogether. This hybrid coupling algorithm uses an overlap region between the two\nmodelling regimes. By coupling fluxes at one end of the interface and using a\nconcentration-matching condition at the other end, we ensure that mass is\nappropriately transferred between PDE- and compartment-based regimes. Our\nmethodology gives notable reductions in simulation time in comparison with\nusing a fully stochastic model, whilst maintaining the important stochastic\nfeatures of the system and providing detail in appropriate areas of the domain.\nWe test our hybrid methodology robustly by applying it to several biologically\nmotivated problems including diffusion and morphogen gradient formation.

We study\nthe trade-off between the number of non-terminals and the distortion. This\nproblem generalizes the Steiner Point Removal (SPR) problem, in which all\nnon-terminals must be removed.\n  We introduce a novel black-box reduction to convert any lower bound on\ndistortion for the SPR problem into a super-linear lower bound on the number of\nnon-terminals, with the same distortion, for our problem.

The physics of the parent state seems\ndeceivingly simple: The hopping of the electrons from site to site is\nprohibited because their on-site Coulomb repulsion U is larger than the kinetic\nenergy gain t. When doping these materials by inserting a small percentage of\nextra carriers, the electrons become mobile but the strong correlations from\nthe Mott state are thought to survive; inhomogeneous electronic order, a\nmysterious pseudogap and, eventually, superconductivity appear. How the\ninsertion of dopant atoms drives this evolution is not known, nor whether these\nphenomena are mere distractions specific to hole-doped cuprates or represent\nthe genuine physics of doped Mott insulators. Here, we visualize the evolution\nof the electronic states of (Sr1-xLax)2IrO4, which is an effective spin-1/2\nMott insulator like the cuprates, but is chemically radically different. Using\nspectroscopic-imaging STM, we find that for doping concentration of x=5%, an\ninhomogeneous, phase separated state emerges, with the nucleation of pseudogap\npuddles around clusters of dopant atoms. Within these puddles, we observe the\nsame glassy electronic order that is so iconic for the underdoped cuprates.\nFurther, we illuminate the genesis of this state using the unique possibility\nto localize dopant atoms on topographs in these samples. At low doping, we find\nevidence for much deeper trapping of carriers compared to the cuprates. This\nleads to fully gapped spectra with the chemical potential at mid-gap, which\nabruptly collapse at a threshold of around 4%. Our results clarify the melting\nof the Mott state, and establish phase separation and electronic order as\ngeneric features of doped Mott insulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 08:33:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 10:07:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

In\nthis work, we study the dynamic properties (resonance frequencies and\ncorresponding eigenmodes) of skyrmionic states in thin film FeGe disk samples.\nWe employ two different methods in finite-element based micromagnetic\nsimulation: eigenvalue and ringdown method. The eigenvalue method allows us to\nidentify all resonance frequencies and corresponding eigenmodes that can exist\nin the simulated system. However, using a particular experimentally feasible\nexcitation can excite only a limited set of eigenmodes. Because of that, we\nperform ringdown simulations that resemble the experimental setup using both\nin-plane and out-of-plane excitations. In addition, we report the nonlinear\ndependence of resonance frequencies on the external magnetic bias field and\ndisk sample diameter and discuss the possible reversal mode of skyrmionic\nstates. We compare the power spectral densities of incomplete skyrmion and\nisolated skyrmion states and observe several key differences that can\ncontribute to the experimental identification of the state present in the\nsample.

The three different magnetic\nstructures found as a function of temperature for \\hfo\\ are described by the\nmagnetic groups Pb$'$n$'2_1$, Pbn$2_1$ and Pbn$'2_1'$ and are stable in the\ntemperature ranges $\\approx$ 600-55~K, 55-37~K and 35$>T>2$~K respectively. In\nall three the fundamental coupling between the Fe sub-lattices remains the same\nand only their orientation and the degree of canting away from the ideal axial\ndirection varies. The magnetic polarisation of the Ho sub-lattices in these two\nhigher temperature regions, in which the major components of the Fe moment lie\nalong $x$ and $y$, is very small. The canting of the moments from the axial\ndirections is attributed to the antisymmetric interactions allowed by the\ncrystal symmetry. They include contributions from single ion anisotropy as well\nas the Dzyaloshinski antisymmetric exchange. In the low temperature phase two\nfurther structural transitions are apparent in which the spontaneous\nmagnetisation changes sign with respect to the underlying antiferromagnetic\nconfiguration. In this temperature range the antisymmetric exchange energy\nvaries rapidly as the the Ho sub-lattices begin to order. So long as the\nordered Ho moments are small the antisymmetric exchange is due only to Fe-Fe\ninteractions, but as the degree of Ho order increases the Fe-Ho interactions\ntake over whilst at the lowest temperatures, when the Ho moments approach\nsaturation the Ho-Ho interactions dominate.

The powder inelastic neutron scattering data on these geometrically\nfrustrated $j_{\\rm eff}=1/2$ Mott insulators provide clear evidence for gapped\nspin wave excitations with very weak dispersion. The INS results and\nthermodynamic data on these materials can be reproduced by conventional\nHeisenberg-Ising models with significant uniaxial Ising anisotropy and sizeable\nsecond-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions. Such a uniaxial Ising exchange\ninteraction is symmetry-forbidden on the ideal fcc lattice, so that it can only\narise from the weak crystal distortions away from the ideal fcc limit. This may\nsuggest that even weak distortions in $j_{\\rm eff}=1/2$ Mott insulators might\nlead to strong exchange anisotropies.

We\nfirst introduce the current state-of-the-art of network estimation. Second, we\nprovide a rationale why researchers should investigate the accuracy of\npsychological networks. Third, we describe how bootstrap routines can be used\nto (A) assess the accuracy of estimated network connections, (B) investigate\nthe stability of centrality indices, and (C) test whether network connections\nand centrality estimates for different variables differ from each other.

Our results show that the behavior of Hawking's radiation\nchanges considerably at the small radii regime such that the black hole does\nnot evaporate completely and a stable remnant is left. We show that stability\nconditions hold for the Hayward solutions found in the Einstein gravity coupled\nwith nonlinear electrodynamics. We analyse the effect that an inspired model of\nthe noncommutativity of spacetime can have on the thermodynamics of Hayward\nspacetimes. This has been done by applying the noncommutative effects to the\nnon-rotating and rotating Hayward black holes. In this setup, all point\nstructures get replaced by smeared distributions owing to this inspired\napproach. The noncommutative effects result in a colder black hole in the small\nradii regime as Hayward's free parameter $g$ increases. As well as the effects\nof noncommutativity and the rotation factor, the configuration of the remnant\ncan be substantially affected by the parameter $g$. However, in the rotating\nsolution it is not so sensitive to $g$ with respect to the non-rotating case.\nAs a consequence, Hayward's parameter, the noncommutativity and the rotation\nmay raise the minimum value of energy for the possible formation of black holes\nin TeV-scale collisions. This observation can be used as a potential\nexplanation for the absence of black holes in the current energy scales\nproduced at particle colliders. However, it is also found that if extra\ndimensions do exist, then the possibility of the black hole production at\nenergy scales accessible at the LHC for large numbers of extra dimensions will\nbe larger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 11:33:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 May 2016 14:17:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2017 20:54:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-09"}

The technique has been applied for\ndecades in DC-power systems, and it was recently adopted to map the impedances\nin AC systems. Most of the work on AC systems can be categorized in two\napproaches. One is the analysis of the system in the \\textit{dq}-domain,\nwhereas the other applies harmonic linearization in the phase domain through\nsymmetric components. Impedance models based on analytical calculations,\nnumerical simulation and experimental studies have been previously developed\nand verified in both domains independently. The authors of previous studies\ndiscuss the advantages and disadvantages of each domain separately, but neither\na rigorous comparison nor an attempt to bridge them has been conducted. The\npresent paper attempts to close this gap by deriving the mathematical\nformulation that shows the equivalence between the \\textit{dq}-domain and the\nsequence domain impedances. A modified form of the sequence domain impedance\nmatrix is proposed, and with this definition the stability estimates obtained\nwith the Generalized Nyquist Criterion (GNC) become equivalent in both domains.\nThe second contribution of the paper is the definition of a \\textit{Mirror\nFrequency Decoupled} (MFD) system. The analysis of MFD systems is less complex\nthan that of non-MFD systems because the positive and negative sequences are\ndecoupled. This paper shows that if a system is incorrectly assumed to be MFD,\nthis will lead to an erroneous or ambiguous estimation of the equivalent\nimpedance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 10:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-03"}
