Rerandomization\ndiscards randomizations that do not satisfy a predetermined covariate balance\ncriterion, generally resulting in better covariate balance and more precise\nestimates of causal effects. Previous theory has derived finite sample theory\nfor rerandomization under the assumptions of equal treatment group sizes,\nGaussian covariate and outcome distributions, or additive causal effects, but\nnot for the general sampling distribution of the difference-in-means estimator\nfor the average causal effect. To supplement existing results, we develop\nasymptotic theory for rerandomization without these assumptions, which reveals\na non-Gaussian asymptotic distribution for this estimator, specifically a\nlinear combination of a Gaussian random variable and a truncated Gaussian\nrandom variable. This distribution follows because rerandomization affects only\nthe projection of potential outcomes onto the covariate space but does not\naffect the corresponding orthogonal residuals. We also demonstrate that,\ncompared to complete randomization, rerandomization reduces the asymptotic\nsampling variances and quantile ranges of the difference-in-means estimator.\nMoreover, our work allows the construction of accurate large-sample confidence\nintervals for the average causal effect, thereby revealing further advantages\nof rerandomization over complete randomization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 2016 22:56:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 02:24:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2017 08:01:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 12 Aug 2017 02:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-15"}

Remarkably, we find that even with vigorous MRI turbulence, spiral\nshocks are an important component to the overall angular momentum budget, at\nleast when temperatures in the disk are high (so that Mach numbers are low). In\norder to understand the excitation, propagation, and damping of spiral density\nwaves in our simulations more carefully, we perform a series of 2D global\nhydrodynamical simulations with various equation of states and both with and\nwithout mass inflow via the Lagrangian point (L1). Compared with previous\nsimilar studies, we find the following new results. 1) Linear wave dispersion\nrelation fits the pitch angles of spiral density waves very well. 2) We\ndemonstrate explicitly that mass accretion is driven by the deposition of\nnegative angular momentum carried by the waves when they dissipate in shocks.\n3) Using Reynolds stress scaled by gas pressure to represent the effective\nangular momentum transport rate alpha_{eff} is not accurate when mass accretion\nis driven by non-axisymmetric shocks. 4) Using the mass accretion rate measured\nin our simulations to directly measure alpha defined in standard thin-disk\ntheory, we find 0.02 < alpha_{eff} < 0.05 for CV disks, consistent with\nobserved values in quiescent states of dwarf novae (DNe).

The key idea is that\na single water drop adhered to window glass is totally transparent and convex,\nand thus optically acts like a fisheye lens. If we have more than one water\ndrop in a single image, then through each of them we can see the environment\nwith different view points, similar to stereo. To realize this idea, we need to\nrectify every water drop imagery to make radially distorted planar surfaces\nlook flat. For this rectification, we consider two physical properties of water\ndrops: (1) A static water drop has constant volume, and its geometric convex\nshape is determined by the balance between the tension force and gravity. This\nimplies that the 3D geometric shape can be obtained by minimizing the overall\npotential energy, which is the sum of the tension energy and the gravitational\npotential energy. (2) The imagery inside a water-drop is determined by the\nwater-drop 3D shape and total reflection at the boundary. This total reflection\ngenerates a dark band commonly observed in any adherent water drops. Hence,\nonce the 3D shape of water drops are recovered, we can rectify the water drop\nimages through backward raytracing. Subsequently, we can compute depth using\nstereo. In addition to depth estimation, we can also apply image refocusing.\nExperiments on real images and a quantitative evaluation show the effectiveness\nof our proposed method. To our best knowledge, never before have adherent water\ndrops been used to estimate depth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 03:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-05"}

These bounds can be used to provide a guideline to determine the\nsystem parameters in various applications of compressed sensing with noisy\nJSM-2. Based on the bounds, we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for\nreliable support set reconstruction. We interpret these conditions to give\ntheoretical explanations about the benefits enabled by joint sparsity structure\nin noisy JSM-2. We compare our sufficient condition with the existing result of\nnoisy multiple measurement vectors model (MMV). As a result, we show that noisy\nJSM-2 may require less number of measurements than noisy MMV for reliable\nsupport set reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 05:35:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-05"}

The evolution of a\ndynamic complex system is typically represented as a sequence of snapshots,\nwhere each snapshot describes the configuration of the system at a particular\ninstant of time. Then, one may directly follow how the snapshots evolve in\ntime, or aggregate the snapshots within some time intervals to form\nrepresentative \"slices\" of the evolution of the system configuration. This is\noften done with constant intervals, whose duration is based on arguments on the\nnature of the system and of its dynamics. A more refined approach would be to\nconsider the rate of activity in the system to perform a separation of\ntimescales. However, an even better alternative would be to define dynamic\nintervals that match the evolution of the system's configuration. To this end,\nwe propose a method that aims at detecting evolutionary changes in the\nconfiguration of a complex system, and generates intervals accordingly. We show\nthat evolutionary timescales can be identified by looking for peaks in the\nsimilarity between the sets of events on consecutive time intervals of data.\nTests on simple toy models reveal that the technique is able to detect\nevolutionary timescales of time-varying data both when the evolution is smooth\nas well as when it changes sharply. This is further corroborated by analyses of\nseveral real datasets. Our method is scalable to extremely large datasets and\nis computationally efficient.

This\nconcept was first introduced in the context of low-density parity-check (LDPC)\ncodes in an attempt to estimate the number of redundant rows in a parity-check\nmatrix suitable for iterative decoding. Essentially the same concepts appear in\nother contexts as well such as robust syndrome extraction for quantum error\ncorrection. Among the known upper bounds on the trapping redundancy, the\nstrongest one was proposed by employing a powerful tool in probabilistic\ncombinatorics, called the Lov\\'{a}sz Local Lemma. Unfortunately, the proposed\nproof invoked this tool in a situation where an assumption made in the lemma\ndoes not necessarily hold. Hence, although we do not doubt that nonetheless the\nproposed bound actually holds, for it to be a mathematical theorem, a more\nrigorous proof is desired. Another disadvantage of the proposed bound is that\nit is only applicable to $(a,b)$-trapping sets with rather small $a$. Here, we\ngive a more general and sharper upper bound on trapping redundancy by making\nmathematically more rigorous use of probabilistic combinatorics without relying\non the lemma.

Recently, stochastic bedload transport theories have been\ndeveloped to address the mechanisms and effects of bedload transport\nfluctuations. Stochastic models involve parameters such as particle\ndiffusivity, entrainment and deposition rates. The lack of hard information on\nhow these parameters vary with flow conditions is a clear impediment to their\napplication to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we determined the closure\nequations for the above parameters from laboratory experiments. We focused on\nshallow supercritical flow on a sloping mobile bed in straight channels, a\nsetting that was representative of flow conditions in mountain rivers.\nExperiments were run at low sediment transport rates under steady nonuniform\nflow conditions (i.e., the water discharge was kept constant, but bedforms\ndeveloped and migrated upstream, making flow nonuniform). Using image\nprocessing, we reconstructed particle paths to deduce the particle velocity and\nits probability distribution, particle diffusivity, and rates of deposition and\nentrainment. We found that on average, particle acceleration, velocity and\ndeposition rate were responsive to local flow conditions, whereas entrainment\nrate depended strongly on local bed activity. Particle diffusivity varied\nlinearly with the depth-averaged flow velocity. The empirical probability\ndistribution of particle velocity was well approximated by a Gaussian\ndistribution when all particle positions were considered together. In contrast,\nthe particles located in close vicinity to the bed had exponentially\ndistributed velocities. Our experimental results provide closure equations for\nstochastic or deterministic bedload transport models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 08:14:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 12:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

These findings have allowed us to establish new features in\nthe genesis of the CME and associated EUV wave and to reconcile all of the\nepisodes into a causally-related sequence. (1) A hot 11 MK flux rope developed\nfrom a compact filament, accelerated up to 3 km/s$^2$ 1 min before a hard X-ray\nburst and earlier than other structures, reached 420 km/s, and decelerated to\n50 km/s. (2) The CME development was driven by the flux rope. Closed structures\nabove the rope got sequentially involved in the expansion from below upwards,\ncame closer together, and disappeared to reveal their envelope, the rim, which\nbecame the outer boundary of the cavity. The rim was associated with the\nseparatrix surface of a magnetic domain, which contained the pre-eruptive\nfilament. (3) The rim formation was associated with a successive compression of\nthe upper active-region structures into the CME frontal structure (FS). When\nthe rim was formed, it resembled a piston. (4) The disturbance responsible for\nthe CME formation was excited by the flux rope inside the rim, and then\npropagated outward. EUV structures at different heights started to accelerate,\nwhen their trajectories in the distance-time diagram were crossed by the front\nof this disturbance. (5) Outside the rim and FS, the disturbance propagated\nlike a blast wave, manifesting in a type II radio burst and a leading part of\nthe EUV transient. Its main, trailing part was the FS, which consisted of\nswept-up 2 MK loops enveloping the rim. The wave decelerated and decayed soon,\nbeing not driven by the trailing piston, which slowed down.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 10:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-05"}

Little is known about the microscopic origin, size\nand handedness of the helical pitch in these, so-called cholesteric phases.\nExperimental observations in chiral lyotropics suggest that long-ranged chiral\nforces of electrostatic origin acting between the mesogens are responsible for\nsuch organization. Using large-scale computer simulation we study the\nsensitivity of the pitch imparted by soft microscopic helices and confirm that\nthe helical sense is sensitive to a change of packing fraction, magnitude of\nthe molecular pitch and amplitude of the chiral interactions. In particular, we\nfind evidence that the cholesteric helix sense may change spontaneously upon\nvariation of particle density, at fixed molecular chirality. These pitch\ninversions have been reported in recent theoretical studies but simulation\nevidence remains elusive. We rationalize these sudden changes in the\nsupramolecular helical symmetry on the basis of detailed measurements of the\nmean-torque generated by the twisting of the helices. The simulation\nmethodology employed does not require confining the twisted nematic in a slab\ngeometry and allows for a simultaneous measurement of the pitch and the twist\nelastic constant. We find that the twist elastic constant increases almost\nlinearly with density suggesting that twisted nematic shows no signs of\nanomalous stiffening due to pre-smectic fluctuations at higher packing\nfraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 10:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-06"}

The reason for this\nis that the proxy data are noisy, i.e. in addition to the variability that is\nrelated to the climate variable of interest, they contain other sources of\nvariability. Inadequate treatment of such noise leads to a biased estimation of\nregression slopes, resulting in a wrong representation of the real amplitude of\npast climate variations.

In the\nother case the type-II Weyl point connects the outer and inner Fermi surfaces.\nAt the Lifshitz transition the Weyl point is released from both Fermi surfaces.\nThese examples reveal the complexity and universality of topological Lifshitz\ntransitions, which originate from the ubiquitous interplay of a variety of\ntopological characters of the momentum-space manifolds.

We establish a\ngeometric theory behind RMHMC to motivate GTHMC and characterize its\ntheoretical properties. Moreover, we develop a novel variable step size\nintegrator for simulating Hamiltonian dynamics to improve on the usual\nSt\\\"{o}rmer-Verlet integrator which suffers from numerical instability in GTHMC\nsettings. We illustrate GTHMC through simulations, demonstrating generality and\nsubstantial gains over standard HMC implementations in terms of effective\nsample sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 14:24:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2017 02:58:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

Recently,\nmeasurements of the changes in the magnification ratio of the individual images\nhave been proposed as a powerful tool for estimation of the size and velocity\nof the emission region in the lensed source. The changes of the magnification\nratios in blazars PKS1830-211 and QSO B0218+357, if interpreted as caused by a\nmicrolensing on individual stars, put strong constraints on those two\nvariables.

This is especially important for neurodegenerative diseases, as\ntherapeutic intervention is most likely to be effective in the preclinical\ndisease stages prior to significant neuronal damage. Longitudinal neuroimaging\nallows for the measurement of structural, functional, and metabolic integrity\nof the brain over time at the level of voxels. However, commonly used\nlongitudinal analysis approaches, such as linear mixed effects models, do not\naccount for the fact that individuals enter a study at various disease stages\nand progress at different rates, and generally consider each voxelwise measure\nindependently. We propose a multivariate nonlinear mixed effects model for\nestimating the trajectories of voxelwise neuroimaging biomarkers from\nlongitudinal data that accounts for such differences across individuals. The\nmethod involves the prediction of a progression score for each visit based on a\ncollective analysis of voxelwise biomarker data within an\nexpectation-maximization framework that efficiently handles large amounts of\nmeasurements and variable number of visits per individual, and accounts for\nspatial correlations among voxels. This score allows individuals with similar\nprogressions to be aligned and analyzed together, which enables the\nconstruction of a trajectory of brain changes as a function of an underlying\nprogression or disease stage.

Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are a common feature of the power\nspectrums of X-ray binaries. Currently it is not possible to unambiguously\ndifferentiate the large number of proposed models to explain these phenomena\nthrough existing observations.\n  Aims. We investigate the observable predictions of a simple model that\ngenerates flux modulation: a spiral instability rotating in a thin accretion\ndisk. This model is motivated by the accretion ejection instability (AEI) model\nfor low- frequency QPOs (LFQPOs). We are particularly interested in the\ninclination dependence of the observables that are associated with this model.\n  Methods. We develop a simple analytical model of an accretion disk, which\nfeatures a spiral instability. The disk is assumed to emit blackbody radiation,\nwhich is ray-traced to a distant observer. We compute pulse profiles and power\nspectra as observed from infinity.\n  Results. We show that the amplitude of the modulation associated with the\nspiral rotation is a strong function of inclination and frequency. The pulse\nprofile is quasi-sinusoidal only at low inclination (face-on source). As a\nconsequence, a higher-inclination geometry leads to a stronger and more diverse\nharmonic signature in the power spectrum.\n  Conclusions. We present how the amplitude depends on the inclination when the\nflux modulation comes from a spiral in the disk. We also include new\nobservables that could potentially differentiate between models, such as the\npulse profile and the harmonic content of the power spectra of high-inclination\nsources that exhibit LFQPOs.

The origin\nof such pairing relies on the hexagonal structure of the VHS and strong\nspin-orbit coupling, resulting in the anisotropy of the electron-electron\nscattering to provide an attractive channel.

When fully expanding the x-axis and\nexamining the conditional response probabilities separately for the beginning,\nmiddle and end of the presented item list, I show that the law of contiguity\napplies only locally, even then only sometimes, and breaks down globally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 12:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-19"}

Here I\ninvestigate conditional response probabilities in Murdock's 40-1 (1962) free\nrecall dataset. I find that the conditional response probabilities confirm the\npresence of two stages. The first stage is characterized by a large enhancement\nof the forward subsequent recall (up to 30 times chance) and a large\nsuppression of backward recalls (up to 26 times smaller than chance for recalls\nbetween 10 and 40 items away). The second stage forward subsequent recall is\nenhanced by a factor of 5 and the probability of backward and forward recalls\nare concentrated at small distances. Thus both stages favor forward subsequent\nrecalls. As in Tarnow (2015), the first stage is much more localized than the\nsecond stage. Working memory capacity is estimated in six ways to be about 4.5\nword items for the 40-1 word list.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 13:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-19"}
