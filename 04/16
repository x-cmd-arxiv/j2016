Moreover,\nthe asymptotic average train time-headway, dwell time, as well as close-in\ntime, are derived analytically, as functions of the number of running trains on\nthe metro line. We then introduce, in a second model, the effect of the\npassenger demand on the train dwell times at platforms. We review that, if this\neffect is not well controlled, then the traffic is unstable. Finally, we\npropose a traffic control model which deals with this instability, by well\ncontrolling the effect of passenger arrivals on the train dwell times at\nplatforms. We show that the dynamics are stable and converge to stationary\nregimes with a unique asymptotic average growth rate. We then calculate by\nnumerical simulations the asymptotic average time-headway as a function of the\nnumber of running trains, compare the results with those of the max-plus\nalgebra model, and derive the effect of the passenger travel demand on the\nfrequency of the metro line, under the proposed control model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2016 18:39:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2018 18:06:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-09"}

The\noccurrence rate and distributions of masses and orbits vary greatly with the\nhost stars mass. These close planets origins are a mystery that motivates\ninvestigating protoplanetary disks central regions. A key factor governing the\nconditions near the star is the silicate sublimation front, which largely\ndetermines where the starlight is absorbed, and which is often called the inner\nrim. We present the first radiation hydrodynamical modeling of the sublimation\nfront in the disks around the young intermediate-mass stars called Herbig Ae\nstars. The models are axisymmetric, and include starlight heating, silicate\ngrains sublimating and condensing to equilibrium at the local, time-dependent\ntemperature and density, and accretion stresses parametrizing the results of\nMHD magneto-rotational turbulence models. The results compare well with\nradiation hydrostatic solutions, and prove to be dynamically stable. Passing\nthe model disks into Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations, we show that\nthe models satisfy observational constraints on the inner rims location. A\nsmall optically-thin halo of hot dust naturally arises between the inner rim\nand the star. The inner rim has a substantial radial extent, corresponding to\nseveral disk scale heights. While the fronts overall position varies with the\nstellar luminosity, its radial extent depends on the mass accretion rate. A\npressure maximum develops near the location of thermal ionization at\ntemperatures about 1000 K. The pressure maximum is capable of halting solid\npebbles radial drift and concentrating them in a zone where temperatures are\nsufficiently high for annealing to form crystalline silicates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2016 18:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

The common approaches follow a division of labor concept, where SDN\ncontrols prioritized traffic and OSPF assures care-free operation of best\neffort traffic. We propose SDN Partitioning, which establishes centralized\ncontrol over the distributed routing protocol by partitioning the topology into\nsub-domains with SDN-enabled border nodes, such that OSPF's routing updates\nhave to traverse SDN border nodes to reach neighboring sub-domains.

The\nSWNT excitonic states are calculated by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation\nusing tight-binding basis functions. The ET rates due to intertube Coulomb\ninteraction are computed via Fermi's golden rule.

One major shortcoming of all accuracy measures\nis that they neglect the anatomical significance or relevance of different\nzones within a given segment. Hence, existing accuracy metrics measure the\noverlap of a given segment with a ground-truth without any anatomical\ndiscrimination inside the segment. For instance, if we understand the rectal\nwall or urethral sphincter as anatomical zones, then current accuracy measures\nignore their significance when they are applied to assess the quality of the\nprostate gland segments. In this paper, we propose an anatomy-aware measurement\nscheme for segmentation accuracy of medical images. The idea is to create a\n``master gold'' based on a consensus shape containing not just the outline of\nthe segment but also the outlines of the internal zones if existent or\nrelevant. To apply this new approach to accuracy measurement, we introduce the\nanatomy-aware extensions of both Dice coefficient and Jaccard index and\ninvestigate their effect using 500 synthetic prostate ultrasound images with 20\ndifferent segments for each image. We show that through anatomy-sensitive\ncalculation of segmentation accuracy, namely by considering relevant anatomical\nzones, not only the measurement of individual users can change but also the\nranking of users' segmentation skills may require reordering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2016 01:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}

This is primarily because one needs to\ncompute the log-partition function on every data point. This makes distributing\nthe computation hard. In this paper, we present a distributed stochastic\ngradient descent based optimization method (DS-MLR) for scaling up multinomial\nlogistic regression problems to massive scale datasets without hitting any\nstorage constraints on the data and model parameters. Our algorithm exploits\ndouble-separability, an attractive property that allows us to achieve both data\nas well as model parallelism simultaneously. In addition, we introduce a\nnon-blocking and asynchronous variant of our algorithm that avoids\nbulk-synchronization. We demonstrate the versatility of DS-MLR to various\nscenarios in data and model parallelism, through an extensive empirical study\nusing several real-world datasets.

In the proposed method, the $M$ input integer data streams\nare linearly superimposed to form $M$ numerically-entangled integer data\nstreams that are stored in-place of the original inputs. A series of LSB\noperations can then be performed directly using these entangled data streams.\nThe results are extracted from the $M$ entangled output streams by additions\nand arithmetic shifts.

Any models that realistically cater to this phenomenon must exhibit\ntwo important properties: the underlying mixture densities must have an unknown\nnumber of mixtures, and there must be some \"smoothness\" constraints in place\nfor the adjacent mixture densities. The traditional Hierarchical Dirichlet\nProcess (HDP) may be suited to the first property, but certainly not the\nsecond. This is due to how each random measure in the lower hierarchies is\nsampled independent of each other and hence does not facilitate any temporal\ncorrelations. To overcome such shortcomings, we proposed a new Smoothed\nHierarchical Dirichlet Process (sHDP). The key novelty of this model is that we\nplace a temporal constraint amongst the nearby discrete measures $\\{G_j\\}$ in\nthe form of symmetric Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence with a fixed bound $B$.\nAlthough the constraint we place only involves a single scalar value, it\nnonetheless allows for flexibility in the corresponding successive measures.\nRemarkably, it also led us to infer the model within the stick-breaking process\nwhere the traditional Beta distribution used in stick-breaking is now replaced\nby a new constraint calculated from $B$. We present the inference algorithm and\nelaborate on its solutions. Our experiment using NIPS keywords has shown the\ndesirable effect of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2016 12:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}

For a given average user rate, we consider the problem of\nmaximizing the EE with respect to the number of each RRH antennas $n$, the\nnumber of RRHs $M$, the number of users $K$, and study the impact of system\nparameters on the optimal $n$, $M$ and $K$. Specifically, by applying random\nmatrix theory, we derive the closed-form expressions of the optimal $n$, and\nfind the solution of the optimal $M$ and $K$, under a simplified channel model\nwith maximum ratio transmission. From the results, we find that to achieve the\noptimal EE, a large number of antennas is needed for a given user rate and PC.\nAs the number of users increases, EE can be improved further by having more\nRRHs and antennas. Moreover, if the backhauling power is not large, massive DAS\ncan be more energy efficient than massive CAS.

However, this attractive\nconclusion was only intuitively explained and then verified through simulation\nresults in the literature, while no rigorous theoretical proof has been\nprovided. To fill in the gap between the theoretical conclusion and simulation\nresults, in this paper, we quantitatively analyze the performance of the\nchannel statistics-based codebook. Specifically, we firstly introduce the rate\ngap between the ideal case of perfect channel state information at the\ntransmitter and the practical case of limited channel feedback, where we find\nthat the rate gap is dependent on the quantization error of the codebook. Then,\nwe derive an upper bound of the quantization error, based on which we prove\nthat the required feedback bits to ensure a constant rate gap only scales\nlinearly with the rank of the channel correlation matrix. Finally, numerical\nresults are provided to verify this conclusion. To the best of our knowledge,\nour work is the first one to provide a rigorous proof of this conclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2016 14:42:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2016 02:21:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 17:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-23"}

This involves the computation of Euclidean projections onto\nlevel sets of the sparseness measure. While previous algorithms for this\noptimization problem had at least quasi-linear time complexity, here the first\nalgorithm with linear time complexity and constant space complexity is\nproposed. The key for this is the mathematically rigorous derivation of a\ncharacterization of the projection's result based on a soft-shrinkage function.\nThis theory is applied in an original algorithm called Easy Dictionary Learning\n(EZDL), which learns dictionaries with a simple and fast-to-compute\nHebbian-like learning rule.

It is demonstrated that despite its\nsimplicity, the proposed learning algorithm is able to generate a rich variety\nof dictionaries, in particular a topographic organization of atoms or separable\natoms. Further, the dictionaries are as expressive as those of benchmark\nlearning algorithms in terms of the reproduction quality on entire images, and\nresult in an equivalent denoising performance.

The Lagrange\nfunction of an electromagnetic field in the space with spin noncommutativity is\nconstructed. In such a space electromagnetic field becomes non-abelian. A gauge\ntransformation law of this field is also obtained. Exact nonlinear field\nequations of noncommutative electromagnetic field are derived from the least\naction principle. Within the perturbative approach we consider field of a point\ncharge in a constant magnetic field and interaction of two plane waves. An\nexact solution of a plane wave propagation in a constant magnetic and electric\nfields is found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2016 11:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

The main goal is to introduce a combined approach consisting in the\nsimultaneous utilization of symmetry principles along with the inverse\nvariational problem considerations in terms of vector-valued differential\nforms. Next, some simple algorithm of transition between the autonomous\nvariational problem and the variational problem in parametric form is\nestablished. The example definitely solved shows no-existence of a globally and\nintrinsically defined Lagrangian for the Poincar\\'e-invariant and well defined\nunique variational equation in the case in hand. Hamiltonian counterpart is\nbriefly discussed in terms of Poisson bracket. The model appears to provide a\ngeneralized canonical description of the quasi-classical spinning particle\ngoverned by the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations in flat space-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2016 11:17:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-29"}
