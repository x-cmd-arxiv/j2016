The fact that conventional distance sampling methods are partly\ndesign-based constrains the spatial resolution at which animal density can be\nestimated using these methods. Estimates are usually obtained at survey stratum\nlevel. For an endangered species such as the blue whale, it is desirable to\nestimate density and abundance at a finer spatial scale than stratum. Temporal\nvariation in the spatial structure is also important. We formulate the process\ngenerating distance sampling data as a thinned spatial point process and\npropose model-based inference using a spatial log-Gaussian Cox process. The\nmethod adopts a flexible stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE)\napproach to model spatial structure in density that is not accounted for by\nexplanatory variables, and integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) for\nBayesian inference. It allows simultaneous fitting of detection and density\nmodels and permits prediction of density at an arbitrarily fine scale. We\nestimate blue whale density in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean from thirteen\nshipboard surveys conducted over 22 years. We find that higher blue whale\ndensity is associated with colder sea surface temperatures in space, and\nalthough there is some positive association between density and mean annual\ntemperature, our estimates are consitent with no trend in density across years.\nOur analysis also indicates that there is substantial spatially structured\nvariation in density that is not explained by available covariates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2016 16:02:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2016 12:56:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2017 21:34:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 2017 16:43:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-23"}

We used the\nOSIRIS instrument at the GTC in long slit spectroscopy mode, placing HAT-P-32\nand a reference star in the same slit and obtaining a time series of spectra\ncovering two transit events. Using the best quality data set, we were able to\nyield 20 narrow-band transit light curves, with each passband spanning a 20 nm\nwide interval. After removal of all systematic noise signals and light curve\nmodeling the uncertainties for the resulting radius ratios lie between 337 and\n972 ppm. The radius ratios show little variation with wavelength suggesting a\nhigh altitude cloud layer masking any atmospheric features. Alternatively, a\nstrong depletion in alkali metals or a much smaller than expected planetary\natmospheric scale height could be responsible for the lack of atmospheric\nfeatures.

This\nraises the question of the capacity of these planets to host surface liquid\nwater. In order to assess the habitability of an eccentric planet, the mean\nflux approximation is often used. It states that a planet on an eccentric orbit\nis called habitable if it receives on average a flux compatible with the\npresence of surface liquid water. However, as the planets do experience\nimportant insolation variations over one orbit and even spend some time outside\nthe HZ for high eccentricities, the question of their habitability might not be\nas straightforward. We performed a set of simulations using the Global Climate\nModel LMDz, exploring the limits of the mean flux approximation when varying\nthe luminosity of the host star and the eccentricity of the planet. We computed\nthe climate of tidally locked ocean covered planets with orbital eccentricity\nfrom 0 to 0.9 receiving a mean flux equal to Earth's, around stars of\nluminosity ranging from $L_\\odot$ to $10^{-4}~L_\\odot$. Using here a definition\nof habitability based on the presence of surface liquid water, we find that\nmost of the planets considered can sustain surface liquid water on the dayside\nwith an ice cap on the nightside.

We\npresent a method based on matched multifrequency filters (MMF) for extracting\ncluster catalogues from SZ and X-ray surveys. We first designed an X-ray\nmatched-filter method, analogous to the classical MMF developed for SZ\nobservations. Then, we built our joint X-ray-SZ algorithm by combining our\nX-ray matched filter with the classical SZ-MMF, for which we used the physical\nrelation between SZ and X-ray observations. We show that the proposed X-ray\nmatched filter provides correct photometry results, and that the joint matched\nfilter also provides correct photometry when the $F_{\\rm X}/Y_{500}$ relation\nof the clusters is known. Moreover, the proposed joint algorithm provides a\nbetter signal-to-noise ratio than single-map extractions, which improves the\ndetection rate even if we do not exactly know the $F_{\\rm X}/Y_{500}$ relation.\nThe proposed methods were tested using data from the ROSAT all-sky survey and\nfrom the Planck survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2016 20:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

The coevality frequency is determined by constraining the relative\nevolutionary stages of the components in a multiple system.

Herschel\nPACS photometric maps were used to sample the peak of the SED for systems with\nseparations >7\", a crucial aspect in determining the evolutionary stage of a\nprotostellar system. Inclination effects and the surrounding envelope and\noutflows were considered to decouple source geometry from evolution. This\ntogether with the shape and derived properties from the SED was used to\ndetermine each system's coevality as accurately as possible. SED models were\nused to examine the frequency of non-coevality that is due to geometry. We find\na non-coevality frequency of 33+/-10% from the comparison of SED shapes of\nresolved multiple systems. Other source parameters suggest a somewhat lower\nfrequency of non-coevality. The frequency of apparent non-coevality that is due\nto random inclination angle pairings of model SEDs is 17+/-0.5%. Observations\nof the outflow of resolved multiple systems do not suggest significant\nmisalignments within multiple systems. Effects of unresolved multiples on the\nSED shape are also investigated. We find that 1/3 of the multiple protostellar\nsystems sampled here are non-coeval, which is more than expected from random\ngeometric orientations. The other 2/3 are found to be coeval. Higher order\nmultiples show a tendency to be non-coeval. The frequency of non-coevality\nfound here is most likely due to formation and enhanced by dynamical evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2016 21:03:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

It calculates the resolution\nsolely from measured track data without using a detailed tracking simulation\nand without considering multiple Coulomb scattering effects. Two separate\nlinear track fits are performed on the same data, one excluding and the other\nincluding the hit from the probed detector. The geometric mean of the widths of\nthe corresponding exclusive and inclusive residual distributions for the probed\ndetector is then taken as a measure of the intrinsic spatial resolution of the\nprobed detector: $\\sigma=\\sqrt{\\sigma_{ex}\\cdot\\sigma_{in}}$. The validity of\nthis method is examined for a range of resolutions with a stand-alone Geant4\nMonte Carlo simulation that specifically takes multiple Coulomb scattering in\nthe tracking detector materials into account.

Many eukaryotic cells were believed\nto require an underlying substratum to migrate (crawl) by using membrane\ndeformation (like blebbing or generation of lamellipodia) but there is now\nincreasing evidence that a large variety of cells (including those of the\nimmune system) can migrate without the assistance of focal adhesion, allowing\nthem to swim as efficiently as they can crawl. This paper details the analysis\nof amoeboid swimming in a confined fluid by modeling the swimmer as an\ninextensible membrane deploying local active forces. The swimmer displays a\nrich behavior: it may settle into a straight trajectory in the channel or\nnavigate from one wall to the other depending on its confinement. The nature of\nthe swimmer is also found to be affected by confinement: the swimmer can\nbehave, on the average over one swimming cycle, as a pusher at low confinement,\nand becomes a puller at higher confinement. The swimmer's nature is thus not an\nintrinsic property. The scaling of the swimmer velocity V with the force\namplitude A is analyzed in detail showing that at small enough A, $V\\sim\nA^2/\\eta^2$, whereas at large enough A, V is independent of the force and is\ndetermined solely by the stroke frequency and swimmer size. This finding\nstarkly contrasts with currently known results found from swimming models where\nmotion is based on flagellar or ciliary activity, where $V\\sim A/\\eta$. To\nconclude, two definitions of efficiency as put forward in the literature are\nanalyzed with distinct outcomes. We find that one type of efficiency has an\noptimum as a function of confinement while the other does not. Future\nperspectives are outlined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2016 22:08:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Aug 2016 18:23:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-19"}

Spectroscopic\nresources are limited, so in the absence of real-time SN spectra these surveys\nmust rely on host galaxy spectra to obtain accurate redshifts for the Hubble\ndiagram and to improve photometric classification of SNe. In addition, SN\nluminosities are known to correlate with host-galaxy properties. Therefore,\nreliable identification of host galaxies is essential for cosmology and SN\nscience. We simulate SN events and their locations within their host galaxies\nto develop and test methods for matching SNe to their hosts. We use both real\nand simulated galaxy catalog data from the Advanced Camera for Surveys General\nCatalog and MICECATv2.0, respectively. We also incorporate \"hostless\" SNe\nresiding in undetected faint hosts into our analysis, with an assumed hostless\nrate of 5%. Our fully automated algorithm is run on catalog data and matches\nSNe to their hosts with 91% accuracy. We find that including a machine learning\ncomponent, run after the initial matching algorithm, improves the accuracy\n(purity) of the matching to 97% with a 2% cost in efficiency (true positive\nrate). Although the exact results are dependent on the details of the survey\nand the galaxy catalogs used, the method of identifying host galaxies we\noutline here can be applied to any transient survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2016 22:51:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jun 2016 19:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

When inside the queue, the speed of a vehicle is\nproportional to a power $m >0$ of the distance to the vehicle in front. The\nservice rate of HTQ is equal to the sum of the speeds of the vehicles, and has\na complex dependency on the state (vehicle locations) of the system. We show\nthat the service-rate increases (resp., decreases) in between arrivals and\ndepartures for $m<1$ (resp., $m>1$) case. For a given initial condition, we\ndefine the throughput of such a queue as the largest arrival rate under which\nthe queue length remains bounded. We extend the busy period calculations for\nM/G/1 queue to our setting, including for non-empty initial condition.

Our experiments show that we can reduce the memory\ncost of a 1,000-layer deep residual network from 48G to 7G with only 30 percent\nadditional running time cost on ImageNet problems. Similarly, significant\nmemory cost reduction is observed in training complex recurrent neural networks\non very long sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2016 04:15:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2016 19:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-25"}

Articulated hand pose estimation is still an\nopen problem and under intensive research from both academia and industry.\n  The 2 approaches used for hand pose estimation are: discriminative and\ngenerative.

In conventional superconductors, the\nelectron-phonon interaction induces attraction between electrons near the Fermi\nenergy and results in a sign-preserved s-wave pairing. For high-temperature\nsuperconductors, including cuprates and iron-based superconductors, prevalent\nweak coupling theories suggest that the electron pairing is mediated by spin\nfluctuations which lead to repulsive interactions, and therefore that a\nsign-reversed pairing with an s+-or d-wave symmetry is favored. Here, by using\nmagnetic neutron scattering, a phase sensitive probe of superconducting gap, we\nreport the observation of a transition from the sign-reversed to sign-preserved\nCooper-pairing symmetry with insignificant changes in Tc in the S-doped iron\nselenide superconductors KxFe2-y(Se1-zSz)2.

In order to study this\nevolution it is important to sample the galaxies at various times in a\nconsistent way through time. In regular luminosity selected samples, our\nanalyses are biased towards the brightest galaxies at all times (as these are\neasier to observe and identify). A complementary method relies on the\nabsorption imprint from neutral gas in galaxies, the so-called damped Ly-alpha\nabsorbers (DLAs) seen towards distant bright objects. This thesis seeks to\nunderstand how the absorption selected galaxies relate to the emission selected\ngalaxies by identifying the faint glow from the absorbing galaxies at redshift\nz~2.\n  In the last Chapter, a study of the more evolved, massive galaxies is\npresented. These galaxies are observed to be a factor of 2 to 6 times smaller\nthan local galaxies of similar masses. A new spectroscopically selected sample\nis presented and the increased precision of the redshifts allows a more\ndetailed measurement of the scatter in the mass-size relation. The size\nevolution of massive, quiescent galaxies is modelled by a `dilution' scenario,\nin which progressively larger galaxies at later times are added to the\npopulation of denser galaxies, causing an increase of the mean size of the\npopulation. This model describes the evolution of both sizes and number\ndensities very well, however, the scatter in the model increases with time,\ncontrary to the data. It is thus concluded that a combination of `dilution' and\nindividual growth, e.g., through mergers, is needed.\n  For brevity, the individual chapters based on published peer-reviewed\narticles are omitted and a link to the given article is given instead.\n  Principal supervisor: Johan P.

Using data from 23 different Scopus\ncategories, this article tests the assumption that removing a proportion of\nuncited articles from a citation dataset allows statistical distributions to\nhave much closer fits. It also introduces two new models, zero inflated\ndiscretised lognormal distribution and the zero inflated hooked power law\ndistribution and algorithms to fit them. In all 23 cases, the zero inflated\nversion of the discretised lognormal distribution was an improvement on the\nstandard version and in 15 out of 23 cases the zero inflated version of the\nhooked power law was an improvement on the standard version. Without zero\ninflation the discretised lognormal models fit the data better than the hooked\npower law distribution 6 out of 23 times and with it, the discretised lognormal\nmodels fit the data better than the hooked power law distribution 9 out of 23\ntimes. Apparently uncitable articles seem to occur due to the presence of\nacademic-related magazines in Scopus categories.

In\nthis paper, we propose to address the challenge by learning a latent matching\nmodel, using not only click-through data but also semantic knowledge. The\nsemantic knowledge can be categories of queries and documents as well as\nsynonyms of words, manually or automatically created. Specifically, we\nincorporate semantic knowledge into the objective function by including\nregularization terms. We develop two methods to solve the learning task on the\nbasis of coordinate descent and gradient descent respectively, which can be\nemployed in different settings.

High-resolution,\nhigh-cadence, H$\\alpha$ line scanning images were taken to observe different\nlayers of the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to upper chromosphere. We\nstudy the distribution of power in different period-bands at different heights.\nPower maps of the upper photosphere and the lower chromosphere show suppressed\npower surrounding the magnetic-network elements, known as \"magnetic shadows\".\nThese also show enhanced power close to the photosphere, traditionally referred\nto as \"power halos\". The interaction between acoustic waves and inclined\nmagnetic fields is generally believed to be responsible for these two effects.\nIn this study we explore if small-scale transients can influence the\ndistribution of power at different heights. We show that the presence of\ntransients, like mottles, Rapid Blueshifted Excursions (RBEs) and Rapid\nRedshifted Excursions (RREs), can strongly influence the power-maps. The short\nand finite lifetime of these events strongly affects all powermaps, potentially\ninfluencing the observed power distribution.

While\nselection is certainly responsible for the spread and maintenance of complex\nphenotypes, this does not automatically imply that strong selection enhances\nthe chance for the emergence of novel traits, that is, the origination of\ncomplexity. Population size is one parameter that alters the relative\nimportance of adaptive and non-adaptive processes: as population size\ndecreases, selection weakens and genetic drift grows in importance. Because of\nthis relationship, many theories invoke a role for population size in the\nevolution of complexity. Such theories are difficult to test empirically\nbecause of the time required for the evolution of complexity in biological\npopulations. Here, we used digital experimental evolution to test whether large\nor small asexual populations tend to evolve greater complexity. We find that\nboth small and large---but not intermediate-sized---populations are favored to\nevolve larger genomes, which provides the opportunity for subsequent increases\nin phenotypic complexity. However, small and large populations followed\ndifferent evolutionary paths towards these novel traits. Small populations\nevolved larger genomes by fixing slightly deleterious insertions, while large\npopulations fixed rare beneficial insertions that increased genome size. These\nresults demonstrate that genetic drift can lead to the evolution of complexity\nin small populations and that purifying selection is not powerful enough to\nprevent the evolution of complexity in large populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2016 13:36:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-17"}

We include\nthe Coriolis force effect, induced by orbital motion and enhanced by the wind\npresence. Large-scale evolution of the jet is sketched accounting for\nwind-to-jet thrust transfer, total energy conservation, and wind-jet flow\nmixing. If the angle of the wind-induced jet bending is larger than its\nhalf-opening angle, the following is expected: (i) a strong recollimation\nshock; (ii) bending against orbital motion, caused by Coriolis forces and\nenhanced by the wind presence; and (iii) non-ballistic helical propagation\nfurther away. Even if disrupted, the jet can reaccelerate due to ambient\npressure gradients, but wind entrainment can weaken this acceleration. On large\nscales, the opening angle of the helical structure is determined by the\nwind-jet thrust relation, and the wind-loaded jet flow can be rather slow.

In the past, entity pairs and relations were\nrepresented as learned vectors with compatibility determined by a scoring\nfunction, limiting generalization to unseen text patterns and entities.\nRecently, 'column-less' versions of Universal Schema have used compositional\npattern encoders to generalize to all text patterns. In this work we take the\nnext step and propose a 'row-less' model of universal schema, removing explicit\nentity pair representations. Instead of learning vector representations for\neach entity pair in our training set, we treat an entity pair as a function of\nits relation types. In experimental results on the FB15k-237 benchmark we\ndemonstrate that we can match the performance of a comparable model with\nexplicit entity pair representations using a model of attention over relation\ntypes. We further demonstrate that the model per- forms with nearly the same\naccuracy on entity pairs never seen during training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2016 15:39:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-22"}

Planetary embryos large enough to become giant\nplanets do not form beyond the ice line within a typical disk lifetime unless\nicy pebbles stick at higher speeds than in experiments using rocky pebbles.\nSystems like the Solar System (small inner planets, giant outer planets) can\nform if (i) icy pebbles are stickier than rocky pebbles, and (ii) the\nplanetesimal formation efficiency increases with pebble size, which prevents\nthe formation of massive terrestrial planets. Growth beyond the ice line is\ndominated by pebble accretion. Most growth occurs early, when the surface\ndensity of pebbles is high due to inward drift of pebbles from the outer disk.\nGrowth is much slower after the outer disk is depleted. The outcome is\nsensitive to the disk radius and turbulence level, which control the lifetime\nand maximum size of pebbles. The outcome is sensitive to the size of the\nlargest planetesimals since there is a threshold mass for the onset of pebble\naccretion. The planetesimal formation rate is unimportant provided that some\nlarge planetesimals form while pebbles remain abundant. Two outcomes are seen,\ndepending on whether pebble accretion begins while pebbles are still abundant.\nEither (i) multiple gas giant planets form beyond the ice line, small planets\nform close to the star, and a Kuiper-belt-like disk of bodies is scattered\noutwards by the giant planets; or (ii) no giants form and bodies remain\nEarth-mass or smaller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2016 15:41:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}
