In order to investigate how the disformal\ncoupling affects the structure of relativistic stars, we propose a minimal\nmodel of a massless scalar-tensor theory and investigate in detail how the\ndisformal coupling affects the spontaneous scalarization of slowly rotating\nneutron stars.

In this paper, we present the CoRoGEE dataset -- obtained\nfrom CoRoT lightcurves for 606 red giant stars in two fields of the Galactic\ndisc which have been co-observed for an ancillary project of APOGEE. We have\nused the Bayesian parameter estimation code PARAM to calculate distances,\nextinctions, masses, and ages for these stars in a homogeneous analysis,\nresulting in relative statistical uncertainties of $\\sim2\\%$ in distance,\n$\\sim4\\%$ in radius, $\\sim9\\%$ in mass and $\\sim25\\%$ in age. We also assess\nsystematic age uncertainties due to different input physics and mass loss. We\ndiscuss the correlation between ages and chemical abundance patterns of field\nstars over a large radial range of the Milky Way's disc (5 kpc $<R_{\\rm Gal}<$\n14 kpc), focussing on the [$\\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H]-age plane in five radial bins of\nthe Galactic disc. We find an overall agreement with the expectations of\nchemical-evolution models computed before the present data were available,\nespecially for the outer regions. However, our data also indicate that a\nsignificant fraction of stars now observed near and beyond the Solar\nNeighbourhood migrated from inner regions. Mock CoRoGEE observations of a\nchemo-dynamical Milky Way disc model show that the number of high-metallicity\nstars in the outer disc is too high to be accounted for even by the strong\nradial mixing present in the model. The mock observations also reveal that the\nage distribution of the [$\\alpha$/Fe]-enhanced sequence in the CoRoGEE\ninner-disc field is much broader than expected from a combination of radial\nmixing and observational errors. We suggest that a thick disc/bulge component\nthat formed stars for more than 3 Gyr may account for these discrepancies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 17:36:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2016 12:28:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

This implies, in particular, considering besides the standard\nEinstein-Hilbert-Palatini term, other terms that either do not change the\nequations of motion, or are topological in nature.

In this\nwork, we consider spacetimes that include a boundary at infinity, satisfying\nasymptotically flat boundary conditions and/or an internal boundary satisfying\nisolated horizons boundary conditions. We focus on the covariant Hamiltonian\nformalism where the phase space $\\Gamma$ is given by solutions to the equations\nof motion. For each of the possible terms contributing to the action we\nconsider the well posedness of the action, its finiteness, the contribution to\nthe symplectic structure, and the Hamiltonian and Noether charges. For the\nchosen boundary conditions, standard boundary terms warrant a well posed\ntheory. Furthermore, the boundary and topological terms do not contribute to\nthe symplectic structure, nor the Hamiltonian conserved charges.

This framework of \"three-dimensional learning\" is based on the\nliterature about how people learn science and how we can help students put\ntheir knowledge to use. Recently, similar changes are underway in higher\neducation by incorporating three-dimensional learning into college science\ncourses. As these transformations move forward, it will become important to\nassess three-dimensional learning both to align assessments with the learning\nenvironment, and to assess the extent of the transformations. In this paper we\nintroduce the Three-Dimensional Learning Assessment Protocol (3D-LAP), which is\ndesigned to characterize and support the development of assessment tasks in\nbiology, chemistry, and physics that align with transformation efforts.

We aim to demonstrate that by using temporal information,\nthe human pose estimation results can be improved over image based pose\nestimation methods. In contrast to the commonly employed graph optimization\nformulation, which is NP-hard and needs approximate solutions, we formulate\nthis problem into a unified two stage tree-based optimization problem for which\nan efficient and exact solution exists. Although the proposed method finds an\nexact solution, it does not sacrifice the ability to model the spatial and\ntemporal constraints between body parts in the frames; in fact it models the\n{\\em symmetric} parts better than the existing methods. The proposed method is\nbased on two main ideas: `Abstraction' and `Association' to enforce the intra-\nand inter-frame body part constraints without inducing extra computational\ncomplexity to the polynomial time solution. Using the idea of `Abstraction', a\nnew concept of `abstract body part' is introduced to conceptually combine the\nsymmetric body parts and model them in the tree based body part structure.\nUsing the idea of `Association', the optimal tracklets are generated for each\nabstract body part, in order to enforce the spatiotemporal constraints between\nbody parts in adjacent frames. A sequence of the best poses is inferred from\nthe abstract body part tracklets through the tree-based optimization. Finally,\nthe poses are refined by limb alignment and refinement schemes. We evaluated\nthe proposed method on three publicly available video based human pose\nestimation datasets, and obtained dramatically improved performance compared to\nthe state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 18:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

By\nmeasuring the shapes of large numbers of galaxies (millions in recent surveys,\nup to tens of billions in future surveys) we can infer the parameters that\ndetermine cosmology. Imperfections in the detectors used to record images of\nthe sky can introduce changes in the apparent shape of galaxies, which in turn\ncan bias the inferred cosmological parameters. In this paper we consider the\neffect of two widely discussed sensor imperfections: tree-rings, due to\nimpurity gradients which cause transverse electric fields in the Charge-Coupled\nDevices (CCD), and pixel-size variation, due to periodic CCD fabrication\nerrors. These imperfections can be observed when the detectors are subject to\nuniform illumination (flat field images).

Indirect encodings can potentially answer this\nchallenge. Yet in practice, indirect encodings do not yield effective\nmultimodal controllers. Thus, this paper introduces novel multimodal extensions\nto HyperNEAT, a popular indirect encoding. A previous multimodal HyperNEAT\napproach called situational policy geometry assumes that multiple brains\nbenefit from being embedded within an explicit geometric space. However,\nexperiments here illustrate that this assumption unnecessarily constrains\nevolution, resulting in lower performance. Specifically, this paper introduces\nHyperNEAT extensions for evolving many brains without assuming geometric\nrelationships between them. The resulting Multi-Brain HyperNEAT can exploit\nhuman-specified task divisions to decide when each brain controls the agent, or\ncan automatically discover when brains should be used, by means of preference\nneurons. A further extension called module mutation allows evolution to\ndiscover the number of brains, enabling multimodal behavior with even less\nexpert knowledge. Experiments in several multimodal domains highlight that\nmulti-brain approaches are more effective than HyperNEAT without multimodal\nextensions, and show that brains without a geometric relation to each other\noutperform situational policy geometry. The conclusion is that Multi-Brain\nHyperNEAT provides several promising techniques for evolving complex multimodal\nbehavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 19:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

In general, this transformation can be approximated by the addition\nof a constant surface mass density sheet. We propose a new technique to break\nthe mass sheet degeneracy. The method uses mass moments of the shear or flexion\nfields in combination with convergence information derived from number counts\nwhich exploit the magnification bias. The difference between the measured mass\nmoments provides an estimator for the magnitude of the additive constant that\nis the mass-sheet. For demonstrating this, we derive relations that hold true\nin general for n-th order moments and show how they can be employed effectively\nto break the degeneracy. We investigate the detectability of this degeneracy\nparameter from our method and find that the degeneracy parameter can be\nfeasibly determined from stacked galaxy-galaxy lensing data and cluster lensing\ndata. Furthermore, we compare the signal-to-noise ratios of convergence\ninformation from number counts with shear and flexion for SIS and NFW models.\nWe find that the combination of shear and flexion performs best on galaxy and\ncluster scales and the convergence information can therefore be used to break\nthe mass sheet degeneracy without quality loss in the mass reconstruction. In\nsummary, there is power in the combination of shear, flexion, convergence and\ntheir higher order moments. With the anticipated wealth of lensing data from\nupcoming and future satellite missions - EUCLID and WFIRST - this technique\nwill be feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 20:01:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2016 14:07:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

A blackbox has a temperature that is just above that of the cosmic\nmicrowave background. The screen can be made from artificial dust pervading the\ngalaxy. I show that there is enough material in galaxies to build blackboxes if\nthe dust is fashioned into dipole antennas. The thermal emission of a blackbox\nmakes it a bright microwave source. I examine the Planck Catalog of Compact\nSources to constrain the abundance of blackboxes. None of the 100 GHz sources\nhas the spectrum expected of a blackbox.

Our emphasis is on a class of channels that we\ncall photon-added Gaussian channels, which are experimentally viable with\ncurrent quantum-optical technologies. A strong motivation for considering these\nchannels is the fact that it is compulsory to go beyond the Gaussian domain for\nnumerous tasks in continuous-variable quantum information processing such as\nentanglement distillation from Gaussian states and universal quantum\ncomputation. The single-mode photon-added channels we consider are obtained by\nusing two-mode beam splitters and squeezing operators with photon addition\napplied to the ancilla ports giving rise to families of non-Gaussian channels.\nFor each such channel, we derive its operator-sum representation, indispensable\nin the present context. We observe that these channels are Fock preserving\n(coherence nongenerating). We then report two examples of activation using our\nscheme of photon addition, that of quantum-optical nonclassicality at outputs\nof channels that would otherwise output only classical states and of both the\nquantum and private communication capacities, hinting at far-reaching\napplications for quantum-optical communication. Further, we see that noisy\nGaussian channels can be expressed as a convex mixture of these non-Gaussian\nchannels.

Unfortunately, many students get bogged down\nwith the whole notion of tensors and never get to the punch lines: Stokes'\nTheorem, de Rham cohomology, Poincare duality, and the realization of various\ntopological invariants (e.g. the degree of a map) via forms, none of which\nactually require tensors to make sense!\n  In these notes, we'll follow a different approach, following the philosophy\nof Amy's Ice Cream: Life is uncertain. Eat dessert first.\n  We're first going to define forms on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ via unmotivated formulas,\ndevelop some proficiency with calculation, show that forms behave nicely under\nchanges of coordinates, and prove Stokes' Theorem. This approach has the\ndisadvantage that it doesn't develop deep intuition, but the strong advantage\nthat the key properties of forms emerge quickly and cleanly. Only then, in\nChapter 3, will we go back and show that tensors with certain (anti)symmetry\nproperties have the exact same properties as the formal objects that we studied\nin Chapters 1 and 2. This allows us to re-interpret all of our old results from\na more modern perspective, and move onwards to using forms to do topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 21:32:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-28"}

It is also shown that L is a multiplication ring,\nthat is, given any two ideals A,B in L with A inside B, there is always an\nideal C such that A = BC, an indication of a possible rich multiplicative ideal\ntheory for L. Existence and uniqueness of factorization of the ideals of L as\nproducts of special types of ideals such as prime, irreducible or primary\nideals is investigated. It turns out that the irreducible ideals of L are\nprecisely the primary ideals of L. It is shown that an ideal I of L is a\nproduct of finitely many prime ideals if and only the graded part gr(I) of I is\na product of prime ideals and I/gr(I) is finitely generated with a generating\nset of cardinality no more than the number of distinct prime ideals in the\nprime factorization of gr(I).

Second, a set of contextual features derived from the position and\nsize of the compared input patches are combined with the CNN output by means of\na gradient boosting classifier to generate the final matching probability. This\nlearning approach is validated by using a linear programming based multi-person\ntracker showing that even a simple and efficient tracker may outperform much\nmore complex models when fed with our learned matching probabilities.

Due to long range homogeneous hopping, a gap between the ground\nstate and the excited states can be induced, which is mathematically equivalent\nto the superconducting gap. In the gapped regime, the dynamics within the\nexcited states subspace is shielded from long range hopping, namely it occurs\nas if long range hopping would be absent. This is a cooperative phenomenon\nsince shielding is effective over a time scale which diverges with the system\nsize. We named this effect {\\it Cooperative Shielding}. We also discuss the\nconsequences of our findings on Anderson localization. Long range hopping is\nusually thought to destroy localization due to the fact that it induces an\ninfinite number of resonances. Contrary to this common lore we show that the\nexcited states display strong localized features when shielding is effective\neven in the regime of strong long range coupling. A brief discussion on the\nextension of our results to generic power-law decaying long range hopping is\nalso given.

The results for the gluon transverse\nmomentum dependent fragmentation functions are presented for the first time at\none and two loops.

We explain this conundrum using our\nneurocomputational model of face and object processing (The Model, TM). Our\nresults show that, as in the behavioral data, the correlation between\nsubordinate level face and object recognition accuracy increases as experience\ngrows. We suggest that different domains do not compete for resources because\nthe relevant features are shared between faces and objects.

Hence, our model predicts that it is the type of\nexperience that matters and that the source of the correlation is in the\nfusiform face area, rather than in cortical areas that subserve basic level\ncategorization.

We use optically trapped\nmicrosphere probes of 2-10 microns, to induce oscillatory strains and measure\nmucus stress response. We show that viscoelastic properties are highly\ndependent on the strain scale (l) with three distinct regimes emerging:\nmicroscale: l_1<4 microns, mesoscale: l_2~4-10 microns, and macroscale: l_3>10\nmicrons. While mucus response is similar to water for l_1 indicating that\nprobes rarely contact the mucus mesh, for l_2 the response is distinctly more\nviscous and independent of probe size, demonstrating that the mucus behaves as\na continuum. However, this principally viscous mesoscale response is distinct\nfrom the largely elastic macroscopic mucus response. Only for l_3 does the\nresponse mimic macroscopic elasticity, with rigid constraints strongly\nresisting microsphere displacement. Our results demonstrate that a uniform mesh\nmodel for mucus with a single lengthscale modulating the crossover from\nwater-like to elastic is too simplistic.

The morphology of the droplet\nis determined from the global minimum of the Helmholtz free energy. The contact\nangle between the droplet and the spherical substrate is expressed by the\ngeneralized Young's formula. When the line tension is positive and large, the\ncontact angle jumps discontinuously to $180^{\\circ}$, the circular contact line\nshrinks towards the top of the substrate, and the droplet detaches from the\nsubstrate, forming a spherical droplet if the substrate is hydrophobic (i.e.,\nthe Young's contact angle is large). This finding is consistent with that\npredicted by Widom [J. Phys. Chem. {\\bf 99}, 2803 (1995)]; the line tension\ninduces a drying transition on a flat substrate. On the other hand, the contact\nangle jumps to $0^{\\circ}$, the circular contact line shrinks towards the\nbottom of the substrate, and the droplet spreads over the substrate to form a\nwrapped spherical droplet if the substrate is hydrophilic (i.e., the Young's\ncontact angle is small). Therefore, not only the drying transition of a\ncap-shaped to a detached spherical droplet but also the wetting transition of a\ncap-shaped to a wrapped spherical droplet could occur on a spherical substrate\nas the surface area of the substrate is finite. When the line tension is\nnegative and its magnitude increases, the contact line asymptotically\napproaches the equator from either above or below. The droplet with a contact\nline that coincides with the equator is an isolated, singular solution of the\nfirst variational problem. In this instance, the contact line is pinned and\ncannot move as far as the line tension is smaller than the critical magnitude,\nwhere the wetting transition occurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 05:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

Based on an\nobservation that self-similarity existing within images is robust to imaging\nmodality variations, we define the descriptor with a series of an adaptive\nself-correlation similarity measure between patches sampled by a randomized\nreceptive field pooling, in which a sampling pattern is obtained using a\ndiscriminative learning. The computational redundancy of dense descriptors is\ndramatically reduced by applying fast edge-aware filtering.

One recent\npopular prior---the graph Laplacian regularizer---assumes that the target pixel\npatch is smooth with respect to an appropriately chosen graph. However, the\nmechanisms and implications of imposing the graph Laplacian regularizer on the\noriginal inverse problem are not well understood. To address this problem, in\nthis paper we interpret neighborhood graphs of pixel patches as discrete\ncounterparts of Riemannian manifolds and perform analysis in the continuous\ndomain, providing insights into several fundamental aspects of graph Laplacian\nregularization for image denoising. Specifically, we first show the convergence\nof the graph Laplacian regularizer to a continuous-domain functional,\nintegrating a norm measured in a locally adaptive metric space. Focusing on\nimage denoising, we derive an optimal metric space assuming non-local\nself-similarity of pixel patches, leading to an optimal graph Laplacian\nregularizer for denoising in the discrete domain. We then interpret graph\nLaplacian regularization as an anisotropic diffusion scheme to explain its\nbehavior during iterations, e.g., its tendency to promote piecewise smooth\nsignals under certain settings. To verify our analysis, an iterative image\ndenoising algorithm is developed. Experimental results show that our algorithm\nperforms competitively with state-of-the-art denoising methods such as BM3D for\nnatural images, and outperforms them significantly for piecewise smooth images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 06:53:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 12:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

The results show that infalling and landing of\nthe LMCs in the inner regions of the protostellar accretion disks can cause\nfaster unstable modes and less enhanced accretion rates relative to the outer\nregions. Also, more fragmentation of landed LMCs in the azimuthal direction\nhave less chance for instability, and then can produce more values of enhanced\nmass accretion rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 07:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

In terms of commonly studied\n$s$-channel mediator simplified models it is argued that at arbitrarily high\nenergies the perturbative description of dark matter production in high energy\nscattering at hadron colliders will break down in a number of cases. This is\nanalogous to the well documented breakdown of an EFT description of dark matter\ncollider production. With this in mind, to diagnose whether or not the use of\nsimplified models at the LHC is valid, perturbative unitarity of the scattering\namplitude in the processes relevant to LHC dark matter searches is studied. The\nresults are as one would expect: at the LHC and future proton colliders the\nsimplified model descriptions of dark matter production are in general valid.\nAs a result of the general discussion, a simple new class of previously\nunconsidered `Fermiophobic Scalar' simplified models is proposed, in which a\nscalar mediator couples to electroweak vector bosons. The Fermiophobic\nsimplified model is well motivated and exhibits interesting collider and direct\ndetection phenomenology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 08:41:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-28"}

However, the\ndevelopment of energy-efficient devices has been hampered by the high current\ndensities needed to initiate domain wall motion. We show here that a remarkable\nreduction in the critical current density can be achieved for in-plane\nmagnetised coupled domain walls in CoFe/Ru/CoFe synthetic ferrimagnet tracks.\nThe antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the layers leads to simple\nN\\'{e}el wall structures, imaged using photoemission electron and Lorentz\ntransmission electron microscopy, with a width of only $\\sim 100$~nm. The\nmeasured critical current density to set these walls in motion, detected using\nmagnetotransport measurements, is $1.0 \\times 10^{11}$~Am$^{-2}$, almost an\norder of magnitude lower than in a ferromagnetically coupled control sample.\nTheoretical modelling indicates that this is due to nonadiabatic driving of\nanisotropically coupled walls, a mechanism that can be used to design efficient\ndomain-wall devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 09:31:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 09:35:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 14:47:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 10:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-01"}

The Yule--Simon\nprocess, which has shown the ability to capture the population dynamics of\nsocial tagging behavior, does not handle the mechanism of new vocabulary\ncreation because it assumes that new vocabulary creation is a Poisson-like\nrandom process. In this research, we focus on the mechanism of vocabulary\ncreation from the microscopic perspective and discuss whether it also follows\nthe random process assumed in the Yule--Simon process. To capture the\nmicroscopic mechanism of vocabulary creation, we focus on the relationship\nbetween the number of tags used in the same entry and the local vocabulary\ncreation rate. We find that the relationship is not the result of a simple\nrandom process, and differs between services.

For instance the\nstrain in the weak formulation can be replaced by the gradient to decouple the\nvelocity components in the different coordinate directions. Thus the\ndiscretization of the simplified problem leads to fewer nonzero entries in the\nstiffness matrix. This is of particular interest in large scale simulations\nwhere a reduced memory bandwidth requirement can help to significantly\naccelerate the computations. In the case of a piecewise constant viscosity, as\nit typically arises in multi-phase flows, or when the boundary conditions\ninvolve traction, the situation is more complex, and one has to treat the cross\nderivatives in the original Stokes system with care. A naive application of the\nstandard vectorial Laplacian results in a physically incorrect solution, while\nformulations based on the strain increase the computational effort everywhere,\neven when the inconsistencies arise only from an incorrect treatment in a small\nfraction of the computational domain. Here we propose a new approach that is\nconsistent with the strain-based formulation and preserves the decoupling\nadvantages of the gradient-based formulation in isoviscous subdomains. The\nmodification is equivalent to locally changing the discretization stencils,\nhence the more expensive discretization is restricted to a lower dimensional\ninterface, making the additional computational cost asymptotically negligible.\nWe demonstrate the consistency and convergence properties of the method and\nshow that in a massively parallel setup, the multigrid solution of the\nresulting discrete systems is faster than for the classical strain-based\nformulation. Moreover, we give an application example which is inspired by\ngeophysical research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 09:40:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-28"}

We show that changing the way of data selection for optimisation of\nnetwork parameters, we can save computation cost up to 12 times. We extend deep\nlearning approaches for saliency prediction in still images with RGB values to\nspecificity of video using the sensitivity of the human visual system to\nresidual motion. Furthermore, we complete primary colour pixel values by\ncontrast features proposed in classical visual attention prediction models. The\nexperiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets. The first is\nIRCCYN video database containing 31 videos with an overall amount of 7300\nframes and eye fixations of 37 subjects. The second one is HOLLYWOOD2 provided\n2517 movie clips with the eye fixations of 19 subjects. On IRCYYN dataset, the\naccuracy obtained is of 89.51%. On HOLLYWOOD2 dataset, results in prediction of\nsaliency of patches show the improvement up to 2% with regard to RGB use only.\nThe resulting accuracy of 76, 6% is obtained.

A\nrelative fractal drum (or RFD, in short) is an ordered pair $(A,\\Omega)$ of\nsubsets of the Euclidean space (under some mild assumptions) which generalizes\nthe notion of a (compact) subset and that of a fractal string. By a fractal\ntube formula for an RFD $(A,\\Omega)$, we mean an explicit expression for the\nvolume of the $t$-neighborhood of $A$ intersected by $\\Omega$ as a sum of\nresidues of a suitable meromorphic function (here, a fractal zeta function)\nover the complex dimensions of the RFD $(A,\\Omega)$. The complex dimensions of\nan RFD are defined as the poles of its meromorphically continued fractal zeta\nfunction (namely, the distance or the tube zeta function), which generalizes\nthe well-known geometric zeta function for fractal strings.

After subtracting the contribution from the companion\nstar, the Cen X-4 data can be described by a single power law correlation of\nthe form $L_{opt}\\propto\\,L_{X}^{0.44}$, consistent with disk reprocessing. We\nfind a similar correlation slope for V404 Cyg in quiescence (0.46) and a\nsteeper one (0.56) in the outburst hard state of 1989. However, V404 Cyg is\nabout $160-280$ times optically brighter, at a given $3-9$ keV X-ray\nluminosity, compared to Cen X-4. This ratio is a factor of 10 smaller in\nquiescence, where the normalization of the V404 Cyg correlation also changes.\nWe show that once the bolometric X-ray emission is considered and the known\nmain differences between V404 Cyg and Cen X-4 are taken into account (a larger\ncompact object mass, accretion disk size, and the presence of a strong jet\ncontribution in the hard state for the black hole system) the two systems lie\non the same correlation.

In\nthe resource theory of coherence free states are diagonal in some fixed basis,\nand free operations are those which cannot create coherence for some particular\nexperimental realization. Recently, some problems of this approach have been\ndiscussed, and new sets of operations have been proposed to resolve these\nproblems. As an example for such a problem, a quantum operation can be\nincoherent in one particular experimental realization, but it still can create\nlarge amount of coherence in another. This problem is resolved by the framework\nof genuine quantum coherence. Here, we investigate this concept further and\nstudy other more general sets of operations which cannot create coherence in\nany experimental realization. We analyze in detail the mathematical structure\nof this class of maps and use this to study possible state transformations\nunder these operations. We show that deterministic manipulation is severely\nlimited, even in the asymptotic settings. In particular, this framework does\nnot have a unique golden unit, i.e., there is no single state from which all\nother states can be created deterministically with the free operations. On the\nother hand, we show that these theories allow for a richer structure in what\ncomes to stochastic manipulation of states. In particular, we determine the\noptimal probability of conversion among pure states with genuinely incoherent\noperations. Still, the aforementioned limitations suggest that any reasonably\npowerful resource theory of coherence must contain free operations which can\npotentially create coherence in some experimental realization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 12:03:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Dec 2016 18:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-26"}

Cooler (K, M) stars\ntypically yield ages that are systematically younger than warmer (A, F, G)\nstars by a factor of two. I explore the possibility that these age\ndiscrepancies are the result of magnetic inhibition of convection in cool young\nstars by using magnetic stellar evolution isochrones to determine the age of\nthe Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB Association. A median\nage of 10 Myr consistent across spectral types A through M is found, except for\na subset of F-type stars that appear significantly older. Agreement is shown\nfor ages derived from the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and from the empirical\nmass-radius relationship defined by eclipsing multiple-star systems. Surface\nmagnetic field strengths required to produce agreement are of order 2.5 kG and\nare predicted from a priori estimates of equipartition values. A region in the\nHR diagram is identified that plausibly connects stars whose structures are\nweakly influenced by the presence of magnetic fields with those whose\nstructures are strongly influenced by magnetic fields. The models suggest this\nregion is characterized by stars with rapidly thinning outer convective\nenvelopes where the radiative core mass is greater than 75% of the total\nstellar mass. Furthermore, depletion of lithium predicted from magnetic models\nappears in better agreement with observed lithium equivalent widths than\npredictions from non-magnetic models. These results suggest that magnetic\ninhibition of convection plays an important role in the early evolution of\nlow-mass stars and that it may be responsible for noted age discrepancies in\nyoung stellar populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 12:24:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 10:11:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

Consequently, processors spend a long time waiting to access data\nfrom main memory, making the long main memory access latency one of the most\ncritical bottlenecks to achieving high system performance. Unfortunately, the\nlatency of DRAM has remained almost constant in the past decade. This is mainly\nbecause DRAM has been optimized for cost-per-bit, rather than access latency.\nAs a result, DRAM latency is not reducing with technology scaling, and\ncontinues to be an important performance bottleneck in modern and future\nsystems.\n  This dissertation seeks to achieve low latency DRAM-based memory systems at\nlow cost in three major directions. First, based on the observation that long\nbitlines in DRAM are one of the dominant sources of DRAM latency, we propose a\nnew DRAM architecture, Tiered-Latency DRAM (TL-DRAM), which divides the long\nbitline into two shorter segments using an isolation transistor, allowing one\nsegment to be accessed with reduced latency. Second, we propose a fine-grained\nDRAM latency reduction mechanism, Adaptive-Latency DRAM, which optimizes DRAM\nlatency for the common operating conditions for individual DRAM module. Third,\nwe propose a new technique, Architectural-Variation-Aware DRAM (AVA-DRAM),\nwhich reduces DRAM latency at low cost, by profiling and identifying only the\ninherently slower regions in DRAM to dynamically determine the lowest latency\nDRAM can operate at without causing failures.\n  This dissertation provides a detailed analysis of DRAM latency by using both\ncircuit-level simulation with a detailed DRAM model and FPGA-based profiling of\nreal DRAM modules. Our latency analysis shows that our low latency DRAM\nmechanisms enable significant latency reductions, leading to large improvement\nin both system performance and energy efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 12:35:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-01"}

It applies to reduced-order finite-dimensional models of fluid\nflows, expressed as a set of first-order nonlinear ordinary differential\nequations with the right-hand side being a polynomial function in the state\nvariables and in the controls. The key idea, first discussed in Chernyshenko et\nal. 2014, Philos. T. Roy. Soc. 372(2020), is that the difficulties of treating\nand optimising long-time averages of a cost are relaxed by using the\nupper/lower bounds of such averages as the objective function. In this setting,\ncontrol design reduces to finding a feedback controller that optimises the\nbound, subject to a polynomial inequality constraint involving the cost\nfunction, the nonlinear system, the controller itself and a tunable polynomial\nfunction. A numerically tractable approach to the solution of such optimisation\nproblems, based on Sum-of-Squares techniques and semidefinite programming, is\nproposed.\n  To showcase the methodology, the mitigation of the fluctuation kinetic energy\nin the unsteady wake behind a circular cylinder in the laminar regime at\nRe=100, via controlled angular motions of the surface, is numerically\ninvestigated. A compact reduced-order model that resolves the long-term\nbehaviour of the fluid flow and the effects of actuation, is derived using\nProper Orthogonal Decomposition and Galerkin projection. In a full-information\nsetting, feedback controllers are then designed to reduce the long-time average\nof the kinetic energy associated with the limit cycle. These controllers are\nthen implemented in direct numerical simulations of the actuated flow. Control\nperformance, energy efficiency, and physical control mechanisms identified are\nanalysed. Key elements, implications and future work are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 13:42:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 10:50:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

Such arguments are\noften cumbersome as the linearization points' position in time can be dynamic\n(depend on the interference, run-time values and events from the past, or even\nfuture), non-local (appear in procedures other than the one considered), and\nwhose position in the execution trace may only be determined after the\nconsidered procedure has already terminated.\n  In this paper we propose a new method, based on a separation-style logic, for\nreasoning about concurrent objects with such linearization points. We embrace\nthe dynamic nature of linearization points, and encode it as part of the data\nstructure's auxiliary state, so that it can be dynamically modified in place by\nauxiliary code, as needed when some appropriate run-time event occurs. We name\nthe idea linking-in-time, because it reduces temporal reasoning to spatial\nreasoning. For example, modifying a temporal position of a linearization point\ncan be modeled similarly to a pointer update in separation logic. Furthermore,\nthe auxiliary state provides a convenient way to concisely express the\nproperties essential for reasoning about clients of such concurrent objects.

A common trait of these processes is that the mixing interface is\nstrained by shear. Depending on the P\\'eclet number $Pe$, which represents the\nratio of the characteristic diffusion time to the characteristic advection\ntime, and the Damk\\\"ohler number $Da$, which represents the ratio of the\ncharacteristic diffusion time to the characteristic reaction time, the local\nreaction rates can be strongly impacted by the dynamics of the mixing\ninterface. This impact has been characterized mostly either in kinetics-limited\nor in mixing-limited conditions, that is, for either very low or very high\n$Da$. Here the coupling of shear flow and chemical reactivity is investigated\nfor arbitrary Damk\\\"ohler numbers, for a bimolecular reaction and an initial\ninterface with separated reactants. Approximate analytical expressions for the\nglobal production rate and reactive mixing scale are derived based on a\nreactive lamella approach that allows for a general coupling between stretching\nenhanced mixing and chemical reactions. While for $Pe<Da$, reaction kinetics\nand stretching effects are decoupled, a scenario which we name \"weak\nstretching\", for $Pe>Da$, we uncover a \"strong stretching\" scenario where new\nscaling laws emerge from the interplay between reaction kinetics, diffusion,\nand stretching. The analytical results are validated against numerical\nsimulations. These findings shed light on the effect of flow heterogeneity on\nthe enhancement of chemical reaction and the creation of spatially localized\nhotspots of reactivity for a broad range of systems ranging from kinetic\nlimited to mixing limited situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 14:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-28"}

The interpolation functions are\nlocalized structure-adapted linear combinations of spherical waves, socalled\nunitary spherical waves (USWs), centered at the spheres where they have\ncubic-harmonic character. Input to the interpolation are the coefficients in\nthe cubic-harmonic expansion of the target function at and slightly outside the\nspheres; specifically, the values and 3 first radial derivatives. To fit this,\nwe use USWs with 4 negative energies. Each interpolation function is actually a\nlinear combination of these 4 sets of USWs with the following properties: (1)\nIt is centered at a specific sphere where it has a specific cubic-harmonic\ncharacter and radial derivative.

First, we show that\nwhen the salinity profile is linear and confined between two non stratified\nlayers at top and bottom, only two separate shallow fluid layers can be\ndestabilized. These unstable layers appear nearby the top and the bottom of the\ntank with a stratified motionless zone between them. This laboratory\narrangement is thus particularly interesting to model geophysical or\nastrophysical situations where stratified regions are often juxtaposed to\nconvective ones. Then, for more general but stable initial density profiles,\nstatistical measures are introduced to quantify the extent of the baroclinic\ninstability at given depths and to analyze the connections between this\ndepth-dependence and the vertical salinity profiles. We find that, although the\npresence of stable stratification generally hinders full-depth overturning,\ndouble-diffusive convection can yield development of multicellular sideways\nconvection in shallow layers and subsequently to a multilayered baroclinic\ninstability. Therefore we conclude that by decreasing the characteristic\nvertical scale of the flow, stratification may even enhance the formation of\ncyclonic and anticyclonic eddies (and thus, mixing) in a local sense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 15:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

It is for instance essential in analog signal computing\nthrough the design of components such as delay lines and buffers, and it is one\nof the prerequisite for increased wave/matter interactions. Despite the\ninterest of a broad community, researches have mostly been conducted in optics\nalong with the development of wavelength scaled structured composite media,\nthat appear promising candidates for compact slow light components. Yet their\nminimum structural scale prevents them from being transposed to lower\nfrequencies where wavelengths range from sub-millimeter to meters.

This unwanted event can be obstructed by detection of\nelectrical changes in the brain that happen before the seizure takes place. The\nautomatic detection of seizures is necessary since the visual screening of EEG\nrecordings is a time consuming task and requires experts to improve the\ndiagnosis. Four linear least squares-based preprocessing models are proposed to\nextract key features of an EEG signal in order to detect seizures. The first\ntwo models are newly developed. The original signal (EEG) is approximated by a\nsinusoidal curve. Its amplitude is formed by a polynomial function and compared\nwith the pre developed spline function.Different statistical measures namely\nclassification accuracy, true positive and negative rates, false positive and\nnegative rates and precision are utilized to assess the performance of the\nproposed models. These metrics are derived from confusion matrices obtained\nfrom classifiers. Different classifiers are used over the original dataset and\nthe set of extracted features. The proposed models significantly reduce the\ndimension of the classification problem and the computational time while the\nclassification accuracy is improved in most cases. The first and third models\nare promising feature extraction methods. Logistic, LazyIB1, LazyIB5 and J48\nare the best classifiers. Their true positive and negative rates are $1$ while\nfalse positive and negative rates are zero and the corresponding precision\nvalues are $1$. Numerical results suggest that these models are robust and\nefficient for detecting epileptic seizure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 01:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-29"}

Therefore, the frequency\ndomain is not the same for every support graph. A consequence of this is that\nthere is no non-trivial generalization of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle,\nthat states that a signal cannot be fully localized both in the time domain and\nin the frequency domain. A way to generalize this principle, introduced by\nAgaskar and Lu, consists in determining a curve that represents a lower bound\non the compromise between precision in the graph domain and precision in the\nspectral domain.
