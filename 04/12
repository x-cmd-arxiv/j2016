For HCN\nhowever, the relative strengths of the hyperfine lines are anomalous. They\nappear in ratios which can vary significantly from source to source, and are\ninconsistent with local thermodynamic equilibrium. This is the HCN hyperfine\nanomaly, and it prevents the use of simple LTE models of HCN emission to derive\nreliable optical depths. In this paper we demonstrate how to model HCN\nhyperfine line emission, and derive accurate line ratios, spectral line shapes\nand optical depths. We show that by carrying out radiative transfer\ncalculations over each hyperfine level individually, as opposed to summing them\nover each rotational level, the anomalous hyperfine emission emerges naturally.\nTo do this requires not only accurate radiative rates between hyperfine states,\nbut also accurate collisional rates. We investigate the effects of different\nsets of hyperfine collisional rates, derived via the 'proportional method' and\nthrough direct recoupling calculations. Through an extensive parameter sweep\nover typical low mass star forming conditions, we show the HCN line ratios to\nbe highly variable to optical depth.

As\nmanual extraction of this information is very time-consuming, there has been\nextensive research effort to automatically segment the neurons to help guide\nand eventually replace manual tracing. Until recently, there has been\ncomparatively less research on automatically detecting the actual synapses\nbetween neurons. This discrepancy can, in part, be attributed to several\nfactors: obtaining neuronal shapes is a prerequisite first step in extracting a\nconnectome, manual tracing is much more time-consuming than annotating\nsynapses, and neuronal contact area can be used as a proxy for synapses in\ndetermining connections.\n  However, recent research has demonstrated that contact area alone is not a\nsufficient predictor of synaptic connection. Moreover, as segmentation has\nimproved, we have observed that synapse annotation is consuming a more\nsignificant fraction of overall reconstruction time. This ratio will only get\nworse as segmentation improves, gating overall possible speed-up. Therefore, we\naddress this problem by developing algorithms that automatically detect\npre-synaptic neurons and their post-synaptic partners. In particular,\npre-synaptic structures are detected using a Deep and Wide Multiscale Recursive\nNetwork, and post-synaptic partners are detected using a MLP with features\nconditioned on the local segmentation.\n  This work is novel because it requires minimal amount of training, leverages\nadvances in image segmentation directly, and provides a complete solution for\npolyadic synapse detection. We further introduce novel metrics to evaluate our\nalgorithm on connectomes of meaningful size. These metrics demonstrate that\ncomplete automatic prediction can be used to effectively characterize most\nconnectivity correctly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 19:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

Detailed studies of stellar populations in the galaxies should\nconstrain the proposed scenarios. In particular, the west halo of the SMC was\nrecently characterized with radial trends in age and metallicity which\nindicates tidal disruption. We increase the sample of star clusters in the west\nhalo of the SMC with homogeneous age, metallicity, and distance derivations, to\ndetermine better age and metallicity gradients.

It is widely believed that these planets formed near the\nwater-ice line of the protoplanetary disk, and subsequently migrated into much\nsmaller orbits. Most of the proposed migration mechanisms can be classified\neither as disk-driven migration, or as excitation of a very high eccentricity\nfollowed by tidal circularization. In the latter scenario, the giant planet\nthat is destined to become a hot Jupiter spends billions of years on a\nhighly-eccentric orbit, with apastron near the water-ice line. Eventually,\ntidal dissipation at periastron shrinks and circularizes the orbit. If this is\ncorrect, then it should be especially rare for hot Jupiters to be accompanied\nby another giant planet interior to the water-ice line.

Our results confirm\nthat the density profiles of the first haloes are described by a $\\sim\nr^{-1.5}$ power-law. As haloes grow in mass, their density profiles evolve\nsignificantly. In the central regions, they become shallower and reach on\naverage $\\sim r^{-1}$, the asymptotic form of an NFW profile. Using\nnon-cosmological controlled simulations, we observe that temporal variations in\nthe gravitational potential caused by major mergers lead to a shallowing of the\ninner profile. This transformation is more significant for shallower initial\nprofiles and for a higher number of merging systems. Depending on the merger\ndetails, the resulting profiles can be shallower or steeper than NFW in their\ninner regions. Interestingly, mergers have a much weaker effect when the\nprofile is given by a broken power-law with an inner slope of $-1$ (such as NFW\nor Hernquist profiles). This offers an explanation for the emergence of\nNFW-like profiles: after their initial collapse, $r^{-1.5}$ $\\chi$DM haloes\nsuffer copious major mergers, which progressively shallows the profile. Once an\nNFW-like profile is established, subsequent merging do not change the profile\nanymore. This suggests that halo profiles are not universal but rather a\ncombination of (1) the physics of the formation of the microhaloes and (2)\ntheir early merger history -- both set by the properties of the dark matter\nparticle -- as well as (3) the resilience of NFW-like profiles to\nperturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 20:09:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2017 21:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-06"}

In this\nlarge patch limit, we find that the attraction-repulsion crossover separation\nis inversely proportional to the square of the patch charge-density and to the\nDebye screening length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 21:05:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 10:19:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

Automatically parallelizing sequential code, to promote an\nefficient use of the available parallelism, has been a research goal for some\ntime now. This work proposes a new approach for achieving such goal. We created\na new parallelizing compiler that analyses the read and write instructions, and\ncontrol-flow modifications in programs to identify a set of dependencies\nbetween the instructions in the program. Afterwards, the compiler, based on the\ngenerated dependencies graph, rewrites and organizes the program in a\ntask-oriented structure. Parallel tasks are composed by instructions that\ncannot be executed in parallel. A work-stealing-based parallel runtime is\nresponsible for scheduling and managing the granularity of the generated tasks.\nFurthermore, a compile-time granularity control mechanism also avoids creating\nunnecessary data-structures. This work focuses on the Java language, but the\ntechniques are general enough to be applied to other programming languages. We\nhave evaluated our approach on 8 benchmark programs against OoOJava, achieving\nhigher speedups. In some cases, values were close to those of a manual\nparallelization. The resulting parallel code also has the advantage of being\nreadable and easily configured to improve further its performance manually.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 18:22:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

Feature vectors\nfrom individual landmarks, as well as pairs of landmarks tracking results are\nextracted, and normalized, with respect to the first frame in the sequence.

As such, recovery performance is remarkably\nincreased. We evaluated PACMAN in a fully-fledged main-memory DBMS running on a\n40-core machine.

For a biological\nprocess, a number of proteins need to work together to perform the job.\nProteins densely interact with each other, forming large molecular machines or\ncellular building blocks. Identification of such densely interconnected\nclusters or protein complexes from PPI networks enables us to obtain a better\nunderstanding of the hierarchy and organization of biological processes and\ncellular components. Most existing methods apply efficient graph clustering\nalgorithms on PPI networks, often failing to detect possible densely connected\nsubgraphs and overlapped subgraphs. Besides clustering-based methods, dense\nsubgraph enumeration methods have also been used, which aim to find all densely\nconnected protein sets. However, such methods are not practically tractable\neven on a small yeast PPI network, due to high computational complexity. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel approximate algorithm to efficiently enumerate\nputative protein complexes from biological networks. The key insight of our\nalgorithm is that we do not need to enumerate all dense subgraphs. Instead we\nonly need to find a small subset of subgraphs that cover as many proteins as\npossible. The problem is formulated as finding a diverse set of dense\nsubgraphs, where we develop highly effective pruning techniques to guarantee\nefficiency. To handle large networks, we take a divide-and-conquer approach to\nspeed up the algorithm in a distributed manner. By comparing with existing\nclustering and dense subgraph-based algorithms on several human and yeast PPI\nnetworks, we demonstrate that our method can detect more putative protein\ncomplexes and achieves better prediction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 04:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

Past research has shown that, employing multiple descriptors\nrather than any single descriptor leads to better recognition. The problem of\nlearning the optimal combination of the available descriptors for a particular\nclassification task is studied. Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) framework has\nbeen developed for learning an optimal combination of descriptors for object\ncategorization. Existing MKL formulations often employ block l-1 norm\nregularization which is equivalent to selecting a single kernel from a library\nof kernels. Since essentially a single descriptor is selected, the existing\nformulations maybe sub- optimal for object categorization. A MKL formulation\nbased on block l-infinity norm regularization has been developed, which chooses\nan optimal combination of kernels as opposed to selecting a single kernel. A\nComposite Multiple Kernel Learning(CKL) formulation based on mixed l-infinity\nand l-1 norm regularization has been developed. These formulations end in\nSecond Order Cone Programs(SOCP).

Interestingly, all of\nthem have similar redshifts within $\\Delta z\\sim$0.01 with velocity dispersions\nranging from 470 to 1300 km s$^{-1}$. Moreover, as the maximum separation is\n$\\sim$15 Mpc, they compose a supercluster at $z\\sim$0.91, meaning that this is\none of the most massive superclusters at this redshift to date. The galaxy\ndensity map implies that the confirmed clusters are embedded in a larger\nstructure stretching over $\\sim$100 Mpc. $\\Lambda$CDM models predict about one\nsupercluster like this in our surveyed volume, consistent with our finding so\nfar. However, there are more supercluster candidates in this field, suggesting\nthat additional studies are required to determine if the $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmological model can successfully reproduce the LSSs at high redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 05:57:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

Two calibration strategies are tested: (1) fitting of\neach fine channel independently, and (2) fitting of an nth-order polynomial for\neach ~1~MHz coarse channel with (n+1)th-order residuals (n=2,3,4). Strategy (1)\nleads to uncorrelated power in the 2D power spectrum proportional to the\nthermal noise power, thereby reducing the overall array sensitivity. Strategy\n(2) leads to correlated residuals from the fitting, and residual signal power\nwith (n+1)th-order curvature. For the residual power to be less than the\nthermal noise, the fractional amplitude of a fourth-order term in the bandpass\nacross a single coarse channel must be <2.5% (50~MHz), <0.5% (150~MHz), <0.8%\n(200~MHz).

The\nuse of confidence intervals to estimate the gain associated with each split\nleads to very effective methods, like the popular Hoeffding tree algorithm.\nFrom a statistical viewpoint, the analysis of decision tree classifiers in a\nstreaming setting requires knowing when enough new information has been\ncollected to justify splitting a leaf. Although some of the issues in the\nstatistical analysis of Hoeffding trees have been already clarified, a general\nand rigorous study of confidence intervals for splitting criteria is missing.\nWe fill this gap by deriving accurate confidence intervals to estimate the\nsplitting gain in decision tree learning with respect to three criteria:\nentropy, Gini index, and a third index proposed by Kearns and Mansour. Our\nconfidence intervals depend in a more detailed way on the tree parameters. We\nalso extend our confidence analysis to a selective sampling setting, in which\nthe decision tree learner adaptively decides which labels to query in the\nstream. We furnish theoretical guarantee bounding the probability that the\nclassification is non-optimal learning the decision tree via our selective\nsampling strategy. Experiments on real and synthetic data in a streaming\nsetting show that our trees are indeed more accurate than trees with the same\nnumber of leaves generated by other techniques and our active learning module\npermits to save labeling cost. In addition, comparing our labeling strategy\nwith recent methods, we show that our approach is more robust and consistent\nrespect all the other techniques applied to incremental decision trees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 07:59:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

In practise this means that the 'equilibrium'\nwill only be relative to fixing the slow feedback processes before comparing\npalaeoclimate sensitivity estimates with estimates from model simulations. In\naddition, information from the late Pleistocene ice age cycles indicates that\nthe climate cycles between cold and warm regimes, and the climate sensitivity\nvaries considerably between regime because of fast feedback processes changing\nrelative strength and time scales over one cycle.\n  In this paper we consider climate sensitivity for quite general climate\ndynamics.

By their\nvery nature, extreme space weather events occur rarely and, therefore,\nstatistical methods are required to determine the probability of their\noccurrence. Space weather events can be characterised by a number of natural\nphenomena such as X-ray (solar) flares, solar energetic particle (SEP) fluxes,\ncoronal mass ejections and various geophysical indices (Dst, Kp, F10.7). In\nthis paper extreme value theory (EVT) is used to investigate the probability of\nextreme solar flares. Previous work has assumed that the distribution of solar\nflares follows a power law. However such an approach can lead to a poor\nestimation of the return times of such events due to uncertainties in the tails\nof the probability distribution function. Using EVT and GOES X-ray flux data it\nis shown that the expected 150-year return level is approximately an X60 flare\nwhilst a Carrington-like flare is a one in a 100-year event. It is also shown\nthat the EVT results are consistent with flare data from the Kepler space\ntelescope mission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 09:54:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2016 12:20:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 13:40:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 13:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-20"}

It turns out\nthat there are string corrections to the field theoretical limit in the case of\na soft graviton, while for a soft dilaton the string corrections vanish. We\nthen show that the new soft theorems, including the string corrections, can be\nsimply obtained from the exchange diagrams where the soft state is attached to\nthe other external states through the three-point string vertex of three\nmassless states. In the soft-limit, the propagator of the exchanged state is\ndivergent, and at tree-level these are the only divergent contributions to the\nfull amplitude. However, they do not form a gauge invariant subset and must be\nsupplemented with extra non-singular terms. The requirement of gauge invariance\nthen fixes the complete amplitude through subsubleading order in the soft\nexpansion, reproducing exactly what one gets from the explicit calculation in\nstring theory. From this it is seen that the string corrections at\nsubsubleading order arise as a consequence of the three-point amplitude having\nstring corrections in the bosonic string. When specialized to a soft dilaton,\nit remarkably turns out that the string corrections vanish and that the\nnon-singular piece of the subsubleading term of the dilaton soft theorem is the\ngenerator of space-time special conformal transformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 11:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

Hence,\nthis communication model is particularly suited to point-to-point communication\nchannels. Several vertex coloring algorithms suited to these systems have been\nproposed. They differ mainly in the number of rounds they require and the\nnumber of colors they use. This paper considers a broadcast/receive\ncommunication model in which message collisions and message conflicts can occur\n(a collision occurs when, during the same round, messages are sent to the same\nprocess by too many neighbors; a conflict occurs when a process and one of its\nneighbors broadcast during the same round).

The dynamics of the atmospheric gas is driven by the\nirradiating host star and/or by the rotation of the objects that changes during\nits lifetime.

The anti-commutation rules for fermion annihilation, creation\noperators suggests the possibility of using anti-commuting Grassmann variables\nto represent these operators. However, in spite of the seminal work by Cahill\nand Glauber and a few applications, the use of Grassmann phase space methods in\nquantum - atom optics to treat fermionic systems is rather rare, though fermion\ncoherent states using Grassmann variables are widely used in particle physics.\n  This paper presents a phase space theory for fermion systems based on\ndistribution functionals, which replace the density operator and involve\nGrassmann fields representing anti-commuting fermion field annihilation,\ncreation operators. It is an extension of a previous phase space theory paper\nfor fermions (Paper I) based on separate modes, in which the density operator\nis replaced by a distribution function depending on Grassmann phase space\nvariables which represent the mode annihilation and creation operators. This\nfurther development of the theory is important for the situation when large\nnumbers of fermions are involved, resulting in too many modes to treat\nseparately.

It was argued earlier that the contact configuration is\ndetermined more immediately through the indentation depth than the normal\nforce, and thus the indentation depth can be considered as one of \"robust\ngoverning parameters\" of friction. Both models of friction of simple shapes and\nfractal surfaces demonstrate that the coefficient of friction of elastomers\nshould be generally a function of dimensionless combinations of sliding\nvelocity, surface gradient, relaxation time and size of micro-contacts.

We propose monadic second order logic (MSO-FO) to\nreason about sequences of database instances appearing along a run.\nUnsurprisingly, the linear-time model checking problem of DMS against MSO-FO is\nundecidable. Towards decidability, we propose under-approximate model checking\nof DMS, where the under-approximation parameter is the \"bound on recency\". In a\n$k$-recency-bounded run, only the most recent $k$ elements in the current\nactive domain may be modified by an action. More runs can be verified by\nincreasing the bound on recency. Our main result shows that recency-bounded\nmodel checking of DMS against MSO-FO is decidable, by a reduction to the\nsatisfiability problem of MSO over nested words.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 14:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

Here the fidelity of energy\nbudget and CQE theories for monsoon location is assessed in a three-dimensional\nbeta-plane model with boundary conditions representative of an off-equatorial\ncontinent with a tropical grassland and an adjacent subtropical desert. Energy\nbudget theories show mixed success for various SST and land surface albedo\nforcings, with the ITCZ being collocated with the energy flux equator but a\nnon-monotonic relationship existing between ITCZ latitude and cross-equatorial\nenergy transport.

However, most previous works only focus on a single\nmodality (tongue, face or sublingual) for diagnosis, although different\nmodalities may provide complementary information for the diagnosis of DM and\nIGR.

We find that the doping dependence of\nthe superconducting and CDW phase transition in 2D NbSe$_2$ can be understood\nby a varying electron-phonon coupling strength induced by the gate-modulated\ncarrier density and the electronic density of states near the Fermi surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 15:50:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

Yan et al. 2015 proposed that Mrk~231 is a milli-parsec black-hole\nbinary with little intrinsic reddening. We show that if the observed FUV\ncontinuum is intrinsic, as assumed by Yan et al. 2015, it fails by a factor of\nabout 100 in powering the observed strength of the near-infrared emission\nlines, and the thermal near and mid-infrared continuum. In contrast, the line\nand continuum strengths are typical for a reddened AGN spectral energy\ndistribution. We find that the HeI*/Pbeta ratio is sensitive to the spectral\nenergy distribution for a one-zone model. If this sensitivity is maintained in\ngeneral broad-line region models, then this ratio may prove a useful diagnostic\nfor heavily reddened quasars. Analysis of archival HST STIS and FOC data\nrevealed evidence that the far-UV continuum emission is resolved on size scales\nof ~40 parsecs. The lack of broad absorption lines in the far-UV continuum\nmight be explained if it were not coincident with the central engine. One\npossibility is that it is the central engine continuum reflected from the\nreceding wind on the far side of the quasar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 15:50:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jun 2016 23:54:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 9 Jul 2016 16:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

Methodology: A combination of\ncitation network analysis; analysis of Medical heading Subject (MeSH) and Gene\nOntology (GO) terms, and quantitative content analysis for patents and\nscientific literature, aimed to map the organization of Ebola research was\ncarried out. Results: We found six putative research fronts (i.e. clusters of\nhigh interconnected papers). Three research fronts are basic research on Ebola\nvirus structural proteins: glycoprotein, VP40 and VP35, respectively. There is\na fourth research front of basic research papers on pathogenesis, which is the\norganizing hub of Ebola research. A fifth research front is pre-clinical\nresearch focused on vaccines and glycoproteins. Finally, a\nclinical-epidemiology research front related to the disease outbreaks was\nidentified. The network structure of patent families shows that the dominant\ndesign is the use of Ebola virus proteins as targets of vaccines and other\nimmunological treatments. Therefore, patents network organization resembles the\norganization of the scientific literature. Specifically, the knowledge on Ebola\nwould flow from higher (clinical-epidemiology) to intermediated\n(cellular-tissular pathogenesis) to lower (molecular interactions) levels of\norganization. Conclusion: Our results suggest a strong reductionist approach\nfor Ebola research probably influenced by the lethality of the disease. On the\nother hand, the ownership profile of the patent families network and the main\nresearches relationship with the United State Army suggest a strong involvement\nof this military institution in Ebola research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 05:48:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-29"}
