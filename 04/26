This end-to-end\napproach proved surprisingly powerful. With minimum training data from humans\nthe system learns to drive in traffic on local roads with or without lane\nmarkings and on highways. It also operates in areas with unclear visual\nguidance such as in parking lots and on unpaved roads.\n  The system automatically learns internal representations of the necessary\nprocessing steps such as detecting useful road features with only the human\nsteering angle as the training signal. We never explicitly trained it to\ndetect, for example, the outline of roads.\n  Compared to explicit decomposition of the problem, such as lane marking\ndetection, path planning, and control, our end-to-end system optimizes all\nprocessing steps simultaneously. We argue that this will eventually lead to\nbetter performance and smaller systems. Better performance will result because\nthe internal components self-optimize to maximize overall system performance,\ninstead of optimizing human-selected intermediate criteria, e.g., lane\ndetection. Such criteria understandably are selected for ease of human\ninterpretation which doesn't automatically guarantee maximum system\nperformance. Smaller networks are possible because the system learns to solve\nthe problem with the minimal number of processing steps.\n  We used an NVIDIA DevBox and Torch 7 for training and an NVIDIA DRIVE(TM) PX\nself-driving car computer also running Torch 7 for determining where to drive.\nThe system operates at 30 frames per second (FPS).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2016 16:03:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-26"}

Recently, the\ndiscovery of two well-defined narrow rings was announced around the Centaur\n10199 Chariklo. The rings are assumed to be in the equatorial plane of Chariklo\nand to have circular orbits. The existence a well-defined system of rings\naround a body in such perturbed orbital region poses an interesting new\nproblem. Are the rings of Chariklo stable when perturbed by close gravitational\nencounters with the giant planets? Our approach to address this question\nconsisted of forward and backward numerical simulations of 729 clones of\nChariklo, with similar initial orbits, for a period of 100 Myrs. We found, on\naverage, that each clone suffers along its lifetime more than 150 close\nencounters with the giant planets within one Hill radius of the planet in\nquestion. We identified some extreme close encounters able to significantly\ndisrupt or to disturb the rings of Chariklo. About 3% of the clones lose the\nrings and about 4% of the clones have the ring significantly disturbed.\nTherefore, our results show that in most of the cases (more than 90%) the close\nencounters with the giant planets do not affect the stability of the rings in\nChariklo-like systems. Thus, if there is an efficient mechanism that creates\nthe rings, then these structures may be common among these kinds of Centaurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2016 16:37:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

Analytical considerations of this mechanism have shown that the\nspectral index of accelerated particles is related to the total plasma\ncompression within the reconnection region similarly to the case of diffusive\nshock acceleration mechanism. As a first step to investigate the efficiency of\nFermi acceleration in reconnection regions in producing hard energy spectra of\nparticles in the solar corona, we explore the degree of plasma compression that\ncan be achieved at reconnection sites. In particular, we aim to determine the\nconditions for the strong compressions to form. Using a two-dimensional\nresistive MHD numerical model we consider a set of magnetic field\nconfigurations where magnetic reconnection can occur including a Harris current\nsheet, a force-free current sheet, and two merging flux ropes. Plasma\nparameters are taken to be characteristic of the solar corona. Numerical\nsimulations show that strong plasma compressions ($\\geq 4$) in the reconnection\nregions can form when the plasma heating due to reconnection is efficiently\nremoved by fast thermal conduction or radiative cooling process. The radiative\ncooling process which is negligible in the typical 1 MK corona can play an\nimportant role in the low corona/transition region.

[2013], KCCA-SIS\nis scale free removing the marginal variation of features and response\nvariables. No model assumption is needed between response and predictors to\napply KCCA-SIS and it can be used in ultrahigh dimensional data analysis.\nSimilar to DC-SIS and sup- HSIC-SIS, KCCA-SIS can also be used directly to\nscreen grouped predictors and for multivariate response variables. We show that\nKCCA-SIS has the sure screening prop- erty, and has better performance through\nsimulation studies. We applied KCCA-SIS to study Autism genes in a\nspatiotemporal gene expression dataset for human brain development, and\nobtained better results based on gene ontology enrichment analysis comparing to\nthe other existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2016 18:29:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2016 15:19:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

We\nexamine the spatial variations of starburst/PDR activity and study the\ncorrelation of the [CII] line with the [NII] 205{\\textmu}m emission line coming\nexclusively from the HII regions. Methods: We present small maps of [CII] and\n[NII] lines recently observed with the GREAT receiver on board SOFIA. In\nparticular we present a super-resolution method to derive how unresolved,\nkinematically correlated structures in the beam contribute to the observed line\nshapes. Results: We find that the emission coming from the ionized gas shows a\nkinematic component in addition to the general Doppler signature of the\nmolecular gas. We interpret this as the signature of two bi-polar lobes of\nionized gas expanding out of the galactic plane.

Previous methods such as\nPosition Based or Projective Dynamics are fast, but support only limited\nselection of materials; even classical materials such as the Neo-Hookean\nelasticity are not supported. Recently, Xu et al. [2015] introduced new\n\"spline-based materials\" which can be easily controlled by artists to achieve\ndesired animation effects. Simulation of these types of materials currently\nrelies on Newton's method, which is slow, even with only one iteration per\ntimestep.

A similar outflow exists irrespective of q if the\nratio of the sound speed to the orbital speed at the injection point is\nsufficiently large, \\epsilon = c_T/v_orb > 0.15. By contrast, for cold L2\nmass-loss (\\epsilon < 0.15) from binaries with q < 0.06 or q > 0.8, the\nequatorial outflow instead remains marginally-bound and falls back to the\nbinary over tens to hundreds of binary orbits, where it experiences additional\ntidal torqueing and shocking. As the bound gas becomes virialized with the\nbinary, the luminosity of the system increases slowly at approximately constant\nphotosphere radius, causing the temperature to rise. Subsequent evolution\ndepends on the efficiency of radiative cooling. If the bound atmosphere is able\nto cool efficiently, as quantified by radiative diffusion time being shorter\nthan the advection time (t_diff/t_adv < 1), then the virialized gas collapses\nto an excretion disk, while for t_diff/t_adv > 1 an isotropic wind is formed.\nBetween these two extremes, an inflated envelope transports the heat generated\nnear the binary to the surface by meridional flows. In all cases, the radiated\nluminosity reaches a fraction ~0.01 to 0.1 of Mdot v_orb^2/2, where Mdot is the\nmass outflow rate.

Recently, computational approaches, known as gene\nprioritization methods have been used to identify candidate disease genes. Gene\nprioritization methods integrate several data sources to discover and\nprioritize the most probable candidate disease genes. In this paper, we propose\na prioritization method, called HybridRanker which is a network-based technique\nand it also uses experimental data to identify candidate cancer genes. We apply\nour proposed method on colorectal cancer data. It is notable to say that in\nHybridRanker, for considering both local and global network information of a\nprotein-protein interaction network, different algorithms such as\nshortest-path, random walk with restart and network propagation are exploited.\nBy using these algorithms, initial scores are given to genes within the\nnetwork. Furthermore, by looking through diseases with similar symptoms and\nalso comorbid diseases and by extracting their causing genes, the gene scores\nare recalculated. We also use gene-phenotype relations for an additional\nscoring of the candidate genes. Our method is validated and compared with other\nprioritization methods in leave one-out cross-validation and the comparison\nresults show the better performance of the HybridRanker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2016 20:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

For exploring disease-susceptible\ngenes, not only experimental approaches such as genome-wide association studies\n(GWAS) have been used, but also computational methods. Since experimental\napproaches are both time-consuming and expensive, numerous studies have\nutilized computational techniques to explore disease genes. These methods use\nvarious biological data sources and known disease genes to prioritize disease\ncandidate genes. In this paper, we propose a gene prioritization method\n(NRSSPrioritize), which benefits from both local and global measures of a\nprotein-protein interaction (PPI) network and also from disease similarity\nknowledge to suggest candidate genes for colorectal cancer (CRC)\nsusceptibility. Network Propagation, Random Walk with Restart, and Shortest\nPaths are three network analysis tools that are applied to a PPI network for\nthe purpose of scoring candidate genes. Also, by looking through diseases with\nsimilar symptoms to CRC and obtaining their causing genes, candidate genes are\nscored in a different way. Finally, to integrate these four different scoring\nschemes, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution\n(TOPSIS) and Analytic Network Process (ANP) methods are applied to obtain\nappropriate weights for the above four quantified measures and the weighted\nsummation of these measures are used to calculate the final score of each\ncandidate gene.

The NuSTAR\nintegrated galaxy spectrum of M83 drops quickly above 10 keV, which is also\nseen in the starburst galaxies NGC253, NGC 3310 and NGC 3256. The NuSTAR\nobservations constrain any AGN to be either highly obscured or to have an\nextremely low luminosity of $_{\\sim}^<$10$^{38}$ erg/s (10-30 keV), implying it\nis emitting at a very low Eddington ratio. An X-ray point source consistent\nwith the location of the nuclear star cluster with an X-ray luminosity of a few\ntimes 10$^{38}$ erg/s may be a low-luminosity AGN but is more consistent with\nbeing an X-ray binary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2016 20:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

We show how to do so for certain kinds of quantum\ncircuits, namely, Clifford circuits where the elementary systems are\ncontinuous-variable systems or discrete systems of odd-prime dimension. These\ntypes of circuit are distinguished by having phase-space representations that\nserve to define their classical counterparts.

The firm sequentially sets prices to earn revenue and to learn\nthe underlying demand function simultaneously. A natural heuristic for this\nproblem, commonly used in practice, is greedy iterative least squares (GILS).\nAt each time period, GILS estimates the demand as a linear function of the\nprice by applying least squares to the set of prior prices and realized\ndemands. Then a price that maximizes the revenue, given the estimated demand\nfunction, is used for the next time period. The performance is measured by the\nregret, which is the expected revenue loss from the optimal (oracle) pricing\npolicy when the demand function is known. Recently, den Boer and Zwart (2014)\nand Keskin and Zeevi (2014) demonstrated that GILS is sub-optimal. They\nintroduced algorithms which integrate forced price dispersion with GILS and\nachieve asymptotically optimal performance.\n  In this paper, we consider this dynamic pricing problem in a data-rich\nenvironment. In particular, we assume that the firm knows the expected demand\nunder a particular price from historical data, and in each period, before\nsetting the price, the firm has access to extra information (demand covariates)\nwhich may be predictive of the demand. We prove that in this setting GILS\nachieves asymptotically optimal regret of order $\\log(T)$. We also show the\nfollowing surprising result: in the original dynamic pricing problem of den\nBoer and Zwart (2014) and Keskin and Zeevi (2014), inclusion of any set of\ncovariates in GILS as potential demand covariates (even though they could carry\nno information) would make GILS asymptotically optimal.

However, most existing work focus on shorter-term (e.g. minute-long or\nhour-long) video sequences. Therefore, we propose a multi-person tracking\nalgorithm for very long-term (e.g. month-long) multi-camera surveillance\nscenarios. Long-term tracking is challenging because 1) the apparel/appearance\nof the same person will vary greatly over multiple days and 2) a person will\nleave and re-enter the scene numerous times. To tackle these challenges, we\nleverage face recognition information, which is robust to apparel change, to\nautomatically reinitialize our tracker over multiple days of recordings.\nUnfortunately, recognized faces are unavailable oftentimes. Therefore, our\ntracker propagates identity information to frames without recognized faces by\nuncovering the appearance and spatial manifold formed by person detections. We\ntested our algorithm on a 23-day 15-camera data set (4,935 hours total), and we\nwere able to localize a person 53.2% of the time with 69.8% precision. We\nfurther performed video summarization experiments based on our tracking output.\nResults on 116.25 hours of video showed that we were able to generate a\nreasonable visual diary (i.e. a summary of what a person did) for different\npeople, thus potentially opening the door to automatic summarization of the\nvast amount of surveillance video generated every day.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2016 22:53:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2017 01:21:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

These trait judgments might influence important social\noutcomes in our lives such as elections and court sentences. Previous studies\nhave reported that human can make valid inferences for at least four\npersonality traits. In addition, some studies have demonstrated that facial\ntrait evaluation can be learned using machine learning methods accurately. In\nthis work, we experimentally explore whether self-reported personality traits\nand intelligence can be predicted reliably from a facial image. More\nspecifically, the prediction problem is separately cast in two parts: a\nclassification task and a regression task. A facial structural feature is\nconstructed from the relations among facial salient points, and an appearance\nfeature is built by five texture descriptors. In addition, a minutia-based\nfingerprint feature from a fingerprint image is also explored. The\nclassification results show that the personality traits \"Rule-consciousness\"\nand \"Vigilance\" can be predicted reliably, and that the traits of females can\nbe predicted more accurately than those of male. However, the regression\nexperiments show that it is difficult to predict scores for individual\npersonality traits and intelligence. The residual plots and the correlation\nresults indicate no evident linear correlation between the measured scores and\nthe predicted scores.

Most existing algorithms try to resolve this problem as\nan object-specific task, i.e., the model is trained to regenerate or classify a\nspecific object. As a result, the model need to be initialized and retrained\nfor different objects. In this paper, we propose a more generic approach\nutilizing a novel two-flow convolutional neural network (named YCNN). The YCNN\ntakes two inputs (one is object image patch, the other is search image patch),\nthen outputs a response map which predicts how likely the object appears in a\nspecific location. Unlike those object-specific approach, the YCNN is trained\nto measure the similarity between two image patches. Thus it will not be\nconfined to any specific object. Furthermore the network can be end-to-end\ntrained to extract both shallow and deep convolutional features which are\ndedicated for visual tracking. And once properly trained, the YCNN can be\napplied to track all kinds of objects without further training and updating.\nBenefiting from the once-for-all model, our algorithm is able to run at a very\nhigh speed of 45 frames-per-second. The experiments on 51 sequences also show\nthat our algorithm achieves an outstanding performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 03:34:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

It is shown that\ndefect mode is very sensitive to the presence of materials with dielectric\npermittivity different from that of the surrounding cylinders while the state\nin the PM is not affected by their presence.

However, in this study, we demonstrate that the sleeping beauty\nis an interesting and unexceptional phenomenon in information diffusion and\neven more inspiring, there exist two consecutive sleeping beauties in the\nentire lifetime of propagation, suggesting that the information, including\nscientific topics, search queries or Wikipedia entries, which we call memes,\nwill go unnoticed for a period and suddenly attracts some attention, and then\nit falls asleep again and later wakes up with another unexpected popularity\npeak. Further explorations on this phenomenon show that intervals between two\nwake ups follow an exponential distribution and the second wake up generally\nreaches its peak at a higher velocity. In addition, higher volume of the first\nwake up will lead to even much higher popularity of the second wake up with\ngreat odds. Taking these findings into consideration, an upgraded Bass model is\npresented to well describe the diffusion dynamics of memes on different media.\nOur results can help understand the common mechanism behind propagation of\ndifferent memes and are instructive to locate the tipping point in marketing or\nfind innovative publications in science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 06:03:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2016 03:54:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

Formation of a\nperiodic lattice (which is a non-trivial Gaussian curvature) of 'cyclotron\norbits' with applied magnetic field, or 'chiral orbits' with fictitious\n'momentum space magnetic field' (Berry curvature) guarantees its flux\nquantization, and thus integer quantum Hall (IQH), and quantum spin-Hall (QSH)\ninsulators, respectively, occur. The bulk-boundary correspondence associated\nwith all classes of TIs dictates that some sort of pumping or polarization of a\n'quantity' at the boundary must be associated with the flux quantization or\ntopological invariant in the bulk. Unlike charge or spin polarizations at the\nedge for IQH and QSH states, the time-reversal (TR) invariant Z2 TIs pump a\nmathematical quantity called 'TR polarization' to the surface.

Part I of this\npaper reported the remarkable improvements in the description of the price\ndynamics which can be obtained when one incorporates the impact of past returns\non the future order flow. However, impact models presented in Part I consider\nthe order flow as an exogenous process, only characterized by its two-point\ncorrelations. This assumption seriously limits the forecasting ability of the\nmodel. Here we attempt to model directly the stream of discrete events with a\nso-called Mixture Transition Distribution (MTD) framework, introduced\noriginally by Raftery (1985). We distinguish between price-changing and non\nprice-changing events and combine them with the order sign in order to reduce\nthe order flow dynamics to the dynamics of a four-state discrete random\nvariable.

In this paper, we first calculate the\ndensity evolution in disks around isolated Be stars. To model the formation\nstage of the disk, we inject mass at a radius just outside the star at a\nconstant rate for 30-50 years. As the disk develops, the density distribution\napproaches the form of the steady disk solution. Then, we turn off the mass\ninjection to model the disk dissipation stage. The innermost part of the disk\nstarts accretion, and a gap forms between the star and the disk. Next, we\ncalculate the one-armed modes at several epochs. We neglect the effect of\nviscosity because the time-scale of oscillations is much shorter than the disk\nevolution time-scale for low viscosity. In the disk formation stage, the\neigenfrequency increases with time toward the value for the steady state disk.\nOn the other hand, one-armed eigenmodes in dissipating Be disks have\nsignificantly higher eigenfrequencies and narrower propagation regions.\nObservationally, such a change of mode characteristics can be taken as an\nevidence for gap opening around the star. In binary Be stars, the\ncharacteristics of the disk evolution and the eigenmodes are qualitatively the\nsame as in isolated Be stars, but quantitatively they have shorter evolution\ntime-scales and higher eigenfrequencies, which is in agreement with the\nobserved trend.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 08:58:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

We present an introduction\nto acceleration mechanisms of charged particles to the highest energies in\nastrophysical objects, their propagation from the sources to Earth, and the\nexperimental techniques for their detection. We also discuss some of the\nrelevant observational results from Telescope Array and Pierre Auger\nObservatory.

In\nour approach, we introduce the {notions of entropy and complexity}, designed to\nmeasure, to some extent, the complexity of such optimization problems.

It can cause packet\ndropping, which results in serious performance degradation (e.g., Incast\nproblem). However, current solutions that attempt to suppress micro-burst\ntraffic are extrinsic and ad hoc, since they lack the comprehensive and\nessential understanding of micro-burst's root cause and dynamic behavior. On\nthe other hand, traditional studies focus on traffic burstiness in a single\nflow, while in data centers micro-burst traffic could occur with highly fan-in\ncommunication pattern, and its dynamic behavior is still unclear. To this end,\nin this paper we re-examine the micro-burst traffic in typical data center\nscenarios. We find that evolution of micro-burst is determined by both TCP's\nself-clocking mechanism and bottleneck link. Besides, dynamic behaviors of\nmicro-burst under various scenarios can all be described by the slope of queue\nlength increasing. Our observations also implicate that conventional solutions\nlike absorbing and pacing are ineffective to mitigate micro-burst traffic.\nInstead, senders need to slow down as soon as possible. Inspired by the\nfindings and insights from experimental observations, we propose S-ECN policy,\nwhich is an ECN marking policy leveraging the slope of queue length increasing.\nTransport protocols utilizing S-ECN policy can suppress the sharp queue length\nincrement by over 50%, and reduce the 99th percentile of query completion time\nby ~20%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 11:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

The accuracy of PCEs degenerates quickly in time. Thus maintaining a\nsufficient level of long term accuracy requires the use of high-order\npolynomials. In numerous cases, it is even infeasible to obtain accurate\nmetamodels with regular PCEs due to the fact that PCEs cannot represent the\ndynamics. To overcome the problem, an original numerical approach was recently\nproposed that combines PCEs and non-linear autoregressive with exogenous input\n(NARX) models, which are a universal tool in the field of system\nidentification. The approach relies on using NARX models to mimic the dynamical\nbehaviour of the system and dealing with the uncertainties using PCEs. The\nPC-NARX model was built by means of heuristic genetic algorithms. This paper\naims at introducing the least angle regression (LAR) technique for computing\nPC-NARX models, which consists in solving two linear regression problems. The\nproposed approach is validated with structural mechanics case studies, in which\nuncertainties arising from both structures and excitations are taken into\naccount. Comparison with Monte Carlo simulation and regular PCEs is also\ncarried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 11:34:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

Aims: We compare the surface magnetic fields and activity\nindicators of two active, fast rotating red giants with similar masses and\nspectral class but diferent rotation rates - OU And (Prot=24.2 d) and 31 Com\n(Prot=6.8 d) - to address the question of the origin of their magnetism and\nhigh activity.\n  Methods: Observations were carried out with the Narval spectropolarimeter in\n2008 and 2013.We used the least squares deconvolution technique to extract\nStokes V and I profiles to detect Zeeman signatures of the magnetic field of\nthe stars. We provide Zeeman-Doppler imaging, activity indicator monitoring,\nand a precise estimation of stellar parameters. We use stellar evolutionary\nmodels to infer the evolutionary status and the initial rotation velocity on\nthe main sequence.\n  Results: The detected magnetic field of OU And is a strong one. Its\nlongitudinal component Bl reaches 40 G and presents an about sinusoidal\nvariation with reversal of the polarity. The magnetic topology of OU And is\ndominated by large scale elements and is mainly poloidal with an important\ndipole component, and a significant toroidal component. The detected magnetic\nfield of 31 Com is weaker, with a magnetic map showing a more complex field\ngeometry, and poloidal and toroidal components of equal contributions. The\nevolutionary models show that the progenitors of OU And and 31 Com must have\nbeen rotat\n  Conclusions: OU And appears to be the probable descendant of a magnetic Ap\nstar, and 31 Com the descendant of a relatively fast rotator on the main\nsequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 12:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

However, motion vector lacks fine structures, and\ncontains noisy and inaccurate motion patterns, leading to the evident\ndegradation of recognition performance. Our key insight for relieving this\nproblem is that optical flow and motion vector are inherent correlated.\nTransferring the knowledge learned with optical flow CNN to motion vector CNN\ncan significantly boost the performance of the latter. Specifically, we\nintroduce three strategies for this, initialization transfer, supervision\ntransfer and their combination.

By using conservation energy arguments, we show that\nthe magnetic field contribution is equivalent to adding an effective negative\nsurface tension to the drop. Our model is found in good agreement with the\nexperiments with no fitting parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 14:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

Although in such\ncountries the ruling elites may receive considerable voter support they often\nemploy several manipulation tools to control election outcomes. A common\npractice of these regimes is the coercion and mobilization of a significant\namount of voters to guarantee the electoral victory. This electoral\nirregularity is known as voter rigging, distinguishing it from vote rigging,\nwhich involves ballot stuffing or stealing. Here we develop a statistical test\nto quantify to which extent the results of a particular election display traces\nof voter rigging. Our key hypothesis is that small polling stations are more\nsusceptible to voter rigging, because it is easier to identify opposing\nindividuals, there are less eye witnesses, and supposedly less visits from\nelection observers. We devise a general statistical method for testing whether\nvoting behavior in small polling stations is significantly different from the\nbehavior of their neighbor stations in a way that is consistent with the\nwidespread occurrence of voter rigging. Based on a comparative analysis, the\nmethod enables to rule out whether observed differences in voting behavior\nmight be explained by geographic heterogeneities in vote preferences. We\nanalyze 21 elections in ten different countries and find significant anomalies\ncompatible with voter rigging in Russia from 2007-2011, in Venezuela from\n2006-2013, and in Uganda 2011. Particularly disturbing is the case of Venezuela\nwhere these distortions have been outcome-determinative in the 2013\npresidential elections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 14:29:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

We find that generically the predictions from wounded\nquarks for such features as eccentricities or initial sizes are close (within\n15\\%) to predictions of the wounded nucleon model with an amended binary\ncomponent. A larger difference is found for the size in p+Pb system, where the\nwounded quark model yields a smaller (more compact) initial fireball than the\nstandard wounded nucleon model. The inclusion of subnucleonic degrees of\nfreedom allows us to analyze p+p collisions in an analogous way, with\npredictions that can be used in further collective evolution.

The developed DGTD-ACM achieves a desired accuracy by refining\nnon-conformal meshes near material interfaces to reduce stair-casing errors\nwithout sacrificing the high efficiency afforded with uniform Cartesian meshes.\nMoreover, DGTD-ACM can dynamically refine the mesh to resolve the local\nvariation of the fields during propagation of electromagnetic pulses.

For simulations of dispersive media, the auxiliary differential\nequation (ADE) and recursive convolution (RC) methods are implemented for a\nlocal Drude model and tested for a cold plasma slab and a plasmonic rod.

We determine ages, metallicities, and\nSFHs of BGGs and SBGGs using the STARLIGHT code with two different single\nstellar population models (which lead to important disagreements in SFHs), and\nalso compute $[\\alpha/{\\rm Fe}]$ from spectral indices. After removing the\ndependence with galaxy velocity dispersion or with stellar mass, there is no\ncorrelation with magnitude gap of BGG ages, metallicities, $[\\alpha/{\\rm Fe}]$,\nand SFHs. The lack of trends of BGG SFHs with magnitude gap suggests that BGGs\nin LGGs have undergone more mergers than those in small-gap groups, but these\nmergers are either dry or occurred at very high redshift, which in either case\nwould leave no detectable imprint in their spectra. We show that SBGGs in LGGs\nlie significantly closer to the BGGs (in projection) than galaxies with similar\nstellar masses in normal groups, which appears to be a sign of the earlier\nentry of the former into their groups. Nevertheless, the stellar population\nproperties of the SBGGs in LGGs are compatible with those of the general\npopulation of galaxies with similar stellar masses residing in normal groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 15:52:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Oct 2016 14:21:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Jan 2022 12:54:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-07"}

A speed\ndifferent from one for tensor modes can arise in several contexts, such as\nGalileons theories or massive gravity, nevertheless the speed is very\nconstrained to be one by observations of gravitational wave emission. It has\nbeen shown that in inflation a disformal trans- formation allows to set the\nspeed for tensor modes to one without making changes to the curvature power\nspectrum. Here we show that this invariance does not hold when considering the\nCMB anisotropy power spectrum. It turns out that the after doing the\ntransformation there is an imprint on the acoustic peaks and the diffusion\ndamping. This has interesting consequences; here we explore quartic galileon\ntheories which allow a modified speed for tensor modes. For these theories the\ntransformation can be used to constraint the parameter space in different\nregimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2016 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

RF is already limiting the scientific outcome of deep-space\nmissions and could be a significant obstacle in the developing of manned\nmissions. Lasercom holds the promise to solve this problem, as it will\nconsiderably increase the data rate while decreasing the energy, mass and\nvolume of onboard communication systems. In RF deep-space communications, where\nthe received power is the main limitation, the traditional approach to boost\nthe data throughput has been increasing the receiver's aperture, e.g. the 70-m\nantennas in the NASA's Deep Space Network. Optical communications also can\nbenefit from this strategy, thus 10-m class telescopes have typically been\nsuggested to support future deep-space links. However, the cost of big\ntelescopes increase exponentially with their aperture, and new ideas are needed\nto optimize this ratio. Here, the use of ground-based gamma-ray telescopes,\nknown as Cherenkov telescopes, is suggested. These are optical telescopes\ndesigned to maximize the receiver's aperture at a minimum cost with some\nrelaxed requirements. As they are used in an array configuration and multiple\nidentical units need to be built, each element of the telescope is designed to\nminimize its cost. Furthermore, the native array configuration would facilitate\nthe joint operation of Cherenkov and lasercom telescopes. These telescopes\noffer very big apertures, ranging from several meters to almost 30 meters,\nwhich could greatly improve the performance of optical ground stations. The key\nelements of these telescopes have been studied applied to lasercom, reaching\nthe conclusion that it could be an interesting strategy to include them in the\nfuture development of an optical deep-space network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Apr 2016 10:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-28"}
