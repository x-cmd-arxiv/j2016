NTDhXPB is also linked to anti-cancer\ntherapies. As a bi-product we derived 3D models of NTD-mXPB - homologue of\nNTD-hXPB in mycobacterium tuberculosis aka MTB (causative agent of most cases\nof tuberculosis, which surpassed HIV as #1 infectious disease killer in 2014).\nThese could be potential target for TB therapeutics.

This paper proposes a new control method that can save the energy\nconsumption of multi-case supermarket refrigerators by explicitly taking into\naccount their interconnected and switched system dynamics. Its novelty is a\nbilevel combinatorial optimization formulation to generate ON/OFF control\nactions for expansion valves and compressors. The inner optimization module\nkeeps display case temperatures in a desirable range and the outer optimization\nmodule minimizes energy consumption. In addition to its energy-saving\ncapability, the proposed controller significantly reduces the frequency of\ncompressor switchings by employing a conservative compressor control strategy.\nHowever, solving this bilevel optimization problem associated with\ninterconnected and switched systems is a computationally challenging task. To\nsolve the problem in near real time, we propose two approximation algorithms\nthat can solve both the inner and outer optimization problems at once. The\nfirst algorithm uses a linear approximation, and the second is based on the\nsubmodular structure of the optimization problem. Both are (polynomial-time)\nscalable algorithms and generate near-optimal solutions with performance\nguarantees.

Whereas both equilibrium abundance\nstratification calculations and stationary solutions to the time-dependent\ndiffusion equations predict (warped) rings about the magnetic equator in\ndipole-like magnetic geometries, spot-like structures dominate published maps.\nAn in-depth analysis of this apparent disagreement investigates the\ndetectability by means of ZDM of a variety of abundance structures, including\n(warped) rings predicted by theory, but also some complex spot-like structures.\nAs it turns out, a number of published maps have to be considered spurious\neither because strong magnetic fields have been neglected or because they are\nbased on spectra where photon noise dominates over the signal of the alleged\nabundance structures.

As with any client-server model, the server should not make\nany assumption on the validity (sanity) of client-side transaction. To our\nsurprise, we find this principle has frequently been overlooked in the\nimplementation of Android system services. In this paper, we demonstrate the\nprevalence and severity of this vulnerability surface and try to answer why\ndevelopers keep making this seemingly simple mistake. Specifically, we design\nand implement BinderCracker, an automatic testing framework that supports\nparameter-aware fuzzing and has identified more than 100 vulnerabilities in six\nmajor versions of Android, including the latest version Android 6.0,\nMarshmallow. Some of the vulnerabilities have severe security implications,\ncausing privileged code execution or permanent Denial-of-Service (DoS). We\nanalyzed the root causes of these vulnerabilities to find that most of them\nexist because system service developers only considered exploitations via\npublic APIs. We thus highlight the deficiency of testing only on client-side\npublic APIs and argue for the necessity of testing and protection on the Binder\ninterface - the actual security boundary. Specifically, we discuss the\neffectiveness and practicality of potential countermeasures, such as\nprecautionary testing and runtime diagnostic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2016 23:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-26"}

We numerically solve the\ncoupled Fokker-Plank equations and computes the time evolution of the spectra\nof both particles. We show that this can lead to a quasi-thermal component plus\na high energy nonthermal tail. We determine the evolution of nonthermal tail\nand the quasi-thermal component.

We define a new signal called the Temporal Flow Graph (TFG)\nwhich depicts the movement of a point of interest over time. It is a graphical\nrepresentation derived from a flow field and describes the temporal evolution\nof a point. We prove that TFG for an object undergoing periodic motion is also\nperiodic. This principle can be utilized to derive both global and local\ninformation from a given sequence. We demonstrate this for detecting motion\nirregularities at the sequence, as well as regional levels on real and\nsynthetic data. A coarse localisation of anatomical landmarks such as centres\nof left/right cavities and valve points is also demonstrated using TFGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2016 03:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-26"}

All the sharp bounds are given for the original Boltzmann and Landau\noperators. The sharpness means the lower and upper bounds for the operators are\nconsistent with the behavior of the linearized operators. Moreover, we make\nclear the difference between the bounds for the original operators and those\nfor the linearized ones.\n  According to the Bobylev's formula, we introduce two types of dyadic\ndecompositions performed in both phase and frequency spaces to make full use of\nthe interaction and the cancellation. It allows us to see clearly which part of\nthe operator behaves like a Laplace type operator and which part is dominated\nby the anisotropic structure. It is the key point to get the sharp bounds in\nweighted Sobolev spaces and in anisotropic spaces. Based on the geometric\nstructure of the elastic collision, we make a geometric decomposition to\ncapture the anisotropic structure of the collision operator. More precisely, we\nmake it explicit that the fractional Laplace-Beltrami operator really exists in\nthe structure of the collision operator. It enables us to derive the sharp\nbounds in anisotropic spaces and then complete the entropy dissipation\nestimates. The structures mentioned above are so stable that we can apply them\nto the rescaled Boltzmann collision operator in the process of the grazing\ncollisions limit. Then we get the sharp bounds for the Landau collision\noperator by passing to the limit. We remark that our analysis used here will\nshed light on the investigation of the asymptotics from Boltzmann equation to\nLandau equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2016 03:58:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 02:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-18"}

In spite of decades of intensive research, the problem remains open.\nPerhaps a more basic question, which has also attracted much attention, is if\nthere exists any dynamically optimal BST algorithm. One such candidate is\nGREEDY which is a simple and intuitive BST algorithm [Lucas, Rutgers Tech.\nReport, 1988; Munro, ESA, 2000; Demaine, Harmon, Iacono, Kane and Patrascu,\nSODA, 2009]. [Demaine et al., SODA, 2009] showed a novel connection between a\ngeometric problem.\n  Since dynamic optimality conjecture in its most general form remains elusive\ndespite much effort, researchers have studied this problem on special\nsequences. Recently, [Chalermsook, Goswami, Kozma, Mehlhorn and Saranurak,\nFOCS, 2015] studied a type of sequences known as $k$-{\\em decomposable\nsequences} in this context, where $k$ parametrizes easiness of the sequence.\nUsing tools from forbidden submatrix theory, they showed that GREEDY takes\n$n2^{O(k^2)}$ time on this sequence and explicitly raised the question of\nimproving this bound.\n  In this paper, we show that GREEDY takes $O(n \\log{k})$ time on\n$k$-decomposable sequences. In contrast to the previous approach, ours is based\non first principles. One of the main ingredients of our result is a new\nconstruction of a lower bound certificate on the performance of any algorithm.\nThis certificate is constructed using the execution of GREEDY, and is more\nnuanced and possibly more flexible than the previous independent set\ncertificate of Demaine et al. This result, which is applicable to all\nsequences, may be of independent interest and may lead to further progress in\nanalyzing GREEDY on $k$-decomposable as well as general sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2016 08:48:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-26"}

With a significant number of compact binaries,\nthe number of evolutionary BSs can be also significant. In turn, for semi-major\naxes distributions preferring binaries with wider orbits, dynamical BSs are the\ndominant ones. Their formation scenario is very distinct: for wide binaries the\nnumber of dynamical interactions is significantly larger. Most interactions are\nweak and increase only slightly the eccentricities. However, due to a large\nnumber of such interactions, the eccentricities of a number of binaries finally\nget so large that the stars collide.\n  We study how larger initial clusters' concentrations influence the BSs.\nBesides the expected increase of the number of dynamically created BSs (for\ndenser GCs the probabilities of strong dynamical interactions and collisions\nare higher), we find that the number of the evolutionary BSs is not affected\neven by very high initial concentrations.

We consider this problem in the setting of local algorithms: one\nwants to quickly determine whether a given edge $e$ is in a specific spanning\ntree, without computing the whole spanning tree, but rather by inspecting the\nlocal neighborhood of $e$. The challenge is to maintain consistency. That is,\nto answer queries about different edges according to the same spanning tree.\nSince it is known that this problem cannot be solved without essentially\nviewing all the graph, we consider the relaxed version of finding a spanning\nsubgraph with $(1+\\epsilon)n$ edges (where $n$ is the number of vertices and\n$\\epsilon$ is a given sparsity parameter). It is known that this relaxed\nproblem requires inspecting $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ edges in general graphs, which\nmotivates the study of natural restricted families of graphs. One such family\nis the family of graphs with an excluded minor. For this family there is an\nalgorithm that achieves constant success probability, and inspects\n$(d/\\epsilon)^{poly(h)\\log(1/\\epsilon)}$ edges (for each edge it is queried\non), where $d$ is the maximum degree in the graph and $h$ is the size of the\nexcluded minor. The distances between pairs of vertices in the spanning\nsubgraph $G'$ are at most a factor of $poly(d, 1/\\epsilon, h)$ larger than in\n$G$.\n  In this work, we show that for an input graph that is $H$-minor free for any\n$H$ of size $h$, this task can be performed by inspecting only $poly(d,\n1/\\epsilon, h)$ edges. The distances between pairs of vertices in the spanning\nsubgraph $G'$ are at most a factor of $\\tilde{O}(h\\log(d)/\\epsilon)$ larger\nthan in $G$. Furthermore, the error probability of the new algorithm is\nsignificantly improved to $\\Theta(1/n)$. This algorithm can also be easily\nadapted to yield an efficient algorithm for the distributed setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2016 14:55:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}
