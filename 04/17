Scattering of the emergent thermal radiation\nfrom these planets by the dust grains in their atmospheres should locally give\nrise to significant linear polarization of the emitted radiation. However, the\nobservable disk averaged polarization should be zero if the planet is\nspherically symmetric. Rotation-induced oblateness may yield a net non-zero\ndisk averaged polarization if the planets have sufficiently high spin rotation\nvelocity. On the other hand, when a large natural satellite or exomoon transits\na planet with cloudy atmosphere along the line of sight, the asymmetry induced\nduring the transit should give rise to a net non-zero, time resolved linear\npolarization signal. The peak amplitude of such time dependent polarization may\nbe detectable even for slowly rotating exoplanets.

It is challenging as the appearances of ac- tions may vary depending on\ntheir context (e.g. associated objects). Manually labeling of context\ninformation would be time consuming and difficult to scale up. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a method to automatically discover and cluster action\nconcepts, and learn their classifiers from weakly supervised image-sentence\ncorpora. It obtains candidate action concepts by extracting verb-object pairs\nfrom sentences and verifies their visualness with the associated images.\nCandidate action concepts are then clustered by using a multi-modal\nrepresentation with image embeddings from deep convolutional networks and text\nembeddings from word2vec.

Finding IMBHs in GCs could validate a formation\nchannel for seed BHs in the early universe, bolster gravitational-wave\npredictions for space missions, and test scaling relations between stellar\nsystems and the central BHs they host. We used the NRAO Karl G. Jansky Very\nLarge Array (VLA) to search for the radiative signatures of IMBH accretion from\n206 probable GCs in a mosaic of M81. The observing wavelength was 5.5 cm and\nthe spatial resolution was 1.5 arcsec (26.4 pc). None of the individual GCs are\ndetected, nor are weighted-mean image stacks of the 206 GCs and the 49 massive\nGCs with stellar masses M_star \\gtrsim 200,000 M_sun. We apply a semi-empirical\nmodel to predict the mass of an IMBH that, if undergoing accretion in the\nlong-lived hard X-ray state, is consistent with a given radio luminosity. The\n3$\\sigma$ radio-luminosity upper limits correspond to mean IMBH masses of\nM_BH(all) < 42,000 M_sun for the all-cluster stack and M_BH(massive) < 51,000\nM_sun for the massive-cluster stack. We also apply the empirical\nfundamental-plane relation to two X-ray-detected clusters, finding that their\nindividual IMBH masses at 95% confidence are M_BH < 99,000 M_sun and M_BH <\n15,000 M_sun. Finally, no analog of HLX-1, a strong IMBH candidate in an\nextragalactic star cluster, occurs in any individual GC in M81. This\nunderscores the uniqueness or rarity of the HLX-1 phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2016 18:42:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

The Sun is an active source of radio emission ranging from long\nduration radio bursts associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections\nto more complex, short duration radio bursts such as solar S bursts, radio\nspikes and fibre bursts. While plasma emission is thought to be the dominant\nemission mechanism for most radio bursts, the electron-cyclotron maser (ECM)\nmechanism may be responsible for more complex, short-duration bursts as well as\nfine structures associated with long-duration bursts. Aims. We investigate the\nconditions for ECM in the solar corona by considering the ratio of the electron\nplasma frequency {\\omega}p to the electron-cyclotron frequency {\\Omega}e. The\nECM is theoretically possible when {\\omega}p/{\\Omega}e < 1. Methods.\nTwo-dimensional electron density, magnetic field, plasma frequency, and\nelectron cyclotron frequency maps of the off- limb corona were created using\nobservations from SDO/AIA and SOHO/LASCO, together with potential field\nextrapolations of the magnetic field. These maps were then used to calculate\n{\\omega}p/{\\Omega}e and Alfven velocity maps of the off-limb corona. Results.\nWe found that the condition for ECM emission ({\\omega}p/{\\Omega}e < 1) is\npossible at heights < 1.07 R_sun in an active region near the limb; that is,\nwhere magnetic field strengths are > 40 G and electron densities are greater\nthan 3x10^8 cm-3.

We apply the theory of cyclic systems to a psychophysical\ndouble-detection experiment, in which observers were asked to determine\npresence or absence of a signal property in each of two simultaneously\npresented stimuli. The results, as in all other behavioral and social systems\nprevious analyzed, indicate lack of contextuality. The role of context in\ndouble-detection is confined to lack of selectiveness: the distribution of\nresponses to one of the stimuli is influenced by the state of the other\nstimulus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Apr 2016 21:13:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 02:55:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-25"}

After the drop, the X-ray afterglow continues with a much\nshallower decay. The optical afterglow exhibits two segments of plateaus\nseparated by a luminous optical flare, followed by a normal decay with a slope\nbasically consistent with that of the late-time X-ray afterglow. The decay of\nthe internal X-ray plateau is much steeper than what we expect in the simplest\nmagnetar model. We propose a scenario in which the magnetar undergoes\ngravitational-wave-driven r-mode instability, and the spin-down is dominated by\ngravitational wave losses up to the end of the steep plateau, so that such a\nrelatively steep plateau can be interpreted as the internal emission of the\nmagnetar wind and the sharp drop can be produced when the magnetar collapses\ninto a black hole. This scenario also predicts an initial X-ray plateau lasting\nfor hundreds of seconds with an approximately constant flux which is compatible\nwith observation. Assuming that the magnetar wind has a negligible contribution\nin the optical band, we interpret the optical afterglow as the forward shock\nemission by invoking the energy injection from a continuously refreshed shock\nfollowing the prompt emission phase.

All models to date,\nrelating the winds to the gravity field, have been in the forward direction,\nthus allowing only calculation of the gravity field from given wind models.\nHowever, there is a need to do the inverse problem since the new observations\nwill be of the gravity field. Here, an inverse dynamical model, is developed to\nrelate the expected measurable gravity field, to perturbations of the density\nand wind fields, and therefore to the observed cloud-level winds. In order to\ninvert the gravity field into the 3D circulation, an adjoint model is\nconstructed for the dynamical model, thus allowing backward integration. This\ntool is used for examination of various scenarios, simulating cases in which\nthe depth of the wind depends on latitude.

Calculating the solution\nuncertainties, we show that the wind depth can be determined more precisely in\nthe low-to-midlatitudes.

Al(IV) and Al(VI) are two common coordinations of Al\nspecies in the silica network and alumina phase, respectively. Al(V) is rare in\nnature and was found hitherto only in the alumina phase or interfaces\ncontaining alumina, a behavior which negatively affects the dispersion,\npopulation, and accessibility of Al(V) species on the silica-alumina surface.\nThis constraint has limited the development of silica-alumina based catalysts,\nparticularly because Al(V) had been confirmed to act as a highly active center\nfor acid reactions and single-atom catalysts. Here, we report the direct\nobservation of high population of homogenously dispersed Al(V) species in\namorphous silica-alumina in the absence of any bulk alumina phase, by high\nresolution TEM/EDX and high magnetic-field MAS NMR. Solid-state 27Al\nmulti-quantum MAS NMR experiments prove unambiguously that most of the Al(V)\nspecies formed independently from the alumina phase and are accessible on the\nsurface for guest molecules.

The\nNMR chemical shifts and their coordination transformation with and without\nwater adsorption are matching that obtained in DFT calculations of the\npredicted clusters.

As such, given a novel image,\na vision system ought to infer which other objects/people play an important\nrole in a given person's activity. However, existing methods are limited to\nlearning action-specific interactions (e.g., how the pose of a tennis player\nrelates to the position of his racquet when serving the ball) for improved\nrecognition, making them unequipped to reason about novel interactions with\nactions or objects unobserved in the training data.\n  We propose to predict the \"interactee\" in novel images---that is, to localize\nthe \\emph{object} of a person's action. Given an arbitrary image with a\ndetected person, the goal is to produce a saliency map indicating the most\nlikely positions and scales where that person's interactee would be found. To\nthat end, we explore ways to learn the generic, action-independent connections\nbetween (a) representations of a person's pose, gaze, and scene cues and (b)\nthe interactee object's position and scale. We provide results on a newly\ncollected UT Interactee dataset spanning more than 10,000 images from SUN,\nPASCAL, and COCO. We show that the proposed interaction-informed saliency\nmetric has practical utility for four tasks: contextual object detection, image\nretargeting, predicting object importance, and data-driven natural language\nscene description. All four scenarios reveal the value in linking the subject\nto its object in order to understand the story of an image.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2016 08:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}

The accelerated electrons are usually assumed to\nfollow a power law energy distribution with an index of $p$. Observationally,\nalthough most GRB afterglows have a $p$ larger than 2, there are still a few\nGRBs suggestive of a hard ($p<2$) electron spectrum. GRB 091127, with\nwell-sampled broad-band afterglow data, shows evidence of a hard electron\nspectrum and strong spectral evolution, with a spectral break moving from high\nto lower energies. The spectral break evolves very fast and cannot be explained\nby the cooling break in the standard afterglow model, unless evolving\nmicrophysical parameters are assumed. Besides, the multi-band afterglow light\ncurves show an achromatic break at around 33 ks. Based on the model of a hard\nelectron spectrum with an injection break, we interpret the observed spectral\nbreak as the synchrotron frequency corresponding to the injection break, and\nthe achromatic break as a jet break caused by the jet-edge effect. It is shown\nthat the spectral evolution and the multi-band afterglow light curves of GRB\n091127 can be well reproduced by this model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2016 08:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}

Many of these\nexamples represent dynamic and uncertain environments, and thus, require, in\nfact, online mechanisms. Unfortunately, as far as we know, no previously\npublished online mechanism for a multi-sided market (or even for a double-sided\nmarket) has managed to (approximately) maximize the gain from trade, while\nguaranteeing desirable economic properties such as incentivizing truthfulness,\nvoluntary participation and avoiding budget deficit. In this work we present\nthe first online mechanism for a multi-sided market which has the above\nproperties. Our mechanism is designed for a market setting suggested by\n[Feldman and Gonen (2016)]; which is motivated by the foreseeable future form\nof online advertising.\n  The online nature of our setting motivated us to define a stronger notion of\nindividual rationality, called \"continuous individual rationality\", capturing\nthe natural requirement that a player should never lose either by participating\nin the mechanism or by not leaving prematurely. Satisfying the requirements of\ncontinuous individual rationality, together with the other economic properties\nour mechanism guarantees, requires the mechanism to use a novel pricing scheme\nwhere users may be paid ongoing increments during the mechanism's execution up\nto a pre-known maximum value. As users rarely ever get paid in reality, this\npricing scheme is new to mechanism design. Nevertheless, the principle it is\nbased on can be observed in many common real life scenarios such as executive\ncompensation payments and company acquisition deals. We believe both our new\ndynamic pricing scheme concept and our strengthened notion of individual\nrationality are of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2016 10:45:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Sep 2016 09:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}

One possible reason for this difference is that mesh\ncodes are not Galilean invariant. Another possible reason is the problem of the\nSPH method, which might give too much \"protection\" to cold clumps because of\nthe unphysical surface tension induced at contact discontinuities. In this\npaper, we apply the density independent formulation of SPH (DISPH), which can\nhandle contact discontinuities accurately, to simulations of a cluster of\ngalaxies, and compare the results with those with the standard SPH.

Instance-based data\nstream algorithms generally employ the Euclidean distance for the\nclassification task underlying this problem. A novel way to look into this\nissue is to take advantage of a more flexible metric due to the increased\nrequirements imposed by the data stream scenario. In this paper we present a\nnew algorithm that learns a Mahalanobis metric using similarity and\ndissimilarity constraints in an online manner.
