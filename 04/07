By varying the parameters $\\beta$ and $q$, we\nderive existence results of Nash equilibrium and equilibrium market prices and\nshares. In particular, we prove that pure Nash equilibrium always exists when\n$q=0$ for markets with either one and two dominating features, and it always\nexists in a single dominating feature market when market affects brand name\nlinearly, i.e., $q=1$. Moreover, we show that at equilibrium, a company's price\nis proportional to its market area over the competition intensity with its\nneighbors, a result that quantitatively reconciles the common belief of a\ncompany's pricing power. We also study an interesting \"wipe out\" phenomenon\nthat only appears when $q>0$, which is similar to the \"undercut\" phenomenon in\nthe Hotelling model, where companies may suddenly lose the entire market area\nwith a small price increment. Our results offer novel insight into market\npricing and positioning under competition with brand effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 16:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-07"}

Typically, their usage is intuitive\nand informal. Here, we present a formalized version of flow diagrams as a kind\nof weighted directed graph which follow a strict grammar, which translate into\na system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by a single unambiguous\nrule, and which have an equivalent representation as a relational database. (We\nabbreviate this schema of \"ODEs and formalized flow diagrams\" as OFFl.) Drawing\na diagram within this strict grammar encourages a mental discipline on the part\nof the modeler in which all dynamical processes of a system are thought of as\ninteractions between dynamical species that draw parcels from one or more\nsource species and deposit them into target species according to a set of\ntransformation rules. From these rules, the net rate of change for each species\ncan be derived. The modeling schema can therefore be understood as both an\nepistemic and practical heuristic for modeling, serving both as an\norganizational framework for the model building process and as a mechanism for\nderiving ODEs. All steps of the schema beyond the initial scientific\n(intuitive, creative) abstraction of natural observations into model variables\nare algorithmic and easily carried out by a computer, thus enabling the future\ndevelopment of a dedicated software implementation. Such tools would empower\nthe modeler to consider significantly more complex models than practical\nlimitations might have otherwise proscribed, since the modeling framework\nitself manages that complexity on the modeler's behalf. In this report, we\ndescribe the chief motivations for OFFl, outline its implementation, and\nutilize a range of classic examples from ecology and epidemiology to showcase\nits features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 16:04:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2016 20:09:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-10"}

It is unclear how QoE metrics such as\nstarvation probability and buffering time interact with dynamics of streaming\ntraffic load. In this paper, we collect view records from one of the largest\nstreaming providers in China over two weeks and perform an in-depth measurement\nstudy on flow arrival and viewing time that shed light on the real traffic\npattern. Our most important observation is that the viewing time of streaming\nusers fits a hyper-exponential distribution quite well. This implies that all\nthe views can be categorized into two classes, short and long views with\nseparated time scales. We then map the measured traffic pattern to bandwidth\nshared cellular networks and propose an analytical framework to compute the\nclosed-form starvation probability on the basis of ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs). Our framework can be naturally extended to investigate\npractical issues including the progressive downloading and the finite video\nduration. Extensive trace-driven simulations validate the accuracy of our\nmodels. Our study reveals that the starvation metrics of the short and long\nviews possess different sensitivities to the scheduling priority at base\nstation. Hence, a better QoE tradeoff between the short and long views has a\npotential to be leveraged by offering them different scheduling weights. The\nflow differentiation involves tremendous technical and non-technical challenges\nbecause video content is owned by content providers but not the network\noperators and the viewing time of each session is unknown beforehand. To\novercome these difficulties, we propose an online Bayesian approach to infer\nthe viewing time of each incoming flow with the \"least\" information from\ncontent providers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 16:04:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-07"}

We start by reviewing in details the supercoset\nconstruction of the superstring action in $AdS_5 \\times S^5$, pointing out the\nlimits of this procedure for $AdS_4$ and $AdS_3$ backgrounds. For the $AdS_4\n\\times CP^3$ case we give a thorough derivation of an alternative action, based\non the double-dimensional reduction of eleven-dimensional super-membranes. We\nthen consider the expansion about the BMN vacuum and the S-matrix for the\nscattering of worldsheet excitations in the decompactification limit. To\nevaluate its elements efficiently we describe a unitarity-based method\nresulting in a very compact formula yielding the cut-constructible part of any\none-loop two-dimensional S-matrix. In the second part of this review we analyze\nthe superstring action on $AdS_4 \\times CP^3$ expanded around the null cusp\nvacuum. The free energy of this model, whose computation we reproduce up to\ntwo-loops at strong coupling, is related to the cusp anomalous dimension of the\nABJM theory and, indirectly, to a non-trivial effective coupling $h(\\lambda)$\nfeaturing all integrability-based calculations in $AdS_4/CFT_3$. Finally, we\nextensively discuss the comparison of the perturbative results and the\nintegrability predictions for the one-loop dispersion relation of GKP\nexcitations. Our results provide valuable data in support of the quantum\nconsistency of the string actions - often debated due to possible issues with\ncancellation of UV divergences and the lack of manifest power-counting\nrenormalizability - and furnish non-trivial stringent tests for the quantum\nintegrability of the analyzed models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 16:04:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2016 10:35:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

To thoroughly evaluate our\ntechniques, we generalise sparse binary network archetypes to weighted forms\nand explore the main topological features of brain networks- integration,\nregularity and modularity- using curves over density. By controlling the\nparameters of our model, the highest complexity is found to arise between a\nrandom topology and a strict 'class-based' topology. Further, the model has\nequivalent complexity to EEG phase-lag networks at peak performance.\nHierarchical complexity attains greater magnitude and range of differences\nbetween different networks than the previous commonly used complexity metric\nand our WCH model offers a much broader range of network topology than the\nstandard scale-free and small-world models at a full range of densities. Our\nmetric and model provide a rigorous characterisation of hierarchical\ncomplexity.

Very lately, a new type of Weyl semimetals has been\nproposed where the Weyl Fermions emerge at the boundary between electron and\nhole pockets in a new phase of matter, which is distinct from the standard type\nI Weyl semimetals with a point-like Fermi surface. The Weyl cone in this type\nII semimetals is strongly tilted and the related Fermi surface undergos a\nLifshitz transition, giving rise to a new kind of chiral anomaly and other new\nphysics. MoTe2 is proposed to be a candidate of a type II Weyl semimetal; the\nsensitivity of its topological state to lattice constants and correlation also\nmakes it an ideal platform to explore possible topological phase transitions.\nBy performing laser-based angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) measurements\nwith unprecedentedly high resolution, we have uncovered electronic evidence of\ntype II semimetal state in MoTe2.

A single branch of surface state is identified\nthat connects bulk hole pockets and bulk electron pockets. Detailed\ntemperature-dependent ARPES measurements show high intensity spot-like features\nthat is ~40 meV above the Fermi level and is close to the momentum space\nconsistent with the theoretical expectation of the type II Weyl points. Our\nresults constitute electronic evidence on the nature of the Weyl semimetal\nstate that favors the presence of two sets of type II Weyl points in MoTe2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 17:45:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-07"}

Here we discuss the\nrelevant results of S-inflation in the context of the 750 GeV resonance. In\nparticular, we show that a singlet scalar, if it is real, has a major advantage\nover the Higgs boson with regard to unitarity violation during inflation. This\nis because it is possible to restrict the large non-minimal coupling required\nfor inflation, $\\xi \\sim 10^5$, to the real singlet scalar, with all other\nscalars having $\\xi \\sim 1$. In this case the scale of unitarity violation\n$\\Lambda$ is much larger than the inflaton field during inflation. This\nprotects the inflaton effective potential from modification by the new physics\nor strong coupling which is necessary to restore unitarity, which would\notherwise invalidate the perturbative effective potential based on Standard\nModel physics. This is in contrast to the case of Higgs Inflation or models\nbased on complex singlet scalars, where the unitarity violation scale during\ninflation is less than or of the order of the inflaton field. Therefore if the\n750 GeV resonance is the inflaton, it must be a non-minimally coupled real\nsinglet scalar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 18:05:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2016 11:50:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

Our approach does not require knowledge of\nthese sensitivity curves, instead we employ a data-driven method. We learn an\nellipsoidal partitioning of the six-dimensional space of colors and color\ngradients. This partitioning creates metamer sets defined by the base color at\nthe display pixel and the color gradient direction for message encoding. We\nsample from the resulting metamer sets to find color steps for each base color\nto embed a binary message into an arbitrary image with reduced visible\nartifacts. Unlike previous methods that rely on visually obtrusive intensity\nmodulation, we embed with color so that the message is more hidden. Ordinary\ndisplays and cameras are used without the need for expensive LEDs or high speed\ndevices. The primary contribution of this work is a framework to map the pixels\nin an arbitrary image to a metamer pair for steganographic photo messaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 18:43:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-07"}

The two frequently used\nindices, ESI and PHI, describe heuristic methods to score\nsimilarity/habitability in the efforts to categorize different exoplanets or\nexomoons. ESI, in particular, considers Earth as the reference frame for\nhabitability and is a quick screening tool to categorize and measure physical\nsimilarity of any planetary body with the Earth. The PHI assesses the\nprobability that life in some form may exist on any given world, and is based\non the essential requirements of known life: a stable and protected substrate,\nenergy, appropriate chemistry and a liquid medium. We propose here a different\nmetric, a Cobb-Douglas Habitability Score (CDHS), based on Cobb-Douglas\nhabitability production function (CD-HPF), which computes the habitability\nscore by using measured and calculated planetary input parameters. The proposed\nmetric, with exponents accounting for metric elasticity, is endowed with\nverifiable analytical properties that ensure global optima, and is scalable to\naccommodate finitely many input parameters. The model is elastic, does not\nsuffer from curvature violations and, as we discovered, the standard PHI is a\nspecial case of CDHS. Computed CDHS scores are fed to K-NN (K-Nearest\nNeighbour) classification algorithm with probabilistic herding that facilitates\nthe assignment of exoplanets to appropriate classes via supervised feature\nlearning methods, producing granular clusters of habitability.

To obtain reliable information from\nthese studies, the statistical properties of time-lags estimated from data must\nbe known as accurately as possible.\n  Aims: We investigated the statistical properties of Fourier-based time-lag\nestimates (i.e. based on the cross-periodogram), using evenly sampled time\nseries with no missing points.

For some class of probability\ndistributions, an edge between two variables is present if and only if the\ncorresponding entry in the precision matrix is non-zero. For a finite sample\nestimate of the precision matrix, entries close to zero may be due to low\nsample effects, or due to an actual association between variables; these two\ncases are not readily distinguishable. %Fisher provided a hypothesis test based\non a parametric approximation to the distribution of an entry in the precision\nmatrix of a Gaussian distribution, but this may not provide valid upper bounds\non $p$-values for non-Gaussian distributions. Many related works on this topic\nconsider potentially restrictive distributional or sparsity assumptions that\nmay not apply to a data sample of interest, and direct estimation of the\nuncertainty of an estimate of the precision matrix for general distributions\nremains challenging. Consequently, we make use of results for $U$-statistics\nand apply them to the covariance matrix. By probabilistically bounding the\ndistortion of the covariance matrix, we can apply Weyl's theorem to bound the\ndistortion of the precision matrix, yielding a conservative, but sound test\nthreshold for a much wider class of distributions than considered in previous\nworks. The resulting test enables one to answer with statistical significance\nwhether an edge is present in the graph, and convergence results are known for\na wide range of distributions. The computational complexities is linear in the\nsample size enabling the application of the test to large data samples for\nwhich computation time becomes a limiting factor. We experimentally validate\nthe correctness and scalability of the test on multivariate distributions for\nwhich the distributional assumptions of competing tests result in\nunderestimates of the false positive ratio.

Analogous to genomic sequence alignment, NA can be used to\ntransfer biological knowledge from well- to poorly-studied species between\naligned network regions. Pairwise NA (PNA) finds similar regions between two\nnetworks while multiple NA (MNA) can align more than two networks. We focus on\nMNA. Existing MNA methods aim to maximize total similarity over all aligned\nnodes (node conservation). Then, they evaluate alignment quality by measuring\nthe amount of conserved edges, but only after the alignment is constructed.\nDirectly optimizing edge conservation during alignment construction in addition\nto node conservation may result in superior alignments. Thus, we present a\nnovel MNA approach called multiMAGNA++ that can achieve this.

Here we present the hot X-ray gas properties of 33 early-type\nsystems within the MASSIVE galaxy survey sample that have archival Chandra\nX-ray observations. Through careful X-ray spectral modeling, we derive X-ray\nluminosities (L_X) and plasma temperatures (T_gas) for the diffuse gas\ncomponents in these galaxies. We combine the MASSIVE sample with 41 galaxies\nfrom the ATLAS^3D survey to investigate the X-ray and optical properties of a\nstatistically significant sample of nearby early-type galaxies across a\nwide-range of environments. We deduce that all early-type galaxies (independent\nof galaxy mass and rotational support) follow a universal scaling law such that\nL_X~T_gas^4.5. When X-ray measurements are performed consistently in apertures\nset by the galaxy stellar content, the wide-scale environment does not\ncontribute to the intrinsic scatter (~0.5dex) within the scaling relation. We\nfurther demonstrate that the scatter in L_X around both K-band luminosity (L_K)\nand the galaxy stellar velocity dispersion is primarily driven by T_gas, with\nno clear trends with halo mass, radio power, or angular momentum of the stars.\nIt is not trivial to tie the origin of the gas directly to either the stellar\nmass or the galaxy potential. Indeed, our data require a steeper relation\nbetween L_X, L_K, and sigma_e than predicted by standard mass-loss models.\nFinally, we find a statistically significant correlation between sigma_e and\nT_gas, suggesting that T_gas is set by the galaxy potential inside the optical\neffective radius.

NGC 4874 was observed with the HST Advanced Camera for\nSurveys in the F475W (g) and F814W (I) passbands and the Wide Field Camera 3 IR\nChannel in F160W (H). The GCs in this field exhibit a bimodal optical color\ndistribution with more than half of the GCs falling on the red side at g-I > 1.\nBimodality is also present, though less conspicuously, in the optical-NIR I-H\ncolor. Consistent with past work, we find evidence for nonlinearity in the g-I\nversus I-H color-color relation. Our results thus underscore the need for\nunderstanding the detailed form of the color-metallicity relations in\ninterpreting observational data on GC bimodality. We also find a very strong\ncolor-magnitude trend, or \"blue tilt,\" for the blue component of the optical\ncolor distribution of the NGC 4874 GC system. A similarly strong trend is\npresent for the overall mean I-H color as a function of magnitude; for M_814 <\n-10 mag, these trends imply a steep mass-metallicity scaling with $Z\\propto\nM_{\\rm GC}^{1.4\\pm0.4}$, but the scaling is not a simple power law and becomes\nmuch weaker at lower masses. As in other similar systems, the spatial\ndistribution of the blue GCs is more extended than that of the red GCs, partly\nbecause of blue GCs associated with surrounding cluster galaxies. In addition,\nthe center of the GC system is displaced by 4+/-1 kpc towards the southwest\nfrom the luminosity center of NGC 4874, in the direction of NGC 4872. Finally,\nwe remark on a dwarf elliptical galaxy with a noticeably asymmetrical GC\ndistribution. Interestingly, this dwarf has a velocity of nearly -3000 km/s\nwith respect to NGC 4874; we suggest it is on its first infall into the cluster\ncore and is undergoing stripping of its GC system by the cluster potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 20:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

We\nsearch for overdensities using the COSMOS photometric redshifts based on over\n30 UV-NIR photometric bands, reaching an accuracy of sigma(Delta\nz/(1+z))=0.0067 (0.0155) at z<3.5 (>3.5). To identify overdensities we apply\nthe Voronoi tessellation analysis, and estimate the overdensity estimator\ndelta_g as a function of distance from the SMG and/or overdensity center. We\ntest and validate our approach via simulations, X-ray detected groups, and\nspectroscopic verifications using VUDS and zCOSMOS catalogues showing that even\nwith photometric redshifts in COSMOS we can efficiently retrieve overdensities\nout to z~5.

We investigate the feasibility of planetesimal growth in circumbinary\nprotoplanetary disks around the observed systems Kepler- 16 and Kepler-34 under\nthe gravitational influence of a precessing eccentric gas disk. Methods. We\nembed the results of our previous hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary\ndisks around binaries into an N-body code to perform 3D, high-resolution,\ninter-particle gravity-enabled simulations of planetesimal growth and dynamics\nthat include the gravitational force imparted by the gas. Results. Including\nthe full, precessing asymmetric gas disk generates high eccentricity orbits for\nplanetesimals orbiting at the edge of the circumbinary cavity, where the gas\nsurface density and eccentricity have their largest values. The gas disk is\nable to efficiently align planetesimal pericenters in some regions leading to\nphased, non-interacting orbits. Outside of these areas eccentric planetesimal\norbits become misaligned and overlap leading to crossing orbits and high\nrelative velocities during planetesimal collisions. This can lead to an\nincrease in the number of erosive collisions that far outweighs the number of\ncollisions that result in growth. Gravitational focusing from the static\naxisymmetric gas disk is weak and does not significantly alter collision\noutcomes from the gas free case. Conclusions. Due to asymmetries in the gas\ndisk, planetesimals are strongly perturbed onto highly eccentric orbits. Where\nplanetesimals orbits are not well aligned, orbit crossings lead to an increase\nin the number of erosive collisions. This makes it difficult for sustained\nplanetesimal accretion to occur at the location of Kepler-16b and Kepler-34b\nand we therefore rule out in-situ growth. This adds further support to our\ninitial suggestions that most circumbinary planets should form further out in\nthe disk and migrate inwards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 20:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}

We show that the majority of the observed Jupiter\npairs (twenty out of twenty-four) will be dynamically unstable if the inner\nplanet was placed at >~1AU distance from the stellar host. This finding is at\nodds with formation theories that invoke the migration of such planets from\nsemi-major axes >~1AU due to secular dynamical processes (e.g., secular chaos,\nLidov-Kozai oscillations) coupled with tidal dissipation. In fact, the results\nof N-body integrations show that the evolution of dynamically unstable systems\ndoes not lead to tidal migration but rather to planet ejections and collisions\nwith the host star. This and other arguments lead us to suggest that most of\nthe observed planets with a companion could not have been transported from\nfurther out through secular migration processes. More generally, by using a\ncombination of numerical and analytic techniques we show that the high-e\nLidov-Kozai migration scenario can only account for less than 10% of all gas\ngiants observed between 0.1-1 AU.

To analyze the entire genome, each of the\nbillions of short reads must be mapped to a reference genome based on the\nsimilarity between a read and \"candidate\" locations in that reference genome.\nThe similarity measurement, called alignment, formulated as an approximate\nstring matching problem, is the computational bottleneck because: (1) it is\nimplemented using quadratic-time dynamic programming algorithms, and (2) the\nmajority of candidate locations in the reference genome do not align with a\ngiven read due to high dissimilarity. Calculating the alignment of such\nincorrect candidate locations consumes an overwhelming majority of a modern\nread mapper's execution time. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a fast and\neffective filter that can detect incorrect candidate locations and eliminate\nthem before invoking computationally costly alignment operations. Results: We\npropose GateKeeper, a new hardware accelerator that functions as a\npre-alignment step that quickly filters out most incorrect candidate locations.\nGateKeeper is the first design to accelerate pre-alignment using\nField-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), which can perform pre-alignment much\nfaster than software. GateKeeper can be integrated with any mapper that\nperforms sequence alignment for verification. When implemented on a single FPGA\nchip, GateKeeper maintains high accuracy (on average >96%) while providing up\nto 90-fold and 130-fold speedup over the state-of-the-art software\npre-alignment techniques, Adjacency Filter and Shifted Hamming Distance (SHD),\nrespectively. The addition of GateKeeper as a pre-alignment step can reduce the\nverification time of the mrFAST mapper by a factor of 10.

We propose a new CNN design without timepadding\nand without timepooling, which is slightly suboptimal for accuracy, but has two\nsignificant advantages: it enables sequence training and deployment by allowing\nefficient convolutional evaluation of full utterances, and, it allows for batch\nnormalization to be straightforwardly adopted to CNNs on sequence data. Through\nbatch normalization, we recover the lost peformance from removing the\ntime-pooling, while keeping the benefit of efficient convolutional evaluation.\nWe demonstrate the performance of our models both on larger scale data than\nbefore, and after sequence training.

Immersed surfaces with prescribed motions are generated using the\ninterpolation and regularization operators obtained from the discrete delta\nfunction approach of the original (Peskin's) immersed boundary method. Unlike\nPeskin's method, boundary forces are regarded as Lagrange multipliers that are\nused to satisfy the no-slip condition. The incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations are discretized on an unbounded staggered Cartesian grid and are\nsolved in a finite number of operations using lattice Green's function\ntechniques. These techniques are used to automatically enforce the natural\nfree-space boundary conditions and to implement a novel block-wise adaptive\ngrid that significantly reduces the run-time cost of solutions by limiting\noperations to grid cells in the immediate vicinity and near-wake region of the\nimmersed surface. These techniques also enable the construction of practical\ndiscrete viscous integrating factors that are used in combination with\nspecialized half-explicit Runge-Kutta schemes to accurately and efficiently\nsolve the differential algebraic equations describing the discrete momentum\nequation, incompressibility constraint, and no-slip constraint. Linear systems\nof equations resulting from the time integration scheme are efficiently solved\nusing an approximation-free nested projection technique. The algebraic\nproperties of the discrete operators are used to reduce projection steps to\nsimple discrete elliptic problems, e.g. discrete Poisson problems, that are\ncompatible with recent parallel fast multipole methods for difference\nequations.

Using human is time-consuming and costly due to monetary\ncompensations. Therefore, a crowd based algorithm must judiciously use any\ninformation computed through an automated process, and ask minimum number of\nquestions to the crowd adaptively.\n  One such problem which has received significant attention is {\\em entity\nresolution}. Formally, we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with unknown edge set $E$\nwhere $G$ is a union of $k$ (again unknown, but typically large $O(n^\\alpha)$,\nfor $\\alpha>0$) disjoint cliques $G_i(V_i, E_i)$, $i =1, \\dots, k$.

When the answer to each query is\ncorrect, e.g. via resampling, then this reduces to finding connected components\nin a graph. On the other hand, when crowd answers may be incorrect, it\ncorresponds to clustering over minimum number of noisy inputs. Even, with\nperfect answers, a simple lower and upper bound of $\\Theta(nk)$ on query\ncomplexity can be shown. A major contribution of this paper is to reduce the\nquery complexity to linear or even sublinear in $n$ when mild side information\nis provided by a machine, and even in presence of crowd errors which are not\ncorrectable via resampling. We develop new information theoretic lower bounds\non the query complexity of clustering with side information and errors, and our\nupper bounds closely match with them. Our algorithms are naturally\nparallelizable, and also give near-optimal bounds on the number of adaptive\nrounds required to match the query complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2016 00:58:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-08"}

The\nprocedure focuses on a desired minimum effect size for the research at hand and\nfinds the minimum sample size required for capturing such effect size as a\nstatistically significant result. In a similar fashion than power analyses,\nsensitiveness analyses can also be extended to finding the minimum effect for a\ngiven sample size a priori as well as to calculating sensitiveness a\nposteriori.

The goal is to find worst-case\noptimal parallel algorithms, similar to the work of [18] for sequential\nalgorithms.\n  We first show that for a single round we can obtain an optimal worst-case\nalgorithm. The optimal load for a conjunctive query $q$ when all relations have\nsize equal to $M$ is $O(M/p^{1/\\psi^*})$, where $\\psi^*$ is a new query-related\nquantity called the edge quasi-packing number, which is different from both the\nedge packing number and edge cover number of the query hypergraph. For multiple\nrounds, we present algorithms that are optimal for several classes of queries.\nFinally, we show a surprising connection to the external memory model, which\nallows us to translate parallel algorithms to external memory algorithms.

Under suitable conditions, simulations\nwith small-scale random forcing and large-scale drag exhibit a spontaneous\nformation of multiple zonal jets. The first hint of wave-like features is seen\nin the distribution of kinetic energy as a function of frequency; specifically,\nfor progressively larger deformation scales there are systematic departures in\nthe form of isolated peaks (at progressively higher frequencies) from a\npower-law scaling. Con- comitantly, there is an inverse flux of kinetic energy\nin frequency space which extends to lower frequencies for smaller deformation\nscales. The identification of these peaks as Rossby waves is made possible by\nexamining the energy spectrum in frequency-zonal wavenumber and\nfrequency-meridional wavenumber diagrams. In fact, the modified Rhines scale\nturns out to be a useful measure of the dominant meridional wavenumber of the\nmodulating Rossby waves; once this is fixed, apart from a spectral peak at the\norigin (the steady jet), almost all the energy is contained in westward\npropagating disturbances that follow the theoretical Rossby dispersion\nrelation. Quite consistently, noting that the zonal scale of the modulating\nwaves is restricted to the first few wavenumbers, the energy spectrum is almost\nentirely contained within the corresponding Rossby dispersion curves on a\nfrequency-meridional wavenumber diagram. Cases when jets do not form are also\nconsidered; once again, there is a hint of Rossby wave activity, though the\nspectral peaks are quite muted.

In dust extinction, we view the leading side of\nNGC 4402 and the trailing side of NGC 4522; we see distinct types of features\nin both galaxies. NGC 4522 has experienced stronger, more recent pressure and\nhas the jellyfish morphology characteristic of some ram pressure stripped\ngalaxies. Its stripped tail extends up from the disk plane in continuous\nupturns of dust and stars curving ~2 kpc above the disk plane. A kinematically\nand morphologically distinct extraplanar arm of young, blue stars and ISM\nextends above a mostly-stripped portion of the disk, and between it and the\ndisk plane are decoupled dust clouds. NGC 4402 contains long dust ridges,\nsuggesting that large parts of the ISM are being pushed out at once. Both\ngalaxies contain long ridges of polarized radio continuum emission indicating\nthe presence of large-scale ordered magnetic fields. We propose that magnetic\nfields could bind together gas of different densities, causing nearby gas of\ndifferent densities to be stripped at the same rate and creating the large,\ncoherent dust ridges and upturns. A number of factors that play roles in\ndetermining what types of structures form as a result of ram pressure: ram\npressure strength and history, the location within the galaxy relative to the\nleading side, and pre-existing substructure in the ISM that may be bound\ntogether by magnetic fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2016 06:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

We\nmeasure a lower limit to SDR in a sample of solar-like stars belonging to young\nassociations with the aim of investigating how SDR depends on global stellar\nparameters in the age range (4-95 Myr). The rotation period of a solar-like\nstar can be recovered by analyzing the flux modulation caused by dark spots and\nstellar rotation. The SDR and the latitude migration of dark-spots induce a\nmodulation of the detected rotation period. We employ long-term photometry to\nmeasure the amplitude of such a modulation and to compute the quantity\nDeltaOmega_phot =2p/P_min -2pi/P_max that is a lower limit to SDR. We find that\nDeltaOmega_phot increases with the stellar effective temperature and with the\nglobal convective turn-over time-scale tau_c. We find that DeltaOmega_phot is\nproportional to Teff^2.18pm 0.65 in stars recently settled on the ZAMS. This\npower law is less steep than those found by previous authors, but closest to\nrecent theoretical models.

Currently local decoding of Reed-Muller codes is based on decoding on\nlines or quadratic curves to recover one single coordinate. To recover multiple\ncoordinates simultaneously, the naive way is to repeat the local decoding for\nrecovery of a single coordinate. This decoding algorithm might be more\nexpensive, i.e., require higher query complexity. In this paper, we focus on\nReed-Muller codes with usual parameter regime, namely, the total degree of\nevaluation polynomials is $d=\\Theta({q})$, where $q$ is the code alphabet size\n(in fact, $d$ can be as big as $q/4$ in our setting). By introducing a novel\nvariation of codex, i.e., interleaved codex (the concept of codex has been used\nfor arithmetic secret sharing \\cite{C11,CCX12}), we are able to locally recover\narbitrarily large number $k$ of coordinates of a Reed-Muller code\nsimultaneously at the cost of querying $O(q^2k)$ coordinates. It turns out that\nour local decoding of Reed-Muller codes shows ({\\it perhaps surprisingly}) that\naccessing $k$ locations is in fact cheaper than repeating the procedure for\naccessing a single location for $k$ times.

However, the reasons for their empirical success are\nunclear, since modern convolutional networks (convnets), incorporating\nrectifier units and max-pooling, are neither smooth nor convex. Standard\nguarantees therefore do not apply. This paper provides the first convergence\nrates for gradient descent on rectifier convnets. The proof utilizes the\nparticular structure of rectifier networks which consists in binary\nactive/inactive gates applied on top of an underlying linear network. The\napproach generalizes to max-pooling, dropout and maxout. In other words, to\nprecisely the neural networks that perform best empirically. The key step is to\nintroduce gated games, an extension of convex games with similar convergence\nproperties that capture the gating function of rectifiers. The main result is\nthat rectifier convnets converge to a critical point at a rate controlled by\nthe gated-regret of the units in the network. Corollaries of the main result\ninclude: (i) a game-theoretic description of the representations learned by a\nneural network; (ii) a logarithmic-regret algorithm for training neural nets;\nand (iii) a formal setting for analyzing conditional computation in neural nets\nthat can be applied to recently developed models of attention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2016 10:46:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-08"}

The AK13 potential behaves analogously with\nthe discontinuous jump associated with the derivative discontinuity at integer\nparticle numbers. Recent works have established that AK13 gives a qualitatively\nimproved orbital description compared to other semi-local methods, and\nreproduces a band structure closer to higher-order theory. However, its\nenergies and energetics are inaccurate. The present work further investigates\nthe deficiency in energetics. In addition to AK13 results, we find that\napplying the local-density approximation (LDA) non-self-consistently on the\nconverged AK13 density gives very reasonable energetics with equilibrium\nlattice constants and bulk moduli well described across 14 systems.

Hence, the deficient energetics cannot be a result\nof the AK13 orbitals having adversely affected the quality of the electron\ndensity compared to that of usual semi-local functionals; an improved orbital\ndescription and good energetics are not in opposition. We also prove that the\nnon-self-consistent scheme is equivalent to using a single external-potential\ndependent functional in an otherwise consistent KS-DFT scheme. Furthermore, our\nresults also demonstrate that, while an internally consistent KS functional is\npresently missing, non-self-consistent LDA on AK13 orbitals works as a\npractical non-empirical computational scheme to predict geometries, bulk\nmoduli, while retaining the band structure features of AK13 at the\ncomputational cost of semi-local DFT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2016 11:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

The goal of this work is the quick detection\nof such changes and in general, tracking of macroscopic as well as microscopic\ntrends in group dynamics. Prior work in this area are based on parametric\napproaches and rely on time-series analysis techniques, self-exciting hurdle\nmodels (SEHM), or hidden Markov models (HMM). While these approaches detect\nspurts and downfalls reasonably accurately, they are all based on model\nlearning --- a task that is difficult in practice because of the \"rare\" nature\nof terrorist attacks from a model learning perspective. In this paper, we\npursue an alternate non-parametric approach for spurt detection in activity\nprofiles. Our approach is based on binning the count data of terrorist activity\nto form observation vectors that can be compared with each other. Motivated by\na majorization theory framework, these vectors are then transformed via certain\nfunctionals and used in spurt classification. While the parametric approaches\noften result in either a large number of missed detections of real changes or\nfalse alarms of unoccurred changes, the proposed approach is shown to result in\na small number of missed detections and false alarms.

We describe this\ntechnique and demonstrate its utility via a use case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 18:15:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

Measured slopes, the time to retrieve\nan additional item, vary from 1.4-4.5 seconds per item depending upon\npresentation rate, subject age and whether there is a delay after list\npresentation or not. These times to retrieve an additional item obey a second\nlinear relationship as a function of the recall probability averaged over the\nexperiment, explicitly independent of subject age, presentation rate and\nwhether there is a delay after the list presentation or not. This second linear\nrelationship mimics the relationships in recognition and cued recall (Tarnow,\n2008) which suggests that free recall retrieval uses the same reactivation\nmechanism as recognition or cued recall. Extrapolation limits the time to\nretrieve an additional item to a maximum of 7.2 seconds per item if the\nprobability of recall is near 0%. Earlier upper limits for recognition and cued\nrecall varied with the item type between 0.2 and 1.8 seconds per item (Tarnow,\n2008). Implications include that there are only two types of short term memory:\nworking memory and reactivation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2016 01:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-19"}

The Tarnow Unchunkable Test (TUT, [2]) uses double\ninteger items to separate out only the first stage by making it difficult to\nreactivate items due to the lack of intra-item relationships. 193 Russian\ncollege students were tested via the internet version of the TUT. The average\nnumber of items remembered in the 3 item test was 2.54 items. In the 4 item\ntest, the average number of items decreased to 2.38. This, and a number of\nother qualitative distribution differences between the 3 and 4 item tests,\nindicates that the average capacity limit of working memory has been reached at\n3 items. This provides the first direct measurement of the unchunkable capacity\nlimit of language based items. That the average number of items remembered\ndecreased as the number of items increased from 3 to 4 indicates that most\nsubjects were unable to manage their working memories as the number of items\nincreased just beyond the average capacity. Further evidence for the difficulty\nin managing the capacity limit is that 25% of subjects could not remember any\nitems correctly at least in one of three 4 item tests and that the Pearson\ncorrelation between the 3 item and 4 item subject recalls was a relatively\nsmall 38%. This failure of managing a basic memory resource should have\nimportant consequences for pedagogy including instruction, text book design and\ntest design. Because working memory scores are important for academic\nachievement, it also suggests that an individual can gain academically by\nlearning how to manage her or his capacity limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Apr 2016 01:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-19"}
