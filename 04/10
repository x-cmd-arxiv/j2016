This behavior is at the\ncore of algorithms known as Assimilation in the Unstable Subspace, although a\nformal proof was still missing.\n  This paper provides the analytical proof of the convergence of the Kalman\nfilter covariance matrix onto the unstable-neutral subspace when the dynamics\nand the observation operator are linear and when the dynamical model is\nerror-free, for any, possibly rank-deficient, initial error covariance matrix.\nThe rate of convergence is provided as well. The derivation is based on an\nexpression that explicitly relates the error covariances at an arbitrary time\nto the initial ones. It is also shown that if the unstable and neutral\ndirections of the model are sufficiently observed and if the column space of\nthe initial covariance matrix has a non-zero projection onto all of the forward\nLyapunov vectors associated with the unstable and neutral directions of the\ndynamics, the covariance matrix of the Kalman filter collapses onto an\nasymptotic sequence which is independent of the initial covariances.

Here we theoretically\nstudy its dependence on the loading rate, the age (history) of the glass and\nthe notch radius $\\rho$. Reduced-dimensionality analysis suggests that the\nnotch fracture toughness results from a competition between the initial, age-\nand history-dependent, plastic relaxation timescale $\\tau^{pl}_0$ and an\neffective loading timescale $\\tau^{ext}(\\dot{K}_I,\\rho)$, where $\\dot{K}_I$ is\nthe tensile stress-intensity-factor rate.

FD communication\nrenders the entire spectrum simultaneously accessible by uplink and downlink,\nand hence, is optimistically promoted to double the transmission rate. While\nthis is true for a single communication link, cross-mode interference (i.e.,\ninterference between uplink and downlink) may diminish the full-duplexing gain.\nThis paper studies FD operation in large-scale cellular networks with real base\nstations (BSs) locations and 3GPP propagation environment. The results show\nthat the uplink is the bottleneck for FD operation due to the overwhelming\ncross-mode interference from BSs. Operating uplink and downlink on a common set\nof channels in an FD fashion improves the downlink rate but significantly\ndegrades (over 1000-fold) the uplink rate. Therefore, we propose the\n$\\alpha$-duplex scheme to balance the tradeoff between the uplink and downlink\nrates via adjustable partial overlap between uplink and downlink channels. The\n$\\alpha$-duplex scheme can provide a simultaneous $30\\%$ improvement in each of\nthe uplink and downlink rates. To this end, we discuss the backward\ncompatibility of the $\\alpha$-duplex scheme with half-duplex user-terminals.\nFinally, we point out future research directions for FD enabled cellular\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2016 19:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

In this context, the fresh look advocated here permeates\nbenefits from convex optimization and graph signal processing, to identify the\nso-termed graph shift operator (encoding the network topology) given only the\neigenvectors of the shift. These spectral templates can be obtained, for\nexample, from principal component analysis of a set of graph signals defined on\nthe particular network. The novel idea is to find a graph shift that while\nbeing consistent with the provided spectral information, it endows the network\nstructure with certain desired properties such as sparsity.

Optical properties of mantle minerals at\nhigh pressure are accessible through diamond anvil cell experiments, but\nbecause of the extensive thermal radiation at T above 1000 K such studies are\nlimited to lower temperatures. Particularly uncertain is the\ntemperature-dependence of optical properties of lower mantle minerals across\nthe spin transition as the spin state itself is a strong function of\ntemperature. Here we use laser-heated DACs combined with a pulsed bright\nsupercontinuum laser probe and a synchronized time-gated detector to examine\noptical properties of high and low spin ferrous iron at 45-73 GPa and to 1600 K\nin FeO6, one of the most abundant building blocks in the mantle. Siderite\n(FeCO3) is used as a model for FeO6-octahedra as it contains no ferric iron and\nexhibits a sharp optically apparent spin transition at 44 GPa, simplifying data\ninterpretation. We find that the optical absorbance of low spin FeO6 is\nsubstantially increased at 1000-1200 K due to the partially lifted Laporte\nselection rule. The temperature-induced low to high spin transition, however,\nresults in a dramatic drop in absorbance of the FeO6-unit. The absorption edge\n(Fe-O charge transfer) red-shifts (~ 1 cm-1/K) with increasing temperature and\nat T above 1600 K becomes the dominant absorption mechanism in the visible\nrange, suppressing radiative conductivity. This implies that the radiative\nconductivity of analogous FeO6-bearing minerals such as ferropericlase, the\nsecond most abundant mineral in the Earths lower mantle, is substantially\nreduced approaching the core-mantle boundary conditions. Finally, our results\nemphasize that optical properties of mantle minerals probed at room temperature\nare insufficient to model radiative thermal conductivity of planetary\ninteriors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2016 22:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

This model thus\nprovides a rare example of a system where a phase transition is caused by a\nnon-local bifurcation, while both micro- and macro-level dynamics are\naccessible to mathematical analysis. The bifurcation points mark the onset of a\nbehaviour that we call network inoculation.

The reflected wave from\ndownstream topography is again reflected back by the patch of ripples through\nthe same mechanism.

To ensure\nrobustness, cutting edge supervised learning approaches rely on large training\ndatasets of face images captured in the wild. While impressive tracking quality\nhas been demonstrated for faces that are largely visible, any occlusion due to\nhair, accessories, or hand-to-face gestures would result in significant visual\nartifacts and loss of tracking accuracy. The modeling of occlusions has been\nmostly avoided due to its immense space of appearance variability. To address\nthis curse of high dimensionality, we perform tracking in unconstrained images\nassuming non-face regions can be fully masked out. Along with recent\nbreakthroughs in deep learning, we demonstrate that pixel-level facial\nsegmentation is possible in real-time by repurposing convolutional neural\nnetworks designed originally for general semantic segmentation. We develop an\nefficient architecture based on a two-stream deconvolution network with\ncomplementary characteristics, and introduce carefully designed training\nsamples and data augmentation strategies for improved segmentation accuracy and\nrobustness. We adopt a state-of-the-art regression-based facial tracking\nframework with segmented face images as training, and demonstrate accurate and\nuninterrupted facial performance capture in the presence of extreme occlusion\nand even side views. Furthermore, the resulting segmentation can be directly\nused to composite partial 3D face models on the input images and enable\nseamless facial manipulation tasks, such as virtual make-up or face\nreplacement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2016 07:04:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

In order to cope with the sampling rate bottleneck, new sampling\nmethods have been proposed that sample below the Nyquist rate. However, such\ntechniques decrease the signal to noise ratio (SNR), deteriorating the\nperformance of subsequent energy detection. Cyclostationary detection, which\nexploits the periodic property of communication signal statistics, absent in\nstationary noise, is a natural candidate for this setting. In this work, we\nconsider cyclic spectrum recovery from sub-Nyquist samples, in order to achieve\nboth efficiency and robustness to noise. To that end, we propose a structured\ncompressed sensing algorithm, that extends orthogonal matching pursuit to\naccount for the structure imposed by cyclostationarity. Next, we derive a lower\nbound on the sampling rate required for perfect cyclic spectrum recovery in the\npresence of stationary noise and show that it can be reconstructed from samples\nobtained below Nyquist, without any sparsity constraints on the signal. In\nparticular, in non sparse settings, the cyclic spectrum can be recovered at\n$4/5$ of the Nyquist rate. If the signal of interest is sparse, then the\nsampling rate may be further reduced to $8/5$ of the Landau rate. Once the\ncyclic spectrum is recovered, we estimate the number of transmissions that\ncompose the input signal, along with their carrier frequencies and bandwidths.\nSimulations show that cyclostationary detection outperforms energy detection in\nlow SNRs in the sub-Nyquist regime. This was already known in the Nyquist\nregime, but is even more pronounced at sub-Nyquist sampling rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2016 09:32:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2016 14:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

It is an\nimportant notion in sociology and related research. The problem of measuring\nsocial status has been studied for many years. Various indicators are proposed\nto assess social status of individuals, including educational attainment,\noccupation, and income/wealth. However, these indicators are sometimes\ndifficult to collect or measure.\n  We investigate social networks for alternative measures of social status.\nOnline activities expose certain traits of users in the real world. We are\ninterested in how these activities are related to social status, and how social\nstatus can be predicted with social network data. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first study on connecting online activities with social status in\nreality.\n  In particular, we focus on the network structure of microblogs in this study.\nA user following another implies some kind of status. We cast the predicted\nsocial status of users to the \"status\" of real-world entities, e.g.,\nuniversities, occupations, and regions, so that we can compare and validate\npredicted results with facts in the real world. We propose an efficient\nalgorithm for this task and evaluate it on a dataset consisting of 3.4 million\nusers from Sina Weibo. The result shows that it is possible to predict social\nstatus with reasonable accuracy using social network data.

To analyze structure or function of microbial communities from\nenvironmental samples, metagenomic sequence fragments are assigned to their\ntaxonomic origins. Although sequence alignment algorithms can readily be used\nand usually provide high-resolution alignments and accurate binning results,\nthe computational cost of such alignment-based methods becomes prohibitive as\nmetagenomic datasets continue to grow. Alternative compositional-based methods,\nwhich exploit sequence composition by profiling local short k-mers in\nfragments, are often faster but less accurate than alignment-based methods.\nInspired by the success of linear error correcting codes in noisy channel\ncommunication, we introduce Opal, a fast and accurate novel compositional-based\nbinning method. It incorporates ideas from Gallager's low-density parity-check\ncode to design a family of compact and discriminative locality-sensitive\nhashing functions that encode long-range compositional dependencies in long\nfragments. By incorporating the Gallager LSH functions as features in a simple\nlinear SVM, Opal provides fast, accurate and robust binning for datasets\nconsisting of a large number of species, even with mutations and sequencing\nerrors. Opal not only performs up to two orders of magnitude faster than BWA,\nan alignment-based binning method, but also achieves improved binning accuracy\nand robustness to sequencing errors. Opal also outperforms models built on\ntraditional k-mer profiles in terms of robustness and accuracy. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that we can effectively use Opal in the \"coarse search\" stage of a\ncompressive genomics pipeline to identify a much smaller candidate set of\ntaxonomic origins for a subsequent alignment-based method to analyze, thus\nproviding metagenomic binning with high scalability, high accuracy and high\nresolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2016 14:57:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

The directional modulation method operates by\nsteering the array beam in such a way that the phase of the received signal at\nthe receiver matches that of the intended M-PSK symbol. Due to the difference\nbetween the channels of the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper, the\nsignals received by the eavesdropper generally encompass a phase component\ndifferent than the actual symbols. As a result, the transceiver which employs\ndirectional modulation can impose a high symbol error rate on the eavesdropper\nwithout requiring to know the eavesdropper's channel. The optimal directional\nmodulation beamformer is designed to minimize the consumed power subject to\nsatisfying a specific resulting phase and minimal signal amplitude at each\nantenna of the legitimate receiver. The simulation results show that the\ndirectional modulation results in a much higher symbol error rate at the\neavesdropper compared to the conventional benchmark scheme, i.e., zero-forcing\nprecoding at the transmitter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 Apr 2016 15:39:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 09:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-15"}

Moreover, we can test in constant time if a vertex $u$\ndominates a vertex $v$, for any pair of query vertices $u$ and $v$. Next, we\npresent a new decremental algorithm to update a dominator tree through a\nsequence of edge deletions. Although our new decremental algorithm is not\nasymptotically faster than repeated applications of a static algorithm, i.e.,\nit runs in $O(mk)$ time for $k$ edge deletions, it performs well in practice.\nBy combining our new incremental and decremental algorithms we obtain a fully\ndynamic algorithm that maintains the dominator tree through intermixed sequence\nof insertions and deletions of edges.

We used statistical relationships between the properties of\nsunspot group emergence, such as the latitude, area, and tilt angle, and the\nsunspot cycle strength and phase to produce semi-synthetic sunspot group\nrecords starting in the year 1700. The semisynthetic records are fed into a\nsurface flux transport model to obtain daily simulated magnetograms that map\nthe distribution of the magnetic flux in active regions (sunspots and faculae)\nand their decay products on the solar surface. The magnetic flux emerging in\nephemeral regions is accounted for separately based on the concept of extended\ncycles whose length and amplitude are linked to those of the sunspot cycles\nthrough the sunspot number.
