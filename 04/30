In this\nimplementation the MM atoms are considered as additional QM ions having\nfractional charges of either sign, which provides conceptual and computational\nsimplicity by exploiting the machinery already existing in planewave codes to\ndeal with electrostatics in periodic boundary conditions. With this strategy,\nboth the QM and MM regions are contained in the same supercell, which\ndetermines the periodicity for the whole system. Thus, while this method is not\nmeant to compete with non-periodic QM-MM schemes able to handle extremely large\nbut finite MM regions, it is shown that for periodic systems of a few hundred\natoms, our approach provides substantial savings in computational times by\ntreating classically a fraction of the particles.

The model presents two regimes for tumor\ngrowth. In the first, cancer arises due to three reasons: a partial corruption\nof the functions that avoid the growth of mutated cells, an aggressive\nphenotype of tumor cells and exposure to external carcinogenic factors. In this\ncase, treatments may be effective if they drive the system to the basin of\nattraction of the cancer cure state. In the second regime, cancer arises\nbecause the repair system is intrinsically corrupted. In this case, the\ncomplete cure is not possible since the cancer cure state is no more stable,\nbut tumor recurrence may be delayed if treatment is prolongued.

To fully exploit the opportunities\nin the third dimension, we propose Skybridge-3D-CMOS (S3DC), a fine-grained 3D\nintegration approach that is directly composed in 3D, utilizing the vertical\ndimension vs. using a layer-by-layer assembly mindset. S3DC uses a novel wafer\nfabric creation with direct 3D design and connectivity in the vertical\ndimension. It builds on a uniform vertical nanowire template that is processed\nas a single wafer; it incorporates specifically architected structures for\nrealizing devices, circuits, and heat management directly in 3D. Novel 3D\ninterconnect concepts, including within the silicon layers, enable\nsignificantly improved routing flexibility in all three dimensions and a\nhigh-density 3D design paradigm overall. Intrinsic components for fabric-level\n3D heat management are introduced. Extensive bottom-up simulations and\nexperiments have been presented to validate the key fabric-enabling concepts.\nEvaluation results indicate up to 40x density and 10x performance-per-watt\nbenefits against conventional 16-nm CMOS for the circuits studied; benefits are\nalso at least an order of magnitude beyond what was shown to be possible with\nother 3D directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2016 18:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-02"}

Understanding the mechanisms underlying biological systems, and\nultimately, predicting their behaviours in a changing environment requires\novercoming the gap between mathematical models and experimental or\nobservational data. Differential equations (DEs) are commonly used to model the\ntemporal evolution of biological systems, but statistical methods for comparing\nDE models to data and for parameter inference are relatively poorly developed.\nThis is especially problematic in the context of biological systems where\nobservations are often noisy and only a small number of time points may be\navailable. 2. The Bayesian approach offers a coherent framework for parameter\ninference that can account for multiple sources of uncertainty, while making\nuse of prior information. It offers a rigorous methodology for parameter\ninference, as well as modelling the link between unobservable model states and\nparameters, and observable quantities. 3. We present deBInfer, a package for\nthe statistical computing environment R, implementing a Bayesian framework for\nparameter inference in DEs. deBInfer provides templates for the DE model, the\nobservation model and data likelihood, and the model parameters and their prior\ndistributions. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure processes these\ninputs to estimate the posterior distributions of the parameters and any\nderived quantities, including the model trajectories. Further functionality is\nprovided to facilitate MCMC diagnostics, the visualisation of the posterior\ndistributions of model parameters and trajectories, and the use of compiled DE\nmodels for improved computational performance. 4.

While 3D IC technologies using Through Silicon Via or Monolithic\nInter-layer Via alleviate some of these challenges, they follow a similar\nlayout and routing mindset as 2D CMOS. This is insufficient to address routing\nrequirements in high-density 3D ICs and even causes severe routing congestion\nat large-scale designs, limiting their benefits and scalability. Skybridge is a\nrecently proposed fine-grained 3D IC fabric relying on vertical nanowires that\npresents a paradigm shift for scaling, while addressing associated 3D\nconnectivity and manufacturability challenges.

Strong refutation is the problem of\ncertifying that no variable assignment satisfies more than a constant fraction\nof clauses; this is the natural algorithmic problem in the unsatisfiable regime\n(when $m/n = \\omega(1)$).\n  Intuitively, strong refutation should become easier as the clause density\n$m/n$ grows, because the contradictions introduced by the random clauses become\nmore locally apparent. For CSPs such as $k$-SAT and $k$-XOR, there is a\nlong-standing gap between the clause density at which efficient strong\nrefutation algorithms are known, $m/n \\ge \\widetilde O(n^{k/2-1})$, and the\nclause density at which instances become unsatisfiable with high probability,\n$m/n = \\omega (1)$.\n  In this paper, we give spectral and sum-of-squares algorithms for strongly\nrefuting random $k$-XOR instances with clause density $m/n \\ge \\widetilde\nO(n^{(k/2-1)(1-\\delta)})$ in time $\\exp(\\widetilde O(n^{\\delta}))$ or in\n$\\widetilde O(n^{\\delta})$ rounds of the sum-of-squares hierarchy, for any\n$\\delta \\in [0,1)$ and any integer $k \\ge 3$.

On\nthe other hand, we find that the introduction of a negative cosmological\nconstant does not affect the angular momentum-free of entropy sum and product\nbut the criterion for angular momentum-independence of entropy product will be\naffected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2016 06:40:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 04:28:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}

Unlike the previous\nmethods, this paper aims at a high-quality fully-automatic colorization method.\nWith the assumption of a perfect patch matching technique, the use of an\nextremely large-scale reference database (that contains sufficient color\nimages) is the most reliable solution to the colorization problem. However,\npatch matching noise will increase with respect to the size of the reference\ndatabase in practice. Inspired by the recent success in deep learning\ntechniques which provide amazing modeling of large-scale data, this paper\nre-formulates the colorization problem so that deep learning techniques can be\ndirectly employed.

Connectivity to multiple cells - both\nin the mmWave and in the traditional lower frequencies - is thus considered\nessential for robust connectivity. However, one of the challenges in supporting\nmulti-connectivity in the mmWave space is the requirement for the network to\ntrack the direction of each link in addition to its power and timing. With\nhighly directional beams and fast varying channels, this directional tracking\nmay be the main bottleneck in realizing robust mmWave networks. To address this\nchallenge, this paper proposes a novel measurement system based on (i) the UE\ntransmitting sounding signals in directions that sweep the angular space, (ii)\nthe mmWave cells measuring the instantaneous received signal strength along\nwith its variance to better capture the dynamics and, consequently, the\nreliability of a channel/direction and, finally, (iii) a centralized controller\nmaking handover and scheduling decisions based on the mmWave cell reports and\ntransmitting the decisions either via a mmWave cell or conventional microwave\ncell (when control signaling paths are not available).

Here, as a model to\ndescribe such phenomena, we investigate a Langevin equation with diffusivity\nfluctuating between a fast and a slow state. We assume that the sojourn time\ndistributions of these two states are given by power laws. It is shown that,\nfor a non-equilibrium ensemble, the ensemble-averaged mean square displacement\n(MSD) shows transient subdiffusion. In contrast, the time-averaged MSD shows\nnormal diffusion, but an effective diffusion coefficient transiently shows\naging behavior. The propagator is non-Gaussian for short time, and converges to\na Gaussian distribution in a long time limit; this convergence to Gaussian is\nextremely slow for some parameter values. For equilibrium ensembles, both\nensemble-averaged and time-averaged MSDs show only normal diffusion, and thus\nwe cannot detect any traces of the fluctuating diffusivity with these MSDs.\nTherefore, as an alternative approach to characterize the fluctuating\ndiffusivity, the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the time-averaged MSD is\nutilized, and it is shown that the RSD exhibits slow relaxation as a signature\nof the long-time correlation in the fluctuating diffusivity. Furthermore, it is\nshown that the RSD is related to a non-Gaussian parameter of the propagator.

The integrated cross section and\nthe differential cross sections as a function of top quark pt and rapidity are\nmeasured at particle level within a fiducial region related to the\ndetector-level requirements and at parton level.

Thakur, Ryan Mohr, Igor Mezi\\'c","title":"Programmable Potentials: Approximate N-body potentials from coarse-level\n  logic","comments":"17 pages, 11 figures","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"physics.chem-ph q-bio.BM","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  This paper gives a systematic method for constructing an N-body potential,\napproximating the true potential, that accurately captures meso-scale behavior\nof the chemical or biological system using pairwise potentials coming from\nexperimental data or ab initio methods. The meso-scale behavior is translated\ninto logic rules for the dynamics. Each pairwise potential has an associated\nlogic function that is constructed using the logic rules, a class of elementary\nlogic functions, and AND, OR, and NOT gates. The effect of each logic function\nis to turn its associated potential on and off. The N-body potential is\nconstructed as linear combination of the pairwise potentials, where the\n\"coefficients\" of the potentials are smoothed versions of the associated logic\nfunctions. These potentials allow a potentially low-dimensional description of\ncomplex processes while still accurately capturing the relevant physics at the\nmeso-scale. We present the proposed formalism to construct coarse-grained\npotential models for three examples: an inhibitor molecular system, bond\nbreaking in chemical reactions, and DNA transcription from biology. The method\ncan potentially be used in reverse for design of molecular processes by\nspecifying properties of molecules that can carry them out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2016 01:23:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-19"}
