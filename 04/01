Recently, a physics-based, nonparametric approach for quantifying\nmodel-form uncertainty in RANS simulations has been proposed, where Reynolds\nstresses are projected to physically meaningful dimensions and perturbations\nare introduced only in the physically realizable limits. However, a challenge\nassociated with this approach is to assess the amount of information introduced\nin the prior distribution and to avoid imposing unwarranted constraints. In\nthis work we propose a random matrix approach for quantifying model-form\nuncertainties in RANS simulations with the realizability of the Reynolds stress\nguaranteed. Furthermore, the maximum entropy principle is used to identify the\nprobability distribution that satisfies the constraints from available\ninformation but without introducing artificial constraints. We demonstrate that\nthe proposed approach is able to ensure the realizability of the Reynolds\nstress, albeit in a different manner from the physics-based approach. Monte\nCarlo sampling of the obtained probability distribution is achieved by using\npolynomial chaos expansion to map independent Gaussian random fields to the\nReynolds stress random field with the marginal distributions and correlation\nstructures as specified. Numerical simulations on a typical flow with\nseparation have shown physically reasonable results, which verifies the\nproposed approach. Therefore, the proposed method is a promising alternative to\nthe physics-based approach for model-form uncertainty quantification of RANS\nsimulations. The method explored in this work is general and can be extended to\nother complex physical systems in applied mechanics and engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 16:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

Threshold studies show an optimal working point of the\nMIMOSA26 sensors at a sensor threshold of between five and six times their RMS\nnoise. Measurements at different plane spacings are used to calibrate the\namount of multiple scattering in the material traversed and allow for\ncorrections to the predicted angular scattering for electron beams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 16:30:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 11:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-11"}

Fundamentally, the\ndriving breaks the continuous time-translation symmetry and replaces it with\nthe symmetry with respect to time translation by the driving period. This\ndiscrete symmetry should be reflected in the character of the oscillations.\nHere, we perform experimental and theoretical study of new aspects of the\nbackaction and the discrete time-translation symmetry using a micromechanical\nresonator designed to have two nonlinearly coupled vibrational modes with\nstrongly differing frequencies and decay rates. We find that self-sustained\noscillations are induced not only in the low frequency mode as measured in\nprevious experiments, but also in the high frequency mode. The vibration\nfrequencies and amplitudes are determined by the system nonlinearity, which\nalso leads to bistability and hysteresis. A remarkable consequence of the\ndiscrete time-translation symmetry is revealed by studying the vibration\nphases. We find that the phase fluctuations of the two modes are nearly\nperfectly anti-correlated. At the same time, in each mode the phase undergoes\nanomalous diffusion, where the time dependence of the phase variance follows a\nsuperlinear rather than the standard linear power law. Our analysis shows that\nthe exponent of the power law is determined by the exponent of the 1/f-type\nintrinsic frequency noise of the resonator. We demonstrate the possibility of\ncompensating for these fluctuations using a feedback scheme to generate stable\noscillations that could prove useful in frequency standards and resonant\ndetection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 16:36:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2016 11:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-10"}

One explanation offered for this\nbehavior is that molecular crowding renders diffusion anomalous, where the\nmean-squared displacement of the particles scales as $\\langle r^2 \\rangle\n\\propto t^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha < 1$. Unfortunately, methods such as\nfluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) or fluorescence recovery after\nphotobleaching (FRAP) probe diffusion only over a narrow range of lengthscales\nand cannot directly test the dependence of the mean-squared displacement (MSD)\non time. Here we show that variable-lengthscale FCS (VLS-FCS), where the volume\nof observation is varied over several orders of magnitude, combined with a\nnumerical inversion procedure of the correlation data, allows retrieving the\nMSD for up to five decades in time, bridging the gap between diffusion\nexperiments performed at different lengthscales. In addition, we show that\nVLS-FCS provides a way to assess whether the propagator associated with the\ndiffusion is Gaussian or non-Gaussian. We used VLS-FCS to investigate two\nsystems where anomalous diffusion had been previously reported. In the case of\ndense cross-linked agarose gels, the measured MSD confirmed that the diffusion\nof small beads was anomalous at short lengthscales, with a cross-over to simple\ndiffusion around $\\approx 1~\\mu$m, consistent with a caged diffusion process.\nOn the other hand, for solutions crowded with marginally entangled dextran\nmolecules, we uncovered an apparent discrepancy between the MSD, found to be\nlinear, and the propagators at short lengthscales, found to be non-Gaussian.\nThese contradicting features call to mind the \"anomalous, yet Brownian\"\ndiffusion observed in several biological systems, and the recently proposed\n\"diffusing diffusivity\" model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 17:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-18"}

We also deduce the exact\nLense-Thirring (LT) precession frequency of a test gyroscope moving toward a\nrotating traversable Teo wormhole. The precession frequency diverges on the\nergoregion, a behavior intimately related to and governed by the geometry of\nthe ergoregion, analogous to the situation in a Kerr spacetime. Interestingly,\nit turns out that here the LT precession is inversely proportional to the\nangular momentum ($a$) of the wormhole along the pole and around it in the\nstrong gravity regime, a behavior contrasting with its direct variation with\n$a$ in the case of other compact objects. In fact, divergence of LT precession\ninside the ergoregion can also be avoided if the gyro moves with a non-zero\nangular velocity in a certain range. As a result, the spin precession frequency\nof the gyro can be made finite throughout its whole path, even very close to\nthe throat, during its travel to the wormhole. Furthermore, it is evident from\nour formulation that this spin precession not only arises due to curvature or\nrotation of the spacetime but also due to the non-zero angular velocity of the\nspin when it does not move along a geodesic in the strong gravity regime.

We propose an\ninformation-theoretic model where a charger can dynamically decide on how much\npower to transfer to the transmitter based on its side information regarding\nthe communication, while the transmitter needs to dynamically adapt its coding\nstrategy to its instantaneous energy state, which in turn depends on the\nactions previously taken by the charger. We characterize the capacity as an\n$n$-letter mutual information rate under various levels of side information\navailable at the charger. When the charger is finely tunable to different\nenergy levels, referred to as a \"precision charger\", we show that these\nexpressions reduce to single-letter form and there is a simple and intuitive\njoint charging and coding scheme achieving capacity. The precision charger\nscenario is motivated by the observation that in practice the transferred\nenergy can be controlled by simply changing the amplitude of the beamformed\nsignal. When the charger does not have sufficient precision, for example when\nit is restricted to use a few discrete energy levels, we show that the\ncomputation of the $n$-letter capacity can be cast as a Markov decision process\nif the channel is noiseless. This allows us to numerically compute the capacity\nfor specific cases and obtain insights on the corresponding optimal policy, or\neven to obtain closed form analytical solutions by solving the corresponding\nBellman equations, as we demonstrate through examples. Our findings provide\nsome surprising insights on how side information at the charger can be used to\nincrease the overall capacity of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 18:32:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 04:20:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-12"}

Multiple-person visual tracking is combined with multiple\nspeech-source localization in order to tackle the speech-to-person association\nproblem. The latter is solved within a novel audio-visual fusion method on the\nfollowing grounds: binaural spectral features are first extracted from a\nmicrophone pair, then a supervised audio-visual alignment technique maps these\nfeatures onto an image, and finally a semi-supervised clustering method assigns\nbinaural spectral features to visible persons. The main advantage of this\nmethod over previous work is that it processes in a principled way speech\nsignals uttered simultaneously by multiple persons. The diarization itself is\ncast into a latent-variable temporal graphical model that infers speaker\nidentities and speech turns, based on the output of an audio-visual association\nprocess, executed at each time slice, and on the dynamics of the diarization\nvariable itself.

We propose hierarchical\nquickest change detection (HQCD), a framework that formalizes the process of\nincorporating additional correlated sources for early changepoint detection.\nThe core ideas behind HQCD are rooted in the theory of quickest detection and\nHQCD can be regarded as its novel generalization to a hierarchical setting.

The clusters with an initial\nhalf-mass radius of 0.1 (0.3) pc can eject up to 50% (30%) of their O-star\nsystems on average. Most of the models show that the average ejection fraction\ndecreases with decreasing stellar mass. For clusters efficient at ejecting O\nstars, the mass function of the ejected stars is top-heavy compared to the\ngiven initial mass function (IMF), while the mass function of stars that remain\nin the cluster becomes slightly steeper (top-light) than the IMF. The top-light\nmass functions of stars in 3 Myr old clusters in our N-body models agree well\nwith the mean mass function of young intermediate-mass clusters in M31, as\nreported previously.

The goal of\nthese studies is to constrain the nature of the hypothesized SN Ia mass-donor\ncompanion. A continuous CSM is typically assumed when interpreting observations\nof interaction. However, while such models have been successfully applied to\ncore-collapse SNe, the assumption of continuity may not be accurate for SNe Ia,\nas shells of CSM could be formed by pre-supernova eruptions (novae). In this\nwork, we model the interaction of SNe with a spherical, low density,\nfinite-extent CSM and create a suite of synthetic radio synchrotron light\ncurves. We find that CSM shells produce sharply peaked light curves, and\nidentify a fiducial set of models that all obey a common evolution and can be\nused to generate radio light curves for interaction with an arbitrary shell.\nThe relations obeyed by the fiducial models can be used to deduce CSM\nproperties from radio observations; we demonstrate this by applying them to the\nnon-detections of SN 2011fe and SN 2014J. Finally, we explore a multiple shell\nCSM configuration and describe its more complicated dynamics and resultant\nradio light curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 20:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

This\nrequires adding a SU(3)_L x SU(3)_R x Z(3)_A nonet of scalar fields, with both\nparities, and coupling these to quarks through a Yukawa coupling, y. Treating\nthe scalar fields in mean field approximation, the effective Lagrangian is\ncomputed by integrating out quarks to one loop order. In addition to the usual\nsymmetry breaking term, linear in the current quark mass m_qk, at a nonzero\ntemperature T it is necessary to add a new term, ~ m_qk T^2. The parameters of\nthe gluon part of the matrix model are identical to that for the pure glue\ntheory without quarks. The parameters in the chiral matrix model are fixed by\nthe values, at zero temperature, of the pion decay constant and the masses of\nthe pions, kaons, eta, and eta'. The temperature for the chiral crossover at\nT_chi = 155 MeV is determined by adjusting the Yukawa coupling y. We find\nreasonable agreement with the results of numerical simulations on the lattice\nfor the pressure and related quantities. In the chiral limit, besides the\ndivergence in the chiral susceptibility there is also a milder divergence in\nthe susceptibility between the Polyakov loop and the chiral order parameter,\nwith critical exponent beta - 1. We compute derivatives with respect to a quark\nchemical potential to determine the susceptibilities for baryon number, the\nchi_2n. Especially sensitive tests are provided by chi_4 - chi_2 and by chi_6,\nwhich changes in sign about T_chi. The behavior of the susceptibilities in the\nchiral matrix model strongly suggests that as the temperature increases from\nT_chi, that the transition to deconfinement is significantly quicker than\nindicated by the measurements of the (renormalized) Polyakov loop on the\nlattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 20:00:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jun 2016 01:49:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2016 15:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-18"}

From this point of view it is concluded that the\neffect of using a capacitive coupling i.e., a strong electric field to induce\nelectric dipoles can be disregarded unless the volume fraction of the GNPs is\nunrealistically high, or if there are some other electric dipole mechanisms\npresent which are not taken into account here, such as e.g., with nanospheres\ncoated with ligands providing an electrophoretic movement and associated\nresonances. On the other hand, a simplified quasi-magnetostatic analysis\nindicates that an inductive heating (induced eddy currents inside the metal\nparticles) based on magnetic coupling may have the potential to significantly\nincrease the heating locally provided that the supplied magnetic field can be\nmade sufficiently strong at radio frequency. This paper presents a near field\noptimization approach to study the electromagnetic heating of conductive\nnanoparticles. An optimization problem is formulated where the power absorption\ninside the nanoparticles is maximized subjected to power constraints related to\nthe skin effect in the surrounding medium. The analysis shows that when the\nexterior medium is modelled as salty water the skin effect in the bulk material\nwill render the simple principle of inductive heating of GNPs practically\nuseless at 13.56 MHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 20:16:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 16:41:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-25"}

The goal is\nto get accurate speed predictions inspite of the significant real world\ndifficulties of force drift, force hysteresis, rubber ageing, and the very non-\nlinear, non-ideal, force vs. pull distance curves of slingshot rubber bands.\nSlingshots are known to shoot faster under some circumstances when the bands\nare tapered rather than having constant width and stiffness. We give both\nqualitative understanding and numerical predictions of this effect. We consider\ntwo models. The first is based on conservation of energy and is easier to\nimplement, but cannot determine the speeds along the rubber bands without\nmaking assumptions. The second, treats the bands as a series of mass points\nsubject to being pulled by immediately adjacent mass points according to how\nmuch the rubber has been stretched on the two adjacent sides. This is a classic\nmany-body F=ma problem but convergence requires using a particular numerical\ntechnique. It gives accurate predictions (average error +2%, standard deviation\n3%). The basis for these models involves measurements of pull-force vs.\npull-distance. We will show how such measurements can be scaled for increased\nwidth or length, so that minimal calibration measurements are needed to support\nthe models. With a good physical model of a slingshot one is easily able to\ntest a wide range of parameters to determine how to get the fastest shots for a\ngiven pull force and draw length.

Even though the optical properties of bulk\nmetals at elevated temperatures have been studied, the temperature-dependent\ndata for thin metal films, with thicknesses ranging from few tens to few\nhundreds of nanometers, is largely missing. In this work we report on the\noptical constants of single- and polycrystalline gold thin films at elevated\ntemperatures in the wavelength range from 370 to 2000 nm. Our results show that\nwhile the real part of the dielectric function changes marginally with\nincreasing temperature, the imaginary part changes drastically. For\n200-nm-thick single- and polycrystalline gold films the imaginary part of the\ndielectric function at 500 0C becomes nearly twice larger than that at room\ntemperature. In contrast, in thinner films (50-nm and 30-nm) the imaginary part\ncan show either increasing or decreasing behavior within the same temperature\nrange and eventually at 500 0C it becomes nearly 3-4 times larger than that at\nroom temperature. The increase in the imaginary part at elevated temperatures\nsignificantly reduces the surface plasmon polariton propagation length and the\nquality factor of the localized surface plasmon resonance for a spherical\nparticle. We provide experiment-fitted models to describe the\ntemperature-dependent gold dielectric function as a sum of one Drude and two\nCritical Point oscillators. These causal analytical models could enable\naccurate multiphysics modelling of gold-based nanophotonic and plasmonic\nelements in both frequency and time domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 21:49:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-22"}

Bulk\nComptonization by divergenceless turbulence is due to radiation viscous\ndissipation only. It can be treated as thermal Comptonization by solving the\nKompaneets equation with an equivalent \"wave\" temperature, which is a weighted\nsum over the power present at each scale in the turbulent cascade. Bulk\nComptonization by turbulence with non-zero divergence is due to both pressure\nwork and radiation viscous dissipation. Pressure work has negligible effect on\nphoton spectra in the limit of optically thin turbulence, and in this limit\nradiation viscous dissipation alone can be treated as thermal Comptonization\nwith a temperature equivalent to the full turbulent power.

Optically induced transitions within the Floquet states and\nformation of correlated electron-hole pairs, i.e., exciton states, are examined\nnumerically.

The animated effects resulting\nfrom these interactions depends both on how interaction (e.g., brushing speed)\ncontrols properties of the animation such as frame rate, as well as how the\ndata that is being explored dictates the data encoded in the animation. Past\nwork has found that frame rate matters to general perception, however a\ncritical question is which of these animation and data properties affects the\nperceptual accuracy of judgement tasks, and to what extent. Although graphical\nperception has been well studied for static data visualizations, it is ripe for\nexploration in the animated setting. We designed two animated judgment tasks of\na target bar in an animated bar chart and empirically evaluate the effects of 2\nanimations properties - highlighting of the target bar and frame rate - as well\nas 3 data properties that affect the target bar's value throughout the\nanimation. In short, we find that the rate and timing of animation changes is\neasier detected in larger values; that encodings such as color are easier to\ndetect than shapes; and that timing is important - earlier changes were harder\nto perceive as compared to later changes in the animation. Our results are an\ninitial step to understanding perceptual accuracy for animated data\nvisualizations, both for presentations and ultimately as part of interactive\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Mar 2016 23:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-04"}

Original contributions\ninclude our treatment of far-from-equilibrium degenerate statistics and\nQC-based modeling of surface-roughness scattering, as well as considering\nquantum-confined phonon and impurity scattering in 3D. Typical MC simulations\napproximate degenerate carrier populations as Fermi distributions to model the\nPauli-blocking (PB) of scattering to occupied final states. To allow for\nincreasingly far-from-equilibrium non-Fermi carrier distributions in\nultra-scaled devices, we instead generate the final-state occupation\nprobabilities used for PB by sampling the local carrier populations as a\nfunction of energy and energy valley. This process is aided by the use of\nfractional carriers or sub-carriers, which minimizes classical carrier-carrier\nscattering.

By launching data injection attacks, an adversary can\nmanipulate the real-time locational marginal prices to obtain economic\nbenefits. Despite the surge of existing literature on data injection, most such\nworks assume the presence of a single attacker and assume no cost for attack or\ndefense. In contrast, in this paper, a model for data injection attacks with\nmultiple adversaries and a single smart grid defender is introduced. To study\nthe defender-attackers interaction, two game models are considered. In the\nfirst, a Stackelberg game model is used in which the defender acts as a leader\nthat can anticipate the actions of the adversaries, that act as followers,\nbefore deciding on which measurements to protect. The existence and properties\nof the Stackelberg equilibrium of this game are studied. To find the\nequilibrium, a distributed learning algorithm that operates under limited\nsystem information is proposed and shown to converge to the game solution. In\nthe second proposed game model, it is considered that the defender cannot\nanticipate the actions of the adversaries. To this end, we proposed a hybrid\nsatisfaction equilibrium - Nash equilibrium game and defined its equilibrium\nconcept. A search algorithm is also provided to find the equilibrium of the\nhybrid game. Numerical results using the IEEE 30-bus system are used to\nillustrate and analyze the strategic interactions between the attackers and\ndefender. Our results show that by defending a very small set of measurements,\nthe grid operator can achieve an equilibrium through which the optimal attacks\nhave no effect on the system. Moreover, our results show how, at equilibrium,\nmultiple attackers can play a destructive role towards each other, by choosing\nto carry out attacks that cancel each other out, leaving the system unaffected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 03:32:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-04"}

For the Bayesian inverse problem, the forward\nmodel needs to be repeatedly computed for a large number of samples to get a\nstationary chain. This requires large computational efforts. To significantly\nimprove the computation efficiency, we use generalized multiscale finite\nelement method and least-squares stochastic collocation method to construct a\nreduced computational model. To avoid the difficulty of choosing regularization\nparameter, hyperparameters are introduced to build a hierarchical model. We use\ntruncated Karhunen-Loeve expansion (KLE) to reduce the dimension of the\nparameter spaces and decrease the mixed time of Markov chains. The techniques\nof hyperparameter and KLE are incorporated into the model reduction method. The\nreduced model is constructed offline. Then it is computed very efficiently in\nthe online sampling stage. This strategy can significantly accelerate the\nevaluation of the Markov chain and the resultant posterior distribution\nconverges fast. We analyze the convergence for the approximation between the\nposterior distribution by the reduced model and the reference posterior\ndistribution by the full-order model. A few numerical examples in subsurface\nflows are carried out to demonstrate the performance of the presented model\nreduction method with application of the Bayesian inverse problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 06:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-04"}

After categorizing the GBPs into five groups by their\nlongitudinal magnetic field strengths, we analyze the dynamics of GBPs of each\ngroup. The results suggest that with increasing longitudinal magnetic field\nstrengths of GBPs correspond to a decrease in their horizontal velocities and\nmotion ranges as well as by showing more complicated motion paths. This\nsuggests that magnetic elements showing weaker magnetic field strengths prefer\nto move faster and farther along straighter paths, while stronger ones move\nmore slowly in more erratic paths within a smaller region. The dynamic\nbehaviors of GBPs with different longitudinal magnetic field strengths can be\nexplained by that the stronger flux concentrations withstand the convective\nflows much better than weaker ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 07:14:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

Our method relies on\ncross-relaxation between a probe spin, the electronic spin of a\nnitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond, and target spins as the two systems are\ntuned into resonance. By optically monitoring the spin relaxation time ($T_1$)\nof the probe spin while varying the amplitude of an applied static magnetic\nfield, a frequency spectrum of the target spin resonances, a $T_1$-MR spectrum,\nis obtained. As a proof of concept, we measure $T_1$-MR spectra of a small\nensemble of $^{14}$N impurities surrounding the probe spin within the diamond,\nwith each impurity comprising an electron spin 1/2 and a nuclear spin 1. The\nintrinsically large bandwidth of the technique and probe properties allows us\nto detect both electron spin transitions -- in the GHz range -- and nuclear\nspin transitions -- in the MHz range -- of the $^{14}$N spin targets. The\nmeasured frequencies are found to be in excellent agreement with theoretical\nexpectations, and allow us to infer the hyperfine, quadrupole and gyromagnetic\nconstants of the target spins. Analysis of the strength of the resonances\nobtained in the $T_1$-MR spectrum reveals that the electron spin transitions\nare probed via dipole interactions, while the nuclear spin resonances are\ndramatically enhanced by hyperfine coupling and an electron-mediated process.\nFinally, we investigate theoretically the possibility of performing $T_1$-MR\nspectroscopy on nuclear spins without hyperfine interaction and predict\nsingle-proton sensitivity using current technology.

Moreover, similar amounts of\ndifferent enzymes might incur different costs for the cell, depending on\nenzyme-specific properties such as protein size and half-life. Here, we\ndeveloped enzyme cost minimization (ECM), a scalable method for computing\nenzyme amounts that support a given metabolic flux at a minimal protein cost.\nThe complex interplay of enzyme and metabolite concentrations, e.g. through\nthermodynamic driving forces and enzyme saturation, would make it hard to solve\nthis optimization problem directly.

We produced two\ntypes of back-side illuminated (BI) XRPIXs, one of which is produced in \"Pizza\nprocess\" which LBNL developed and the other is processed in the ion\nimplantation and laser annealing. We irradiated both of the BI-XRPIXs with soft\nX-ray and investigate soft X-ray performance of them. We report results from\nsoft X-ray evaluation test of the device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 09:11:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-04"}

Near $x\\approx0.17$, the nematic\nsusceptibility diverges towards absolute zero, revealing a nematic quantum\ncritical point. This highlights FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ as a unique nonmagnetic\nsystem suitable for studying the impact of nematicity on superconductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 09:55:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2016 08:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-21"}

The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of\nthe broad [CII] component shows a trend with the OH119 blue-shifted velocity,\nalthough with significant scatter.

We fitted the\nnuclear spectral energy distribution of the torus using ALMA and near and\nmid-infrared (NIR/MIR) data with CLUMPY models. The mass and radius of the\nbest-fit solution for the torus are both consistent with the values derived\nfrom the ALMA data alone: Mgas_torus=(1+-0.3)x10^5 Msun and Rtorus=3.5+-0.5 pc.\nThe dynamics of the molecular gas in the torus show non-circular motions and\nenhanced turbulence superposed on the rotating pattern of the disk. The\nkinematic major axis of the CO torus is tilted relative to its morphological\nmajor axis.

However, timing jitter can\nalso result in an indefinite increase in the settling time of clock recovery\ncircuits, particularly in low swing mesochronous systems. Mesochronous clock\nretiming circuits are required in repeaterless low swing on-chip interconnects.\nWe first discuss how timing jitter can result in a large increase in the\nsettling time of the clock recovery circuit. Next, the circuit is modelled as a\nMarkov chain with absorbing states. The mean time to absorption of the Markov\nchain, which represents the mean settling time of the circuit, is determined.\nThe model is validated through behavioural simulations of the circuit, the\nresults of which match well with the model predictions.

We show that a mismatch between the strengths of up and down\ncorrections of the retiming can reduce the settling time. In particular, a 10%\nmismatch can reduce the mean settling time by up to 40%. We leverage this fact\ntoward improving the settling time performance, and propose useful techniques\nbased on biased training sequences and mismatched charge pumps.

This allows to estimate the white dwarf masses as\nthe white dwarf mass-radius relation M-R and the expected free-fall velocities\nat the surface are well known. This method is widely used, however, derived\nwhite dwarf masses M can be systematically underestimated because the accretion\nflow is stopped at and re-accelerates from the magnetospheric boundary R_m, and\ntherefore, its velocity at the surface will be lower than free-fall.To avoid\nthis problem we computed a two-parameter set of model hard X-ray spectra, which\nallows to constrain a degenerate M - R_m dependence. On the other hand,\nprevious works showed that power spectra of accreting X-ray pulsars and\nintermediate polars exhibit breaks at the frequencies corresponding to the\nKeplerian frequencies at the magnetospheric boundary. Therefore, the break\nfrequency \\nu_b in an intermediate polar power spectrum gives another relation\nin the M - R_m plane. The intersection of the two dependences allows,\ntherefore, to determine simultaneously the white dwarf mass and the\nmagnetospheric radius. To verify the method we analyzed the archival Suzaku\nobservation of EX Hya obtaining M /M_sun= 0.73 \\pm 0.06 and R_ m / R = 2.6 \\pm\n0.4 consistent with the values determined by other authors.

We compare the IB\nand DIB on synthetic data, showing that the IB and DIB perform similarly in\nterms of the IB cost function, but that the DIB significantly outperforms the\nIB in terms of the DIB cost function. We also empirically find that the DIB\noffers a considerable gain in computational efficiency over the IB, over a\nrange of convergence parameters.

This normal\nform consists of four parts, one part based on the Jordan canonical form, one\npart made of nilpotent matrices, and two other dual parts, which we call the\nobservation and control part. The goal of this paper is to show that large\nportions of that decomposition are still valid for pairs of morphisms of\nmodules or abelian groups, and more generally in any abelian category. % This\ngives a new perspective even in the vector space case, as we have to use\nradically new proof techniques to work on abelian categories. In the vector\nspace case, we recover the full Kronecker decomposition theorem. The main\ntechnique is that of reduction, which extends readily to the abelian category\ncase. Reductions naturally arise in two flavours, which are dual to each other.\nThere are a number of properties of those reductions which extend remarkably\nfrom the vector space case to abelian categories. First, both types of\nreduction commute. Second, at each step of the reduction, one can compute three\nsequences of invariant spaces (objects in the category), which generalize the\nKronecker decomposition into nilpotent, observation and control blocks. These\nsequences indicate whether the system is reduced in one direction or the other.\nIn the category of modules, there is also a relation between these sequences\nand the resolvent set of the pair of morphisms, which generalizes the regular\npencil theorem. We also indicate how this allows to define invariant subspaces\nin the vector space case, and study the notion of strangeness as an example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 14:56:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 11:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-15"}

New difficulties are\nencountered due to the higher polynomial growth, but for regular potentials, we\nretain the continuous dependence on initial and boundary data for the chemical\npotential and for the order parameter in strong norms as established in the\nprevious work. Furthermore, we deduce the well-posedness of a variant of the\nmodel with quasi-static nutrient by rigorously passing to the limit where the\nratio of the nutrient diffusion time-scale to the tumor doubling time-scale is\nsmall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 15:34:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 14:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-04"}

The\nFFBRST transformation thus establishes that divergence in graviton two-point\nfunction may be only a gauge artifact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 11:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

Through rigorous analysis, we prove that the optimal BESS\ncontrol is a \"state-invariant\" strategy in the sense that the optimal SoC range\ndoes not vary with the state of the system. As such, the optimal control\nstrategy can be computed offline once and for all with very low complexity.\nRegarding the BESS planning, we prove that the the minimum operating cost is a\ndecreasing convex function of the BESS energy capacity.

The remote synchronization, defined as\nthe synchronization of nodes not directly connected by any sequence of\nsynchronized nodes, was found firstly in networks of amplitude oscillators and\nrecently in bipartite delayed networks of phase oscillators. The quorum\nsensing, a biological information scheme discovered in cell aggregates, has\nbeen investigated in amplitude oscillators coupled by a common medium.\nImplications of such findings are important in technology and biology. We show\nboth of them in non-bipartite, biologically plausible networks of Kuramoto\noscillators. The quorum sensing emerges using the graph edge density, while the\nremote synchronization is obtained by means of an oscillator acting as a\npacemaker. In the remote synchronization two distinct groups of well inter and\ninfra-synchronized nodes, separated by non-synchronized paths, appear clearly.\nOur biological interpretation is that the remote synchronization, bypassing the\nnormal quorum sensing mechanism, is responsible of the pathological cell\nproliferation. This approach seems suitable to study the quorum sensing\nalterations due to genetic mutation or to the environmental action before the\nactual mass replication begins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 12:17:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-05"}

Whereas the algebra for\nthe anomalous Zeeman effect is impeccable and therefore in excellent agreement\nwith experiment, the physical interpretation of that algebra uses images that\nare based on macroscopic intuition but do not correspond to the meaning of this\nalgebra. The interpretation violates the Lorentz symmetry. We give an\nalternative intuitive description of the meaning of this effect, which respects\nthe symmetry and is exact. It can be summarized by stating that a magnetic\nfield makes any charged particle spin. We show also that the traditional\ndiscussion about magnetic monopoles confuses two issues, viz. the symmetry of\nthe Maxwell equations and the quantization of charge. These two issues define\neach a different concept of magnetic monopole. They cannot be merged together\ninto a unique all-encompassing issue. We also generalize the minimal\nsubstitution for a charged particle, and provide some intuition for the\nmagnetic vector potential. We finally explore the algebra of the spin-orbit\ncoupling, which turns out to be badly wrong. The traditional theory that is\nclaimed to reproduce the Thomas half is based on a number of errors. An\nerror-free application of the Dirac theory cannot account for the Thomas\nprecession, because it only accounts for the instantaneous local boosts, not\nfor the rotational component of the Lorentz transformation. This runs contrary\nto established beliefs, but Thomas precession can be understood in terms of the\nBerry phase on a path through the velocity space of the Lorentz group manifold.\nThese results clearly reveal the limitations of the prevailing working\nphilosophy to \"shut up and calculate\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 03:30:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}
