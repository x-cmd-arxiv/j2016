The X-ray spectrum, the optical to UV\nspectrum, and the rapid UV variability of SU Lyn are all consistent with our\ninterpretation that it is a symbiotic star containing an accreting white dwarf.\nThe symbiotic nature of SU Lyn went unnoticed until now, because it does not\nexhibit emission lines strong enough to be obvious in low resolution spectra.\nWe argue that symbiotic stars without shell-burning have weak emission lines,\nand that the current lists of symbiotic stars are biased in favor of\nshell-burning systems.

Power extraction is modeled by\nadding a parameterized Rayleigh friction term in the barotropic vorticity\nequation. Numerical assessments are performed by simulating a set of\nmid-latitude ocean basins in the beta plane, which are standard prototypes of\nmore realistic ocean dynamics considering inter-decadal variability in\nturbulent equilibrium. A sensitivity analysis with respect to the turbine\nparameters is performed for various physical conditions. Results show that the\nproposed model captures the quasi-stationary ocean dynamics and provides the\nfour-gyre circulation patterns in time mean. After an initial spin-up process,\nthe proposed model reaches a statistically steady state at an average maximum\nspeed between 1.5 m/s and 2.5 m/s, which is close to the observed maximum zonal\nvelocities in the western boundary currents. The probability density function\nof the available power over a long time period is computed for a wide range of\nparameters. Numerical results shows that 10 GW mean power can be extracted from\nthe turbines distributed over a length scale of 100 km along the western\nboundaries. However, it is demonstrated that bigger turbine areas would alter\nthe flow patterns and energetics due to excessive dissipation. An increase in\nthe turbine area results in an increase in the available power ranging from 8\nto 22 GW depending on the values of turbine modeling parameters. This first\nstep in the numerical assessment of the proposed QG model shows that the\npresent framework could represent a viable tool for evaluating energy\npotentials in a highly turbulent flow regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 16:04:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-29"}

Despite significant research efforts, this question\nhas resisted numerous attempts at resolution even for basic graph families such\nas forests.\n  In this paper, we resolve the question in the affirmative, by presenting a\nrandomized algorithm for maintaining maximal matching in general graphs with\n\\emph{constant} amortized update time. The optimal runtime bound $O(t)$ of our\nalgorithm holds both in expectation and with high probability.\n  As an immediate corollary, we can maintain 2-approximate vertex cover with\nconstant amortized update time.

We apply these decompositions to real\nworld graphs, like the Collaboration network of arXiv graph, and found some\ninteresting results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 16:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-29"}

Consequently, perturbations of network activity\nplay an important role in the pathophysiology of brain disorders. When\nstructural information from non-invasive brain imaging is merged with\nmathematical modeling, then generative brain network models constitute\nin-silico platforms for the exploration of causal mechanisms of brain function\nand clinical hypothesis testing. We here demonstrate along the example of\ndrug-resistant epilepsy that patient-specific virtual brain models derived from\ndiffusion MRI have sufficient predictive power to improve diagnosis and surgery\noutcome. In partial epilepsy, seizures originate in a local network, the\nso-called epileptogenic zone, before recruiting other close or distant brain\nregions. We create personalized large-scale brain networks for 15 patients and\nsimulate the individual seizure propagation patterns. Model validation is\nperformed against the presurgical stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG)\ndata and the standard-of-care clinical evaluation. We demonstrate that the\nindividual brain models account for the temporal variability in patient seizure\npropagation patterns and explain the variability in postsurgical success. Our\nresults show that individual variations in structural connectivity, when linked\nwith mathematical dynamic models, have the capacity to explain changes in\nspatiotemporal organization of brain dynamics as observed in network-based\nbrain disorders, thus opening up avenues towards discovery of novel clinical\ninterventions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 16:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-29"}

This has heretofore not been\npractical because it is difficult to locate where reconnection occurs for\noblique IMF, but new techniques make this possible. The approach is to identify\nmagnetic separators, the curves separating four regions of differing magnetic\ntopology, which map the reconnection X-line. The electric field parallel to the\nX-line is the local reconnection rate. We compare results to a simple model of\nlocal two-dimensional asymmetric reconnection. To do so, we find the plasma\nparameters that locally drive reconnection in the magnetosheath and\nmagnetosphere in planes perpendicular to the X-line at a large number of points\nalong the X-line. The global magnetohydrodynamic simulations are from the\nthree-dimensional Block-Adaptive, Tree Solarwind Roe-type Upwind Scheme\n(BATS-R-US) code with a uniform resistivity, although the techniques described\nhere are extensible to any global magnetospheric simulation model. We find that\nthe predicted local reconnection rates scale well with the measured values for\nall simulations, being nearly exact for due southward IMF. However, the\nabsolute predictions differ by an undetermined constant of proportionality,\nwhose magnitude increases as the IMF clock angle changes from southward to\nnorthward. We also show similar scaling agreement in a simulation with oblique\nsouthward IMF and a dipole tilt.

This result applies also to the\nIDS in any finite volume subject to the random potential induced by an ambient,\ninfinitely extended disordered media. Dimension one is critical: in the\nBernoulli case, within the class of exponential interactions, the IDS measure\nundergoes continuity phase transitions, from absolutely continuous to singular\ncontinuous behaviour (the singularity in the latter case was known before). The\ncontinuity transitions do not occur for sub-exponential or slower decaying\ninteractions, nor for $d\\ge 2$.

In the models with\nnon-local interaction the IDS is actually much more regular than the underlying\ndisorder, which can even be discrete, due to the smoothing effect of multiple\nconvolutions. In turn, smoothness of the IDS is responsable for a mechanism\ncomplementing the usual Lifshitz tails phenomenon.\n  It is also shown that the disorder can take various forms (e.g., substitution\nor random displacements) and need not be stochastically stationary (as in\nDelone--Anderson or trim\\-med/crooked Hamiltonians, for example); this does not\naffect the main phenomena observed already in the simplest setting.\n  Long-range models have an amazingly large number of connections to several\nclassical problems of harmonic analysis, probability theory, dynamical systems\nand number theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 17:55:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 12:29:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

Furthermore, an extreme densification\nphase for cellular networks is foreseen to fulfill the ambitious fifth\ngeneration (5G) performance requirements. Network densification improves\nspectrum utilization and network capacity by shrinking base stations' (BSs)\nfootprints and reusing the same spectrum more frequently over the spatial\ndomain. However, network densification also increases the handover (HO) rate,\nwhich may diminish the capacity gains for mobile users due to HO delays. In\nhighly dense 5G cellular networks, HO delays may neutralize or even negate the\ngains offered by network densification. In this paper, we present an analytical\nparadigm, based on stochastic geometry, to quantify the effect of HO delay on\nthe average user rate in cellular networks. To this end, we propose a flexible\nhandover scheme to reduce HO delay in case of highly dense cellular networks.\nThis scheme allows skipping the HO procedure with some BSs along users'\ntrajectories.

The spread is usually\ncreated by octupole magnets, which introduce the tune dependence on the\namplitude and, in some cases, by a chromatic spread (tune dependence on\nparticle's momentum). The introduction of octupoles usually has both the\nbeneficial (improved Landau damping) and harmful properties, such as a resonant\nbehavior and a reduction of the dynamic aperture. One of the research goals at\nthe IOTA ring is to achieve a large betatron tune spread, while retaining a\nlarge dynamic aperture, using conventional octupole magnets in a special but\nrealistic accelerator configuration.

This\nfriction acts both on the equilibrium/non-wave like tide and on tidal inertial\nwaves in these layers. It is thus necessary to obtain a robust prescription for\nthis friction. In the current state-of-the-art, it is modeled by a turbulent\neddy-viscosity coefficient, based on mixing-length theory, applied on\nvelocities of tides. However, none of the current prescriptions take into\naccount the action of rotation that can strongly affects turbulent convection.\nTherefore, we use theoretical scaling laws for convective velocities and\ncharacteristic lengthscales in rotating stars and planets that have been\nrecently confirmed by 3-D high-resolution nonlinear Cartesian numerical\nsimulations to derive a new prescription. A corresponding local model of tidal\nwaves is used to understand the consequences for the linear tidal dissipation.\nFinally, new grids of rotating stellar models and published values of planetary\nconvective Rossby numbers are used to discuss astrophysical consequences. The\naction of rotation on convection deeply modifies the turbulent friction applied\non tides. In the regime of rapid rotation (with a convective Rossby number\nbelow 0.25), the eddy-viscosity may be decreased by several ordres of\nmagnitude. It may lead to a loss of efficiency of the viscous dissipation of\nthe equilibrium tide and to a more efficient complex and resonant dissipation\nof tidal inertial waves in the bulk of convective regions. Therefore, it is\nnecessary to have a completely coupled treatment of the tidal/rotational\nevolution of star-planet systems and multiple stars with a coherent treatment\nof the variations of tidal flows and of their dissipation as a function of\nrotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 19:39:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

The goal of the present paper is to define and\ninvestigate stored energies that are valid for structures that can support both\nelectric and magnetic current densities.

Lower\nbounds of the Q factor provide information about the available bandwidth for\npassive antennas that can be realized in the structure. The definition that we\npropose is valid beyond the leading order small antenna limit. Our starting\npoint is the energy density with subtracted far-field form which we obtain an\nexplicit and numerically attractive current density representation.

To understand the origin of this deficit, and\nto investigate possible evolution with redshift and galaxy properties, we\nmeasure the SFR efficiency of atomic gas at z~1, z~2, and z~3 around\nstar-forming galaxies. We use new robust photometric redshifts in the Hubble\nUltra Deep Field to create galaxy stacks in these three redshift bins, and\nmeasure the SFR efficiency by combining DLA absorber statistics with the\nobserved rest-frame UV emission in the galaxies' outskirts. We find that the\nSFR efficiency of HI gas at z>1 is ~1-3% of that predicted by the KS relation.\nContrary to simulations and models that predict a reduced SFR efficiency with\ndecreasing metallicity and thus with increasing redshift, we find no\nsignificant evolution in the SFR efficiency with redshift. Our analysis instead\nsuggests that the reduced SFR efficiency is driven by the low molecular content\nof this atomic-dominated phase, with metallicity playing a secondary effect in\nregulating the conversion between atomic and molecular gas. This interpretation\nis supported by the similarity between the observed SFR efficiency and that\nobserved in local atomic-dominated gas, such as in the outskirts of local\nspiral galaxies and local dwarf galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 20:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}

For instance, this work shows that a\nwidely spread dislocation core on the {110} plane as compared to dislocations\non the {100} and {101} planes.

We apply principal component abundance analysis (PCAA) to the\nsimulations and existing data to reveal the main correlations amongst\nabundances and quantify their contributions to variation in abundance space.\nFor the stellar population mixing scenario, the abundances of alpha-elements\nand elements with metallicity-dependent yields dominate the first and second\nprincipal components, respectively, and collectively explain 99% of the\nvariance in the model. flexCE is a python package available at\nhttps://github.com/bretthandrews/flexCE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 20:44:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 03:33:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 22:26:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

In this study, we investigate the\nimpact of membrane tension on the mechanics of membrane budding by simulating\nclathrin coats that either grow in area or progressively induce greater\ncurvature. At low membrane tension, progressively increasing the area of a\ncurvature-generating coat causes the membrane to smoothly evolve from a flat to\nbudded morphology, whereas the membrane remains essentially flat at high\nmembrane tensions. Interestingly, at physiologically relevant, intermediate\nmembrane tensions, the shape evolution of the membrane undergoes a snapthrough\ninstability in which increasing coat area causes the membrane to \"snap\" from an\nopen, U-shaped bud to a closed, $\\Omega$-shaped bud. This instability is\naccompanied by a large energy barrier, which could cause a developing endocytic\npit to stall if the binding energy of additional coat is insufficient to\novercome this barrier. Similar results were found for a coat of constant area\nin which the spontaneous curvature progressively increases.

While deriving these step-size vectors, precautions and\nadjustments are considered so that the set of new possible solution points\nstill remain within the simplex constrained space. Thus, no extra time is spent\nin evaluating the (possibly expensive) objective function at infeasible points\n(points outside the unit-simplex space). While minimizing any objective\nfunction of m parameters, within each iteration, the objective function is\nevaluated at 2m new possible solution points. So, upto 2m parallel threads can\nbe incorporated which makes the computation even faster while optimizing\nexpensive objective functions over high-dimensional parameter space. Once a\nlocal minimum is discovered, in order to find a better solution, a novel\n`re-start' strategy is considered to increase the likelihood of finding a\nbetter solution. Unlike existing pattern search based methods, a sparsity\ncontrol parameter is introduced which can be used to induce sparsity in the\nsolution in case the solution is expected to be sparse in prior. A comparative\nstudy of the performances of the proposed algorithm and other existing\nalgorithms are shown for a few low, moderate and high-dimensional optimization\nproblems. Upto 338 folds improvement in computation time is achieved using the\nproposed algorithm over Genetic algorithm along with better solution.

Developing\nnumerically efficient and accurate simulation methods is an indispensable part\nof this. Already in equilibrium, fermions are notoriously hard to handle due to\nthe sign problem. Out of equilibrium, an important outstanding problem is the\nefficient numerical simulation of the dynamics of these systems. In this work\nwe develop a new semiclassical phase-space approach (a.k.a. the truncated\nWigner approximation) for simulating the dynamics of interacting fermions in\narbitrary dimensions. As fermions are essentially non-classical objects, a\nphase-space is constructed out of all fermionic bilinears. Classical\nphase-space is thus comprised of highly non-local (hidden) variables\nrepresenting these bilinears, and the cost of the method is that it scales\nquadratic rather than linear with system size.

Previous work tackles this problem by either\nsolving an optimization task given 2D keypoint positions, or training on\nsynthetic data with ground truth 3D information. In this work, we propose 3D\nINterpreter Network (3D-INN), an end-to-end framework which sequentially\nestimates 2D keypoint heatmaps and 3D object structure, trained on both real\n2D-annotated images and synthetic 3D data. This is made possible mainly by two\ntechnical innovations. First, we propose a Projection Layer, which projects\nestimated 3D structure to 2D space, so that 3D-INN can be trained to predict 3D\nstructural parameters supervised by 2D annotations on real images. Second,\nheatmaps of keypoints serve as an intermediate representation connecting real\nand synthetic data, enabling 3D-INN to benefit from the variation and abundance\nof synthetic 3D objects, without suffering from the difference between the\nstatistics of real and synthesized images due to imperfect rendering. The\nnetwork achieves state-of-the-art performance on both 2D keypoint estimation\nand 3D structure recovery.

This\narticle addresses the question of how long it takes to reduce the population\nfrom one level to a lower one under a schedule of sudden decrements, each of\nwhich removes a given fraction of the cell mass or population. A deterministic\nperiodic schedule is first examined and yields exact results for the\neradication or extinction time which is defined as that required to reduce the\nnumber of cells to less than unity.

In this paper\nwe evaluate the efficiency of two versions of the A star algorithm for mobile\nrobot navigation inside indoor environments with the help of two software\napplications and the Pioneer 2DX robot. We demonstrate that an improved version\nof the A star algorithm (we call this the fast A star algorithm) which (a\ndifferent version of this algorithm is widely used in video games) can be\nsuccessfully used for indoor mobile robot navigation.

In this paper, we show that the conditional \"knowing\nvalue\" logic proposed by Wang and Fan \\cite{WF13} can be viewed as a disguised\nnormal modal logic by treating the negation of the Kv operator as a special\ndiamond. Under this perspective, it turns out that the original first-order\nKripke semantics can be greatly simplified by introducing a ternary relation\n$R_i^c$ in standard Kripke models, which associates one world with two\n$i$-accessible worlds that do not agree on the value of constant $c$. Under\nintuitive constraints, the modal logic based on such Kripke models is exactly\nthe one studied by Wang and Fan (2013,2014}. Moreover, there is a very natural\nbinary generalization of the \"knowing value\" diamond, which, surprisingly, does\nnot increase the expressive power of the logic. The resulting logic with the\nbinary diamond has a transparent normal modal system, which sharpens our\nunderstanding of the \"knowing value\" logic and simplifies some previously hard\nproblems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2016 07:22:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Jun 2016 16:48:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 05:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-22"}

Both components become too\nfaint to be used as a tracer in observations of high-redshift galaxies. In\nthose cases, the 158 $\\mu$m line of atomic carbon [CII] may be the only way to\nderive M_dyn. As the distribution and kinematics of the ISM tracer affects the\ndetermination of M_dyn, it is important to quantify the relative distributions\nof HI, CO and [CII]. HI and CO are well-characterised observationally, however,\nfor [CII] only very few measurements exist. Here we compare observations of CO,\nHI, and [CII] emission of a sample of nearby galaxies, drawn from the HERACLES,\nTHINGS and KINGFISH surveys. We find that within R_25, the average [CII]\nexponential radial profile is slightly shallower than that of the CO, but much\nsteeper than the HI distribution. This is also reflected in the integrated\nspectrum (\"global profile\"), where the [CII] spectrum looks more like that of\nthe CO than that of the HI. For one galaxy, a spectrally resolved comparison of\nintegrated spectra was possible; other comparisons were limited by the\nintrinsic line-widths of the galaxies and the coarse velocity resolution of the\n[CII] data. Using high-spectral-resolution SOFIA [CII] data of a number of star\nforming regions in two nearby galaxies, we find that their [CII] linewidths\nagree better with those of the CO than the HI. As the radial extent of a given\nISM tracer is a key input in deriving M_dyn from spatially unresolved data, we\nconclude that the relevant length-scale to use in determining M_dyn based on\n[CII] data, is that of the well-characterised CO distribution. This length\nscale is similar to that of the optical disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2016 11:17:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

The light from artificial\nsources is not only reflected by the scene but it is also scattered by the\nmedium particles, yielding the backscatter component. Backscatter corresponds\nto a complex term with several unknown variables, and makes the problem of\nnormal estimation hard. In this work, we show that instead of trying to\noptimize the complex backscatter model or use previous unrealistic\nsimplifications, we can approximate the per-pixel backscatter signal directly\nfrom the captured images. Our method is based on the observation that\nbackscatter is saturated beyond a certain distance, i.e. it becomes scene-depth\nindependent, and finally corresponds to a smoothly varying signal which depends\nstrongly on the light position with respect to each pixel.

The system must react\nto unplanned events in order to optimize the task allocation between the\nrobots. In a broad sense, the resilience of a system can be defined as the\nability to maintain or recover a stable state when subject to disturbance and\nit is related to the concept of robustness in industrial systems. In this\npaper, we study the resilience in a synchronized multi-robot system stated as\nfollows:Consider a team of $n$ (ground or aerial) robots each moving along\npredetermined periodic closed trajectories. Each of the agents needs to\ncommunicate informationabout its operation to other agents, but the\ncommunication links have a limited range. Hence, when two agents are within\ncommunication range, a communication link is established, and information is\nexchanged. Thus, two neighbors are synchronized if they visit the communication\nlink at the same time and a multi-robot system is called synchronized if each\npair of neighbors is synchronized. If a set of robots left the system, then\nsome trajectories has no robots. In these cases, when an alive robot detects no\nneighboring robot then it pass to this neighboring trajectory to assume the\nunattended task. In this framework, a fault-tolerance measure is introduced:\nthe resilience of the system is the largest number of robots that can fail\nwhile executing the global task. Interesting combinatorial properties of the\nresilience are showed that allow to know its value for some usual scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2016 12:45:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-02"}

A cultural bias restrains the range of congruent implementations of\nrelational models, but does not preclude any relational model altogether. This\nstands in contrast to earlier reconciliation attempts between PRT and RMT.\nBased on hypothetical one-to-one mappings, these attempts expect each cultural\nsetting to be significantly associated with some, but not all, relational\nmodels.

The classification with the\napplied method was possible even using ground-based observations: r'-band\nimaging from OSIRIS/GTC. We defined very conservative probability limits,\ntaking into account the probability errors, in order to obtain a trustworthy\nclassification. In this way we were able to classify about the 30% of all\ncluster members, and to separate between LT and ET galaxies. Additionally, when\nanalysing the colour-magnitude diagram, we observed a significant population of\nblue ET galaxies between the classified ones. We discussed possible\nexplanations for the finding of this population. Moreover, we studied different\nphysical properties of LT, ET, and blue ET galaxies. They turn out to be\ncomparable, with the exception of the stellar mass that shows that the red ET\npopulation is more massive. We also analysed the morphology-density and\nmorphology-radius relations, observing that, only when considering the\nmorphological separation between ET and LT galaxies, a mild classical behaviour\nis obtained. RXJ1257+4738 is a young galaxy cluster, showing a clumpy structure\nand being still in the process of formation, which could explain the lack of\nsome of the standard morphological relations. This makes this cluster a very\nattractive case for obtaining the higher resolution data and for studying in\nmore details the morphological properties of the entire cluster and relation\nwith the environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2016 14:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-10"}

Briefly, a type is a complete\n(closed) program that evaluates to a canonical type whose members are complete\nprograms that evaluate to canonical elements of that type. The explanation is\nextended to incomplete (open) programs by functionality: types and elements\nmust respect equality in their free variables. Equality is evidence-free---two\ntypes or elements are at most equal---and equal things are implicitly\ninterchangeable in all contexts.\n  Higher-dimensional type theory extends type theory to account for\nidentifications of types and elements. An identification witnesses that two\ntypes or elements are explicitly interchangeable in all contexts by an explicit\ntransport, or coercion, operation. There must be sufficiently many\nidentifications, which is ensured by imposing a generalized form of the Kan\ncondition from homotopy theory. Here we provide a Martin-L\\\"of-style meaning\nexplanation of simple higher-dimensional type theory based on a programming\nlanguage that includes Kan-like constructs witnessing the computational meaning\nof the higher structure of types. The treatment includes an example of a higher\ninductive type (namely, the 1-dimensional sphere) and an example of Voevodsky's\nunivalence principle, which identifies equivalent types.\n  The main result is a computational canonicity theorem that validates the\ncomputational interpretation: a closed boolean expression must always evaluate\nto a boolean value, even in the presence of higher-dimensional structure. This\nprovides the first fully computational formulation of higher-dimensional type\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2016 15:26:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jun 2016 17:48:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

In this regime, the electrons are paired, but they lack the phase\ncoherence necessary for superconductivity. The existence of preformed pairs\nimplies the existence of a characteristic energy scale associated to a\npseudogap. Preformed pairs are often invoked to interpret systems where some\nsignatures of pairing are present without actual superconductivity, but an\nunambiguous theoretical characterization of a preformed-pair system is still\nlacking. To fill this gap, we consider the response to an external pairing\nfield of an attractive Hubbard model, which hosts one of the cleanest\nrealizations of a preformed pair phase, and a repulsive model where s-wave\nsuperconductivity can not be realized. Using dynamical mean-field theory to\nstudy this response, we identify the characteristic features which distinguish\nthe reaction of a preformed pair state from a normal metal without any\nprecursor of pairing. The theoretical detection of preformed pairs is\nassociated with the behavior of the second derivative of the order parameter\nwith respect to the external field, as confirmed by analytic calculations in\nlimiting cases.

While Honolulu has supportive density and topography for rail\ntransit, questions remain about its ability to effectively integrate urban\ndesign and accessibility across the system. Every transit trip begins and ends\nwith a walking trip from origins and to destinations: transportation planning\nmust account for pedestrian safety, comfort, and access. Ildefons Cerda's 19th\ncentury utopian plan for Barcelona's Eixample district produced a renowned,\nlivable urban form. The Eixample, with its well-integrated rail transit, serves\nas a model of urban design, land use, transportation planning, and\npedestrian-scaled streets working in synergy to produce accessibility. This\nstudy discusses the urban form of Honolulu and the history and planning of its\nnew rail transit system. Then it reviews the history of Cerda's plan for the\nEixample and discusses its urban form and performance today. Finally it draws\nseveral lessons from Barcelona's urban design, accessibility, and rail transit\nplanning and critically discusses their applicability to policy and design in\nHonolulu. This discussion is situated within wider debates around livable\ncities and social justice as it contributes several form and design lessons to\nthe livability and accessibility literature while identifying potential\nconcerns with privatization and displacement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2016 06:00:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2016 23:11:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-10"}

PBNs are suited for\nmodelling large biological systems, which more and more often arise in systems\nbiology. However, the large system size poses a~significant challenge to the\nanalysis of PBNs, in particular, to the crucial analysis of their steady-state\nbehaviour. Numerical methods for performing steady-state analyses suffer from\nthe state-space explosion problem, which makes the utilisation of statistical\nmethods the only viable approach. However, such methods require long\nsimulations of PBNs, rendering the simulation speed a crucial efficiency\nfactor. For large PBNs and high estimation precision requirements, a slow\nsimulation speed becomes an obstacle. In this paper, we propose a\nstructure-based method for fast simulation of PBNs. This method first performs\na network reduction operation and then divides nodes into groups for parallel\nsimulation. Experimental results show that our method can lead to an\napproximately 10 times speedup for computing steady-state probabilities of a\nreal-life biological network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 16:29:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}
