On the assumption that M-FFC\nreceives single-scale Gabor filters of varying orientations as input, these\nfilters are self-cross convolved by M-fold to instantiate a filter offspring\nset. The M-FFC flexibility also permits cross convolution amongst Gabor filters\nand other filter banks of profoundly dissimilar traits, e.g., principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) filters, and independent component analysis (ICA)\nfilters. The 2-FFC of Gabor, PCA and ICA filters thus yields three offspring\nsets: (1) Gabor filters solely, (2) Gabor-PCA filters, and (3) Gabor-ICA\nfilters, to render the learning-free and the learning-based 2-FFC descriptors.\nTo facilitate a sensible Gabor filter selection for M-FFC, the 40 multi-scale,\nmulti-orientation Gabor filters are condensed into 8 elementary filters.

Each miner chooses one of these points as the\nbase point for their claim. Each miner obtains mining rights for the area of\nthe square that is closest to their chosen base, that is, they obtain the\nVoronoi cell corresponding to their chosen point in the Voronoi diagram of the\n$n$ chosen points. Each player's goal is simply to maximize the amount of land\nunder their control. What can we say about the players' strategy and the\nequilibria of such games?\n  In our main result, we derive bounds on the expected number of pure Nash\nequilibria for a variation of the 1-dimensional game on the circle where a\nplayer owns the arc starting from their point and moving clockwise to the next\npoint. This result uses interesting properties of random arc lengths on\ncircles, and demonstrates the challenges in analyzing these kinds of problems.\nWe also provide several other related results. In particular, for the\n1-dimensional game on the circle, we show that a pure Nash equilibrium always\nexists when each player owns the part of the circle nearest to their point, but\nit is NP-hard to determine whether a pure Nash equilibrium exists in the\nvariant when each player owns the arc starting from their point clockwise to\nthe next point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Apr 2016 21:18:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-26"}

We show here that with a different approach\nthe running time becomes linear, answering a question posed by Biedl et al.\n(SoCG 2011).

At the\nfoundation of every urban system, transportation system is undeniably a crucial\ncomponent in powering the life of the entire urban system. In this work, we\nstudy the spatial pattern of $73$ cities across the globe by analysing the\ndistribution of public transport points within the cities. The analysis reveals\nthat different spatial distributions of points could be classified into four\ngroups with distinct features, indicating whether the points are clustered,\ndispersed or regularly distributed. From visual inspection, we observe that the\ncities with regularly distributed patterns do not have apparent centre in\ncontrast to the other two types in which star-node structure, i.e. monocentric,\ncan be clearly observed. Furthermore, the results provide evidence for the\nexistence of two different types of urban system: well-planned and organically\ngrown. We also study the spatial distribution of another important urban\nentity, the amenities, and find that it possesses universal properties\nregardless of the city's spatial pattern type. This result has one important\nimplication that at small scale of locality, the urban dynamics cannot be\ncontrolled even though the regulation can be done at large scale of the entire\nurban system.

We observe that the known provable complexity of C-CD\ncan be $O(n^2)$ times slower than randomized coordinate descent (R-CD), but no\nexample was rigorously proven to exhibit such a large gap. In this paper we\nshow that the gap indeed exists. We prove that there exists an example for\nwhich C-CD takes at least $O(n^4 \\kappa_{\\text{CD}} \\log\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$\noperations, where $\\kappa_{\\text{CD}}$ is related to Demmel's condition number\nand it determines the convergence rate of R-CD.

Our model invokes a tight binary system consisting of a massive star\nand a black hole which leads to the triggering of a collapse of the star's\nnucleus, the formation of a second black hole, and finally to the binary black\nhole merger. For the most-likely configuration of the binary spin vectors with\nrespect to the orbital angular momentum in the GW150914 event, the recoil speed\n(kick velocity) acquired by the final black hole through gravitational wave\nemission is of the order of a few hundred km/s and this might be sufficient to\nget it closer to the envelope of surrounding material and capture a small\nfraction of matter from the remnant of the host star. The gamma-ray burst is\nproduced by the accretion of this remnant matter onto the final black hole. The\nmoderate spin of the final black hole suggests that the gamma-ray burst jet is\npowered by weak neutrino emission rather than the Blandford-Znajek mechanism,\nand hence explains the low power available for the observed GRB signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2016 05:20:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 14:00:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Aug 2016 11:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

A rapid stellar\nevolutionary code and a recently published database of rotational effects of\nsingle stars have been used, via an advanced stellar population synthesis\ntechnique. As a result, we find a consistent result for rotation to recent\nworks, which suggests that rotation is able to explain, at least partially, the\neMSTOs of clusters, if clusters are not too old ($<$ 2.0\\,Gyr). In addition, an\nage spread of 200 to 500\\,Myr reproduces extended turn-offs for all clusters\nyounger than 2.5\\,Gyr, in particular, for those younger than 2.2\\,Gyr.

In this setting, each\nnode in the graph represents a person. One after another, each person has to\ntake a decision based on a private signal as well as the decisions made by\nearlier neighboring nodes. Such information cascades commonly occur in practice\nand have been studied in complete graphs where everyone can overhear the\ndecisions of every other player. It is known that information cascades can be\nfragile and based on very little information, and that they have a high\nlikelihood of being wrong.\n  Generalizing the problem to arbitrary graphs reveals interesting insights. In\nparticular, we show that in a random graph $G(n,q)$, for the right value of\n$q$, the number of nodes making a wrong decision is logarithmic in $n$. That\nis, in the limit for large $n$, the fraction of players that make a wrong\ndecision tends to zero. This is intriguing because it contrasts to the two\nnatural corner cases: empty graph (everyone decides independently based on his\nprivate signal) and complete graph (all decisions are heard by all nodes). In\nboth of these cases a constant fraction of nodes make a wrong decision in\nexpectation. Thus, our result shows that while both too little and too much\ninformation sharing causes nodes to take wrong decisions, for exactly the right\namount of information sharing, asymptotically everyone can be right.

The main goal of this paper is proposing a robust\napproach for solving the above mentioned problems. Accordingly, this paper\ndevelops a novel framework for clustering problems, which is called Weighted\nSpectral Cluster Ensemble (WSCE), by exploiting some concepts from community\ndetection arena and graph based clustering. Under this framework, a new version\nof spectral clustering, which is called Two Kernels Spectral Clustering, is\nused for generating graphs based individual clustering results. Further, by\nusing modularity, which is a famous metric in the community detection, on the\ntransformed graph representation of individual clustering results, our approach\nprovides an effective diversity estimation for individual clustering results.\nMoreover, this paper introduces a new approach for combining the evaluated\nindividual clustering results without the procedure of thresholding.\nExperimental study on varied data sets demonstrates that the prosed approach\nachieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2016 09:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-26"}

The cpsd-rank of a cpsd matrix is the\nsmallest $d\\ge 1$ for which such a representation is possible. In this work we\ninitiate the study of the cpsd-rank which we motivate twofold. First, the\ncpsd-rank is a natural non-commutative analogue of the completely positive rank\nof a completely positive matrix. Second, we show that the cpsd-rank is\nphysically motivated as it can be used to upper and lower bound the size of a\nquantum system needed to generate a quantum behavior.\n  In this work we present several properties of the cpsd-rank. Unlike the\ncompletely positive rank which is at most quadratic in the size of the matrix,\nno general upper bound is known on the cpsd-rank of a cpsd matrix. In fact, we\nshow that the cpsd-rank can be exponential in terms of the size. Specifically,\nfor any $n\\ge1,$ we construct a cpsd matrix of size $2n$ whose cpsd-rank is\n$2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})}$. Our construction is based on Gram matrices of Lorentz\ncone vectors, which we show are cpsd. The proof relies crucially on the\nconnection between the cpsd-rank and quantum behaviors. In particular, we use a\nknown lower bound on the size of matrix representations of extremal quantum\ncorrelations which we apply to high-rank extreme points of the $n$-dimensional\nelliptope.\n  Lastly, we study cpsd-graphs, i.e., graphs $G$ with the property that every\ndoubly nonnegative matrix whose support is given by $G$ is cpsd. We show that a\ngraph is cpsd if and only if it has no odd cycle of length at least $5$ as a\nsubgraph. This coincides with the characterization of cp-graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2016 10:57:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-12"}

We investigate this dynamic process using an\nextension of homogenization theory that accounts for a macroscale variation in\nmicrostructure. We formulate and homogenize the coupled problems of flow\nthrough a filter with a near-periodic time-dependent microstructure, solute\ntransport due to advection, diffusion, and filter adsorption, and filter\nstructure evolution due to the adsorption of contaminant.

Additionally, we determine which initial\nporosity distributions result in a filter that will block everywhere at once by\nexploiting an asymptotic reduction of the homogenized equations.

In this paper, we first unify and extend these sampling approaches\nby viewing the evaluation problem as a Monte Carlo estimation task that applies\nto a large number of common IR metrics. Drawing on the theoretical clarity that\nthis view offers, we tackle three practical evaluation scenarios: comparing two\nsystems, comparing $k$ systems against a baseline, and ranking $k$ systems. For\neach scenario, we derive an estimator and a variance-optimizing sampling\ndistribution while retaining the strengths of sampling-based evaluation,\nincluding unbiasedness, reusability despite missing data, and ease of use in\npractice. In addition to the theoretical contribution, we empirically evaluate\nour methods against previously used sampling heuristics and find that they\ngenerally cut the number of required relevance judgments at least in half.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2016 11:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-26"}

To untangle the latent structure of such signals, one can view them as\noutputs of linear graph filters modeling underlying network dynamics. This\npaper deals with the problem of joint identification of a graph filter and its\ninput signal, thus broadening the scope of classical blind deconvolution of\ntemporal and spatial signals to the less-structured graph domain. Given a graph\nsignal $\\mathbf{y}$ modeled as the output of a graph filter, the goal is to\nrecover the vector of filter coefficients $\\mathbf{h}$, and the input signal\n$\\mathbf{x}$ which is assumed to be sparse. While $\\mathbf{y}$ is a bilinear\nfunction of $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{h}$, the filtered graph signal is also a\nlinear combination of the entries of the lifted rank-one, row-sparse matrix\n$\\mathbf{x} \\mathbf{h}^T$. The blind graph-filter identification problem can\nthus be tackled via rank and sparsity minimization subject to linear\nconstraints, an inverse problem amenable to convex relaxations offering\nprovable recovery guarantees under simplifying assumptions. Numerical tests\nusing both synthetic and real-world networks illustrate the merits of the\nproposed algorithms, as well as the benefits of leveraging multiple signals to\naid the blind identification task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2016 12:40:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

With classification experiments on all 217 countries in our datasets,\nas well as on the top 25 countries, we offer some insights into the best use of\ntweet-inherent features for an accurate country-level classification of tweets.\nWe find that the use of a single feature, such as the use of tweet content\nalone -- the most widely used feature in previous work -- leaves much to be\ndesired.

Such a morphology is also found for flare ribbons observed in\nthe EUV band, as well as in non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) magnetic field\nextrapolations and models. We study the evolution of the photospheric traces of\nthe current density and flare ribbons, both obtained with the SDO instruments.\nWe investigate the photospheric current evolution during the 6 September 2011\nX-class flare (SOL2011-09-06T22:20) from observational data of the magnetic\nfield obtained with HMI. This evolution is compared with that of the flare\nribbons observed in the EUV filters of the AIA. We also compare the observed\nelectric current density and the flare ribbon morphology with that of the QSLs\ncomputed from the flux rope insertion method/NLFFF model.\n  The NLFFF model shows the presence of a fan-spine configuration of overlying\nfield lines, due to the presence of a parasitic polarity, embedding an\nelongated flux rope that appears in the observations as two parts of a\nfilament. The QSLs, evolved via a magnetofrictional method, also show similar\nmorphology and evolution as both the current ribbons and the EUV flare ribbons\nobtained at several times during the flare. For the first time, we propose a\ncombined analysis of the photospheric traces of an eruptive flare, in a complex\ntopology, with direct measurements of electric currents and QSLs from\nobservational data and a magnetic field model. The results, obtained by two\ndifferent and independent approaches, 1) confirm previous results of current\nincrease during the impulsive phase of the flare, 2) show how NLFFF models can\ncapture the essential physical signatures of flares even in a complex magnetic\nfield topology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2016 13:15:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-04"}

The main difference concerns the\nmagnitude of the mode amplification: whereas transcritical flows display a\nlarge amplification (which is generally in good agreement with the Hawking\nprediction), this effect is heavily suppressed in subcritical flows. This is\ndue to the transmission across the obstacle for frequencies less than some\ncritical value. As a result, subcritical flows display high- and low-frequency\nbehaviors separated by a narrow band around the critical frequency. In the\nlow-frequency regime, transmission of long wavelengths is accompanied by\nnon-adiabatic scattering into short wavelengths, whose spectrum is\napproximately linear in frequency.

As a result 38 objects (~ a 55% increase in the known star\nclusters located in the surveyed field) of 0.15 - 0.40 arcmin (2.6 - 7.0 pc) in\nradius resulted to have near-infrared CMD features which resemble those of star\nclusters of young to moderate intermediate age (log(t /yr ) ~ 7.5-9.0). Most of\nthe new star cluster candidates are hardly recognizable in optical images\nwithout the help of a sound star field decontaminated CMD analysis. For highly\nreddened star cluster candidates (E(B - V ) >= 0.6 mag) the VMC data sets were\nnecessary in order to recognize them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Apr 2016 14:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

We intend to constrain some of the unknown parameters of\nHD 93129A through modelling the non-thermal emitter, and also to analyse the\ndetectability of this source in hard X-rays and $\\gamma$-rays. We develop a\nbroadband radiative model for the wind-collision region taking into account the\nevolution of the accelerated particles streaming along the shocked region, the\nemission by different radiative processes, and the attenuation of the emission\npropagating through the local matter and radiation fields. From the analysis of\nthe radio emission, we find that the binary HD~93129A is more likely to have a\nlow inclination and a high eccentricity.

We demonstrate that a resonance between seabed corrugations and a\nnormally or slightly oblique incident internal wave results in a series of\nfollow-up resonant interactions, which take place between the same corrugations\nand successively resonated shorter waves. A chain resonance of internal waves\nthat carries energy to small scales is thus obtained, and we find that the\nRichardson number decreases by several orders of magnitude over the corrugated\npatch. If the incidence angle is large, and the incident wave perfectly\nsatisfies a resonance condition with the topography, it turns out that not many\nhigher-mode resonance or near-resonance conditions can be satisfied, such that\nenergy stays confined within the first few modes. Nevertheless, if the incident\nwaves are sufficiently detuned from satisfying a perfect resonance condition\nwith the seabed corrugations, then we show that this frequency detuning may\nbalance off the large detuning due to oblique incidence, leading to a chain\nresonance that again carries energy to small scales.

We extend and confirm the previous works of\n\\citet{2009MNRAS.400..820T} and \\citet{2010A&A...512A..82M} by scanning a large\nparameter range for the disk magnetization, $\\mu_{\\rm D} = 10^{-3.5} ...\n10^{-0.7}$. We disentangle the disk magnetization at the foot point of the\noutflow as the main parameter that governs the properties of the outflow. We\nshow how the four jet integrals known from steady-state MHD are correlated to\nthe disk magnetization at the jet foot point. This agrees with the usual\nfindings of the steady-state theory, however, here we obtain these correlations\nfrom time-dependent simulations that include the dynamical evolution of the\ndisk in the treatment. In particular, we obtain robust correlations between the\nlocal disk magnetization and (i)the outflow velocity, (ii) the jet mass\nloading, (iii) jet angular momentum, and (iv) the local mass accretion rate.\nEssentially we find that strongly magnetized disks launch more energetic and\nfaster jets, and, due to a larger Alfv\\'en lever arm, these jets extract more\nangular momentum from the underlying disk. These kind of disk-jet systems have,\nhowever, a smaller mass loading parameter and a lower mass\nejection-to-accretion ratio. The jets are launched at the disk surface where\nthe magnetization is $\\mu(r,z) \\simeq 0.1$. The magnetization rapidly increases\nvertically providing the energy reservoir for subsequent jet acceleration.

First,\nthe solutions within each of these theories for pure torsion of cylindrical\nbars composed of isotropic elastic material are presented and found to provide\na remarkable basis for comparison with observed physical response. In\nparticular, recent novel physical experiments to characterize torsion of\nmicro-diameter copper wires in quasi-static tests show no significant size\neffect in the elastic range. This result agrees with the prediction of the\nskew-symmetric C-CST that there is no size effect for torsion of an elastic\ncircular bar in quasi-static loading, because the mean curvature tensor\nvanishes in a pure twist deformation.
