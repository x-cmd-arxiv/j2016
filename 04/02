This phenomenon, which we call a piezo-thermal effect, is\nshown to grow bilinearly with the compression rate and the amplitude of the\npotential.

However,\nthere are two clear situations when these approaches are inadequate. The first\noccurs when the data are continuous but display non-normal marginal behavior\nsuch as heavy tails or skewness, rendering an assumption of normality\ninappropriate. The second occurs when a part of the data is ordinal or discrete\n(e.g., presence or absence of a mutation) and the other part is continuous\n(e.g., expression levels of genes or proteins).

To map this connectivity, we\nacquire thousands of electron microscopy (EM) images with nanometer-scale\nresolution. After aligning these images, the resulting dataset has the\npotential to reveal the shapes of neurons and the synaptic connections between\nthem. However, imaging the brain of even a tiny organism like the fruit fly\nyields terabytes of data. It can take years of manual effort to examine such\nimage volumes and trace their neuronal connections. One solution is to apply\nimage segmentation algorithms to help automate the tracing tasks. In this\npaper, we propose a novel strategy to apply such segmentation on very large\ndatasets that exceed the capacity of a single machine. Our solution is robust\nto potential segmentation errors which could otherwise severely compromise the\nquality of the overall segmentation, for example those due to poor classifier\ngeneralizability or anomalies in the image dataset. We implement our algorithms\nin a Spark application which minimizes disk I/O, and apply them to a few large\nEM datasets, revealing both their effectiveness and scalability. We hope this\nwork will encourage external contributions to EM segmentation by providing 1) a\nflexible plugin architecture that deploys easily on different cluster\nenvironments and 2) an in-memory representation of segmentation that could be\nconducive to new advances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 19:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-04"}

The proposed version is\nstable and does not require huge or extensive computer resources. Because PIC\nsimulations work with scaled plasma and field parameters, we also propose to\nvalidate our code by comparing its results with the available MHD simulations\nunder same scaled Solar wind ( SW ) and ( IMF ) conditions. We report new\nresults from the two models. In both codes the Earth's bow shock position is\nfound to be ~14.8 RE along the Sun-Earth line, and ~ 29 RE on the dusk side.\nThose findings are consistent with past in situ observations. Both simulations\nreproduce the theoretical jump conditions at the shock. However, the PIC code\ndensity and temperature distributions are inflated and slightly shifted sunward\nwhen compared to the MHD results. Kinetic electron motions and reflected ions\nupstream may cause this sunward shift. Species distributions in the foreshock\nregion are depicted within the transition of the shock (measured ~2\nc/{\\omega}pi for {\\Theta}Bn =90o and MMS =4.7 ) and in the downstream. The size\nof the foot jump in the magnetic field at the shock is measured to be (1.7\nc/{\\omega}pi ). In the foreshocked region, the thermal velocity is found equal\nto 213 km.sec-1 at 15 RE and is equal to 63 km.sec-1at 12 RE (Magnetosheath\nregion). Despite the large cell size of the current version of the PIC code, it\nis powerful to retain macrostructure of planets magnetospheres in very short\ntime, thus it can be used for a pedagogical test purposes. It is also likely\ncomplementary with MHD to deepen our understanding of the large scale\nmagnetosphere\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 19:55:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-13"}

In the course of a\ncalculation, one encounters divergences unregulated by dimensional\nregularization, often called rapidity divergences. Once regulated, a general\nframework exists for their renormalization, the rapidity renormalization group\n(RRG), leading to fully resummed calculations of transverse momentum (to the\njet axis) sensitive quantities. We examine how this regularization can be\nimplemented via a multi-differential factorization of the soft-collinear\nphase-space, leading to an (in principle) alternative non-perturbative\nregularization of rapidity divergences. As an example, we examine the\nfully-differential factorization of a color singlet's momentum spectrum in a\nhadron-hadron collision at threshold. We show how this factorization acts as a\nmother theory to both traditional threshold and transverse momentum\nresummation, recovering the classical results for both resummations. Examining\nthe refactorization of the transverse momentum beam functions in the threshold\nregion, we show that one can directly calculate the rapidity renormalized\nfunction, while shedding light on the structure of joint resummation. Finally,\nwe show how using modern bootstrap techniques, the transverse momentum spectrum\nis determined by an expansion about the threshold factorization, leading to a\nviable higher loop scheme for calculating the relevant anomalous dimensions for\nthe transverse momentum spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-05"}

Using interviews with practicing researchers, namely physics graduate\nstudents, we explore the different experiences researchers had in learning how\nto effectively use a notebook for scientific documentation. We find that very\nfew of those interviewed thought that their undergraduate lab classes\nsuccessfully taught them the benefit of maintaining a lab notebook. Most\ndescribed training in lab notebook use as either ineffective or outright\nmissing from their undergraduate lab course experience. Furthermore, a large\nmajority of those interviewed explained that they did not receive any formal\ntraining in maintaining a lab notebook during their graduate school experience\nand received little to no feedback from their advisors on these records. Many\nof the interviewees describe learning the purpose of, and how to maintain,\nthese kinds of lab records only after having a period of trial and error,\nhaving already started doing research in their graduate program.

Numerical methods which are capable to describe\ncorrectly the large time behavior of the system are also introduced and\ndiscussed. Finally, several numerical examples showing the influence of the\nagents' number of connections in the opinion dynamics are reported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Apr 2016 22:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-05"}

This new model is adequate to study a novel class of intermetallic 4f\nand 5f orbitals materials: the Kondo topological insulators, whose paradigmatic\nmaterial is the compound SmB6.\n  For simplicity, we consider a version of the periodic Anderson model on a two\ndimensional square lattice. The starting point of the model is the 4f-Ce ions\norbitals, with J=5/2 multiplet in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. We\npresent results of the correlation functions and we show that the short range\nantiferromagnetic correlations favors the formation of magnetic moments on the\natoms, and at the same time the existence of these moments opens the\npossibility of the spin-flip scattering by the conduction electrons, generating\nthe Kondo effect, which contribute to the opening of a gap in the density of\nstates of the system.

Two\ndifferent approaches are applied to reformulate the (nonconvex) multi-objective\nproblem. In the first approach, the transmitter can control the specific amount\nof power to be harvested by power transfer whereas in the second approach the\ntransmitter can only control the proportion of power to be harvested among the\ndifferent harvesting users. The computational complexity will also be\ndifferent, with higher computational resources required in the first approach.\nIn order to solve the resulting formulations, we propose to use the\nmajorization-minimization (MM) approach. The idea behind this approach is to\nobtain a convex function that approximates the nonconvex objective and, then,\nsolve a series of convex subproblems that will converge to a locally optimal\nsolution of the general nonconvex multi-objective problem.

It is demonstrated on the Cassra/Iris Field. The theory for the\nstochastic wavelet derivation (which estimates the seismic noise level along\nwith the wavelet, time-to-depth mapping, and their uncertainties), the\nstochastic sparse spike inversion, and the net pay estimation (using secant\nareas) along with its uncertainty; will be outlined. This includes benchmarking\nof this methodology on a synthetic model. A critical part of this process is\nthe calibration of the secant areas. This is done in a two step process. First,\na preliminary calibration is done with the stochastic reflection response\nmodeling using rock physics relationships derived from the well logs. Second, a\nrefinement is made to the calibration to account for the encountered net pay at\nthe wells. Finally, a variogram structure is estimated from the extracted\nsecant area map, then used to build in the lateral correlation to the ensemble\nof net pay maps while matching the well results to within the nugget of the\nvariogram. These net pay maps are then integrated, over the area of full\nsaturation gas, to give the GIIP distribution (Gaussian distributions for the\nporosity, gas expansion factor, and gas saturation for the sand end member are\nassumed and incorporated in the estimate of GIIP). The method is demonstrated\non the Iris (UP5 turbidite) interval. The net pay is corrected for reduction in\nthe amplitudes over part of the area due to shallow gas. The sensitivity of the\nGIIP to the independent stochastic variables is estimated (determining the\nvalue of information) so that business decisions can be made that maximize the\nvalue of the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2016 00:05:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-05"}

For\nlarge dynamic networks, computing and maintaining a set of spanning trees is\nnot efficient, as the network-topology may change frequently. In this paper we\ndesign a class of dynamic algorithms which makes packet-by-packet schedul- ing\nand routing decisions and thus obviates the need for maintaining any global\ntopological structures, such as span- ning trees. Our algorithms may be\nconveniently understood as a non-trivial generalization of the familiar\nback-pressure algorithm which makes unicast packet routing and schedul- ing\ndecisions, based on queue-length information, without maintaining end-to-end\npaths. However, in the broadcast problem, it is hard to define queuing\nstructures due to ab- sence of a work-conservation principle which results from\npacket duplications. We design and prove the optimality of a virtual-queue\nbased algorithm, where a virtual-queue is de- fined for subsets of vertices. We\nthen propose a multi-class broadcast policy which combines the above scheduling\nalgo- rithm with a class-based in-order packet delivery constraint, resulting\nin significant reduction in complexity.

It is\nknown that if $h$ out of the $n$ nodes are inaccessible and $d$ surviving\n(helper) nodes are used to recover the lost data, then we need to download at\nleast $h/(d+h-k)$ fraction of the data stored in each of the helper nodes\n(Dimakis et. al., 2010 and Cadambe et al., 2013). If this lower bound is\nachieved for the repair of any $h$ erased nodes from any $d$ helper nodes, we\nsay that the MDS code has the $(h,d)$-optimal repair property.\n  We study high-rate MDS array codes with the optimal repair property. Explicit\nconstructions of such codes in the literature are only available for the cases\nwhere there are at most 3 parity nodes, and these existing constructions can\nonly optimally repair a single node failure by accessing all the surviving\nnodes.\n  In this paper, given any $r$ and $n$, we present two explicit constructions\nof MDS array codes with the $(h,d)$-optimal repair property for all $h\\le r$\nand $k\\le d\\le n-h$ simultaneously. Codes in the first family can be\nconstructed over any base field $F$ as long as $|F|\\ge sn,$ where\n$s=\\text{lcm}(1,2,\\dots,r).$ The encoding, decoding, repair of failed nodes,\nand update procedures of these codes all have low complexity. Codes in the\nsecond family have the optimal access property and can be constructed over any\nbase field $F$ as long as $|F|\\ge n+1.$ Moreover, both code families have the\noptimal error resilience capability when repairing failed nodes. We also\nconstruct several other related families of MDS codes with the optimal repair\nproperty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2016 03:16:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2016 04:28:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-11"}

They can only get a\nsnapshot of the locations of other robots but can not detect whether they are\nstatic or in motion. The robots are forgetful; once they have completed their\nmotion they forget their previous locations and observations. Again they decide\nnew destinations to move to.
