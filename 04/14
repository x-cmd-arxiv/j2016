We\nderive the Hamiltonian in a non perturbative manner and complete the\nHamiltonian analysis for all regions of the theory. We confirm that the theory\nhas at most 3 degrees of freedom in all regions of the theory as long as the\ntheory has the symmetry under the spatial diffeormorphism. Then, we derive the\ninvariant canonical transformation by using the infinitesimal transformation.\nThe invariant metric transformation of the XG theory contains a vector product\nas well as the disformal transformation. The vector product and the disformal\nfactor can depend on the higher order derivative terms of the scalar field and\nthe metric. In addition, we discover the invariant canonical transformation\nwhich transforms the momentum of the metric. Using the invariant\ntransformation, we study the relation between the Horndeski theory and the GLPV\ntheory, and find that we can not obtain the arbitrary GLPV theory from the\nHorndeski theory through the invariant canonical transformation we have found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2016 16:00:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2016 09:32:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 07:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

For a given WIMP mass the cross section at which neutrinos\nconstitute a dominant background is dependent on the uncertainty on the flux of\neach neutrino source from either the Sun, supernovae or atmospheric cosmic ray\ncollisions. However there are also considerable uncertainties with regard to\nthe astrophysical ingredients to the predicted WIMP signal. Uncertainties in\nthe velocity of the Sun with respect to the Milky Way dark matter halo, the\nlocal density of WIMPs, and the shape of the local WIMP speed distribution all\nhave an effect on the expected event rate in direct detection experiments and\nhence will change the region of the WIMP parameter space for which neutrinos\nare a significant background. In this work we extend the WIMP+neutrino analysis\nto account for the uncertainty in the astrophysics dependence of the WIMP\nsignal. We show the effect of uncertainties on projected discovery limits with\nan emphasis on low WIMP masses (less than 10 GeV) when Solar neutrino\nbackgrounds are most important.

We have measured the orientation of a total of 30\nchurches built prior to 1810, as well as a few buildings of later times, nearly\na complete sample of all the island Christian sanctuaries.

However, in many real\nimages, that's not what people do. People often appear quite close to each\nother, e.g., with limbs linked or heads touching, and their poses are often not\npedestrian-like. We propose an approach to detangle people in multi-person\nimages. We formulate the task as a region assembly problem. Starting from a\nlarge set of overlapping regions from body part semantic segmentation and\ngeneric object proposals, our optimization approach reassembles those pieces\ntogether into multiple person instances. It enforces that the composed body\npart regions of each person instance obey constraints on relative sizes, mutual\nspatial relationships, foreground coverage, and exclusive label assignments\nwhen overlapping. Since optimal region assembly is a challenging combinatorial\nproblem, we present a Lagrangian relaxation method to accelerate the lower\nbound estimation, thereby enabling a fast branch and bound solution for the\nglobal optimum. As output, our method produces a pixel-level map indicating\nboth 1) the body part labels (arm, leg, torso, and head), and 2) which parts\nbelong to which individual person. Our results on three challenging datasets\nshow our method is robust to clutter, occlusion, and complex poses.

It is shown that the proposed scheme achieves a smaller delivery\nrate than the existing coded caching schemes in the literature when K > N >= 3.\nFurthermore, we argue that the delivery rate of the proposed scheme is within a\nconstant multiplicative factor of 2 of the optimal delivery rate for cache\ncapacities 1/K <= M <= (N-1)/K, when K > N >= 3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2016 17:55:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 22:12:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-15"}

This cloud is located in the so-called outer\nfilament of ionized gas (about 15 kpc from the nucleus) where jet-induced star\nformation has been suggested to occur by different studies. We find that,\ndespite the small size, a mixture of ionization mechanisms is operating,\nresulting in considerable complexity in the spatial ionization structure. The\narea includes two H II regions where star formation is occurring and another\nlocation where star formation must have ceased very recently. Interestingly,\nthe extreme Balmer decrement of one of the star forming regions\n(H_alpha/H_beta~6) indicates that it is still heavily embedded in its natal\ncocoon of gas and dust. At all three locations a continuum counterpart is found\nwith spectra matching those of O/B stars local to Centaurus A. The H II regions\nare embedded in a larger gas complex which is photoionized by the radiation of\nthe central active galactic nucleus (AGN), but the O/B stars affect the spatial\nionization pattern in the ENLR cloud very locally. In particular, in the\nsurroundings of the youngest star forming region, we can isolate a tight mixing\nsequence in the diagnostic diagram going from gas with ionization due to a pure\nstellar continuum to gas only photoionized by the AGN. These results emphasize\nthe complexity and the mixture of processes occurring in star forming regions\nunder the influence of an AGN radiation. This is relevant for our understanding\nof AGN-induced star formation suggested to occur in a number of objects,\nincluding this region of Centaurus A. They also illustrate that these young\nstars influence the gas over only a limited region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2016 18:04:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

In\nall cases, the structure of the soft limit is controlled by a larger theory,\nwhich provides an extension of the original one by adding more fields and\ninteractions. Our main example is the $U(N)$ non-linear sigma model in its CHY\nrepresentation. Its extension is a theory in which the NLSM Goldstone bosons\ninteract with a cubic biadjoint scalar. Other theories we study and extend are\nthe special Galileon and Born-Infeld theory, including its maximally\nsupersymmetric version in four dimensions, the DBI-Volkov-Akulov theory. In all\nthe cases, we propose the CHY representation of the complete tree-level\nS-matrix of the extended theories. In fact, CHY formulas are the key technique\nfor studying the single soft limit behavior of the original theories.

One possible cause, suggested for the\nhysteresis, is polarization of the perovskite layer under applied voltage and\nillumination bias, due to ion migration within the perovskite. To study this\nproblem systemically current-voltage characteristics of both regular (light\nincident through the electron conducting contact) and so-called inverted (light\nincident through the hole conducting contact) perovskite cells were studied at\ndifferent temperatures and scan rates. We explain our results by assuming that\nthe effects of scan rate and temperature on hysteresis are strongly correlated\nto ion migration within the device, with the rate-determining step being ion\nmigration at/across the interfaces of the perovskite layer with the contact\nmaterials. By correlating between the scan rate with the measurement\ntemperature we show that the inverted and regular cells operate in different\nhysteresis regimes, with different activation energies of 0.28+-0.04 eV and\n0.59+-0.09 eV, respectively.

However,\ntheir origin is still highly debated. In one of the leading formation\nscenarios, a black hole of $\\sim100$ M$_{\\odot}$ results from the collapse of\nthe inner core of a supermassive star ($\\gtrsim 10^{4-5}$ M$_{\\odot}$), created\nby the rapid accumulation ($\\gtrsim 0.1 $ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) of pristine\ngas at the centre of newly formed galaxies at $z\\sim 15$.

To address this\npoint, we consider the effect of rotation on a quasi-star, as angular momentum\nis inevitably transported towards the galactic nucleus by the accumulating gas.\nUsing a model for the internal redistribution of angular momentum that\nqualitative matches results from simulations of rotating convective stellar\nenvelopes, we show that quasi-stars with an envelope mass greater than a few\n$10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot} \\times (\\rm black~hole~mass/100 M_{\\odot})^{0.82}$ have\nhighly sub-keplerian gas motion in their core, preventing gas circularisation\noutside the black hole's horizon. Less massive quasi-stars could form but last\nfor only $\\lesssim 10^4$ years before the accretion luminosity unbinds the\nenvelope, suppressing the black hole growth.

The correlation\nsuggests that the spin axes of quasars preferentially align with their\nsurrounding large-scale structure that is assumed to be traced by the LQGs.\nHere, we consider a large sample of LQGs built from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey DR7 quasar catalogue in the redshift range $1.0-1.8$. For quasars\nembedded in this sample, we collected radio polarization measurements with the\ngoal to study possible correlations between quasar polarization vectors and the\nmajor axis of their host LQGs. Assuming the radio polarization vector is\nperpendicular to the quasar spin axis, we found that the quasar spin axis is\npreferentially parallel to the LQG major axis inside LQGs that have at least\n$20$ members. This result independently supports the observations at optical\nwavelengths. We additionally found that when the richness of an LQG decreases,\nthe quasar spin axis becomes preferentially perpendicular to the LQG major axis\nand that no correlation is detected for quasar groups with fewer than $10$\nmembers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2016 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}

The second, ECO,\ncovers a ~40 times larger volume (containing RESOLVE-A) and is complete to\nMbary ~ 10^9.4 Msun.

Nonetheless, the low-mass slope of the BMF is not as steep as that\nof the theoretical dark matter halo MF. Moreover, we assign group halo masses\nby abundance matching, finding that the SMF and BMF separated into four\nphysically motivated halo mass regimes reveal complex structure underlying the\nsimple shape of the overall MFs. In particular, the satellite MFs are depressed\nbelow the central galaxy MF \"humps\" in groups with mass <10^13.5 Msun yet rise\nsteeply in clusters.

This\nresults in a gap in the mass vs. spin distribution of BHs when the BH size is\ncomparable to the axion's Compton wavelength. By measuring the spin and mass of\nthe merging objects observed at LIGO, we could verify the presence and shape of\nthe gap in the BH distribution produced by the axion.\n  The axion cloud can also be discovered through the GWs it radiates via axion\nannihilations or level transitions.

Quantum physicists consider Bells famous\ninequality and its violation in experiments to be a strong indication that\nlocal realistic or local causal models of QT are not possible and that quantum\ntheory as a whole is therefore not a local realistic or local causal theory.\nBased on a proposed definition of a \"formal causal model\" for a theory of\nphysics (such as QT), this paper investigates the possibility of having a local\ncausal model for QT. Areas of QT are identified in which the construction of a\ncausal model is impeded because of deficiencies in the state of the respective\ntheory. It is shown that the removal of the deficiencies can be achieved by the\nprovision of a causal model. Whereas the construction of a causal model of QT,\nincluding QFT, appears to be feasible after the removal of certain\ndeficiencies, the construction of a local (causal) model does not appear to be\npossible. As a consequence of the conclusion that local (causal) models of\nQT/QFT are not possible, if a strong interpretation of locality is assumed, a\nlocality model is proposed in which the non-localities are confined to \"quantum\nobjects\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2016 20:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-15"}

In order to quantify possible non-LTE\ncontributions to the OH Trot as a function of the upper vibrational level v',\nwe studied a sample of 343 echelle spectra taken with the X-shooter\nspectrograph at the Very Large Telescope at Cerro Paranal in Chile. These data\nallowed us to analyse 25 OH bands in each spectrum. Moreover, we could measure\nlines of O2b(0-1), which peaks at 94 to 95 km, and O2a(0-0) with an emission\npeak at about 90 km. Since the radiative lifetimes are relatively long, the\nderived O2 Trot are not significantly affected by non-LTE contributions. For a\ncomparison with OH, the differences in the emission profiles were corrected by\nusing OH emission, O2a(0-0) emission, and CO2-based temperature profile data\nfrom the multi-channel radiometer SABER on the TIMED satellite. For a reference\nprofile at 90 km, we found a good agreement of the O2 with the SABER-related\ntemperatures, whereas the OH temperatures, especially for the high and even v',\nshowed significant excesses with a maximum of more than 10 K for v' = 8.

The approach is simplified\nby neglecting stress-assisted transverse barrier hopping, and irreversible\nrelaxation proceeds solely via deformation-perturbed reptation. This process is\nself-consistently coupled to tube dilation and macroscopic rheological\nresponse. We predict that with increasing strain the tube strongly dilates,\nentanglements are lost, and reptation speeds up. As a consequence, a stress\novershoot emerges not due to affine over-orientation, but rather to strong\nweakening of the entanglement network. Just beyond the stress overshoot the\nlongest relaxation time is predicted to scale as the inverse shear rate,\ncorresponding to the emergence of a generic form of convective constraint\nrelease (CCR). Its origin is a stress-induced local force that\nself-consistently couples the mesoscopic tube-scale physics with macroscopic\nmechanical response. Tube weakening at the overshoot occurs via the same\nqualitative mechanism that leads to microscopic absolute yielding in the\nnonlinear elastic scenario analyzed in the preceding paper. The stress\novershoot and emergent CCR thus correspond to an elastic-viscous crossover due\nto deformation-induced disentanglement, which at long times and high shear\nrates results in a quantitatively sensible flow stress plateau and shear\nthinning behavior.

Since\nthen, the GGE has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool to predict the\noutcome of the relaxation dynamics of few-body observables in a variety of\nintegrable models, a process we call generalized thermalization. This review\ndiscusses several fundamental aspects of the GGE and generalized thermalization\nin integrable systems. In particular, we focus on questions such as: which\nobservables equilibrate to the GGE predictions and who should play the role of\nthe bath; what conserved quantities can be used to construct the GGE; what are\nthe differences between generalized thermalization in noninteracting systems\nand in interacting systems mappable to noninteracting ones; why is it that the\nGGE works when traditional ensembles of statistical mechanics fail. Despite a\nlot of interest in these questions in recent years, no definite answers have\nbeen given. We review results for the XX model and for the transverse field\nIsing model. For the latter model, we also report original results and show\nthat the GGE describes spin-spin correlations over the entire system. This\nmakes apparent that there is no need to trace out a part of the system in real\nspace for equilibration to occur and for the GGE to apply. In the past, a\nspectral decomposition of the weights of various statistical ensembles revealed\nthat generalized eigenstate thermalization occurs in the XX model (hard-core\nbosons). Namely, eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with similar distributions of\nconserved quantities have similar expectation values of few-spin observables.\nHere we show that generalized eigenstate thermalization also occurs in the\ntransverse field Ising model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2016 22:34:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 May 2016 19:59:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2016 13:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

For an asynchronous ripple carry adder\n(RCA) constructed using the proposed early output full adders, the\nrelative-timing assumption becomes necessary and the inherent advantages of the\nrelative-timed RCA are: (1) computation with valid inputs, i.e., forward\nlatency is data-dependent, and (2) computation with spacer inputs involves a\nbare minimum constant reverse latency of just one full adder delay, thus\nresulting in the optimal cycle time. With respect to different 32-bit RCA\nimplementations, and in comparison with the optimized strong-indication,\nweak-indication, and early output full adder designs, one of the proposed early\noutput full adders achieves respective reductions in latency by 67.8, 12.3 and\n6.1 %, while the other proposed early output full adder achieves corresponding\nreductions in area by 32.6, 24.6 and 6.9 %, with practically no power penalty.\nFurther, the proposed early output full adders based asynchronous RCAs enable\nminimum reductions in cycle time by 83.4, 15, and 8.8 % when considering\ncarry-propagation over the entire RCA width of 32-bits, and maximum reductions\nin cycle time by 97.5, 27.4, and 22.4 % for the consideration of a typical\ncarry chain length of 4 full adder stages, when compared to the least of the\ncycle time estimates of various strong-indication, weak-indication, and early\noutput asynchronous RCAs of similar size.

A way proven to be effective is to give more weight to terms\nwith more imbalanced distributions across categories. This paper shows that\nsupervised term weighting should not just assign large weights to imbalanced\nterms, but should also control the trade-off between over-weighting and\nunder-weighting. Over-weighting, a new concept proposed in this paper, is\ncaused by the improper handling of singular terms and too large ratios between\nterm weights. To prevent over-weighting, we present three regularization\ntechniques: add-one smoothing, sublinear scaling and bias term. Add-one\nsmoothing is used to handle singular terms. Sublinear scaling and bias term\nshrink the ratios between term weights. However, if sublinear functions scale\ndown term weights too much, or the bias term is too large, under-weighting\nwould occur and harm the performance. It is therefore critical to balance\nbetween over-weighting and under-weighting. Inspired by this insight, we also\npropose a new supervised term weighting scheme, regularized entropy (re). Our\nre employs entropy to measure term distribution, and introduces the bias term\nto control over-weighting and under-weighting. Empirical evaluations on topical\nand sentiment classification datasets indicate that sublinear scaling and bias\nterm greatly influence the performance of supervised term weighting, and our re\nenjoys the best results in comparison with existing schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 01:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-15"}

Our objective is to maximize the\nweighted sum of the harvested energy at two source nodes subject to quality of\nservice (QoS) constraints and the relay power constraints. Three well-known and\npractical two-way relay strategies are considered, i.e., amplify-and-forward\n(AF), bit level XOR based decode-and-forward (DF-XOR) and symbol level\nsuperposition coding based DF (DF-SUP). For each relaying strategy, we\nformulate the joint energy transmit beamforming and PS ratios optimization as a\nnonconvex quadratically constrained problem. To find a closed-form solution of\nthe formulated problem, we decouple the primal problem into two subproblems. In\nthe first problem, we intend to optimize beamforming vector for a given PS\nratio. In the second subproblem, we optimize the PS ratio with a given\nbeamforming vector. It is worth noting that although the corresponding\nsubproblem are nonconvex, the optimal solution of each subproblem can still be\nfound by using certain techniques.

Current state-of-the-art\nobject detection methods mostly adhere to the framework of regions with\nconvolutional neural network (R-CNN) and only use local appearance features\ninside object bounding boxes. Since these approaches ignore the contextual\ninformation around the object proposals, the outcome of these detectors may\ngenerate a semantically incoherent interpretation of the input image. In this\npaper, we propose an ensemble object detection system which incorporates the\nlocal appearance, the contextual information in term of relationships among\nobjects and the global scene based contextual feature generated by a\nconvolutional neural network. The system is formulated as a fully connected\nconditional random field (CRF) defined on object proposals and the contextual\nconstraints among object proposals are modeled as edges naturally. Furthermore,\na fast mean field approximation method is utilized to inference in this CRF\nmodel efficiently. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach\nachieves a higher mean average precision (mAP) on PASCAL VOC 2007 datasets\ncompared to the baseline algorithm Faster R-CNN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 07:01:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-15"}

While the increased likelihood of extremes is\nconsistent with a higher average temperature during the pause (as compared to\n1979-1997), it is important to note that the periods considered are also\ncharacterized by a transition from a relatively warm to cold phase of the El\nNino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). To further probe the relation between\ncontrasting phases of ENSO and extremes in accumulation, a similar comparison\nis performed between 1960-1978 (another extended cold phase of ENSO) and the\naforementioned warming era. Though limited by land-only observations, in this\ncold-to-warm transition, remarkably, a near-exact reversal of extremes is noted\nboth statistically and geographically. This is despite the average temperature\nbeing higher in 1979-1997 as compared to 1960-1978.

We fit the pulse\nshape obtained by the MAGIC telescope with a three-Gaussian template and\nrescale it to account for the different CTA instrumental and observational\nconfigurations. Simulations are performed for different configurations of CTA\nand for the ASTRI mini-array. The northern CTA configuration will provide an\nimprovement of a factor of ~3 in accuracy with an observing time comparable to\nthat of MAGIC (73 hours). Unless the VHE spectrum above 1 TeV behaves\ndifferently from what we presently know, unreasonably long observing times are\nrequired for a significant detection of the pulsations of the Crab pulsar with\nthe high-energy-range sub-arrays. We also found that an independent VHE timing\nanalysis is feasible with Large Size Telescopes (LSTs). CTA will provide a\nsignificant improvement in determining the VHE pulse shape parameters necessary\nto constrain theoretical models of the gamma-ray emission of the Crab pulsar.\nOne of such parameters is the shift in phase between peaks in the pulse profile\nat VHE and in other energy bands that, if detected, may point to different\nlocations of the emission regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 08:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

Our framework builds on the notion of kernelization\nfrom parameterized complexity. However, as opposed to the original notion of\nkernelization, our definitions combine well with approximation algorithms and\nheuristics. The key new definition is that of a polynomial size\n$\\alpha$-approximate kernel. Loosely speaking, a polynomial size\n$\\alpha$-approximate kernel is a polynomial time pre-processing algorithm that\ntakes as input an instance $(I,k)$ to a parameterized problem, and outputs\nanother instance $(I',k')$ to the same problem, such that $|I'|+k' \\leq\nk^{O(1)}$. Additionally, for every $c \\geq 1$, a $c$-approximate solution $s'$\nto the pre-processed instance $(I',k')$ can be turned in polynomial time into a\n$(c \\cdot \\alpha)$-approximate solution $s$ to the original instance $(I,k)$.\n  Our main technical contribution are $\\alpha$-approximate kernels of\npolynomial size for three problems, namely Connected Vertex Cover, Disjoint\nCycle Packing and Disjoint Factors. These problems are known not to admit any\npolynomial size kernels unless $NP \\subseteq coNP/poly$. Our approximate\nkernels simultaneously beat both the lower bounds on the (normal) kernel size,\nand the hardness of approximation lower bounds for all three problems. On the\nnegative side we prove that Longest Path parameterized by the length of the\npath and Set Cover parameterized by the universe size do not admit even an\n$\\alpha$-approximate kernel of polynomial size, for any $\\alpha \\geq 1$, unless\n$NP \\subseteq coNP/poly$. In order to prove this lower bound we need to combine\nin a non-trivial way the techniques used for showing kernelization lower bounds\nwith the methods for showing hardness of approximation\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 11:08:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2016 09:22:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-07"}

Although past studies considered the effect of\nthe Type I migration of protoplanetary embryos, in most cases they used a\nconventional formula based on static torques in isothermal disks, and employed\na reduction factor to account for uncertainty in the mechanism details.\nHowever, in addition to static torques, a migrating planet experiences dynamic\ntorques that are proportional to the migration rate. These dynamic torques can\nimpact on planet migration and predicted planetary populations. In this study,\nwe derived a new torque formula for Type I migration by taking into account\ndynamic corrections. This formula was used to perform population synthesis\nsimulations with and without the effect of dynamic torques. In many cases,\ninward migration was slowed significantly by the dynamic effects. For the\nstatic torque case, gas giant formation was effectively suppressed by Type I\nmigration; however, when dynamic effects were considered, a substantial\nfraction of cores survived and grew into gas giants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 11:37:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-15"}

Understanding\nthe formation and evolution of the solar network (NE) is a challenge, because\nit provides a magnetic flux over the solar surface comparable to the flux of\nactive regions at solar maximum. Aims: We investigate the structure and\nevolution of interior cells of solar supergranulation. From Hinode\nobservations, we explore the motions on solar surface at high spatial and\ntemporal resolution. We derive the main organization of the flows inside\nsupergranules and their effect on the magnetic elements. Method: To probe the\nsuperganule interior cell, we used the Trees of Fragmenting Granules (TFG)\nevolution and their relations to horizontal Results: Evolution of TFG and their\nmutual interactions result in cumulative effects able to build horizontal\ncoherent flows with longer lifetime than granulation (1 to 2 hours) over a\nscale up to 12\\arcsec. These flows clearly act on the diffusion of the\nintranetwork (IN) magnetic elements and also on the location and shape of the\nnetwork. Conclusions: From our analysis during 24 hours, TFG appear as one of\nthe major elements of the supergranules which diffuse and advect the magnetic\nfield on the Sun's surface.

We find that in\nthe log-log space the derived image power spectra can be well represented by a\nconstant model component at large wavenumbers, while at small wavenumbers a\npower excess beyond the constant component appears in all clusters, with a\nclear tendency that the excess is stronger in CC clusters. By introducing a new\nCC diagnostic parameter, i.e., the power excess index (PEI), we classify the\nclusters in our sample and compare the results with those obtained with three\ntraditional CC diagnostics. We find that the results agree with each other very\nwell. By calculating the PEI values of the simulated clusters, we find that the\nnew diagnostic works well at redshifts up to 0.5 for intermediately sized and\nmassive clusters with a typical Chandra or XMM pointing observation. The new CC\ndiagnostic has several advantages over its counterparts, e.g., it is free of\nthe effects of the commonly seen centroid shift of the X-ray halo caused by\nmerger event, and the corresponding calculation is straightforward, almost\nirrelevant to the complicated spectral analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 12:14:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

To prove that the proposed DFA is a promising\ntechnique, its performance has been compared with two other well-known\ntechniques: an evolutionary algorithm and an evolutionary simulated annealing.\nOur results have shown that the DFA has outperformed these two classic\nmeta-heuristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 13:25:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-15"}

In view of this,\nwe quantify the interference correlation in non-Poisson networks where the\ninterferers are distributed as a Matern cluster process (MCP) and a\nsecond-order cluster process (SOCP). Interestingly, it is found that the\ncorrelation coefficient of interference for the Matern cluster networks,\n$\\zeta_{MCP}$, is equal to that for second-order cluster networks,\n$\\zeta_{SOCP}$. Furthermore, they are greater than their counterpart for the\nPoisson networks. This shows that clustering in interferers enhances the\ninterference correlation.

A wide class\nof these theories, albeit indistinguishable from GR in the weak field regime,\npredicts a radically different phenomenology for neutron stars, due to a\nnonperturbative, strong-field effect referred to as spontaneous scalarization.\nThis effect is known to occur in theories where the effective linear coupling\n$\\beta_0$ between the scalar and matter fields is sufficiently negative, i.e.\n$\\beta_0 \\lesssim -4.35$, and has been strongly constrained by pulsar timing\nobservations.\n  In the test-field approximation, spontaneous scalarization manifests itself\nas a tachyonic-like instability. Recently, it was argued that, in theories\nwhere $\\beta_0>0$, a similar instability would be triggered by sufficiently\ncompact neutron stars obeying realistic equations of state. In this work we\ninvestigate the endstate of this instability for some representative coupling\nfunctions with $\\beta_0>0$. This is done both through an energy balance\nanalysis of the existing equilibrium configurations, and by numerically\ndetermining the nonlinear Cauchy development of unstable initial data. We find\nthat, contrary to the $\\beta_0<0$ case, the final state of the instability is\nhighly sensitive to the details of the coupling function, varying from\ngravitational collapse to spontaneous scalarization.

In particular, the state-of-the-art solution requires up\nto a few seconds to compute a SimRank score in million-node graphs, and does\nnot offer any worst-case assurance in terms of the query error.\n  This paper presents SLING, an efficient index structure for SimRank\ncomputation. SLING guarantees that each SimRank score returned has at most\n$\\varepsilon$ additive error, and it answers any single-pair and single-source\nSimRank queries in $O(1/\\varepsilon)$ and $O(n/\\varepsilon)$ time,\nrespectively. These time complexities are near-optimal, and are significantly\nbetter than the asymptotic bounds of the most recent approach. Furthermore,\nSLING requires only $O(n/\\varepsilon)$ space (which is also near-optimal in an\nasymptotic sense) and $O(m/\\varepsilon + n\\log \\frac{n}{\\delta}/\\varepsilon^2)$\npre-computation time, where $\\delta$ is the failure probability of the\npreprocessing algorithm. We experimentally evaluate SLING with a variety of\nreal-world graphs with up to several millions of nodes. Our results demonstrate\nthat SLING is up to $10000$ times (resp. $110$ times) faster than competing\nmethods for single-pair (resp. single-source) SimRank queries, at the cost of\nhigher space overheads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 15:17:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-15"}

For\n$\\kappa\\neq\\infty$ these are subject to the restrictions that they can be used\nonly at temperatures far from zero. They thus, as shown earlier, have little\nvalue for quantum physics.

A trajectory in Cartesian space is represented by a\nfour-dimensional manifold, called the fundamental manifold. Based on geometric\nand topological aspects classical concepts of stability are translated to KS\nlanguage. The separation between manifolds of solutions generalizes the concept\nof Lyapunov stability. The dimension-raising nature of the fibration transforms\nfixed points, limit cycles, attractive sets, and Poincar\\'e sections to\nhigher-dimensional subspaces. From these concepts chaotic systems are studied.\nIn strongly perturbed problems the numerical error can break the topological\nstructure of KS space: points in a fiber are no longer transformed to the same\npoint in Cartesian space. An observer in three dimensions will see orbits\ndeparting from the same initial conditions but diverging in time. This apparent\nrandomness of the integration can only be understood in four dimensions. The\nconcept of topological stability results in a simple method for estimating the\ntime scale in which numerical simulations can be trusted. Ideally all\ntrajectories departing from the same fiber should be KS transformed to a unique\ntrajectory in three-dimensional space, because the fundamental manifold that\nthey constitute is unique. By monitoring how trajectories departing from one\nfiber separate from the fundamental manifold a critical time, equivalent to the\nLyapunov time, is estimated. These concepts are tested on N-body examples: the\nPythagorean problem, and an example of field stars interacting with a binary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Apr 2016 05:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-25"}
