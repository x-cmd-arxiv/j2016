Using the simulation\nmethod of multi-particle collision dynamics, we study an undulatory Taylor line\nswimming in a two-dimensional microchannel and in a cubic lattice of obstacles,\nwhich represent simple forms of a microstructured environment. In the\nmicrochannel the Taylor line swims at an acute angle along a channel wall with\na clearly enhanced swimming speed due to hydrodynamic interactions with the\nbounding wall. While in a dilute obstacle lattice swimming speed is also\nenhanced, a dense obstacle lattice gives rise to geometric swimming. This new\ntype of swimming is characterized by a drastically increased swimming speed.\nSince the Taylor line has to fit into the free space of the obstacle lattice,\nthe swimming speed is close to the phase velocity of the bending wave traveling\nalong the Taylor line.

However, empirical\nanalysis of the temporal variation of trophic interactions is constrained by\nthe lack of data with high spatial, temporal, and taxonomic resolution. Here,\nwe evaluate the spatiotemporal variability of multiple consumer-resource\ninteractions of large marine networks. The tropic interactions of all of the\nanalyzed networks had low temporal persistence, which was well described by a\ncommon exponential decay in the rank-frequency relationship of\nconsumer-resource interactions. This common pattern of low temporal persistence\nwas evident despite the dissimilarities of environmental conditions among\nsites. Between-site rank correlations of frequency of occurrence of\ninteractions ranged from 0.59 to 0.73. After removing the interactions with\n<50% frequency, the between-site correlations decreased to values between 0.60\nand 0.28, indicating that low-frequency interactions accounted for the apparent\nsimilarities between sites. Our results showed that the communities studied\nwere characterized by few persistent interactions and a large number of\ntransient trophic interactions. We suggest that consumer-resource temporal\nasynchrony in addition to varying local environmental conditions and\nopportunistic foraging could be among the mechanisms generating the observed\nrank-frequency relationship of trophic interactions.

Motivated in part by the difficulty of\naccommodating large amounts of entropy carried in dark radiation with cosmic\nmicrowave background measurements of the effective number of relativistic\nspecies at recombination, $N_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, we aim to establish which\nadmissible cosmological histories can populate a thermal dark sector that never\nreaches thermal equilibrium with the SM. The minimal cosmological origin for\nsuch a dark sector is asymmetric reheating, when the same mechanism that\npopulates the SM in the early universe also populates the dark sector at a\nlower temperature. Here we demonstrate that the resulting inevitable\ninflaton-mediated scattering between the dark sector and the SM can wash out a\nwould-be temperature asymmetry, and establish the regions of parameter space\nwhere temperature asymmetries can be generated in minimal reheating scenarios.\nThus obtaining a temperature asymmetry of a given size either restricts\npossible inflaton masses and couplings or necessitates a non-minimal cosmology\nfor one or both sectors.

We investigate the compatibility of the pure baryonic model and\nbaryonic plus one of the three DM models with observations on the assembled\ngalaxy database. When a DM component improves the fit with the spectroscopic\nrotational curve, we rank the models according to the goodness of fit to the\ndatasets. We constructed the spatial luminosity density of the baryonic\ncomponent based on the surface brightness profile of the galaxies. We estimated\nthe mass-to-light (M/L) ratio of the stellar component through a previously\nproposed color-mass-to-light ratio relation (CMLR). We assumed an axissymetric\nbaryonic mass model with variable axis ratios together with one of the three DM\nmodels to provide the theoretical rotational velocity curves, and we compared\nthem with the dataset. In a second attempt, we addressed the question whether\nthe dark component could be replaced by a pure baryonic model with fitted M/L\nratios. We employed the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to establish the\nperformance of the best-fit models. For 7 galaxies, neither model fits the\ndataset within the 1{\\sigma} confidence level. For the other 23 cases, one of\nthe models with DM explains the rotation curve data best. According to the AIC,\nthe PSE emerges as most favored in 14 cases, followed by the NFW (6 cases) and\nthe Einasto (3 cases) DM models. We find that the pure baryonic model with\nfitted M/L ratios falls within the 1{\\sigma} confidence level for 10 HSB and 2\nLSB galaxies, at the price of growing the M/Ls on average by a factor of two,\nbut the fits are inferior compared to the best-fitting DM model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2016 20:01:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 16:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

One of the\nmain goals in analyzing these mutations is the identification of mutations\nassociated with clinical parameters, such as survival time. This goal is\nhindered by the genetic heterogeneity of mutations in cancer, due to the fact\nthat genes and mutations act in the context of pathways. To identify mutations\nassociated with survival time it is therefore crucial to study mutations in the\ncontext of interaction networks.\n  In this work we study the problem of identifying subnetworks of a large\ngene-gene interaction network that have mutations associated with survival. We\nformally define the associated computational problem by using a score for\nsubnetworks based on the test statistic of the log-rank test, a widely used\nstatistical test for comparing the survival of two populations. We show that\nthe computational problem is NP-hard and we propose a novel algorithm, called\nNetwork of Mutations Associated with Survival (NoMAS), to solve it. NoMAS is\nbased on the color-coding technique, that has been previously used in other\napplications to find the highest scoring subnetwork with high probability when\nthe subnetwork score is additive. In our case the score is not additive;\nnonetheless, we prove that under a reasonable model for mutations in cancer\nNoMAS does identify the optimal solution with high probability. We test NoMAS\non simulated and cancer data, comparing it to approaches based on single gene\ntests and to various greedy approaches. We show that our method does indeed\nfind the optimal solution and performs better than the other approaches.\nMoreover, on two cancer datasets our method identifies subnetworks with\nsignificant association to survival when none of the genes has significant\nassociation with survival when considered in isolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2016 20:09:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Sep 2016 11:25:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-13"}

The derivation of the outer bounds on the secrecy\ncapacity region involves careful selection of the side information to be\nprovided to the receivers and using the secrecy constraints at the receivers in\na judicious manner. To this end, a novel partitioning of the encoded messages\nand outputs is proposed for the deterministic model based on the strength of\ninterference and signal.

The Main\nPulse and the Low-Frequency Interpulse come from regions somewhere in the\nhigh-altitude emission zones (caustics) that also produce pulsed X-ray and\ngamma-ray emission. Although no emission model can fully explain these two\ncomponents, the most likely models suggest they arise from a combination of\nbeam-driven instabilities, coherent charge bunching and strong electromagnetic\nturbulence. Because the radio power fluctuates on a wide range of timescales,\nwe know the emission zones are patchy and dynamic. It is tempting to invoke\nunsteady pair creation in high-altitude gaps as source of the variability, but\ncurrent pair cascade models cannot explain the densities required by any of the\nlikely models. It is harder to account for the mysterious High-Frequency\nInterpulse. We understand neither its origin within the magnetosphere nor the\nstriking emission bands in its dynamic spectrum. The most promising models are\nbased on analogies with solar zebra bands, but they require unusual plasma\nstructures which are not part of our standard picture of the magnetosphere.

When the algorithm is\nseeded with a special type of cluster containing a defect, we find that growth\nis forced to infinity with high probability and that the resultant IQC has a\nvanishing density of defects. The geometric features underlying this algorithm\ncan inform analyses of experimental systems and numerical models that generate\nhighly ordered quasicrystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2016 20:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

Knowledge of the neutrino energy spectrum and\nneutrino-detector interactions are crucial for these experiments. Short range\nnucleon-nucleon correlations in nuclei (SRC) affect properties of nuclei. The\nArgoNeut liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (lArTPC) observed neutrino-argon\nscattering events with two protons back-to-back in the final state (\"hammer\"\nevents) which they associated with SRC pairs. The MicroBoone lArTPC will\nmeasure far more of these events.\n  We simulate hammer events using two simple models. We use the well-known\nelectron-nucleon cross section to calculate e-argon interactions where the e-\nscatters from a proton, ejecting a pi+, and the pi+ is then absorbed on a\nmoving deuteron-like $np$ pair. We also use a model where the electron excites\na nucleon to a Delta, which then deexcites by interacting with a second\nnucleon.\n  The pion production model results in two protons very similar to those of the\nhammer events. These distributions are insensitive to the momentum of the $np$\npair that absorbed the $\\pi$. The incident neutrino energy can be reconstructed\nfrom just the outgoing lepton. The Delta process results in two protons that\nare less similar to the observed events.\n  ArgoNeut hammer events can be described by a simple pion production and\nreabsorption model.

Experimental\ntechnologies for directly profiling genomes of single cells are rapidly\nimproving, but they are still impractical for large-scale sampling. Bulk\ngenomic assays remain the standard for population-scale studies, but conflate\nthe influences of mixtures of genetically distinct tumor, stromal, and\ninfiltrating immune cells. Many computational approaches have been developed to\ndeconvolute these mixed samples and reconstruct the genomics of genetically\nhomogeneous clonal subpopulations. All such methods, however, are limited to\nreconstructing only coarse approximations to a few major subpopulations. In\nprior work, we showed that one can improve deconvolution of genomic data by\nleveraging substructure in cellular mixtures through a strategy called\nsimplicial complex inference. This strategy, however, is also limited by the\ndifficulty of inferring mixture structure from sparse, noisy assays. Results:\nWe improve on past work by introducing enhancements to automate learning of\nsubstructured genomic mixtures, with specific emphasis on genome-wide copy\nnumber variation (CNV) data. We introduce methods for dimensionality estimation\nto better decompose mixture model substructure; fuzzy clustering to better\nidentify substructure in sparse, noisy data; and automated model inference\nmethods for other key model parameters. We show that these improvements lead to\nmore accurate inference of cell populations and mixture proportions in\nsimulated scenarios. We further demonstrate their effectiveness in identifying\nmixture substructure in real tumor CNV data.

We start with simple models, such as the two-site molecule, the\ninfinite and semi-infinite one-dimensional chains, and the two-dimensional\nladder. Numerical implementations are developed via the recursive Green's\nfunction, implemented in Julia, an open-source, efficient and easy-to-learn\nscientific language. We also present a new variation of the surface recursive\nGreen's function method, which can be of interest when simulating\nsimultaneously the properties of surface and bulk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2016 22:56:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2016 15:20:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-14"}

However, most of the existing relaying\nschemes are based on relays with fixed locations, or \\emph{static relaying}. In\nthis paper, we consider a novel \\emph{mobile relaying} technique, where the\nrelay nodes are assumed to be capable of moving at high speed. Compared to\nstatic relaying, mobile relaying offers a new degree of freedom for performance\nenhancement via careful relay trajectory design. We study the throughput\nmaximization problem in mobile relaying systems by optimizing the source/relay\ntransmit power along with the relay trajectory, subject to practical mobility\nconstraints (on the relay speed and initial/final relay locations), as well as\nthe \\emph{information-causality constraint} at the relay owing to its\ndecode-store-and-forward (DSF) strategy. It is shown that for fixed relay\ntrajectory, the throughput-optimal source/relay power allocations over time\nfollow a \"staircase\" water filling (WF) structure, with \\emph{non-increasing}\nand \\emph{non-decreasing} water levels at the source and relay, respectively.\nOn the other hand, with given power allocations, the throughput can be further\nimproved by optimizing the relay trajectory via successive convex optimization.\nAn iterative algorithm is thus proposed to optimize the power allocations and\nrelay trajectory alternately. Furthermore, for the special case with free\ninitial and final relay locations, the jointly optimal power allocation and\nrelay trajectory are derived. Numerical results show that by optimizing the\ntrajectory of the relay and power allocations adaptive to its induced channel\nvariation, mobile relaying is able to achieve significant throughput gains over\nthe conventional static relaying.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2016 03:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

Powering this massive number of embedded devices is a key\nchallenge of designing IoT since batteries increase the devices' form factors\nand their recharging/replacement is difficult. To tackle this challenge, we\npropose a novel network architecture that integrates wireless power transfer\nand backscatter communication, called wirelessly powered backscatter\ncommunication (WP-BC) networks. In this architecture, power beacons (PBs) are\ndeployed for wirelessly powering devices; their ad-hoc communication relies on\nbackscattering and modulating incident continuous waves from PBs, which\nconsumes orders-of-magnitude less power than traditional radios. Thereby, the\ndense deployment of low-complexity PBs with high transmission power can power a\nlarge-scale IoT. In this paper, a WP-BC network is modeled as a random Poisson\ncluster process in the horizontal plane where PBs are Poisson distributed and\nactive ad-hoc pairs of backscatter communication nodes with fixed separation\ndistances form random clusters centered at PBs. Furthermore, by harvesting\nenergy from and backscattering radio frequency (RF) waves transmitted by PBs,\nthe transmission power of each node depends on the distance from the associated\nPB. Applying stochastic geometry, the network coverage probability and\ntransmission capacity are derived and optimized as functions of the backscatter\nduty cycle and reflection coefficient as well as the PB density. The effects of\nthe parameters on network performance are characterized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2016 03:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

Thermal convection in a plane\nhorizontal fluid layer is numerically simulated.
