In this paper, we link FPT results to classic\nartificial intelligence (AI) techniques to show how they complement each other.\nSpecifically, we consider the workflow satisfiability problem (WSP) which asks\nwhether there exists an assignment of authorised users to the steps in a\nworkflow specification, subject to certain constraints on the assignment. It\nwas shown by Cohen et al. (JAIR 2014) that WSP restricted to the class of\nuser-independent constraints (UI), covering many practical cases, admits FPT\nalgorithms, i.e. can be solved in time exponential only in the number of steps\n$k$ and polynomial in the number of users $n$. Since usually $k << n$ in WSP,\nsuch FPT algorithms are of great practical interest. We present a new\ninterpretation of the FPT nature of the WSP with UI constraints giving a\ndecomposition of the problem into two levels. Exploiting this two-level split,\nwe develop a new FPT algorithm that is by many orders of magnitude faster than\nthe previous state-of-the-art WSP algorithm and also has only polynomial-space\ncomplexity. We also introduce new pseudo-Boolean (PB) and Constraint\nSatisfaction (CSP) formulations of the WSP with UI constraints which\nefficiently exploit this new decomposition of the problem and raise the novel\nissue of how to use general-purpose solvers to tackle FPT problems in a fashion\nthat meets FPT efficiency expectations. In our computational study, we\ninvestigate, for the first time, the phase transition (PT) properties of the\nWSP, under a model for generation of random instances. We show how PT studies\ncan be extended, in a novel fashion, to support empirical evaluation of scaling\nof FPT algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 16:08:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2018 16:13:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Feb 2019 15:33:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2019 15:44:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-07-24"}

In contrast, the quantum coherence will\neventually vanish from the open quantum system when the underlying topology is\na regular graph (such as a cycle).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 17:07:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2017 14:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-19"}

This occurs by the\ncombination of experimental ingenuity and ever simpler theoretical schemes.\nThis thesis comes from the latter perspective, aiming to find new, simpler ways\nin which components of a quantum computer could be built. We first search for\nways to create quantum gates, the primitive building blocks of a quantum\ncomputer. We find a novel, low-control way of performing a two-qubit gate on\nqubits encoded in a decoherence-free subspace, making use of many-body\ninteractions that may already be present. This includes an analysis of the\neffect of control errors and magnetic field fluctuations on the gate. We then\npresent novel ways to create three-qubit Toffoli and Fredkin gates in a single\nstep using linear arrays of qubits, including an assessment of how well these\ngates could perform, for quantum or classical computation, using\nstate-of-the-art ion trap and silicon donor technology. We then focus on a very\ndifferent model from the normal circuit model, combining ideas from\nmeasurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) and holonomic quantum computation,\nshowing that all MBQC patterns with a property called \\emph{gflow} can be\nconverted into a holonomic computation. The manifestation of the properties of\nMBQC in this adiabatically driven model is then explored. Finally, we\ninvestigate ways in which quantum information can be communicated between\ndistant parties, using minimally engineered spin chains. The viability of using\n1D Wigner crystals as a quantum channel is analysed, as well as schemes using\nideal uniform spin chains with next-neighbour interactions, and edge-locking\neffects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 17:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

Most existing methods either\nrestrict to static environments or lack performance guarantees. This motivates\nus to investigate the ITMP problem using formal methods and propose a bottom-up\ncompositional design approach called CoSMoP (Composition of Safe Motion\nPrimitives). Our basic idea is to synthesize a global motion plan through\ncomposing simple local moves and actions, and to achieve its performance\nguarantee through modular and incremental verifications. The design consists of\ntwo steps. First, basic motion primitives are designed and verified locally.\nThen, a global motion path is built upon these certified motion primitives by\nconcatenating them together. In particular, we model the motion primitives as\nhybrid automata and verify their safety through formulating as Differential\nDynamic Logic (d$\\mathcal{L}$). Furthermore, these proven safe motion\nprimitives are composed based on an encoding to Satisfiability Modulo Theories\n(SMT) that takes into account the geometric constraints. Since d$\\mathcal{L}$\nallows compositional verification, the sequential composition of the safe\nmotion primitives also preserves safety properties. Therefore, the CoSMoP\ngenerates correct plans for given task specifications that are formally proven\nsafe even for moving obstacles. Illustrative examples are presented to show the\neffectiveness of the methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 17:25:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 17:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-16"}

Here, we present an\nalternative phosphorene production method based on surfactant-assisted\nexfoliation and post-processing of black phosphorus in deoxygenated water. From\ncomprehensive microscopic and spectroscopic analysis, this approach is shown to\nyield phosphorene dispersions that are stable, highly concentrated, and\ncomparable to micromechanically exfoliated phosphorene in structure and\nchemistry. Due to the high exfoliation efficiency of this process, the\nresulting phosphorene flakes are thinner than anhydrous organic solvent\ndispersions, thus allowing the observation of layer-dependent photoluminescence\ndown to the monolayer limit. Furthermore, to demonstrate preservation of\nelectronic properties following solution processing, the aqueous-exfoliated\nphosphorene flakes are employed in field-effect transistors with high drive\ncurrents and current modulation ratios. Overall, this method enables the\nisolation and mass production of few-layer phosphorene, which will accelerate\nongoing efforts to realize a diverse range of phosphorene-based applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 18:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

This approach postulates that star forming regions and\nclusters are an evolutionary sequence which can be modeled with assumptions\nabout the coupling between protostars and accretion disks, angular momentum\nloss from magnetized winds that saturates in a mass-dependent fashion at high\nrotation rates, and core-envelope decoupling for solar analogs. We test this\napproach by combining established data with the large h Per dataset from the\nMONITOR project and new low-mass Pleiades data. We confirm prior results that\nyoung low-mass stars can be used to test star-disk coupling and angular\nmomentum loss independent of the treatment of internal angular momentum\ntransport. For slow rotators, we confirm the need for star-disk interactions to\nevolve the ONC to older systems, using h Per (age 13~Myr) as our natural\npost-disk case. Further interactions are not required to evolve slow rotators\nfrom h Per to older systems, implying no justification for extremely long-lived\ndisks as an alternative to core-envelope decoupling. However, our wind models\ncannot evolve rapid rotators from h Per to older systems consistently; this\nappears to be a general problem for any wind model that becomes ineffective in\nlow-mass young stars. We outline two possible solutions: either there is cosmic\nvariance in the distribution of stellar rotation rates in different clusters or\nthere are substantially enhanced torques in low-mass rapid rotators. We favor\nthe former explanation and discuss observational tests that could be used to\ndistinguish them. If the distribution of initial conditions depends on\nenvironment, models which test parameters by assuming a universal underlying\ndistribution of initial conditions will need to be re-evaluated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 20:00:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

The\nspreading of correlations in the presence of algebraic decaying interactions,\n$1/R^\\alpha$, is studied for lattice Bose models in arbitrary dimension $D$.\nThese models are exactly solvable and provide useful insight in the universal\ndescription of more complex systems as well as comparisons to the known\nuniversal upper bounds for the spreading of correlations. Using analytical\ncalculations of the dominant terms and full numerical integration of all\nquasi-particle contributions, we identify three distinct dynamical regimes. For\nstrong decay of nteractions, $\\alpha>D+1$, we find a causal regime,\nqualitatively similar to what previously found for short-range interactions.\nThis regime is characterized by ballistic (linear cone) spreading of the\ncorrelations with a cone velocity equal to twice the maximum group velocity of\nthe quasi-particles. For weak decay of interactions, $\\alpha<D$, we find\ninstantaneous activation of correlations at arbitrary distance. This signals\nthe breaking of causality, which can be associated with the divergence of the\nquasi-particle energy spectrum. Finite-size scaling of the activation time\nprecisely confirms this interpretation. For intermediate decay of interactions,\n$D<\\alpha<D+1$, we find a sub-ballistic, algebraic (bent cone) spreading and\ndetermine the corresponding exponent as a function of $\\alpha$. These outcomes\ngeneralize existing results for one-dimensional systems to arbitrary dimension.\nWe precisely relate the three regimes to the first- and second-order\ndivergences of the quasi-particle energy spectrum for any dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 20:19:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Sep 2016 12:26:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

An important systematic\nconcern for these surveys is line confusion from foreground or background\ngalaxies emitting in other lines that happen to lie at the same observed\nfrequency as the \"target\" emission line of interest. We develop an approach to\nseparate this \"interloper\" emission at the power spectrum level. If one adopts\nthe redshift of the target emission line in mapping from observed frequency and\nangle on the sky to co-moving units, the interloper emission is mapped to the\nwrong co-moving coordinates. Since the mapping is different in the line of\nsight and transverse directions, the interloper contribution to the power\nspectrum becomes anisotropic, especially if the interloper and target emission\nare at widely separated redshifts. This distortion is analogous to the\nAlcock-Paczynski test, but here the warping arises from assuming the wrong\nredshift rather than an incorrect cosmological model. We apply this to the case\nof a hypothetical [CII] emission survey at z~7 and find that the distinctive\ninterloper anisotropy can, in principle, be used to separate strong foreground\nCO emission fluctuations. In our models, however, a significantly more\nsensitive instrument than currently planned is required, although there are\nlarge uncertainties in forecasting the high redshift [CII] emission signal.\nWith upcoming surveys, it may nevertheless be useful to apply this approach\nafter first masking pixels suspected of containing strong interloper\ncontamination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 20:20:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

We show\nthat any sparse polynomial function can be computed, on nearly all sparse\nbinary vectors, by a single layer neural network that takes a compact sketch of\nthe vector as input. Consequently, when a set of sparse binary vectors is\napproximately separable using a sparse polynomial, there exists a single-layer\nneural network that takes a short sketch as input and correctly classifies\nnearly all the points. Previous work has proposed using sketches to reduce\ndimensionality while preserving the hypothesis class. However, the sketch size\nhas an exponential dependence on the degree in the case of polynomial\nclassifiers. In stark contrast, our approach of using improper learning, using\na larger hypothesis class allows the sketch size to have a logarithmic\ndependence on the degree. Even in the linear case, our approach allows us to\nimprove on the pesky $O({1}/{{\\gamma}^2})$ dependence of random projections, on\nthe margin $\\gamma$.

To date, most of the presented approaches rely on\nthe same underlying formulation, the continuous Galerkin (CG)-FEM. In this\narticle, a novel approach to solve the EEG forward problem based on a mixed\nfinite element method (Mixed-FEM) is introduced. To obtain the Mixed-FEM\nformulation, the electric current is introduced as an additional unknown\nbesides the electric potential. As a consequence of this derivation, the\nMixed-FEM is, by construction, current preserving, in contrast to the CG-FEM.\nConsequently, a higher simulation accuracy can be achieved in certain\nscenarios, e.g., when the diameter of thin insulating structures, such as the\nskull, is in the range of the mesh resolution.\n  A theoretical derivation of the Mixed-FEM approach for EEG forward\nsimulations is presented, and the algorithms implemented for solving the\nresulting equation systems are described. Subsequently, first evaluations in\nboth sphere and realistic head models are presented, and the results are\ncompared to previously introduced CG-FEM approaches. Additional visualizations\nare shown to illustrate the current preserving property of the Mixed-FEM.\n  Based on these results, it is concluded that the newly presented Mixed-FEM\ncan at least complement and in some scenarios even outperform the established\nCG-FEM approaches, which motivates a further evaluation of the Mixed-FEM for\napplications in bioelectromagnetism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2016 22:14:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2017 22:24:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-25"}

As video content becomes an increasingly\nsignificant tool for analysis, there is a demand for appropriate digital\nannotation techniques that offer equivalent functionality to tools used for\nannotation of text based literature sources. This paper argues for the\nimportance of video annotating as an effective method for research that is as\naccessible as literature annotation is. Video annotation has been shown to\ntrigger higher learning and engagement but research struggles to explain the\nabsence of video annotation in contemporary structures of education practice.\nIn both academic and informal settings the use of video playback as a\nmeaningful tool of analysis is apparent, yet the availability of supplementary\nannotation software is not within obvious grasp or even prevalent in\nstandardized computer software. Practical software tools produced by the\nresearcher have demonstrated effective video annotation in a short development\ntime. With software design programs available for rapid application creation,\nthis paper also highlights the absence of a development community. This paper\nargues that video annotation is an accessible tool, not just for academic\ncontexts, but also for wider practical video analysis applications, potentially\nbecoming a mainstream learning tool. This paper thus presents a practical\nmultimodal public approach to video research that potentially affords a deeper\nanalysis of media content.

Sources of noise and correlations among summed\nquantities within a comparison metric affect the significance of a signal that\nis useful for testing model skill. In the setting of the tropical Pacific, we\nintroduce an \"inquiry dependent\" (ID) metric of model-data comparison that\ndetermines the relative importance of the TOGA-TAO buoy observations of the\nocean temperature, salinity, and horizontal currents for influencing\nupper-ocean vertical turbulent mixing as represented by the K-Profile\nParameterization (KPP) embedded in the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm)\nfor the 2004-2007 time period.

In this approach the MITgcm is\nused to infer variability and relationships in and among the data, and to\ndetermine the response structures that are most relevant for constraining\nuncertain parameters. We demonstrate that the ID metric is able to distinguish\nthe effects due to parameter perturbations from those due to uncertain winds\nand that it is important to include multiple kinds of data in the comparison,\nsuggesting that the ID metric is appropriate for use in a calibration of the\nKPP model parameters using mooring observations of the ocean state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2016 03:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-21"}

Among various transport processes,\nelectroosmosis stands as one of the efficient flow actuation method through\nnarrow confinement. In the present study, we explore the electrically actuated\nflow of a nematic fluid with ionic inclusions taking into account the\ninfluences from surface induced elastic and electrical double layer phenomena.\nInfluence of surface effects on the flow characteristics is known to get\naugmented in micro-confined environment and must be properly addressed. Towards\nthis, we devise the coupled flow governing equations from fundamental free\nenergy analysis considering the contributions from first and second-order\nelastic, dielectric, flexoelectric, ionic and entropic energies. We have\nfurther considered weak anchoring surface conditions with second order\nelasticity which helps us to more accurately capture the director deformations\nalong the boundaries. The present study focuses on the influence of surface\ncharge and elasticity effects in the resulting linear electroosmosis through a\nslit-type microchannel whose surface are considered to be chemically treated in\norder to display a homeotropic-type weak anchoring state. An optical periodic\nstripe configuration of the nematic director has been observed especially for\nhigher electric fields wherein the Ericksen number for the dynamic study is\nrestricted to the order of unity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2016 05:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

There are however potential advantages to be gained\nfrom using field dependent, high frequency magnetization dynamics for magnetic\nparticle detection. Here we demonstrate the use of nano-confined ferromagnetic\nresonances in periodically patterned magnetic films for the detection of\nadsorbed magnetic particles with diameters ranging from 6 nm to 4 $\\mu$m. The\nnanopatterned films contain arrays of holes which can act as preferential\nadsorption sites for small particles. Hole-localized particles act in unison to\nshift the resonant frequencies of the various modes of the patterned layer with\nshift polarities determined by the localization of each mode within the\nnanopattern's repeating unit cell. The same polarity shifts are observed for a\nlarge range of coverages, even when hole-localized particles are covered by\nquasi-continuous particle sheets. For large particles however, preferential\nadsorption no longer occurs, leading to resonance shifts with polarities which\nare independent of the mode localization. Analogous shifts are seen in\ncontinuous layers where, for small particles, the shift of the layer's\nfundamental mode is typically about 10 times less than in patterned systems and\ninduced by relatively weak fields emanating beyond the particle in the\ndirection of the static applied field. This highlights the importance of having\nconfined modes consistently positioned with respect to nearby particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2016 06:23:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

This removes the perspective distortion associated with the oblique\nviewing angle of the irregularities from the ground, facilitating the\ndecomposition of dynamics along and across magnetic field lines.

We study these FAIs in the new reference frame, quantifying\nfield-aligned and field-transverse behaviour, examining time and altitude\ndependencies, and extending the analysis to FAIs on sub-array scales. We show\nthat the inclination of the plane can be derived solely from the data, and\nverify that the best-fit value is consistent with the known magnetic\ninclination.

These require changes both in the liveness analysis itself\nand in the design of the garbage collector.\n  To show the effectiveness of our method, we implemented a copying collector\nthat uses the results of the liveness analysis to preserve live objects, both\nevaluated (i.e., in WHNF) and closures. Our experiments confirm that for\nprograms running with a liveness-based garbage collector, there is a\nsignificant decrease in peak memory requirements. In addition, a sizable\nreduction in the number of collections ensures that in spite of using a more\ncomplex garbage collector, the execution times of programs running with\nliveness and reachability-based collectors remain comparable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2016 06:40:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 10:53:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-03"}

We find that the disk lifetimes of\ntypical pre-stellar cores are around 2--4 million years (Myr).

Relating the flow on these planets to perturbations in their density\nfield is key to the analysis of the gravity measurements expected from both the\nJuno (Jupiter) and Cassini (Saturn) spacecrafts during 2016-17. Both missions\nwill provide latitude-dependent gravity fields, which in principle could be\ninverted to calculate the vertical structure of the observed cloud-level zonal\nflow on these planets. Theories to date connecting the gravity field and the\nflow structure have been limited to potential theories under a barotropic\nassumption, or estimates based on thermal wind balance that allow analyzing\nbaroclinic wind structures, but have made simplifying assumptions. Those\ninclude the effects of the deviations from spherical symmetry, the centrifugal\nforce due to density perturbations, and self-gravitational effects of the\ndensity perturbations. Recent studies attempted to include some effects but not\nin a self-consistent manner. The present study introduces such a\nself-consistent perturbation approach to the thermal wind balance that\nincorporates all physical effects, and applies it to several example wind\nstructures, both barotropic and baroclinic. The contribution of each term is\nanalyzed, and the results are compared in the barotropic limit to those of\npotential theory. It is found that the dominant balance involves the original\nsimplified thermal wind approach. This balance produces a good\norder-of-magnitude estimate of the gravitational moments, and is able,\ntherefore, to address the order one question of how deep the flows are given\nmeasurements of gravitational moments. The additional terms are significantly\nsmaller and none of these terms is dominant, so any approximation attempting to\nimprove over the simplified thermal wind approach needs to include all other\nterms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2016 06:57:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2016 10:12:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

We consider a dielectric plate separated from a dielectric\nhalf-space by a vacuum gap, both media being similar. We consider the following\ncategories: (1) Making use of the statistical mechanical method developed by\nH{\\o}ye and Brevik (1998), implying that the quantized electromagnetic field is\nreplaced by interaction between dipole moments oscillating in harmonic\npotentials, we first verify that the Casimir force is in agreement with the\nDrude prediction.

With the plasma relation the reflection coefficient for TE zero\nfrequency modes depend on the component of the wave vector parallel to the\nsurfaces and lies between 0 and 1.

With the plasma\nmodel magnetic fields, except for a small part, can not pass through metals.\ni.e.~metals effectively become superconductors.

The main goal of this work is to\nunderstand a certain deformation of the commutative product on the symmetric\ntensor algebra over a given (locally convex) Lie algebra in a topological\nsetting. Therefore, the tensor algebra over the Lie algebra is topologized in a\nlocally convex manner. This finally provides a new example of a strict\ndeformation quantization, i.e. a continuous star product. The related formal\nstar product was found by Simone Gutt and is therefore called the Gutt star\nproduct. Together with this star product, the symmetric tensor algebra is\nisomorphic to the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra. Hence, this\nwork also presents an explicit locally convex topology on the universal\nenveloping algebra of certain locally convex Lie algebras.

The paper deals\nwith approximation of the covariance matrix of the field being observed with\nthe help of covariance matrix of a multiply connected (m-connected) Markov\nfield. Using computer simulation, the accuracy of such replacements at\ndifferent values of the connectivity coefficient m for the problem of\nparametric identification of deterministic component of the field has been\nstudied. Various models of deterministic polynomial component of the field and\na number of covariance functions that are often used as a mathematical model of\nreal random noise and measurements noise have been reviewed.

Due to its zero topological number ($Q=0$) and doughnut-like\nstructure, the skyrmionium has its distinctive characteristics as compared to\nthe skyrmion with $Q=\\pm 1$. Here we systematically study the generation,\nmanipulation and motion of a skyrmionium in ultrathin magnetic nanostructures\nby applying a magnetic field or a spin-polarized current. It is found that the\nskyrmionium moves faster than the skyrmion when they are driven by the\nout-of-plane current, and their velocity difference is proportional to the\ndriving force.

The Au/Ge(100) system in particular is the\nsubject of controversy as to whether the Au-induced nanowires do indeed host\nexotic, 1D metallic states. We report on a thorough study of the electronic\nproperties of high quality nanowires formed at the Au/Ge(100) surface. High\nresolution ARPES data show the low-lying Au-induced electronic states to\npossess a dispersion relation that depends on two orthogonal directions in\nk-space. Comparison of the E(k$_x$,k$_y$) surface measured using ARPES to\ntight-binding calculations yields hopping parameters in the two different\ndirections that differ by a factor of two. We find that the larger of the two\nhopping parameters corresponds, in fact, to the direction perpendicular to the\nnanowires (t$_{\\perp}$). This, the topology of the $E$=$E_F$ contour in\nk$_{\\||}$, and the fact that $t_{\\||}$/$t_{\\perp}\\sim 0.5$ proves that the\nAu-induced electron pockets possess a 2D, closed Fermi surface, this firmly\nplaces the Au/Ge(100) nanowire system outside being a potential hosts of a\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquid. We combine these ARPES data with STS measurements of\nthe spatially-resolved electronic structure and find that the spatially\nstraight conduction channels observed up to energies of order one electron volt\nbelow the Fermi level do not originate from the Au-induced states seen in the\nARPES data. The former are more likely to be associated with bulk Ge states\nthat are localized to the subsurface region. Despite our proof of the 2D nature\nof the Au-induced nanowire and sub-surface Ge-related states, an anomalous\nsuppression of the density of states at the Fermi level is observed in both the\nSTS and ARPES data, this phenomenon is discussed in the light of the effects of\ndisorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2016 13:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

In this work, we show\nthat: 1) if $G$ is planar and has no $C_4$ as subgraph, and $H$ is a linear\nspanning forest of $G$, then $CBC_2(G,H)\\leq 7$; 2) if $G$ is a plane graph\nhaving no two 3-faces sharing an edge, and $H$ is a matching of $G$, then\n$CBC_2(G,H)\\leq 6$; and 3) if $G$ is planar and has no $C_4$ nor $C_5$ as\nsubgraph, and $H$ is a mathing of $G$, then $CBC_2(G,H)\\leq 5$. These results\npartially answer questions posed by Broersma, Fujisawa and Yoshimoto (2003),\nand by Broersma, Fomin and Golovach (2007). It also points towards a positive\nanswer for the Steinberg's Conjecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2016 13:50:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-21"}

This deterministic finite\npath is the shortest path that leads out of a given environment from any\nstarting point. There are some worst case positions where the full path length\nis required. Up to now such a fixed ultimate optimal escape path for a known\nshape for any starting position is only known for some special convex shapes\n(i.e., circles, strips of a given width, fat convex bodies, some isosceles\ntriangles). Therefore, we introduce a different, simple and intuitive escape\npath, the so-called certificate path. This escape path depends on the starting\nposition s and takes the distances from s to the outer boundary of the\nenvironment into account. Due to the additional information, the certificate\npath always (for any position s) leaves the environment earlier than the\nultimate escape path, in the above convex examples. Next we assume that fewer\ninformation is available. Neither the precise shape of the envir- onment, nor\nthe location of the starting point is known. For a class of environments\n(convex shapes and shapes with kernel positions), we design an online strategy\nthat always leaves the environment. We show that the path length for leaving\nthe environment is always shorter than 3.318764 the length of the corresponding\ncertificate path. We also give a lower bound of 3.313126, which shows that for\nthe above class of environments the factor 3.318764 is (almost) tight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2016 14:21:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-21"}

Based on\nthese high temperatures, as well as previous measurements of UV variability and\nUV luminosity, and the large amplitude of X-ray flickering in 4 Dra, we\nconclude that all five sources are accretion-powered through predominantly\noptically thick boundary layers. Our X-ray data allow us to observe a small,\noptically thin portion of the emission from these boundary layers. Given the\ntime between previous observations and these observations, we find that the\nintrinsic X-ray flux and the intervening absorbing column can vary by factors\nof three or more on a time scale of years. However, the location of the\nabsorber and the relationship between changes in accretion rate and absorption\nare still elusive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2016 14:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

As a star evolves, the planet orbits change with time due to tidal\ninteractions, stellar mass losses, friction and gravitational drag forces, mass\naccretion and evaporation on/by the planet. Stellar rotation modifies the\nstructure of the star and therefore the way these different processes occur.\nChanges of the orbits, at their turn, have an impact on the rotation of the\nstar.\n  Aims. Models accounting in a consistent way for these interactions between\nthe orbital evolution of the planet and the evolution of the rotation of the\nstar are still missing. The present work is a first attempt to fill this gap.\n  Methods. We compute the evolution of stellar models including a comprehensive\ntreatment of rotational effects together with the evolution of planetary\norbits, so that the exchanges of angular momentum between the star and the\nplanetary orbit are treated in a self-consistent way. The evolution of the\nrotation of the star accounts for the angular momentum exchange with the planet\nand also follows the effects of the internal transport of angular momentum and\nchemicals.\n  Results. We show that rotating stellar models without tidal interactions can\nwell reproduce the surface rotations of the bulk of the red giants. However,\nmodels without any interactions cannot account for fast rotating red giants in\nthe upper part of the red giant branch, where, such models, whatever the\ninitial rotation considered on the ZAMS, always predict very low velocities.\nFor those stars some interaction with a companion is highly probable and the\npresent rotating stellar models with planets confirm that tidal interaction can\nreproduce their high surface velocities. We show also that the minimum distance\nbetween the planet and the star on the ZAMS that will allow the planet to avoid\nengulfment and survive is decreased around faster rotating stars.
