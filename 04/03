We study the properties of filamentary structures from the\nATLASGAL survey.\n  Methods. We use the DisPerSE algorithm to identify spatially coherent\nstructures located across the inner-Galaxy (300 < l < 60 and |b| < 1.5).\n  Results. We have determined distances, masses and physical sizes for 241 of\nthe filamentary structures. We find a median distance of 3.8 kpc, a mean mass\nof a few 10^3 m_sun, a mean length of ~6pc and a mass-to-length ratio of (M/L)\n~200-2000M_sun/ pc. We also find that these filamentary structures are tightly\ncorrelated with the spiral arms in longitude and velocity, and that their\nsemi-major axis is preferentially aligned parallel to the Galactic mid-plane\nand therefore with the direction of large-scale Galactic magnetic field. We\nfind many examples where the dense filaments identified in ATLASGAL are\nassociated with larger scale filamentary structures (~100 pc), and argue that\nthis is likely to be common, and as such these may indicate a connection\nbetween large-scale Galactic dynamics and star formation.\n  Conclusions. We have produced a large and Galaxy-wide catalogue of dense\nfilamentary structures that are representative of a particular size and mass\nrange not previously well studied in the literature. Analyses of the properties\nand distribution of these filaments reveals that they are correlated with the\nspiral arms and make a significant contribution to star formation in the\nGalaxy. Massive star formation is ongoing within ~20% of the filaments and is\nstrongly correlated with the filaments with the largest mass-to- length ratios.\nThe luminosity of the embedded sources has a similar distribution to the\nGalactic-wide samples of young massive stars and can therefore be considered to\nbe representative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2016 19:05:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 May 2016 13:04:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2016 19:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

Traditional electronic EM wave\nsensors use large metallic probes which distort the field to be measured and\nalso have strict limitations on the detectable RF bandwidth. To address these\nproblems, integrated photonic EM wave sensors have been developed to provide\nhigh sensitivity and broad bandwidth. Previously we demonstrated a compact,\nbroadband, and sensitive integrated photonic EM wave sensor, consisting of an\norganic electro-optic (EO) polymer refilled silicon slot photonic crystal\nwaveguide (PCW) modulator integrated with a gold bowtie antenna, to detect the\nX band of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, due to the relative large RC\nconstant of the silicon PCW, such EM wave sensors can only work up to tens of\nGHz. In this work, we present a detailed design and discussion of a new\ngeneration of EM wave sensors based on EO polymer refilled plasmonic slot\nwaveguides in conjunction with bowtie antennas to cover a wider electromagnetic\nspectrum from 1 GHz up to 10THz, including the range of microwave, millimeter\nwave and even terahertz waves. This antenna-coupled plasmonic-organic hybrid\n(POH) structure is designed to provide an ultra-small RC constant, a large\noverlap between plasmonic mode and RF field, and strong electric field\nenhancement, as well as negligible field perturbation. A taper is designed to\nbridge silicon strip waveguide to plasmonic slot waveguide. Simulation results\nshow that our device can have an EM wave sensing ability up to 10 THz. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first POH device for photonic terahertz wave\ndetection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2016 22:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

In this paper we propose a new online\nthroughput-optimal broadcast algorithm which makes packet-by-packet scheduling\nand routing decisions, obviating the need for maintaining any global\ntopological structures, such as spanning-trees. Our algorithm relies on\nsystem-state information for making transmission decisions and hence, may be\nthought of as a generalization of the well-known back-pressure algorithm which\nmakes point-to-point unicast transmission decisions based on queue-length\ninformation, without requiring knowledge of end-to-end paths. Technically, the\nback-pressure algorithm is derived by stochastically stabilizing the\nnetwork-queues. However, because of packet-duplications associated with\nbroadcast, the work-conservation principle is violated and queuing processes\nare difficult to define in the broadcast problem. To address this fundamental\nissue, we identify certain state-variables which behave like virtual queues in\nthe broadcast setting. By stochastically stabilizing these virtual queues, we\ndevise a throughput-optimal broadcast policy.

Twinning deformation typically involves the kinetics of stacking\nfaults, its interaction with dislocations, and dislocation - twin boundary\ninteractions. While the latter has been intensively investigated, the dynamics\nof stacking faults has been less known. In this work, we report several new\ninsights on the stacking fault behavior in twin induced plasticity from our\nmeta-atom molecular dynamics simulation: The stacking fault interactions are\ndominated by dislocation reactions taking place spontaneously, different from\nthe proposed mechanism in literatures; The competition among generating a\nsingle stacking fault, a twinning partial and a trailing partial dislocation is\ndependent on a unique parameter, i.e. stacking fault energy, which in turn\ndetermines deformation twinning behaviors. The complex twin-slip and\ntwin-dislocation interactions demonstrate the dual role of deformation twins as\nboth dislocation barrier and storage, potentially contributing to the high\nstrength and ductility of advanced materials like TWIP steels where deformation\ntwinning dominated plasticity accounts for the superb strength-ductility\ncombination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 2016 01:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-05"}

The first\nis a contribution in the study of complex networks. We propose preferential\nattachment model with degree bound for the first time. In the normal\npreferential attachment model, the degree distribution follows a power law,\nwith many nodes of low degree and a few nodes of high degree. In our scheme,\nthe nodes can have a maximum degree $d_{\\max}$, where $d_{\\max}$ is an integer\nchosen according to the application. The second is in the security of wireless\nsensor networks.

The important features of this model are that the network is fully\nconnected, it has fewer keys, has larger size of the giant component and lower\naverage path length compared with traditional key predistribution schemes and\ncomparable resilience to random node attacks.\n  We argue that in many networks like key predistribution and Internet of\nThings, having nodes of very high degree will be a bottle-neck in\ncommunication.

Although the latest Region\nProposal Network method gets promising detection accuracy with several hundred\nproposals, it still struggles in small-size object detection and precise\nlocalization (e.g., large IoU thresholds), mainly due to the coarseness of its\nfeature maps. In this paper, we present a deep hierarchical network, namely\nHyperNet, for handling region proposal generation and object detection jointly.\nOur HyperNet is primarily based on an elaborately designed Hyper Feature which\naggregates hierarchical feature maps first and then compresses them into a\nuniform space. The Hyper Features well incorporate deep but highly semantic,\nintermediate but really complementary, and shallow but naturally\nhigh-resolution features of the image, thus enabling us to construct HyperNet\nby sharing them both in generating proposals and detecting objects via an\nend-to-end joint training strategy. For the deep VGG16 model, our method\nachieves completely leading recall and state-of-the-art object detection\naccuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 using only 100 proposals per image.

The attractor obtained\nwith the PS algorithm matches the attractor obtained by integrating the system\nwith the parameter replaced by the averaged value of the switched parameter\nvalues.

In this way, every stable cycle of the HP system can be\napproximated if its underlying parameter value equalizes the average value of\nthe switching values.

Then, it was observed by Metcalfe et al. at\nBohyunsan Optical Astronomy Observatory and McDonald Observatory respectively\nfor 7 nights in 2004.

We evolve grids of\nwhite dwarf models by \\texttt{MESA}. Cores, added with He/C envelopes, of those\nwhite dwarf models are inserted into \\texttt{WDEC} to evolve grids of DBV star\nmodels. With those DBV star models, we calculate eigenperiods. Those calculated\nperiods are used to fit observed periods. A best-fitting model is selected.

Detection of the oil spill is performed using\nchange detection algorithms between imagery acquired at different times. The\nspecific algorithms used are the correlation coefficient change statistic and\nthe intensity ratio change statistic algorithms. Therefore these algorithms and\nthe probabilistic selection of the threshold criteria is reviewed and\ndiscussed. A recently offered change detection method which depends on the idea\nof generating two different final change maps of two images in a sequence, is\nused. First final change map is obtained by cumulatively adding the sequences\nof change maps in such a manner that common change areas are excluded and\nuncommon change areas are included. The second final change map is obtained by\ncomparing the first and the last images in the temporal sequence. This method\nrequires at least three images to be employed and can be generalized to longer\ntemporal image sequences. The purpose of this approach is to provide a double\ncheck mechanism to the conventional approach and thus to reduce the probability\nof false alarm and enhance the change detection. The algorithms mentioned are\napplied to a 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill imagery together with the method\ndescribed. It is shown that intensity ratio change statistic is a better tool\nfor identification of the changes due to the oil spill compared to the\ncorrelation coefficient change statistic.

In the case of\ndistributed consensus algorithms, this approach is adapted to enhance its\nconvergence rate to the equilibrium. In previous studies within this context,\nconstant diffusion parameter is considered for obtaining the diffusion\nequations. This is equivalent to assigning a constant weight to all edges of\nthe underlying graph in the consensus algorithm. Here, by relaxing this\nrestricting assumption, a spatially-variable diffusion parameter is considered\nand by optimizing the obtained system, it is shown that significant\nimprovements are achievable in terms of the convergence rate of the obtained\nspatially-continuous system. As a result of approximation, the system is\ndivided into two sections, namely, the spatially-continuous path branches and\nthe lattice core which connects these branches at one end. The optimized\nweights and diffusion parameter for each of these sections are optimal\nindividually but considering the whole system, they are suboptimal.

The stochastic\nnature of wireless channels in general gives rise to a time varying\ntransmission rate. In such an environment, interference is increasingly\nbecoming a key constraint. Obtaining an expressive model for offered service of\nsuch channels has major implications in the design and optimization of future\nnetworks. However, interference channels are not well-understood with respect\nto their higher layer performance. The particular difficulty for handling\ninterference channels arises from the superposition of random fading processes\nfor the signals of the transmitters involved (i.e., for the signal of interest\nand for the signals of the interferers). Starting from the distribution of the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), we derive a statistical\ncharacterization of the underlying service process in terms of its Mellin\ntransform. Then, we adapt a recent stochastic network calculus approach for\nfading channels to derive measures of the queuing performance of single- and\nmulti-hop wireless interference networks. Special cases of our solution include\nnoise-limited and interference-limited systems. A key finding of our analysis\nis that for a given average signal and average sum interference power, the\nperformance of interfered systems not only depends on the relative strength of\nthe sum interference with respect to the signal-of-interest power, but also on\nthe interference structure (i.e., the number of interferers) as well as the\nabsolute levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 2016 13:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-05"}

We find that a flat spectrum, as observed in about half of\nRQ AGN, can be produced by corona with a disc or a spherical configuration,\nwhich extends from the innermost regions out to a pc scale. A spectral break to\nan optically thin power-law emission is expected around 300-1000 GHz, as the\ninnermost corona becomes optically thin.

A lower bound of\n{\\Omega}(1/{\\epsilon} + log W) memory bits for W{\\epsilon}-additive\napproximations is derived. This is followed by an algorithm whose memory\nconsumption is O(1/{\\epsilon} + log W) bits, indicating that the algorithm is\noptimal and that the bound is tight. Next, the more general problem of\nmaintaining a sum of the last W integers, each in the range of {0,1,...,R}, is\naddressed. The paper shows that approximating the sum within an additive error\nof RW{\\epsilon} can also be done using {\\Theta}(1/{\\epsilon} + log W) bits for\n{\\epsilon}={\\Omega}(1/W).

The\ncomposite materials have complex nature which posses the nonlinear relationship\namong heat treatment, processing parameters, and composition and affects their\nmechanical properties. These nonlinear relation ships with properties can more\nefficiently be modeled by ANNs. Neural networks modeling needs sufficient data\nbase consisting of mechanical properties, chemical composition and processing\nparameters. Such data base is not available for modeling. Therefore, a large\nrange of experimental work was carried out for the development of aluminum\ncomposite materials. Alloys containing Cu, Mg and Zn as matrix were reinforced\nwith 1- 15% Al2O3 particles using stir casting method. Alloys composites were\ncast in a metal mold. More than eighty standard samples were prepared for\ntensile tests. Sixty samples were given solution treatments at 580oC for half\nan hour and tempered at 120oC for 24 hours. The samples were characterized to\ninvestigate mechanical properties using Scanning Electron Microscope, X-Ray\nSpectrometer, Optical Metallurgical Microscope, Vickers Hardness, Universal\nTesting Machine and Abrasive Wear Testing Machine. A MLP (Multilayer\nPerceptron) feedforward was developed and used for modeling purpose. Training,\ntesting and validation of the model were carried out using back propagation\nlearning algorithm. The modeling results show that an architecture of 14 inputs\nwith 9 hidden neurons and 4 outputs which includes the tensile strength,\nelongation, hardness and abrasive wear resistance gives reasonably accurate\nresults with an error within the range of 2-7 % in training, testing and\nvalidation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Apr 2016 20:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}
