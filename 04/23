However, the problem of finding\nthe true global ground state of a lattice model, which is essential for all of\nthe aforementioned applications, has remained unresolved, with only a limited\nnumber of results for highly simplified systems known. In this article, we\npresent the first general algorithm to find the exact ground states of complex\nlattice models and to prove their global optimality, resolving this fundamental\nproblem in condensed matter and materials theory. We transform the\ninfinite-discrete-optimization problem into a pair of combinatorial\noptimization (MAX-SAT) and non-smooth convex optimization (MAX-MIN) problems,\nwhich provide upper and lower bounds on the ground state energy respectively.\nBy systematically converging these bounds to each other, we find and prove the\nexact ground state of realistic Hamiltonians whose solutions are completely\nintractable via traditional methods. Considering that currently such\nHamiltonians are solved using simulated annealing and genetic algorithms that\nare often unable to find the true global energy minimum, and never able to\nprove the optimality of their result, our work opens the door to resolving\nlong-standing uncertainties in lattice models of physical phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2016 16:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Semi-dilute solutions are characterized by large fluctuations in\nconcentration, wherein polymer coils interpenetrate but may not be\ntopologically entangled at equilibrium. In non-equilibrium flows, it is\ngenerally thought that polymer chains can self-entangle in semi-dilute\nsolutions, thereby leading to entanglements in solutions that are nominally\nunentangled at equilibrium. Despite recent progress, we still lack a complete\nmolecular-level understanding of these dynamics. In this work, we use single\nmolecule techniques to study the dynamics of semi-dilute solutions of DNA in\nplanar extensional flow, including polymer relaxation from high stretch,\ntransient stretching dynamics in step-strain experiments, and steady-state\nstretching in flow. Our results are consistent with a power-law scaling of the\nlongest polymer relaxation time in semi-dilute solutions, revealing an\neffective excluded volume exponent $\\nu$ = 0.56. We further studied the\nnon-equilibrium stretching dynamics in extensional flow, with results showing a\ndecrease in transient polymer stretch at moderate Weissenberg number and a\nmilder coil-to-stretch transition in semi-dilute solutions compared to dilute\nsolutions. Interestingly, a unique set of molecular conformations during the\ntransient stretching process for single polymers in semi-dilute solutions is\nobserved, which suggests transient stretching pathways for polymer chains in\nsemi-dilute solutions are qualitatively different than dilute solutions due to\nintermolecular interactions. Taken together, this work provides a molecular\nframework for understanding the non-equilibrium stretching dynamics of\nsemi-dilute solutions in strong flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Apr 2016 17:19:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Dec 2016 18:24:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-03"}

With AU-level spatial\nresolution, we first establish characteristic sizes of the infrared emission\nusing a simple geometrical model consisting of a hot inner rim and mid-infrared\ndisk emission. We find a high degree of correlation between the stellar\nluminosity and the mid-infrared disk sizes after using near-infrared data to\nremove the contribution from the inner rim.

Such spinors are reducible, and contain also\n(j,0)+(0,j)-pure spin representation spaces. The 2(2j+1) degrees of freedom of\nthe latter are identified by a projector given by the n-fold direct product of\nthe covariant parity projector within the Dirac spinor space. Considering\ntotally symmetric tensor spinors one is left with the expected number of\n2(2j+1) independent degrees of freedom. The BW projector is of the order\n$\\partial ^{2j}$ in the derivatives, and so are the related spin-j wave\nequations and associated Lagrangians. High order differential equations can not\nbe consistently gauged, and allow several unphysical aspects, such as\nnon-locality, acausality, ghosts and etc to enter the theory. In order to avoid\nthese difficulties we here suggest a strategy of replacing the high order of\nthe BW wave equations by the universal second order. To do so we replaced the\nBW projector by one of zeroth order in the derivatives. We built it up from one\nof the Casimir invariants of the Lorentz group when exclusively acting on\nspaces of internal spin degrees of freedom. This projector allows one to\nidentify anyone of the irreducible sectors of the primordial rank-2j spinor, in\nparticular (j,0)+(0,j), and without any reference to the external space-time\nand the four-momentum. The dynamics is then introduced by requiring the (j,0)+\n(0,j) sector to satisfy the Klein-Gordon equation.

We begin with the old\nobservation that, in compressible states, the composite fermion in the lowest\nLandau level should be viewed as a charge-neutral particle carrying vorticity.\nThis leads to the absence of a Chern-Simons term in the effective theory of the\nCFL. We argue here that instead a Berry curvature should be enclosed by the\nfermi surface of composite fermions, with the total Berry phase fixed by the\nfilling fraction $\\phi_B=-2\\pi\\nu$. We illustrate this point with the CFL of\nfermions at filling fractions $\\nu=1/2q$ and (single and two-component) bosons\nat $\\nu=1/(2q+1)$. The Berry phase leads to sharp consequences in the transport\nproperties including thermal and spin Hall conductances, which in the RPA\napproximation are distinct from the standard Halperin-Lee-Read predictions. We\nemphasize that these results only rely on the LLL limit, and do not require\nparticle-hole symmetry, which is present microscopically only for fermions at\n$\\nu=1/2$. Nevertheless, we show that the existing LLL theory of the composite\nfermi liquid for bosons at $\\nu=1$ does have an emergent particle-hole\nsymmetry. We interpret this particle-hole symmetry as a transformation between\nthe empty state at $\\nu=0$ and the boson integer quantum hall state at $\\nu=2$.\nThis understanding enables us to define particle-hole conjugates of various\nbosonic quantum Hall states which we illustrate with the bosonic Jain and\nPfaffian states. The bosonic particle-hole symmetry can be realized exactly on\nthe surface of a three-dimensional boson topological insulator.

More surprisingly, we find that the smallest\nresolvable parameter of a simple split detector scales as the inverse of the\nnumber of biphotons for small biphoton number (\"Heisenberg scaling\"), because\nthe Fisher information diverges as the parameter to be estimated decreases in\nvalue. One usually sees this scaling only for systems with many entangled\ndegrees of freedom. We discuss the transition for the split-detection scheme to\nthe standard quantum limit scaling for imperfect correlations as the biphoton\nnumber is increased. An analysis of an $N$-pixel detector is also given to\ninvestigate the benefit of using a higher resolution detector. The physical\nlimit of these metrology schemes is determined by the uncertainty in the birth\nzone of the biphoton in the nonlinear crystal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2016 03:30:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2016 21:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

The calculations demonstrate the concept of\nenhancing the electronic coupling, and hence the stability, by exploring the\nstabilizing features of \\ce{CH3PH3+}, \\ce{CH3SH2+}, and \\ce{SH3+} cations,\namong several other possible candidates. Chemical stability enhancement hence\nresults from a strong, yet balanced, electronic coupling between the cation and\nthe halides in the octahedron. This shall unlock the hindering instability\nproblem for PSCs and allow them to hit the market as a serious low-cost\ncompetitor to silicon based solar cell technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2016 07:52:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-26"}

The\nquantity of interest is T, the time to reach consensus , i.e. the number of\ninteractions needed for all vertices have the same colour.\n  An edge whose endpoint colours differ (i.e. one vertex is coloured red and\nthe other one blue) is said to be discordant. A vertex is discordant if its is\nincident with a discordant edge. In discordant voting, all interactions are\nbased on discordant edges. Because the voting process is asynchronous there are\nseveral ways to update the colours of the interacting vertices.

We discuss how mass affects the thermal state\nof the intracluster or the intragroup medium, specifically as to their entropy\nlevels and radial profiles. We show that entropy is produced in both cases by\nthe continuing inflow of intergalactic gas across the system boundary into the\ngravitational potential well. The inflow is highly supersonic in clusters, but\nweakly so in groups. The former condition implies strong accretion shocks with\nsubstantial conversion of a large inflow kinetic into thermal energy, whereas\nthe latter condition implies less effective conversion of lower energies. These\nfeatures produce a conspicuous difference in entropy deposition at the current\nboundary. Thereafter, adiabatic compression of the hot gas into the potential\nwell converts such time histories into radial profiles throughout a cluster or\na group. In addition, in both cases a location of the system at low z in the\naccelerating universe or in a poor environment will starve out the inflow and\nthe entropy production, and produce flattening or even bending down of the\nouter profile. We analyze in detail the sharp evidence provided by the two\ngroups ESO 3060170 and RXJ1159+5531 that have been recently observed in X rays\nout to their virial radii, and find a close and detailed match with our\nexpectations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Apr 2016 15:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}
