However the method is known to be\nhighly sensitive to initial seed selection of cluster centers. K-means++ has\nbeen proposed to overcome this problem and has been shown to have better\naccuracy and computational efficiency than k-means. In many clustering problems\nthough -such as when classifying georeferenced data for mapping applications-\nstandardization of clustering methodology, specifically, the ability to arrive\nat the same cluster assignment for every run of the method i.e. replicability\nof the methodology, may be of greater significance than any perceived measure\nof accuracy, especially when the solution is known to be non-unique, as in the\ncase of k-means clustering. Here we propose a simple initial seed selection\nalgorithm for k-means clustering along one attribute that draws initial cluster\nboundaries along the 'deepest valleys' or greatest gaps in dataset. Thus, it\nincorporates a measure to maximize distance between consecutive cluster centers\nwhich augments the conventional k-means optimization for minimum distance\nbetween cluster center and cluster members. Unlike existing initialization\nmethods, no additional parameters or degrees of freedom are introduced to the\nclustering algorithm. This improves the replicability of cluster assignments by\nas much as 100% over k-means and k-means++, virtually reducing the variance\nover different runs to zero, without introducing any additional parameters to\nthe clustering process.

However, many TMD materials with extremely large\nIsing SOC, in the order of a few hundred meV, are not superconducting. In this\nwork, we show that TMD materials can induce strong Ising SOC on ordinary\n$s$-wave superconductors through proximity effect. By solving the\nself-consistent gap equation of the TMD/superconductor heterostructure, we\nfound that the $H_{c2}$ of the $s$-wave superconductor can be strongly\nenhanced.

Nevertheless, the timescales and\nenergetics of the events have lead to many theories associating FRBs with young\nneutron stars. Motivated by this, I explore the interaction of FRBs with young\nsupernova remnants (SNRs), and I discuss the potential observational\nconsequences and constraints of such a scenario. As the SN ejecta plows into\nthe interstellar medium (ISM), a reverse shock is generated that passes back\nthrough the material and ionizes it. This leads to a dispersion measure (DM)\nassociated with the SNR as well as a time derivative for DM. Times when DM is\nhigh are generally overshadowed by free-free absorption, which, depending on\nthe mass of the ejecta and the density of the ISM, may be probed at frequencies\nof $400\\,{\\rm MHz}$ to $1.4\\,{\\rm GHz}$ on timescales of $\\sim100-500\\,{\\rm\nyrs}$ after the SN. Magnetic fields generated at the reverse shock may be high\nenough to explain Faraday rotation that has been measured for one FRB. If FRBs\nare powered by the spin energy of a young NS (rather than magnetic energy), the\nNS must have a magnetic field $\\lesssim10^{11}-10^{12}\\,{\\rm G}$ to ensure that\nit does not spin down too quickly while the SNR is still optically thick at\nradio frequencies. In the future, once there are distance measurements to FRBs\nand their energetics are better understood, the spin of the NS can also be\nconstrained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2016 18:54:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2016 20:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

Based on this observation, we suppose that, in the sector responsible\nfor low-energy R symmetry breaking, a discrete R symmetry remains preserved at\nhigh energies and only becomes dynamically broken at relatively late times in\nthe cosmological evolution, i.e., after the dynamical breaking of SUSY. Prior\nto R symmetry breaking, the Universe is then bound to be in a quasi-de Sitter\nphase---which offers a dynamical explanation for the occurrence of cosmic\ninflation. This scenario yields a new perspective on the interplay between SUSY\nbreaking and inflation, which neatly fits into the paradigm of high-scale SUSY:\ninflation is driven by the SUSY-breaking vacuum energy density, while the\nchiral field responsible for SUSY breaking, the Polonyi field, serves as the\ninflaton. Because R symmetry is broken only after inflation, slow-roll\ninflation is not spoiled by otherwise dangerous gravitational corrections in\nsupergravity. We illustrate our idea by means of a concrete example, in which\nboth SUSY and R symmetry are broken by strong gauge dynamics and in which\nlate-time R symmetry breaking is triggered by a small inflaton field value. In\nthis model, the scales of inflation and SUSY breaking are unified; the\ninflationary predictions are similar to those of F-term hybrid inflation in\nsupergravity; reheating proceeds via gravitino decay at temperatures consistent\nwith thermal leptogenesis; and the sparticle mass spectrum follows from pure\ngravity mediation. Dark matter consists of thermally produced winos with a mass\nin the TeV range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2016 19:07:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

Despite\nan initial response to therapy, drug resistance remains a problem for some CML\npatients. Recent studies have shown that resistance mutations that preexist\ntreatment can be detected in a substan- tial number of patients, and that this\nmay be associated with eventual treatment failure. One proposed method to\nextend treatment efficacy is to use a combination of multiple targeted\ntherapies. However, the design of such combination therapies (timing, sequence,\netc.) remains an open challenge. In this work we mathematically model the\ndynamics of CML response to combination therapy and analyze the impact of\ncombination treatment schedules on treatment efficacy in patients with\npreexisting resistance. We then propose an optimization problem to find the\nbest schedule of multiple therapies based on the evolution of CML according to\nour ordinary differential equation model. This resulting optimiza- tion problem\nis nontrivial due to the presence of ordinary different equation constraints\nand integer variables. Our model also incorporates realistic drug toxicity\nconstraints by tracking the dynamics of patient neutrophil counts in response\nto therapy. Using realis- tic parameter estimates, we determine optimal\ncombination strategies that maximize time until treatment failure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2016 19:16:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

In this region the evolution of binaries is dominated by\nperturbations from the central SMBH. In particular, as first pointed out by\nAntonini and Perets, the Kozai-Lidov (KL) mechanism trades relative inclination\nof the BHB to the SMBH for eccentricity of the BHB, and for some orientations\ncan bring the BHB to an eccentricity near unity. At very high eccentricities,\nGW emission from the BHB can become efficient, causing the members of the BHB\nto coalesce. We use a novel combination of two N-body codes to follow this\nevolution. We are forced to simulate small systems to follow the behavior\naccurately. We have completed 400 simulations that range from $\\sim$ 300 stars\naround a $10^{3}$ M$_{\\odot}$ black hole to $\\sim$ 4500 stars around a $10^{4}$\nM$_{\\odot}$ black hole. These simulations are the first to follow the internal\norbit of a binary near a SMBH while also following the changes to its external\norbit self-consistently. We find that this mechanism could produce mergers at a\nmaximum rate per volume of $\\sim 100$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ or considerably less\nif the inclination oscillations of the binary remain constant as the BHB\ninclination to the SMBH changes, or if the binary black hole fraction is small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 00:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}

It is devoted to an elementary and\ndetailed proof of this theorem in its natural generality, i.e. not for graphs,\nbut for matroids.\n  In contrast with usual methods, the emphasis is on the properties of maps (as\nopposed to elements) naturally associated to a matroid (or a graph) and an\norder.

A long standing challenge for\nspasers is their poor coupling to the far-field radiation. Unlike conventional\nlasers that could produce directional beams, spasers have highly divergent\nradiation patterns due to their subwavelength apertures. Here, we theoretically\nand experimentally demonstrate a new technique for implementing\ndistributed-feedback (DFB) that is distinct from any other previously utilized\nDFB schemes for semiconductor lasers. The so-termed antenna-feedback scheme\nleads to single-mode operation in plasmonic lasers, couples the resonant SPP\nmode to a highly directional far-field radiation pattern, and integrates hybrid\nSPPs in surrounding medium into the operation of the DFB lasers.\nExperimentally, the antenna-feedback method, which does not require the phase\nmatching to a well-defined effective index, is implemented for terahertz QCLs,\nand single-mode terahertz QCLs with beam divergence as small as 4 x 4 degree\nare demonstrated, which is the narrowest beam reported for any terahertz QCL\nto-date.

The notion of an element of a subset has as its dual\nthe notion of a distinction of a partition (a pair of elements in different\nblocks). Boole developed finite logical probability as the normalized counting\nmeasure on elements of subsets so there is a dual concept of logical entropy\nwhich is the normalized counting measure on distinctions of partitions. Thus\nthe logical notion of information is a measure of distinctions. Classical\nlogical entropy also extends naturally to the notion of quantum logical entropy\nwhich provides a more natural and informative alternative to the usual Von\nNeumann entropy in quantum information theory. The quantum logical entropy of a\npost-measurement density matrix has the simple interpretation as the\nprobability that two independent measurements of the same state using the same\nobservable will have different results.

This is\ncontrary to the expectation from a unitary evolution in quantum theory and\nleads to (a version of) the black hole information paradox. Classically,\nnothing else, apart from mass, charge and angular momentum is expected to be\nrevealed to such asymptotic observers after the formation of a black hole.\nSemi-classically, black holes evaporate after their formation through the\nHawking radiation. The dominant part of the radiation is expected to be thermal\nand hence one cannot know anything about the initial data from the resultant\nradiation. However, there can be sources of distortions which make the\nradiation non-thermal. Although the distortions are not strong enough to make\nthe evolution unitary, these distortions carry some part of information\nregarding the in-state. In this work, we show how one can decipher the\ninformation about the in-state of the field from these distortions. We show\nthat the distortions of a particular kind --- which we call {\\it non-vacuum\ndistortions} --- can be used to \\emph{fully} reconstruct the initial data.

Further, using a $1+1$ dimensional CGHS model to\naccommodate back-reaction self-consistently, we show that observers can also\ninfer and track the information content about the initial data, during the\ncourse of evaporation, unambiguously.

The Matrix-Tree theorem can be used to calculate the number of spanning\ntrees in a connected graph, and thus allows us to compute the number of ways to\nunfold the cube.

The\nexercise has been performed for the Indian stock market on daily data for two\nyears. For our analysis we map number of clusters against number of variables.\nWe then test for efficiency of clustering. Our contention is that, given a\nfixed number of variables, one of them being historic volatility of NIFTY\nreturns, if increase in the number of clusters improves clustering efficiency,\nthen volatility cannot be predicted. Volatility then becomes random as, for a\ngiven time period, it gets classified in various clusters. On the other hand,\nif efficiency falls with increase in the number of clusters, then volatility\ncan be predicted as there is some homogeneity in the data. If we fix the number\nof clusters and then increase the number of variables, this should have some\nimpact on clustering efficiency. Indeed if we can hit upon, in a sense, an\noptimum number of variables, then if the number of clusters is reasonably\nsmall, we can use these variables to predict volatility. The variables that we\nconsider for our study are volatility of NIFTY returns, volatility of gold\nreturns, India VIX, CBOE VIX, volatility of crude oil returns, volatility of\nDJIA returns, volatility of DAX returns, volatility of Hang Seng returns and\nvolatility of Nikkei returns.

An\neffective way to mitigate the ISI is using enzymes to degrade undesired\nmolecules.

For\nanonymous networks, the task of leader election is formulated as follows: every\nnode v of the network must output a simple path, which is coded as a sequence\nof port numbers, such that all these paths end at a common node, the leader. In\nthis paper, we study deterministic leader election in arbitrary anonymous\nnetworks. It is well known that leader election is impossible in some networks,\nregardless of the allocated amount of time, even if nodes know the map of the\nnetwork. However, even in networks in which it is possible to elect a leader\nknowing the map, the task may be still impossible without any knowledge,\nregardless of the allocated time. On the other hand, for any network in which\nleader election is possible knowing the map, there is a minimum time, called\nthe election index, in which this can be done. Informally, the election index\nof a network is the minimum depth at which views of all nodes are distinct. Our\naim is to establish tradeoffs between the allocated time $\\tau$ and the amount\nof information that has to be given a priori to the nodes to enable leader\nelection in time $\\tau$ in all networks for which leader election in this time\nis at all possible. Following the framework of algorithms with advice, this\ninformation is provided to all nodes at the start by an oracle knowing the\nentire network. The length of this string (its number of bits) is called the\nsize of advice. For a given time $\\tau$ allocated to leader election, we give\nupper and lower bounds on the minimum size of advice sufficient to perform\nleader election in time $\\tau$. We focus on the two sides of the time spectrum\nand give tight (or almost tight) bounds on the minimum size of advice for these\nextremes. We also show that constant advice is not sufficient for leader\nelection in all graphs, regardless of the allocated time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 07:55:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}

We aim to investigate whether a multilayer ice model can be as\nsuccessful as a bulk ice model in reproducing the observed abundances of\nvarious deuterated gas-phase species toward starless cores. Methods. We\ncalculate abundances for various deuterated species as functions of time\nadopting fixed physical conditions. We also estimate abundance gradients by\nadopting a modified Bonnor-Ebert sphere as a core model. In the multilayer ice\nscenario, we consider desorption from one or several monolayers on the surface.\nResults. We find that the multilayer model predicts abundances of $\\rm DCO^+$\nand $\\rm N_2D^+$ that are about an order of magnitude lower than observed,\ncaused by the trapping of CO and $\\rm N_2$ into the grain mantle. As a result\nof the mantle trapping, deuteration efficiency in the gas phase increases and\nwe find stronger deuterium fractionation in ammonia than what has been\nobserved. Another distinguishing feature of the multilayer model is that $\\rm\nD_3^+$ becomes the main deuterated ion at high density. The bulk ice model is\ngenerally easily reconciled with observations. Conclusions. Our results\nunderline that more theoretical and experimental work is needed to understand\nthe composition and morphology of interstellar ices, and the desorption\nprocesses that can act on them. With the current constraints, the bulk ice\nmodel appears to be better in reproducing observations than the multilayer ice\nmodel. According to our results, the $\\rm H_2D^+$ to $\\rm N_2D^+$ abundance\nratio is higher than 100 in the multilayer model, while only a few $\\times$ 10\nin the bulk model, and so observations of this ratio could provide information\non the ice morphology in starless cores.

In particular, our contribution is threefold. i) First, we propose\na time-space union signal reception model for receiving array signals, where\nthe sub-Nyquist sampling techniques and arbitrary array geometries are employed\nto decrease the time-domain sampling rate and improve the DOA estimation\naccuracy. A better joint estimation is obtained in the higher time-space union\nspace. ii) Second, two joint estimation algorithms are proposed for the\nreceiving model.

In addition, the\nnew steer vectors of the union time-space model are completely uncorrelated\nunder the limited number of sensors, which improves the estimation performance.\nFurthermore, the simulation results demonstrate that our estimates via the\nreceiver architecture associated with the proposed algorithms closely match the\nCRB according to the noise levels, the branch number and the source number as\nwell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 08:41:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Feb 2017 10:05:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

One of the proposed explanations\nof the ribbon is the mechanism of the secondary ENA emission.

Prominent vasculature-targeting\ntherapies involve functional tumour-associated blood vessel deterioration and\nnormalisation. The former aims at tumour infarction and nutrient deprivation\nmedi- ated by vascular targeting agents that induce occlusion/collapse of\ntumour blood vessels. In contrast, the therapeutic intention of normalising the\nabnormal structure and function of tumour vascular net- works, e.g. via\nalleviating stress-induced vaso-occlusion, is to improve chemo-, immuno- and\nradiation therapy efficacy. Although both strategies have shown therapeutic\npotential, it remains unclear why they often fail to control glioma invasion\ninto the surrounding healthy brain tissue. To shed light on this issue, we\npropose a mathematical model of glioma invasion focusing on the interplay\nbetween the mi- gration/proliferation dichotomy (Go-or-Grow) of glioma cells\nand modulations of the functional tumour vasculature. Vaso-modulatory\ninterventions are modelled by varying the degree of vaso-occlusion. We\ndiscovered the existence of a critical cell proliferation/diffusion ratio that\nseparates glioma invasion re- sponses to vaso-modulatory interventions into two\ndistinct regimes. While for tumours, belonging to one regime, vascular\nmodulations reduce the tumour front speed and increase the infiltration width,\nfor those in the other regime the invasion speed increases and infiltration\nwidth decreases. We show how these in silico findings can be used to guide\nindividualised approaches of vaso-modulatory treatment strategies and thereby\nimprove success rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 10:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}

The traditional computational\nquestion, that asks to compute a draw (optimal draw) that maximizes the winning\nprobability for a distinguished player, has received a lot of attention.\nPrevious works consider the problem where the pairwise winning probabilities\nare known precisely, while we study how robust is the winning probability with\nrespect to small errors in the pairwise winning probabilities. First, we\npresent several illuminating examples to establish: (a)~there exist\ndeterministic tournaments (where the pairwise winning probabilities are~0 or~1)\nwhere one optimal draw is much more robust than the other; and (b)~in general,\nthere exist tournaments with slightly suboptimal draws that are more robust\nthan all the optimal draws. The above examples motivate the study of the\ncomputational problem of robust draws that guarantee a specified winning\nprobability. Second, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for approximating\nthe robustness of a draw for sufficiently small errors in pairwise winning\nprobabilities, and obtain that the stated computational problem is NP-complete.\nWe also show that two natural cases of deterministic tournaments where the\noptimal draw could be computed in polynomial time also admit polynomial-time\nalgorithms to compute robust optimal draws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 11:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-19"}

For planets with one moon, measurements from successive\ntransits exhibit a hitherto undescribed pattern in the TTV-TDV diagram,\noriginating from the stroboscopic sampling of the planet's orbit around the\nplanet-moon barycenter. This pattern is fully determined and analytically\npredictable after three consecutive transits. The more measurements become\navailable, the more the TTV-TDV diagram approaches an ellipse. For planets with\nmultiple moons in orbital mean motion resonance (MMR), like the Galilean moons,\nthe pattern is much more complex and addressed numerically in this report.\nExomoons in MMR can also form closed, predictable TTV-TDV figures if the drift\nof the moons' pericenters is sufficiently slow. We find that MMR exomoons\nproduce loops in the TTV-TDV diagram and that the number of these loops is\nequal to the order of the MMR, or the largest integer in the MMR ratio.

Single exomoons with a 10% moon-to-planet mass ratio,\nlike to Pluto-Charon binary, can be detectable in the archival data of the\nKepler primary mission. Multi-exomoon systems, however, require either larger\ntelescopes or brighter target stars. Complementary detection methods invoking a\nmoon's own photometric transit or its orbital sampling effect can be used for\nvalidation or falsification.

These algorithms often come with high\ncomputational costs, therefore approximate stochastic simulation algorithms\nsuch as the tau-leap method are used. However, in order to minimise the bias in\nthe estimates generated using them, a relatively small value of tau is needed,\nrendering the computational costs comparable to Gillespie's direct method.\n  The multi-level Monte Carlo method (Anderson and Higham, Multiscale Model.\nSimul. 10:146-179, 2012) provides a reduction in computational costs whilst\nminimising or even eliminating the bias in the estimates of system statistics.\nThis is achieved by first crudely approximating required statistics with many\nsample paths of low accuracy. Then correction terms are added until a required\nlevel of accuracy is reached. Recent literature has primarily focussed on\nimplementing the multi-level method efficiently to estimate a single system\nstatistic. However, it is clearly also of interest to be able to approximate\nentire probability distributions of species counts.

Previous work on load balancing\nproposed solutions such as splitting long flows into short flows, using\nper-packet forwarding approaches, and isolating the paths of short and long\nflows. We propose DiffFlow, a new load balancing solution which detects long\nflows and forwards packets using Random Packet Spraying (RPS) with help of SDN,\nwhereas the flows with small duration are forwarded with ECMP by default. The\nuse of ECMP for short flows is reasonable, as it does not create the\nout-of-order problem; at the same time, RPS for long flows can efficiently help\nto load balancing the entire network, given that long flows represent most of\nthe traffic in DCNs. The results show that our DiffFlow solution outperforms\nboth the individual usage of either RPS or ECMP, while the overall throughput\nachieved is maintained at the level comparable to RPS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 11:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-03"}

The magnetic field model consists of an\nunperturbed reversed-shear helical part and a perturbation consisting of a\nsuperposition of modes. Contrary to most of the previous studies, the particle\ntrajectories are computed by directly solving the full Lorentz force equations\nof motion in a six-dimensional phase space using a sixth-order, implicit,\nsymplectic Gauss-Legendre method. The level of stochasticity in the particle\norbits is diagnosed using averaged, effective Poincare sections. It is shown\nthat when only one mode is present the particle orbits can be stochastic even\nthough the magnetic field line orbits are not stochastic. The lack of\nintegrability of the particle orbits in this case is related to separatrix\ncrossing and the breakdown of the global conservation of the magnetic moment.\nSome perturbation consisting of two modes creates resonance overlapping,\nleading to Hamiltonian chaos in magnetic field lines. Then, the particle orbits\nexhibit a nontrivial dynamics depending on their energy and pitch angle. It is\nshown that the regions where the particle motion is stochastic decrease as the\nenergy increases. The non-monotonicity of the $q$-profile implies the existence\nof magnetic ITBs which correspond to shearless flux surfaces located in the\nvicinity of the $q$-profile minimum.

Magnetic field\nlines in reversed-shear configurations exhibit topological bifurcations due to\nseparatrix reconnection.

They can already be observed in the\nenvelopes of the much younger, low-mass Class 0 protostars that are still in\ntheir early phase of heavy accretion. Aims. We aim at using the information on\nthe sublimation regions of different kinds of ices to understand the chemistry\nof the envelope, its temperature and density structure, and the history of the\naccretion process. Methods. As part of the CALYPSO IRAM Large Program, we have\nobtained observations of C$^{18}$O, N$_2$H$^+$ and CH$_3$OH towards nearby\nClass 0 protostars with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer at\nsub-arcsecond resolution. For four of these sources we have modeled the\nemission using a chemical code coupled with a radiative transfer module.\nResults. We observe an anti-correlation of C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ in NGC\n1333-IRAS4A, NGC 1333-IRAS4B, L1157, and L1448C, with N$_2$H$^+$ forming a ring\naround the centrally peaked C$^{18}$O emission due to N$_2$H$^+$ being\nchemically destroyed by CO. The emission regions of models and observations\nmatch for a CO binding energy of 1200 K, which is higher than the binding\nenergy of pure CO ices ($\\sim$855 K). Furthermore, we find very low CO\nabundances inside the snow lines in our sources, about an order of magnitude\nlower than the total CO abundance observed in the gas on large scales in\nmolecular clouds before depletion sets in. Conclusions. The high CO binding\nenergy may hint at CO being frozen out in a polar ice environment like\namorphous water ice or in non-polar CO$_2$-rich ice. The low CO abundances are\ncomparable to values found in protoplanetary disks, which may indicate an\nevolutionary scenario where these low values are already established in the\nprotostellar phase.

The role of the interlayer exchange coupling in\nmagnetization relaxation is determined experimentally by varying the thickness\nof the spacer. It is shown that stronger interlayer coupling via thinner\nspacers enhances the microwave energy exchange between the outer ferromagnetic\nlayers, with the magnetization of F$_2$ exchange-dragged by the resonance\nprecession in F$_1$. A weaker mirror effect is also observed: the magnetization\nof F$_1$ can be exchange-dragged by the precession in F$_2$, which leads to\nanti-damping and narrower FMR linewidths.

Our purpose is to\nstudy the subsequent temporal generation of entanglement, quantified by\nconcurrence, when initially the qubits are in an unentangled state. In the\nequilibrium situation, we show that the concurrence survives for a larger value\nof $d$ when the environmental spin chain is critical. Importantly, a common\nfeature observed both in the equilibrium and the non-equilibrium situations\nwhile the latter is created by a sudden but global change of the environmental\ntransverse field, is that the two qubits become maximally entangled for the\ncritical quenching. Following a non-equilibrium evolution of the spin chain,\nour study for $d\\neq 0$, indicates that there exists a threshold time above\nwhich concurrence attains a finite value. Additionally, we show that the number\nof independent decohering channels (DCs) is determined by $d$ as well as the\nlocal difference of the transverse field of the two underlying Hamiltonians\ngoverning the time evolution. The qualitatively similar behavior displayed by\nthe concurrence for critical and off-critical quenches, as reported here, is\ncharacterized by analyzing the non-equilibrium evolution of these channels. The\nconcurrence is maximum when the decoherence factor or the echo associated with\nthe most rapidly DC decays to zero; on the contrary, the condition when the\nconcurrence vanishes is determined non-trivially by the associated decay of one\nof the intermediate DCs. Analyzing the reduced density of a single qubit, we\nalso explain the observation that the dephasing rate is always slower than the\nunentanglement rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 13:48:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-23"}

By\nconstructing a minimal model for the approximant crystal, the heavy\nquasiparticle band is shown to emerge near the Fermi level because of strong\ncorrelation of 4f electrons at Yb. We find that charge-transfer mode between 4f\nelectron at Yb on the 3rd shell and 3p electron at Al on the 4th shell in\nTsai-type cluster is considerably enhanced with almost flat momentum\ndependence.

The exact cause of the environmental\ndependence is still poorly understood, yet semi-analytic models (SAMs) of\ngalaxy formation need to parameterise it to reproduce observations of galaxy\nproperties. In this work, we use hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the\nquenching of disk galaxies through ram-pressure stripping (RPS) as they fall\ninto galaxy clusters with the goal of characterising the importance of this\neffect for the reddening of disk galaxies. Our set-up employs a live model of a\ngalaxy cluster that interacts with infalling disk galaxies on different orbits.\nWe use the moving-mesh code AREPO, augmented with a special refinement strategy\nto yield high resolution around the galaxy on its way through the cluster in a\ncomputationally efficient way. Our direct simulations differ substantially from\nstripping models employed in current SAMs, which in most cases overpredict the\nmass loss from RPS. Furthermore, after pericentre passage, as soon as ram\npressure becomes weaker, gas that remains bound to the galaxy is redistributed\nto the outer parts, an effect that is not captured in simplified treatements of\nRPS. Star formation in our model galaxies is quenched mainly because the hot\ngas halo is stripped, depriving the galaxy of its gas supply. The cold gas disk\nis only stripped completely in extreme cases, leading to full quenching and\nsignificant reddening on timescale of ~200 Myr. On the other hand, galaxies\nexperiencing only mild ram pressure actually show an enhanced star formation\nrate that is consistent with observations and are quenched on timescales > 1\nGyr. Stripped gas in the wake is mixed efficiently with intracluster gas\nalready a few tens of kpc behind the disk, and this gas is free of residual\nstar formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 15:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

In particular, we consider the holonomy-flux\nalgebra of (2+1)-dimensional Euclidean loop quantum gravity, and construct a\nnew representation of this algebra that incorporates a positive cosmological\nconstant.

Second, through different layers, an\nindividual can also transmit the pathogen or information to the same\nindividuals more than once at one time, which makes the spreading more\neffective. To understand the different roles of the spreading scope and\neffectiveness, we propose an epidemic model on multiplex networks with link\noverlapping, where the spreading effectiveness of each interaction as well as\nthe variety of channels (spreading scope) can be controlled by the number of\noverlapping links. We find that for Poisson degree distribution, increasing the\nepidemic scope (the first effect) is more efficient than enhancing epidemic\nprobability (the second effect) to facilitate the spreading process. However,\nfor power-law degree distribution, the effects of the two factors on the\nspreading dynamics become complicated. Enhancing epidemic probability makes\npathogen or rumor easier to outbreak in a finite system.

However in many situations, e.g., in the context of\n$f(R)$ theories the higher curvature gravity action can be written as\nEinstein-Hilbert action plus a scalar field action. We show that not only the\naction but the field equations derived from the action are also equivalent\nprovided the spacetime is regular. We also demonstrate that such equivalence\ncontinues to hold even when gravitational field equations are projected on a\nlower dimensional hypersurface. We have further depicted explicit examples in\nwhich the solutions for Einstein-Hilbert and a scalar field system lead to\nsolutions of the equivalent higher curvature theory. The same, but on the lower\ndimensional hypersurface, has been illustrated in the reverse order as well. We\nconclude with a brief discussion on this technique of solving higher curvature\nfield equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2016 03:43:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Oct 2016 02:19:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-11"}

The path lengths to STEREO-B(STB) of protons\nand electrons have distinct difference and deviate remarkably from the nominal\nParker spiral path length, which is likely due to the presence of\ninterplanetary magnetic structures situated between the source and the STB.\nAlso the VDA method seems only to obtain reasonable results at well-connected\nlocations and the inferred energetic particles release times in different\nenergy channels are similar.
