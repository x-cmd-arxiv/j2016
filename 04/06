Over the last few years, a strong correlation between the\nintrinsic X-ray absorbing column density (N_H(z)) and the redshift was found.\nThis absorption excess in high-z GRBs is now thought to be due to the\noverlooked contribution of the absorption along the intergalactic medium, by\nmeans of both intervening objects and the diffuse warm-hot intergalactic medium\nalong the line of sight. In this work we neglect the absorption along the IGM,\nbecause our purpose is to study the eventual effect of a radical change in the\nGalactic absorption model on the N_H(z) distribution. Therefore, we derive the\nintrinsic absorbing column densities using two different Galactic absorption\nmodels, the Leiden Argentine Bonn HI survey and the more recent model including\nmolecular hydrogen. We find that, if on the one hand the new Galactic model\nconsiderably affects the single column density values, on the other hand there\nis no drastic change in the distribution as a whole. It becomes clear that the\ncontribution of Galactic column densities alone, no matter how improved, is not\nsufficient to change the observed general trend and it has to be considered as\na second-order correction. The cosmological increase of N_H(z) as a function of\nredshift persists and, in order to explain the observed distribution, it is\nnecessary to include the contribution of both the diffuse intergalactic medium\nand the intervening systems along the line of sight of the GRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 16:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-18"}

It is shown that, at the zero-group velocity (ZGV)\nfrequency, the forward $S_1$ Lamb mode fully converts into the backward\n$S_{2b}$ Lamb mode at normal incidence. Besides, this conversion is very\nefficient over most of the angular spectrum and remains dominant at frequencies\njust above the ZGV-point.

These properties can be easily understood in Wilsonian\nrenormalization, in which effective field theories are the low energy\nrenormalization group evolution of a more fundamental ---perhaps unknown or\nunsolvable--- high energy theory. In nuclear physics they provide the\npossibility of a theoretically sound derivation of nuclear forces without\nhaving to solve quantum chromodynamics explicitly. However there is the problem\nof how to organize calculations within nuclear effective field theory: the\ntraditional knowledge about power counting is perturbative but nuclear physics\nis not.

In\nphotometric redshift estimation, cosmologists use the coarse data collected\nfrom the vast majority of galaxies to predict the redshift of individual\ngalaxies. To properly quantify the uncertainty in the predictions, however, one\nneeds to go beyond standard regression and instead estimate the full\nconditional density f(z|x) of a galaxy's redshift z given its photometric\ncovariates x. The problem is further complicated by selection bias: usually\nonly the rarest and brightest galaxies have known redshifts, and these galaxies\nhave characteristics and measured covariates that do not necessarily match\nthose of more numerous and dimmer galaxies of unknown redshift. Unfortunately,\nthere is not much research on how to best estimate complex multivariate\ndensities in such settings.

Also, the existing\nBayesian optimization method with exponential convergence requires access to\nthe delta-cover sampling, which was considered to be impractical. Our approach\neliminates both requirements and achieves an exponential convergence rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 17:53:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-06"}

The BEC is stirred by a laser to induce\nexcitations manifesting as irregular spatial and energy oscillations of the\ntrapped cloud. Adding laser stirring to the external trap results in an\neffective time-varying trapping frequency in connection with the dynamically\nchanging combined external+laser potential trap. The resulting dynamics are\nanalyzed by plotting their trajectories in coordinate phase space and in energy\nspace. The Lyapunov exponents are computed to confirm the existence of chaos in\nthe latter space. Quantum effects and trap anharmonicity are demonstrated to\ngenerate chaos in energy space, thus confirming its presence and implicating\neither quantum effects or trap anharmonicity as its generator. The presence of\nchaos in energy space does not necessarily translate into chaos in coordinate\nspace. In general, a dynamic trapping frequency is found to promote chaos in a\ntrapped BEC. An apparent means to suppress chaos in a trapped BEC is achieved\nby increasing the characteristic scale of the external trap with respect to the\ncondensate size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 17:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-08"}

Thus,\nthe problem of estimating the minimum eigenvalue of a local Hamiltonian to\ninverse exponential precision is PSPACE-complete, which we show holds even in\nthe frustration-free case. Finally, we can use this characterization to give a\nprovable setting in which the ability to prepare the ground state of a local\nHamiltonian is more powerful than the ability to prepare PEPS states.\n  Interestingly, by suitably changing the parameterization of either of these\nproblems we can completely characterize the power of quantum computation with\nsimultaneously bounded time and space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 19:48:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 18:41:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-22"}

Full 3D SPH realizations of a\nnumber of representative cases, run over a shorter interval of time, validate\nthe general trends observed in the less computationally demanding 2D\nsimulations. Initially circular black hole binaries increase only slightly\ntheir eccentricity which then oscillates around small values (<0.1) while they\nharden. By contrast, initially eccentric binaries become more and more\neccentric. A semi-analytical model describing the black hole's dynamics under\naccretion only explores the late evolution stages of the binary in an otherwise\nunperturbed retrograde disc to illustrate how eccentricity evolves with time in\nrelation to the shape of the underlying surface density distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 19:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

However, in two\ndifferent classes of commonly used systems, this is often not the case. These\nclasses exhibit non-monotonic changes in their density profile slopes which we\ncall oscillations for short. We analyze these two unrelated classes separately.\nClass 1 consists of systems that have density oscillations and that are defined\nthrough their distribution function $f(E)$, or differential energy distribution\n$N(E)$, such as isothermal spheres, King profiles, or DARKexp, a theoretically\nderived model for relaxed collisionless systems. Systems defined through $f(E)$\nor $N(E)$ generally have density slope oscillations. Class 1 system\noscillations can be found at small, intermediate, or large radii but we focus\non a limited set of Class 1 systems that have oscillations in the central\nregions, usually at $\\log(r/r_{-2})\\lesssim -2$, where $r_{-2}$ is the largest\nradius where $d\\log(\\rho)/d\\log(r)=-2$. We show that the shape of their $N(E)$\ncan roughly predict the amplitude of oscillations. Class 2 systems which are a\nproduct of dynamical evolution, consist of observed and simulated galaxies and\nclusters, and pure dark matter halos. Oscillations in the density profile slope\nseem pervasive in the central regions of Class 2 systems. We argue that in\nthese systems, slope oscillations are an indication that a system is not fully\nrelaxed. We show that these oscillations can be reproduced by small\nmodifications to $N(E)$ of DARKexp. These affect a small fraction of systems'\nmass and are confined to $\\log(r/r_{-2})\\lesssim 0$. The size of these\nmodifications serves as a potential diagnostic for quantifying how far a system\nis from being relaxed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 20:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

The $H$-band magnitude has been significantly improved\nrelative to previous measurements, whereas the low resolution $K_1$\n($\\lambda/\\delta\\lambda \\approx 66$) spectrum is featureless within the\nmeasurement uncertainties, and presents a monotonically increasing\npseudo-continuum consistent with a cloudy atmosphere. By combining these new\nmeasurements with literature $L^{\\prime}$ photometry, we compare the spectral\nenergy distribution of the planet to other young planetary-mass companions,\nfield brown dwarfs, and to the predictions of grids of model atmospheres. HD\n95086 b is over a magnitude redder in $K_1-L^{\\prime}$ color than 2MASS\nJ12073346-3932539 b and HR 8799 c and d, despite having a similar $L^{\\prime}$\nmagnitude. Considering only the near-infrared measurements, HD 95086 b is most\nanalogous to the brown dwarfs 2MASS J2244316+204343 and 2MASS\nJ21481633+4003594, both of which are thought to have dusty atmospheres.\nMorphologically, the spectral energy distribution of HD 95086 b is best fit by\nlow temperature ($T_{\\rm eff} =$ 800-1300 K), low surface gravity spectra from\nmodels which simulate high photospheric dust content. This range of effective\ntemperatures is consistent with field L/T transition objects, but the spectral\ntype of HD 95086 b is poorly constrained between early L and late T due to its\nunusual position the color-magnitude diagram, demonstrating the difficulty in\nspectral typing young, low surface gravity substellar objects. As one of the\nreddest such objects, HD 95086 b represents an important empirical benchmark\nagainst which our current understanding of the atmospheric properties of young\nextrasolar planets can be tested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 20:05:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

Here, we overcome this restriction by using a\ndevice-independent approach.

This framework is general and can be\nused to model a variety of problems, such as movie studios selecting movies to\nproduce, venture capital firms picking start-up companies to invest in, or\nindividuals selecting lineups for daily fantasy sports contests, which is the\nexample we focus on here. We model the portfolio selection task as a\ncombinatorial optimization problem with a submodular objective function, which\nis given by the probability of at least one entry winning. We then show that\nthis probability can be approximated using only pairwise marginal probabilities\nof the entries winning when there is a certain structure on their joint\ndistribution. We consider a model where the entries are jointly Gaussian random\nvariables and present a closed form approximation to the objective function.\nBuilding on this, we then consider a scenario where the entries are given by\nsums of constrained resources and present an integer programming formulation to\nconstruct the entries. Our formulation uses principles based on our theoretical\nanalysis to construct entries: we maximize the expected score of an entry\nsubject to a lower bound on its variance and an upper bound on its correlation\nwith previously constructed entries. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our\ninteger programming approach, we apply it to daily fantasy sports contests that\nhave top-heavy payoff structures. We find that our approach performs well in\npractice. Using our integer programming approach, we are able to rank in the\ntop-ten multiple times in hockey and baseball contests with thousands of\ncompeting entries.

The northern loop system brightens following the initiation\nof the flare within the southern loop system, but all three cusp-shaped\nstructures are characterized by ~ 10 MK temperatures, hotter than the\narch-shaped loops underneath. The \"Ahead\" satellite of the Solar Terrestrial\nRelations Observatory (STEREO) provides a top view, in which the post-flare\nloops brighten sequentially, with one end fixed while the other apparently\nslipping eastward. By performing stereoscopic reconstruction of the post-flare\nloops in EUV and mapping out magnetic connectivities, we found that the\nfootpoints of the post-flare loops are slipping along the footprint of a\nhyperbolic flux tube (HFT) separating the two loop systems, and that the\nreconstructed loops share similarity with the magnetic field lines that are\ntraced starting from the same HFT footprint, where the field lines are\nrelatively flexible. These results argue strongly in favor of slipping magnetic\nreconnection at the HFT. The slipping reconnection was likely triggered by the\nflare and manifested as propagative dimmings before the loop slippage is\nobserved. It may contribute to the late-phase peak in Fe XVI 33.5 nm, which is\neven higher than its main-phase counterpart, and may also play a role in the\ndensity and temperature asymmetry observed in the northern loop system through\nheat conduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 00:53:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

However,\ncold dust emission is non-negligible, averagely contributing ~24% of total IR\nluminosity. 2) Compared to QSO and starburst SED templates, the median SED of\nHot DOGs shows the highest luminosity ratio between mid-IR and submm at\nrest-frame, while it is very similar to that of QSOs at 10-50um suggesting that\nthe heating sources of Hot DOGs should be buried AGNs. 3) Hot DOGs have both\nhigh dust temperatures ~73K and IR luminosity of cold dust. The T-L relation of\nHot DOGs suggests that the increase in IR luminosity for Hot DOGs is mostly due\nto the increase of the dust temperature, rather than dust mass. Hot DOGs have\nlower dust masses than those of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) and QSOs within\nthe similar redshift range. Both high IR luminosity of cold dust and relatively\nlow dust mass in Hot DOGs can be expected by their relatively high dust\ntemperatures. 4) Hot DOGs have high dust covering factors, which deviate the\npreviously proposed trend of the dust covering factor decreasing with\nincreasing bolometric luminosity. Finally, we can reproduce the observed\nproperties in Hot DOGs by employing a physical model of galaxy evolution. The\nresult suggests that Hot DOGs may lie at or close to peaks of both star\nformation and black hole growth histories, and represent a transit phase during\nthe evolution of massive galaxies, transforming from the dusty starburst\ndominated phase to the optically bright QSO phase.

Multiple single-antenna users are served\nusing zero-forcing beamforming with equal power allocation across the beams.\nFor such a system, we obtain tractable, but accurate, approximations of the\nsignal power and inter-cluster interference power distributions and derive a\ncomputationally efficient expression for the achievable per-BS ergodic sum rate\nusing tools from stochastic geometry. This expression allows us to obtain the\noptimal loading factor, i.e., the ratio between the number of scheduled users\nand the number of BS antennas, that maximizes the per-BS ergodic sum rate.\nFurther, it allows us to quantify the performance improvement of network MIMO\nsystems as a function of the cooperating cluster size.

A major family of derivations is based on\nenvariance, a recently discovered symmetry of entangled quantum states.

The aperture is wide enough to separate the slits in the\nimages, i.e., telling which way. The illumination pattern over the pupil is\nreconstructed from the series of slit intensities.

Often\nthe NOE distance restraints are too imprecise and sparse for accurate structure\ndetermination. Residual dipolar coupling (RDC) measurements provide additional\ngeometric information on the angles between atom-pair directions and axes of\nthe principal-axis-frame.

By comparing our findings with the\npredictions of theoretical models, we show that the opposite behavior observed\nin the $M_{\\rm HI}/M_{\\rm dust}$ and $M_{\\rm H_{2}}/M_{\\rm dust}$ ratios is\nfully consistent with outside-in stripping of the interstellar medium (ISM),\nand is simply a consequence of the different distribution of dust, \\hi\\ and\nH$_{2}$ across the disk. Our results demonstrate that the small environmental\nvariations in the total $M_{\\rm gas}/M_{\\rm dust}$ ratio, as well as in the\ngas-phase metallicity, do not automatically imply that environmental mechanisms\nare not able to affect the dust and metal content of the ISM in galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 06:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

We have used the spectral synthesis code CLOUDY to\nsimulate the physical environment of these DLAs, and constrain the density,\nradiation field, geometry and dust-grain properties of the DLAs\nself-consistently based on the observed column densities of various atomic and\nmolecular species such as H I, fine structure lines of C I and the rotational\nlevel population of H2. In our models, we explore the effect of grain size\ndistribution on the predicted column densities of different species. Within the\nallowed uncertainties in the inferred dust-to-gas ratio, both models with\nstandard ISM grains and smaller-sized grains reproduce the observations equally\nwell. Improved constraints on dust-to-gas ratio and line-of-sight extinction\nare important for probing the grain size distribution in high-z DLAs. We find\nthe H2-bearing clouds to have line-of-sight thickness in the range 1-6 pc,\nconsistent with what has been found using partial coverage or 21-cm\nobservations in some high-z DLAs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 07:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

In this paper we review this method, provide the relevant equations,\nand test it by analyzing high-resolution ($R \\sim 50000$) near-infrared spectra\noftwo young stars, namely the Herbig Be star HD 200775 and the Be star V1478\nCyg, which exhibit intense emission lines.

A set of various determinations of the Einstein\ncoefficients are compared to show how much the available computations affect\nextinction derivation. The most recently obtained values are probably good\nenough to allow reddening determination within 1 visual mag of accuracy.\nFurthermore, we show that [FeII] line ratios from low-resolution pure\nemission-line spectra in general are likely to be in error due to the\nimpossibility to properly account for telluric absorption lines. If\nlow-resolution spectra are used for reddening determinations, we advice that\nthe ratio 1.644/1.257, rather than 1.644/1.321, should be used, being less\naffected by the effects of telluric absorption lines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 08:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-10"}

So\nfar, optomechanics has mostly focused on the optical and microwave domains,\nleading to new types of quantum experiments [9-11] and to the development of\noptical-microwave converters [12-14]. Here we demonstrate an integrated\nmeta-atom [15] THz resonator with a flexible part acting as a mechanical\noscillator. In this device free space THz photons are collected by the\nresonator and induce high frequency currents and charges that, in turn, couple\nto the mechanical degrees of freedom. The resulting mechanical motion is\nread-out optically, allowing our device to function as a compact and efficient\nterahertz detector at room temperature. Furthermore the device operates at high\nmodulation frequencies (>10MHz), well beyond the cut-off frequencies of Golay\ncells, pyroelectric detectors and cryogenic semiconductor bolometers [16,17].\nNotably, our experiments unambiguously reveal an instantaneous THz detection\nmechanism arising from a nano-scale Coulomb interaction, with a Noise\nEquivalent Power that is potentially frequency independent.

In the spirit of celebrated Young's characterization result that\naxiomatizes single-winner scoring rules, we provide an axiomatic\ncharacterization of multiwinner committee scoring rules.

The usual approach in the literature is to minimize the\nobjective function value of the recovered solution in the nominal or in the\nworst case.\n  As the recovery itself is also costly, there is a trade-off between the\nrecovery costs and the solution value obtained; we study both, the recovery\ncosts and the solution value in the worst case in a biobjective setting.\n  To this end, we assume that the recovery costs can be described by a metric.\nWe demonstrate that this leads to a location planning problem, bringing\ntogether two fields of research which have been considered separate so far.\n  We show how weakly Pareto efficient solutions to this biobjective problem can\nbe computed by minimizing the recovery costs for a fixed worst-case objective\nfunction value and present approaches for the case of linear and quasiconvex\nproblems for finite uncertainty sets.

Several constraints limit the practical\nperformance of DNs in this context: firstly, the paucity of existing pixel-wise\nlabelled training data, and secondly, the memory constraints of embedded\nhardware, which rule out the practical use of state-of-the-art DN architectures\nsuch as fully convolutional networks (FCN). To address the first constraint, we\nintroduce a Multi-Domain Road Scene Semantic Segmentation (MDRS3) dataset,\naggregating data from six existing densely and sparsely labelled datasets for\ntraining our models, and two existing, separate datasets for testing their\ngeneralisation performance. We show that, while MDRS3 offers a greater volume\nand variety of data, end-to-end training of a memory efficient DN does not\nyield satisfactory performance. We propose a new training strategy to overcome\nthis, based on (i) the creation of a best-possible source network (S-Net) from\nthe aggregated data, ignoring time and memory constraints; and (ii) the\ntransfer of knowledge from S-Net to the memory-efficient target network\n(T-Net). We evaluate different techniques for S-Net creation and T-Net\ntransferral, and demonstrate that training a constrained deconvolutional\nnetwork in this manner can unlock better performance than existing training\napproaches. Specifically, we show that a target network can be trained to\nachieve improved accuracy versus an FCN despite using less than 1\\% of the\nmemory.

To determine which of the two competing effects wins, we study\nthe interplay of Cooper pairing interaction and disorder scattering by means of\nrenormalization group method. We consider three types of disorders, including\nrandom mass, random gauge potential, and random chemical potential, and show\nthat the first two suppress superconductivity. In particular, the critical BCS\ncoupling $|u_{c}|$ is increased to certain larger value if the system contains\nonly random mass or random gauge potential, which makes the onset of\nsuperconductivity more difficult. In the case of random chemical potential, the\neffective disorder parameter flows to the strong coupling regime, where the\nperturbation expansion breaks down and cannot provide a clear answer concerning\nthe fate of superconductivity. When different types of disorder coexist in one\nsystem, their strength parameters all flow to strong couplings. In the strong\ncoupling regime, the perturbative renormalization group method becomes invalid,\nand one needs to employ other methods to treat the disorder effects. We perform\na simple gap equation analysis of the impact of random chemical potential on\nsuperconductivity by using the Abrikosov-Gorkov diagrammatic approach, and also\nbriefly discuss the possible generalization of this approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 09:19:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2016 12:32:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2017 17:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-17"}

Li, Tripunitara and Wang (2009)\nintroduced the Resiliency Checking Problem (RCP), in which we are given an\nauthorization policy, a subset of resources $P \\subseteq R$, as well as\nintegers $s \\ge 0$, $d \\ge 1$ and $t \\geq 1$. It asks whether upon removal of\nany set of at most $s$ users, there still exist $d$ pairwise disjoint sets of\nat most $t$ users such that each set has collectively access to all resources\nin $P$. This problem possesses several parameters which appear to take small\nvalues in practice. We thus analyze the parameterized complexity of RCP with\nrespect to these parameters, by considering all possible combinations of $|P|,\ns, d, t$. In all but one case, we are able to settle whether the problem is in\nFPT, XP, W[2]-hard, para-NP-hard or para-coNP-hard.

We first show that the initiation pressure for the onset\nof localised bulging is simply the limiting pressure in uniform inflation when\nthe axial force is held fixed. We then demonstrate analytically how, as\ninflation continues, the initial bulge grows continually in diameter until it\nreaches a critical size and then propagates in both directions. The bulging\nsolution before propagation starts is of the solitary-wave type, whereas the\npropagating bulging solution is of the kink-wave type. The stability, with\nrespect to axially symmetric perturbations, of both the solitary-wave type and\nthe kink-wave type solutions is studied by computing the Evans function using\nthe compound matrix method. It is found that when the inflation is\npressure-controlled, the Evans function has a single non-negative real root and\nthis root tends to zero only when the initiation pressure or the propagation\npressure is approached. Thus, the kink-wave type solution is probably stable\nbut the solitary-wave type solution is definitely unstable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 10:36:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-07"}

Both yes\nand no answers have important practical and theoretical consequences, and the\nquestion seems genuinely hard. The state-of-the-art approaches to securely\ndelegating quantum computation, without exception, rely on granting the client\nmodest quantum powers, or on additional, non-communicating, quantum servers. In\nthis work, we consider the single server setting, and push the boundaries of\nthe minimal devices of the client, which still allow for blind quantum\ncomputation. Our approach is based on the observation that, in many blind\nquantum computing protocols, the \"quantum\" part of the protocol, from the\nclients perspective, boils down to the establishing classical-quantum\ncorrelations (independent from the computation) between the client and the\nserver, following which the steering of the computation itself requires only\nclassical communication. Here, we abstract this initial preparation phase,\nspecifically for the Universal Blind Quantum Computation protocol of Broadbent,\nFitzsimons and Kashefi. We identify sufficient criteria on the powers of the\nclient, which still allow for secure blind quantum computation. We work in a\nuniversally composable framework, and provide a series of protocols, where each\nstep reduces the number of differing states the client needs to be able to\nprepare. As the limit of such reductions, we show that the capacity to prepare\njust two pure states, which have an arbitrarily high overlap (thus are\narbitrarily close to identical), suffices for efficient and secure blind\nquantum computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 12:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-07"}

(2003) in the redshift\nrange of 0.16 to 0.7. This is the introductory paper of a series presenting the\nsample selection, photometric and spectroscopic observations and data\nreduction. Photometric data in different passbands were taken for eight galaxy\nclusters at Las Campanas Observatory; three clusters at Cerro Tololo\nInteramerican Observatory; and eight clusters at the Gemini Observatory.\nSpectroscopic data were collected for only four galaxy clusters using Gemini\ntelescopes. With the photometry, the galaxies were defined based on the\nstar-galaxy separation taking into account photometric parameters. For each\ngalaxy cluster, the catalogues contain the PSF and aperture magnitudes of\ngalaxies within the 90\\% completeness limit. They are used together with\nstructural parameters to study the galaxy morphology and to estimate\nphotometric redshifts.

The chronological time $\\tau$ was\nintroduced as an independent evolution parameter in order to free the\nlaboratory clock $x^0$ to evolve alternately 'forward' and 'backward' in time\naccording to the sign of the energy, thus providing a classical implementation\nof the Feynman-Stueckelberg interpretation of pair creation/annihilation. The\nresulting theory differs in its underlying mechanics from conventional\nelectromagnetism, but coincides with Maxwell theory in an equilibrium limit.\n  After a brief review of Stueckelberg-Horwitz electrodynamics, we obtain the\nfield produced by an event in uniform motion and verify that it satisfies the\nfield equations. We study this field in the rest frame of the event, where it\ndepends explicitly on coordinate time $x^0$ and the parameter $\\tau$, as well\nas spatial distance $R$.

It is seen that for an event in the field\nof an oppositely charged sheet of sufficient density, the event can reverse\ntime direction, providing a specific model for pair phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 13:24:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-22"}

The resulting theory differs in its underlying mechanics from\nconventional electromagnetism, but coincides with Maxwell theory in an\nequilibrium limit. In particular, the total mass-energy-momentum of particles\nand fields is conserved, but the mass-shell constraint is lifted from\nindividual interacting events, so that the standard Feynman-Stueckelberg\ninterpretation of pair creation/annihilation is implemented in classical\nmechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 13:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

The protocols measure solely whether Q has the same or different\nsign at the ends of a given time interval. They are inspired, in part, by a\ndecoherent histories analysis of the two-time histories of Q although the\nprotocols are ultimately expressed in macrorealistic form independent of\nquantum theory. The first type involves an ancilla coupled to the system with\ntwo sequential CNOT gates, and the two-time histories of the system are\ndetermined in a single final time measurement of the ancilla. It is\nnon-invasive for special choices of initial system states and partially\ninvasive for more general choices. Modified Leggett-Garg type inequalities\nwhich accommodate the partial invasiveness are discussed. The quantum picture\nof the protocol shows that for certain choices of primary system initial state\nthe protocol is undetectable with respect to final system state measurements,\nalthough it is still invasive at intermediate times. This invasiveness can be\nreduced with different choices of ancilla states and the protocol is then\nsimilar in flavour to a weak measurement. The second type of protocol is based\non the fact that the behaviour of Q over a time interval can be determined from\nknowledge of the dynamics together with a measurement of certain initial (or\nfinal) data. Its quantum version corresponds to the known fact that when sets\nof histories are decoherent, their probabilities may be expressed in terms of a\nrecord projector, hence the two-time histories in which Q has the same or\ndifferent sign can be determined by a single projective measurement. The\nresulting protocol resembles the decay-type protocol proposed by Huelga and\ncollaborators (which is non-invasive but requires a stationarity assumption).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 15:20:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Apr 2016 14:09:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 7 Aug 2016 13:59:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 4 Oct 2016 20:51:31 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 14:16:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

Here we investigate the statistics of\nrecord-breaking events in the time series of crackling noise generated by local\nrupture events during the compressive failure of porous materials. The events\nare generated by computer simulations of the uni-axial compression of\ncylindrical samples in a discrete element model of sedimentary rocks that\nclosely resemble those of real experiments. The number of records grows\ninitially as a decelerating power law of the number of events, followed by an\nacceleration immediately prior to failure. We demonstrate the existence of a\ncharacteristic record rank k^* which separates the two regimes of the time\nevolution. Up to this rank deceleration occurs due to the effect of random\ndisorder. Record breaking then accelerates towards macroscopic failure, when\nphysical interactions leading to spatial and temporal correlations dominate the\nlocation and timing of local ruptures. Sub-sequences of bursts between\nconsecutive records are characterized by a power law size distribution with an\nexponent which decreases as failure is approached. High rank records are\npreceded by bursts of increasing size and waiting time between consecutive\nevents and they are followed by a relaxation process. As a reference, surrogate\ntime series are generated by reshuffling the crackling bursts. The record\nstatistics of the uncorrelated surrogates agrees very well with the\ncorresponding predictions of independent identically distributed random\nvariables, which confirms that the temporal and spatial correlation of cracking\nbursts are responsible for the observed unique behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 15:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-07"}

The theory can also\nhave additional applications since today information often has a network or\ndirected graph like structure and it often evolves or it is maintained. The\nembed method applies the communication theory by modeling the object database\nand a modified object structure in the run-time memory as directed graphs of\nnodes without any artificial limitations. For example, different kinds of\ncircular substructures and their modifications are allowed. Persistence in the\nobject database is defined in a well known and accepted way, by reachability\nfrom persistent root objects. The embed method also removes structures of\ngarbage objects from the object database if any appear during the update\noperation, leaving the database in a consistent state. The embed method applies\nreference counting techniques. It understands local topology of the object\ndatabase, avoiding examining unrelated objects in the database. For these\nreasons, the embed method is efficient and it scales for databases of different\nsizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 23:44:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-11"}

Aptamers are identified in vitro via the Systematic\nEvolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) protocol. SELEX selects\nbinders through an iterative process that, starting from a pool of random\nssDNA/RNA sequences, amplifies target-affine species through a series of\nselection cycles. HT-SELEX, which combines SELEX with high throughput\nsequencing, has recently transformed aptamer development and has opened the\nfield to even more applications. HT-SELEX is capable of generating over half a\nbillion data points, challenging computational scientists with the task of\nidentifying aptamer properties such as sequence structure motifs that determine\nbinding. While currently available motif finding approaches suggest partial\nsolutions to this question, none possess the generality or scalability required\nfor HT-SELEX data, and they do not take advantage of important properties of\nthe experimental procedure.\n  We present AptaTRACE, a novel approach for the identification of\nsequence-structure binding motifs in HT-SELEX derived aptamers. Our approach\nleverages the experimental design of the SELEX protocol and identifies\nsequence-structure motifs that show a signature of selection. Because of its\nunique approach, AptaTRACE can uncover motifs even when these are present in\nonly a minuscule fraction of the pool. Due to these features, our method can\nhelp to reduce the number of selection cycles required to produce aptamers with\nthe desired properties, thus reducing cost and time of this rather expensive\nprocedure. The performance of the method on simulated and real data indicates\nthat AptaTRACE can detect sequence-structure motifs even in highly challenging\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 18:47:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-12"}

It is shown here that this effect can be predicted by assuming that the\ninertial mass of the photons in the cavity is caused by Unruh radiation, whose\nwavelengths must fit exactly within the cavity, using a theory already applied\nsuccessfully to astrophysical anomalies such as galaxy rotation where the Unruh\nwaves have to fit within the Hubble scale. In the emdrive this means that more\nUnruh waves are allowed at the wide end, leading to a greater inertial mass for\nthe photons there, and to conserve momentum the cavity must move towards its\nnarrow end, as observed.

However, for fermionic\nexpressions these infinite terms are due to anti-particles only. This exposes\nan asymmetry in standard QFT, which can be traced back to a bias towards\nparticles in the Dirac bra-ket notation. To counter this bias a new ordering\nprinciple (called the $\\mathbb{R}$-product) is required which restores the\nsymmetry (or rather duality) between particles and anti-particles and\neliminates the infinite v.e.v. While this $\\mathbb{R}$-product was already used\nin a bound-state application, this paper aims to give it a more general\nfoundation and analyze its overall impact in QFT.\n  For boson fields the particle bias is hidden and the fields must first be\nexpanded into bilinear particle-anti-particle fermion operators. This new\nrepresentation also leads to vanishing v.e.v.'s and avoids some common\ntechnical problems in the quantization of vector fields, while it admits new\nconstant contributions that mimic the Higgs mechanism without unacceptable\ncontributions to the cosmological constant.\n  Since the $\\mathbb{R}$-product does not apply between operators belonging to\ndifferent space- time coordinates (e.g. propagators and vacuum condensates),\nmost standard QFT calculations remain unaffected by this new principle,\npreserving those quantitative successes. The boson propagator also retains a\nstandard bosonic form despite the fermionic representation. However, the\nfoundations of QFT are affected strongly as the new principle suggests that the\nStandard Model is an effective theory built (partly?) on massless bare quarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Apr 2016 20:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-25"}

These distributions show that the first three recalls come from\nthe emptying of working memory, recalls 6 and above come from a second stage\nand the 4th and 5th recalls are mixtures of the two. A discontinuity, a rounded\nstep function, is shown to exist in the fitted linear slope of the recall\ndistributions as the recall shifts from the emptying of working memory\n(positive slope) to the second stage (negative slope). The discontinuity leads\nto a first estimate of the capacity of working memory at 4-4.5 items. Working\nmemory accounts for the recency effect. The primacy effect comes from the\nsecond stage with a contribution also from working memory for short lists (the\nfirst item). The different slopes of the working memory and secondary stages,\nand that the two have different functional forms, accounts for the u-shaped\nserial position curve. The total recall is shown to be a linear combination of\nthe content of working memory and items recalled in the second stage with\n3.0-3.9 items coming from working memory, a second estimate of the capacity of\nworking memory. A third, separate upper limit on the capacity of working memory\nis found (3.06 items), corresponding to the requirement that the content of\nworking memory cannot exceed the total recall, item by item. This third limit\npresumably corresponds to the least chunked item. This is the best limit on the\ncapacity of unchunked working memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Apr 2016 11:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-19"}
