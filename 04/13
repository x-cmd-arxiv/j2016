In this paper, we show that the $\\mathcal{MGIG}$ is unimodal, and the\nmode can be obtained by solving an Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) equation\n[7]. Based on the property, we propose an importance sampling method for the\n$\\mathcal{MGIG}$ where the mode of the proposal distribution matches that of\nthe target. The proposed sampling method is more efficient than existing\napproaches [32, 33], which use proposal distributions that may have the mode\nfar from the $\\mathcal{MGIG}$'s mode. Further, we illustrate that the the\nposterior distribution in latent factor models, such as probabilistic matrix\nfactorization (PMF) [25], when marginalized over one latent factor has the\n$\\mathcal{MGIG}$ distribution. The characterization leads to a novel Collapsed\nMonte Carlo (CMC) inference algorithm for such latent factor models. We\nillustrate that CMC has a lower log loss or perplexity than MCMC, and needs\nfewer samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 16:03:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 16:05:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-23"}

If $M$ is such a manifold, we show\nthat the type D structure $\\widehat{\\mathit{CFD}}$ may be viewed as a set of\nimmersed curves decorated with local systems in $\\partial M$. These\ncurves-with-decoration are invariants of the underlying three-manifold up to\nregular homotopy of the curves and isomorphism of the local systems. Given two\nsuch manifolds and a homeomorphism $h$ between the boundary tori, the Heegaard\nFloer homology of the closed manifold obtained by gluing with $h$ is obtained\nfrom the Lagrangian intersection Floer homology of the curve-sets. This\nmachinery has several applications: We establish that the dimension of\n$\\widehat{\\mathit{HF}}$ decreases under a certain class of degree one maps\n(pinches) and we establish that the existence of an essential separating torus\ngives rise to a lower bound on the dimension of $\\widehat{\\mathit{HF}}$.

Responding to the growth of the market,\nmany alternative cloud services and their underlying systems are currently\nvying for the attention of cloud users and providers. Thus, benchmarking them\nis needed, to enable cloud users to make an informed choice, and to enable\nsystem DevOps to tune, design, and evaluate their systems. This requires\nfocusing on old and new system properties, possibly leading to the re-design of\nclassic benchmarking metrics, such as expressing performance as throughput and\nlatency (response time), and the design of new, cloud-specififc metrics.\nAddressing this requirement, in this work we focus on four system properties:\n(i) elasticity of the cloud service, to accommodate large variations in the\namount of service requested, (ii) performance isolation between the tenants of\nshared cloud systems, (iii) availability of cloud services and systems, and the\n(iv) operational risk of running a production system in a cloud\nenvironment.Focusing on key metrics, for each of these properties we review the\nstate-of-the-art, then select or propose new metrics together with measurement\napproaches.

It is difficult for the designer to identify the\nassumptions that ensures the existence of a correct controller, and doing so\nmanually can lead to assumptions that are stronger than necessary. As a\nconsequence the generated controllers are suboptimal in terms of generality and\nrobustness. In this work, given a specification, we identify the weakest\nassumptions that ensures the existence of a controller. We also consider two\nimportant classes of assumptions: the ones that can be ensured by the\nenvironment and assumptions that speaks only about inputs of the systems. We\nshow that optimal assumptions correspond to strongly winning strategies,\nadmissible strategies and remorsefree strategies respectively.

As an application of our theoretical\nstrategy, we compute various single-particle and many-particle phenomena such\nas the Fock-Darwin spectrum; Fermi energy; magneto-optical transitions;\nprobability distribution; and the magneto-optical absorption in the quantum\ndots. It is observed that the role of an applied magnetic field on the\nabsorption spectrum is comparable to that of a confining potential. Increasing\n(decreasing) the strength of the magnetic field or the confining potential is\nfound to be analogous to shrinking (expanding) the size of the quantum dots:\nresulting into a blue (red) shift in the absorption spectrum.

We embark on the charge-density excitations in\na two-subband model within the framework of Bohm-Pines's random-phase\napproximation. The problem involves two length scales: ${\\it\nl}_0=\\sqrt{\\hbar/m^*\\omega_0}$ and ${\\it l}_c=\\sqrt{\\hbar/m^*\\omega_c}$, which\ncharacterize the strengths of the confinement and the magnetic field ($B$).\nEssentially, we focus on the device aspects of the intersubband collective\n(magnetoroton) excitation, which observes a negative group velocity between\nmaxon and roton. Consequently, it leads to tachyon-like (superluminal) behavior\nwithout one's having to introduce the negative energies. Existence of the\nnegative group velocity is a clear manifestation of a medium with population\ninversion brought about due to a metastable state caused by the magnetic field\nthat satisfies the condition $B> B_{th}$; $B_{th}$ being the threshold value\nbelow which the magnetoroton does not exist. The interest in negative group\nvelocity is based on anomalous dispersion in a medium with inverted population,\nso that gain instead of absorption occurs at the frequencies of interest. A\nmedium with an inverted population has the remarkable ability of amplifying a\nsmall optical signal of definite wavelength, i.e., it can serve as an {\\em\nactive} laser medium. An extensive scrutiny of the gain coefficient suggests an\ninteresting and important application: the electronic device designed on the\nbasis of such magnetoroton modes can act as an optical amplifier. Examining the\nmagnetic-field dependence of the life-time of magnetorotons leads us to infer\nthat relatively smaller magnetic fields are optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 17:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-20"}

That is, how the lumpy universe that we observe at small scales\naverages out to a smooth Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model. The\nroot of the problem is that averaging does not commute with the Einstein\nequations that govern the dynamics of the model. This leads to the well-know\nquestion of backreaction in cosmology. In this work, we approach the problem\nusing the covariant framework of Macroscopic Gravity (MG). We use its\ncosmological solution with a flat FLRW macroscopic background where the result\nof averaging cosmic inhomogeneities has been encapsulated into a backreaction\ndensity parameter denoted $\\Omega_\\mathcal{A}$.

In order to achieve\nsuch goal, these systems are learning user interests over time and trying to\npresent content items tailoring to user profiles. Recommending items according\nto users' preferences has been investigated extensively in the past few years,\nmainly thanks for the popularity of Netflix competition. In a real setting,\nusers may be attracted by a subset of those items and interact with them, only\nleaving partial feedbacks to the system to learn in the next cycle, which leads\nto significant biases into systems and hence results in a situation where user\nengagement metrics cannot be improved over time.

This paper presents basic ideas behind a directed\nenergy planetary defense system that utilizes laser ablation of an asteroid to\nimpart a deflecting force on the target. A conceptual philosophy called\nDE-STAR, which stands for Directed Energy System for Targeting of Asteroids and\nexploRation, is an orbiting stand-off system, which has been described in other\npapers. This paper describes a smaller, stand-on system known as DE-STARLITE as\na reduced-scale version of DE-STAR. Both share the same basic heritage of a\ndirected energy array that heats the surface of the target to the point of high\nsurface vapor pressure that causes significant mass ejection thus forming an\nejection plume of material from the target that acts as a rocket to deflect the\nobject. This is generally classified as laser ablation. DE-STARLITE uses\nconventional propellant for launch to LEO and then ion engines to propel the\nspacecraft from LEO to the near-Earth asteroid (NEA). During laser ablation,\nthe asteroid itself provides the propellant source material; thus a very modest\nspacecraft can deflect an asteroid much larger than would be possible with a\nsystem of similar mission mass using ion beam deflection (IBD) or a gravity\ntractor. DE- STARLITE is capable of deflecting an Apophis-class (325 m\ndiameter) asteroid with a 1- to 15-year targeting time (laser on time)\ndepending on the system design. The mission fits within the rough mission\nparameters of the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) program in terms of mass and\nsize. DE-STARLITE also has much greater capability for planetary defense than\ncurrent proposals and is readily scalable to match the threat. It can deflect\nall known threats with sufficient warning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 18:37:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Apr 2016 01:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

Recent studies show\nthat YAP/TAZ mechanical sensing is dependent on RhoA-regulated stress fibers.\nHowever, current understanding of YAP/TAZ still remains limited due to the\nunknown interaction between the canonical Hippo pathway and cell tension. To\nidentify the roles of key signaling molecules in mechanical signal sensing and\ntransduction, we present a novel computational model of the YAP/TAZ signaling\npathway. This model converts ECM mechanical properties to biochemical signals\nvia adhesion, and integrates intracellular signaling cascades associated with\ncytoskeleton dynamics. Adhesion molecules, such as FAK, are predicted to rescue\nYAP/TAZ activity in soft environments via the RhoA pathway. We found that\nchanges of molecule concentrations result in different pattern of YAP/TAZ\nstiffness response. We also investigate the sensitivity of YAP/TAZ activity to\nECM stiffness. In addition, the model shows that the unresolved synergistic\neffect of YAP/TAZ activity between the mechanosensing and the Hippo pathways\ncan be explained by the interaction of LIMK and LATS. Overall, our model\nprovides a novel platform for studying YAP/TAZ activity in the context of\nintegrating different signaling pathways. This platform can be used to gain new\nfundamental insights into roles of key molecular and mechanical regulators on\ndevelopment, tissue engineering or tumor progression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 19:19:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-28"}

We search the\nfield of view of 542 previously identified members of the young associations to\nidentify wide or extremely wide (1000-100,000 au in physical separation)\ncompanions. We combined 2MASS near-infrared photometry ($J$, $H$, $K$) with\nproper motion values (from UCAC4, PPMXL, NOMAD) to identify companions in the\nfield of view of known members. We collated further photometry and spectroscopy\nfrom the literature and conducted our own high-resolution spectroscopic\nobservations for a subsample of candidate members. This complementary\ninformation allowed us to assess the efficiency of our method. We identified 84\ntargets (45: 0.2-1.3 M$_\\odot$, 17: 0.08-0.2 M$_\\odot$, 22: $<$0.08 M$_\\odot$)\nin our analysis, ten of which have been identified from spectroscopic analysis\nin previous young association works. For 33 of these 84, we were able to\nfurther assess their membership using a variety of properties (X-ray emission,\nUV excess, H$_\\alpha$, lithium and K I equivalent widths, radial velocities,\nand CaH indices). We derive a success rate of 76-88% for this technique based\non the consistency of these properties. Once confirmed, the targets identified\nin this work would significantly improve our knowledge of the lower mass end of\nthe young associations. Additionally, these targets would make an ideal new\nsample for the identification and study of planets around nearby young stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

This\nseparation occurs because the diffuse gas experiences ram pressure forces while\nthe effectively collisionless galaxies (and presumably their associated dark\nmatter halos) do not.

We find evidence for a temperature peak\nassociated with the SW relic, likely created by the same merger shock that is\npowering the relic radio emission in this region. Thus, this system is a\nrelatively rare clean example of a dissociative binary merger, which can in\nprinciple be used to place constraints on the self-interaction cross-section of\ndark matter. Low frequency radio observations reveal ultra-steep spectrum\ndiffuse radio emission that is not correlated with the X-ray, optical, or high\nfrequency radio emission.

Here we show how to overcome this\nlimitation using electrodynamic hot spots and interference effects in the\nregime of continuous-wave (CW) excitation. We introduce a set of figures of\nmerit for the localization of temperature and for the efficiency of the\nplasmonic photo-thermal effect. Our calculations show that the temperature\nlocalization in a trimer nanoparticle assembly is a complex function of the\ngeometry and sizes. Large nanoparticles in the trimer play the role of the\nnano-optical antenna whereas the small nanoparticle in the plasmonic hot spot\nacts as a nano-heater. Under the peculiar conditions, the temperature increase\ninside a nanoparticle trimer can be localized in a hot spot region at the small\nheater nanoparticle and, in this way, a thermal hot spot can be realized.\nHowever, the overall power efficiency of temperature generation in this trimer\nis much smaller than that of a single nanoparticle. We can overcome the latter\ndisadvantage by using a trimer with a nanorod. In the trimer assembly composed\nof a nanorod and two spherical nanoparticles, we observe a strong plasmonic\nFano effect that leads to the concertation of optical energy dissipation in the\nsmall heater nanorod.

The\nresponse of the plasma leads to a self-consistent electric field that\ncomplements the inductive electric field with a potential field leading to an\nelectric drift and a polarization current associated with the total field. The\nelectrodynamic models determine the charge density, $\\rho$, and the current\ndensity, ${\\bf J}$, charge starvation refers to situations where the plasma\ncannot supply $\\rho$, resulting in a gap and associated particle acceleration\nand pair creation. It is pointed out that a form of current starvation also\noccurs implying a new class of gaps. The properties of gaps are discussed,\nemphasizing that static models are unstable, the role of large-amplitude\nlongitudinal waves, and the azimuthal dependence that arises across a gap in an\noblique rotator.

Observations were carried out with the Nobeyama\n45 m telescope at 0.05 km s$^{-1}$ velocity resolution. We find that the NH$_3$\nline profile consists of two components. The quiescent main component has a\nsmall linewidth of 0.3 km s$^{-1}$ dominated by thermal motions, and the\nred-shifted wing component has a large linewidth of 1.36 km s$^{-1}$\nrepresenting turbulent motions. These components show kinetic temperatures of\n11 K and $<$ 30 K, respectively. Furthermore, there is a clear velocity offset\nbetween the NH$_3$ quiescent gas ($VLSR=3.7$ km s$^{-1}$) and the turbulent gas\n($VLSR=4.4$ km s$^{-1}$). The centroid velocity of the turbulent gas\ncorresponds to that of the surrounding gas traced by the $^{13}$CO ($J=1-0$)\nand CS ($J=2-1$) lines. LVG model calculations for CS and CO show that the\nturbulent gas has a temperature of $8-13$ K and an H$_2$ density of ~ $10^4$\ncm$^{-3}$, suggesting that the temperature of the turbulent component is also ~\n10 K. The detections of both NH$_3$ quiescent and wing components may indicate\na sharp transition from the turbulent parent cloud to the quiescent dense core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2016 00:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-27"}

As an application, we consider inferences about the\nspectral distribution of integrated covolatility (ICV) matrices of\nhigh-dimensional diffusion processes based on high-frequency data with\nmicrostructure noise. The (slightly modified) pre-averaging estimator is a\nsignal-plus-noise sample covariance matrix, and the aforementioned result,\ntogether with a (generalized) connection between the spectral distribution of\nsignal sample covariance matrices and that of the population covariance matrix,\nenables us to propose a two-step procedure to consistently estimate the\nspectral distribution of ICV for a class of diffusion processes. An alternative\napproach is further proposed, which possesses several desirable properties: it\nis more robust, it eliminates the effects of microstructure noise, and the\nasymptotic relationship that enables consistent estimation of the spectral\ndistribution of ICV is the standard Marcenko-Pastur equation.

While many researchers have developed various systems to\nbring some of the benefits of static types to dynamic languages, prior\napproaches have trouble dealing with metaprogramming, which generates code as\nthe program executes. In this paper, we propose Hummingbird, a new system that\nuses a novel technique, just-in-time static type checking, to type check Ruby\ncode even in the presence of metaprogramming. In Hummingbird, method type\nsignatures are gathered dynamically at run-time, as those methods are created.\nWhen a method is called, Hummingbird statically type checks the method body\nagainst current type signatures. Thus, Hummingbird provides thorough static\nchecks on a per-method basis, while also allowing arbitrarily complex\nmetaprogramming. For performance, Hummingbird memoizes the static type checking\npass, invalidating cached checks only if necessary. We formalize Hummingbird\nusing a core, Ruby-like language and prove it sound. To evaluate Hummingbird,\nwe applied it to six apps, including three that use Ruby on Rails, a powerful\nframework that relies heavily on metaprogramming. We found that all apps\ntypecheck successfully using Hummingbird, and that Hummingbird's performance\noverhead is reasonable. We applied Hummingbird to earlier versions of one Rails\napp and found several type errors that had been introduced and then fixed.\nLastly, we demonstrate using Hummingbird in Rails development mode to typecheck\nan app as live updates are applied to it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2016 03:04:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-14"}

Consider an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$\nvertices, and define (for $s > 0$) $\\mu_s = \\frac{1}{n}\\cdot\\sum_{v \\in V}\nd^s_v$. Our aim is to estimate $\\mu_s$ within a multiplicative error of\n$(1+\\epsilon)$ (for a given approximation parameter $\\epsilon>0$) in sublinear\ntime. We consider the sparse graph model that allows access to: uniform random\nvertices, queries for the degree of any vertex, and queries for a neighbor of\nany vertex. For the case of $s=1$ (the average degree),\n$\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ queries suffice for any constant $\\epsilon$ (Feige,\nSICOMP 06 and Goldreich-Ron, RSA 08). Gonen-Ron-Shavitt (SIDMA 11) extended\nthis result to all integral $s > 0$, by designing an algorithms that performs\n$\\widetilde{O}(n^{1-1/(s+1)})$ queries.\n  We design a new, significantly simpler algorithm for this problem. In the\nworst-case, it exactly matches the bounds of Gonen-Ron-Shavitt, and has a much\nsimpler proof. More importantly, the running time of this algorithm is\nconnected to the degeneracy of $G$. This is (essentially) the maximum density\nof an induced subgraph. For the family of graphs with degeneracy at most\n$\\alpha$, it has a query complexity of\n$\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{n^{1-1/s}}{\\mu^{1/s}_s} \\Big(\\alpha^{1/s} +\n\\min\\{\\alpha,\\mu^{1/s}_s\\}\\Big)\\right) =\n\\widetilde{O}(n^{1-1/s}\\alpha/\\mu^{1/s}_s)$. Thus, for the class of bounded\ndegeneracy graphs (which includes all minor closed families and preferential\nattachment graphs), we can estimate the average degree in $\\widetilde{O}(1)$\nqueries, and can estimate the variance of the degree distribution in\n$\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ queries. This is a major improvement over the\nprevious worst-case bounds. Our key insight is in designing an estimator for\n$\\mu_s$ that has low variance when $G$ does not have large dense subgraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2016 05:36:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2017 13:57:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-17"}

Furthermore, the combined effect of rotation and\nmagnetism is to change the shape of the main quark matter phase transition line\nin an interesting way, reducing the magnitude of its curvature; again, local\nrotation contributes to this phenomenon at least as strongly as magnetism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2016 06:44:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 01:02:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

Comets are primitive objects, remnants of the volatile-rich\nplanetesimals from which the solar system condensed.

After the\nsuccessful landing of Philae on the nucleus of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in\nNovember 2014, for the first time, the Rosetta mission provided the opportunity\nto measure the low frequency electrical properties of a cometary mantle with\nthe permittivity probe SESAME-PP (Surface Electric Sounding and Acoustic\nMonitoring Experiment - Permittivity Probe).\n  Aims. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the data from active\nmeasurements collected by SESAME-PP at Abydos, which is the final landing site\nof Philae, to constrain the porosity and, to a lesser extent, the composition\nof the surface material down to a depth of about 1 meter.\n  Methods. SESAME-PP observations on the surface are then analyzed by\ncomparison with data acquired during the descent toward the nucleus and with\nnumerical simulations that explore different possible attitudes and\nenvironments of Philae at Abydos using a method called the Capacity-Influence\nMatrix Method.\n  Results.

The\nenergy of deformation is then localized in a ridge in which the deformed and\nundeformed portions of the shell join together, commonly referred to as\nPogorelov's ridge. Rather than using an energy formulation, we revisit this\nproblem from the point of view of the shallow shell equations and perform an\nasymptotic analysis that exploits the largeness of the indentation depth. This\nreveals first that the stress profile associated with mirror buckling is\nsingular as the indenter is approached. This consequence of point indentation\nmeans that mirror buckling must be modified to incorporate the shell's bending\nstiffness close to the indenter and gives rise to an intricate asymptotic\nstructure with seven different spatial regions. This is in contrast with the\nthree regions (mirror-buckled, ridge and undeformed) that are usually assumed\nand yields new insight into the large compressive hoop stress that ultimately\ncauses the shell to buckle azimuthally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2016 08:28:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2017 17:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-21"}

Unlike earlier works which retain only point\nestimates of the frequencies, we undertake a more complete Bayesian treatment\nby estimating the posterior probability density functions (pdfs) of the\nfrequencies and computing expectations over them. Thus, we additionally capture\nand operate with the uncertainty of the frequency estimates. Aiming to maximize\nthe model evidence, variational optimization provides analytic approximations\nof the posterior pdfs and also gives estimates of the additional parameters. We\npropose an accurate representation of the pdfs of the frequencies by mixtures\nof von Mises pdfs, which yields closed-form expectations. We define the\nalgorithm VALSE in which the estimates of the pdfs and parameters are\niteratively updated. VALSE is a gridless, convergent method, does not require\nparameter tuning, can easily include prior knowledge about the frequencies and\nprovides approximate posterior pdfs based on which the uncertainty in line\nspectral estimation can be quantified.

The key idea is\nthat SUs relay the traffic of PUs in exchange for the access time on the PUs'\nlicensed spectrum. In this paper, we formulate the cooperative spectrum sharing\nbetween multiple PUs and multiple SUs as a two-sided market, and study the\nmarket equilibrium under both complete and incomplete information. First, we\ncharacterize the sufficient and necessary conditions for the market\nequilibrium. We analytically show that there may exist multiple market\nequilibria, among which there is always a unique Pareto-optimal equilibrium for\nPUs (called PU-Optimal-EQ), in which every PU achieves a utility no worse than\nin any other equilibrium. Then, we show that under complete information, the\nunique Pareto-optimal equilibrium PU-Optimal-EQ can always be achieved despite\nthe competition among PUs; whereas, under incomplete information, the\nPU-Optimal-EQ may not be achieved due to the mis-representations of SUs (in\nreporting their private information). Regarding this, we further study the\nworse-case equilibrium for PUs, and characterize a Robust equilibrium for PUs\n(called PU-Robust-EQ), which provides every PU a guaranteed utility under all\npossible mis-representation behaviors of SUs. Numerical results show that in a\ntypical network where the number of PUs and SUs are different, the performance\ngap between PU-Optimal-EQ and PU-Robust-EQ is quite small (e.g., less than 10%\nin the simulations).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2016 13:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

More\ngenerally, it is difficult and often impossible to handle towers of coherences.\nTo address this, we propose a 2-level theory which features both strict and\nweak equality. This can essentially be represented as two type theories: an\n\"outer\" one, containing a strict equality type former, and an \"inner\" one,\nwhich is some version of HoTT. Our type theory is inspired by Voevosky's\nsuggestion of a homotopy type system (HTS) which currently refers to a range of\nideas. A core insight of our proposal is that we no not need any form of\nequality reflection in order to achieve what HTS was suggested for. Instead,\nhaving unique identity proofs in the outer type theory is sufficient, and it\nalso has the meta-theoretical advantage of not breaking decidability of type\nchecking. The inner theory can be an easily justifiable extensions of HoTT,\nallowing the construction of \"infinite structures\" which are considered\nimpossible in plain HoTT. Alternatively, we can set the inner theory to be\nexactly the current standard formulation of HoTT, in which case our system can\nbe thought of as a type-theoretic framework for working with \"schematic\"\ndefinitions in HoTT.

A particular solution strategy relying on the Fast Fourier Transform is\nadopted, which has a high computational efficiency both in terms of speed and\nmemory footprint, thus enabling a statistically meaningful analysis. This\nsolution method naturally accompanies the regular microstructural model, as the\nFast Fourier Transform relies on a regular grid.\n  Using the many considered microstructures as an ensemble, the average\narrangement of phases around fracture initiation sites is objectively\nidentified by the correlation between microstructure and fracture initiation --\nin three dimensions. The results show that fracture initiates where regions of\nthe hard phase are interrupted by bands of the soft phase that are aligned with\nthe direction of maximum shear. In such regions, the hard phase is arranged\nsuch that the area of the phase boundary perpendicular to the principal strain\ndirection is maximum, leading to high hydrostatic tensile stresses, while not\ninterrupting the shear bands that form in the soft phase. The local\nincompatibility that is present around the shear bands is responsible for a\nhigh plastic strain. By comparing the response to a two-dimensional\nmicrostructure it is observed that the response is qualitatively similar (both\nmacroscopically and microscopically). One important difference is that the\nlocal strain partitioning between the two phases is over-predicted by the\ntwo-dimensional microstructure, leading to an overestimation of damage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2016 14:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-14"}

The lack of a flat Kasner metric at\nthe quantum level results from a novel feature of the loop quantum Bianchi-I\nspacetime: quantum geometry induces non-vanishing spacetime curvature\ncomponents, making it not Ricci flat even when no matter is present. The\nnon-curvature singularity of the classical flat Kasner spacetime is avoided,\nand the effective spacetime transits from a flat Kasner spacetime in asymptotic\nfuture, to a Minkowski spacetime in asymptotic past.

The research was aimed at exploring the\npotential use of wireless sensor networks as an early-warning system to help\nmitigate human-wildlife conflicts occurring at the edge of a forest. There are\nthree important features to the development. Firstly, the sensor platform\nemploys multiple sensors arranged in the form of a two-dimensional array to\ngive it a key spatial-resolution capability that aids in classification.\nSecondly, given the challenges of collecting data involving animal intrusion,\nan Animation-based Simulation tool for Passive Infra-Red sEnsor (ASPIRE) was\ndeveloped that simulates signals corresponding to human and animal intrusion\nand some limited models of vegetative clutter. This speeded up the process of\nalgorithm development by allowing us to test different hypotheses in a\ntime-efficient manner. Finally, a chirplet-based model for intruder signal was\ndeveloped that significantly helped boost classification accuracy despite\ndrawing data from a smaller number of sensors. An SVM-based classifier was used\nwhich made use of chirplet, energy and signal cross-correlation-based features.\nThe average accuracy obtained for intruder detection and classification on\nreal-world and simulated data sets was in excess of 97%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2016 15:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-14"}

To measure this orientation/attention effect, we adopt the\ncueing effect paradigm by deploying discrimination tasks at each location of an\nimage, and measure the discrimination performance variation across the image as\nthe attentional effect of the bottom-up saliency. Such attentional effects are\ncombined to construct a final bottomup saliency map.

This means that any given return can at times\nacquire a substantial probability of occurring while remaining low on average\nin time. Still, due to local character of order interaction during price\nformation the distribution width grows smoothly, has a minimum value at small\ntime scale and a square root behavior at large time scale. Examples of\ncalibration to market data, both intraday and daily, are provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2016 19:45:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 05:14:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-19"}
