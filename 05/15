The smallest QoS necessary for stabilization is shown as a\nfunction of the positive Lyapunov exponents of uncontrolled nonlinear systems.\nThe positive Lyapunov exponent is a measure of dynamical complexity and\ncaptures the rate of exponential divergence of nearby system trajectories.

Modern multivariate statistical\nmethods developed in the rapidly growing field of machine learning are being\nincreasingly applied to various problems in neuroimaging, from cognitive state\ndetection to clinical diagnosis and prognosis. Multivariate pattern analysis\nmethods are designed to examine complex relationships between high-dimensional\nsignals, such as brain images, and outcomes of interest, such as the category\nof a stimulus, a type of a mental state of a subject, or a specific mental\ndisorder. Such techniques are in contrast with the traditional mass-univariate\napproaches that dominated neuroimaging in the past and treated each individual\nimaging measurement in isolation.\n  We believe that machine learning has a prominent role in shaping how\nquestions in neuroscience are framed, and that the machine-learning mind set is\nnow entering modern psychology and behavioral studies. It is also equally\nimportant that practical applications in these fields motivate a rapidly\nevolving line or research in the machine learning community. In parallel, there\nis an intense interest in learning more about brain function in the context of\nrich naturalistic environments and scenes. Efforts to go beyond highly specific\nparadigms that pinpoint a single function, towards schemes for measuring the\ninteraction with natural and more varied scene are made. The goal of the\nworkshop is to pinpoint the most pressing issues and common challenges across\nthe neuroscience, neuroimaging, psychology and machine learning fields, and to\nsketch future directions and open questions in the light of novel methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 May 2016 16:37:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-17"}

The determination of meteoroid mass indices is central to flux\nmeasurements and evolutionary studies of meteoroid populations.

We aim to develop a fully automated method that will measure meteoroid\nmass indices and associated uncertainty. We validate our method on large radar\nand optical datasets and compare results to obtain a best estimate of the true\nmeteoroid mass index.\n  Methods. Using MultiNest, a Bayesian inference tool that calculates the\nevidence and explores the parameter space, we search for the best fit of\ncumulative number vs. mass distributions in a four-dimensional space of\nvariables ($a,b,X_1,X_2$).

When such\nmodes are present, the Hamiltonian is, in general, indefinite. Although such\nsystems with negative energy modes are linearly stable (spectral stable), they\nare unstable to infinitesimal perturbations under the nonlinear dynamics. In\nthe present work we study this kind of nonlinear instability with the simplest\nnontrivial four dimensional area-preserving map, which has a cubic degree of\nfreedom, that was designed to mimic the behavior of a Hamiltonian system with\none positive and one negative energy mode, and a quadratic degree of freedom,\nthat allows eventual escapes in phase space, usually called as Arnold\ndiffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 May 2016 18:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-17"}

In\na weakly correlated regime (U=t<~6), BRE are negligible on all the states\nstudied. As previously shown, the effective band of d-SC is greatly\nrenormalized but the modifications of physical quantities, including energy\nimprovement, are negligible. In contrast, BRE on the AF state considerably\naffects various features of the system. Because the energy is markedly improved\nfor t'/t<0, the AF state occupies almost the whole underdoped regime in phase\ndiagrams. A doped metallic AF state undergoes a kind of Lifshitz transition at\nt'= t'L~-0.05t as t'/t varies, irrespective of the values of U/t and delta\n(doping rate). Pocket Fermi surfaces arise around (pi,0)[(pi/2,pi/2)] for\nt'>t'L [t'<t'L], which corresponds to the electron-hole asymmetry observed in\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) spectra. The coexistent state\nof the two orders is possible basically for t'>t'L, because the existence of\nFermi surfaces near (pi,0) is a requisite for the electron scattering of\nq=(pi,pi). Actually, the coexistent state appears mainly for t'L/t<t'/t<~0.2 in\nthe mixed state. Nevertheless, the AF and coexisting states become unstable\ntoward phase separation for -0.05<~t'/t<~0.2 but become stable at other values\nof t'/t owing to the energy reduction by the diagonal hopping of doped holes.\nWe show that this instability does not directly correlate with the strength of\nd-SC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 2016 09:28:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-05"}

Therefore the microscopic descriptions of spontaneous\nfission and induced fission are very desirable for a unified understanding of\nvarious fission processes.\n  We propose to study the fission rates, at both low and high temperatures,\nwith microscopically calculated temperature-dependent fission barriers and\ncollective mass parameters.\n  The fission barriers are calculated by the finite-temperature\nSkyrme-Hartree-Fock+BCS method. The mass parameters are calculated by the\ntemperature-dependent cranking approximation. The thermal fission rates can be\nobtained by the imaginary free energy approach at all temperatures, in which\nfission barriers are naturally temperature dependent. The fission at low\ntemperatures can be described mainly as a barrier-tunneling process. While the\nfission at high temperatures has to incorporate the reflection above barriers.\nOur results of spontaneous fission rates reasonably agree with other studies\nand experiments. The temperature dependencies of fission barrier heights and\ncurvatures have been discussed. The temperature dependent behaviors of mass\nparameters have also been discussed.

This model is\nsufficiently simple and concise to enable designing a closed-loop controller,\ncapable of accurate vertical positioning of a carried object. The near-field\nacoustic levitation phenomenon exploits the compressibility, the nonlinearity\nand the viscosity of the gas trapped between a rapidly oscillating surface and\na freely suspended planar object, to elevate its time averaged pressure above\nthe ambient pressure. By these means, the vertical position of loads weighing\nup to several kilograms can be varied between dozens and hundreds of\nmicrometers. The simplified model developed in this paper is a second order\nordinary differential equation where the height-dependent stiffness and damping\nterms of the gas layer are derived explicitly. This simplified model replaces a\ntraditional model consisting of the equation of motion of the levitated object,\ncoupled to a nonlinear partial differential equation, accounting for the\nbehavior of the entrapped gas. Due to the relatively simple form of the model\ndeveloped here, it constitutes a convenient foundation for model based control\nalgorithms, governing the slow dynamics of near-field acoustically levitated\nobjects. Indeed, based on the former, a height dependent, gain scheduled PID\ncontroller is developed and verified numerically and experimentally, both\nproviding satisfying results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 2016 13:14:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-29"}

Then, we develop a mean-field theory to describe the proposed model.\nFrom theoretical analyses and numerical simulations, we find that behavior\nadoption in the social contagions exhibits a hierarchical feature, i.e., the\nbehavior first quickly spreads in one of the communities, and then outbreaks in\nthe other. Moreover, under different behavioral information transmission rates,\nthe final behavior adoption proportion in the whole network versus the\ncommunity strength shows one of the patterns, which are a monotone increasing\npattern, a non-monotonic changing pattern, and a monotone decreasing pattern.\nAn optimal community strength maximizing the final behavior adoption can be\nfound in a suitable range of behavioral information transmission rate.

On the other hand, the emergence of the chiral\nmagnetic effect as an equilibrium current is still controversial. We propose a\npossible realization of the chiral magnetic effect as an equilibrium current\nusing inhomogeneous magnetic fields.

However,\ncomputing the real-time dynamics in gauge theories is a notorious challenge for\nclassical computational methods. In the spirit of Feynman's vision of a quantum\nsimulator, this has recently stimulated theoretical effort to devise schemes\nfor simulating such theories on engineered quantum-mechanical devices, with the\ndifficulty that gauge invariance and the associated local conservation laws\n(Gauss laws) need to be implemented. Here we report the first experimental\ndemonstration of a digital quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory, by\nrealising 1+1-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (Schwinger model) on a\nfew-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer. We are interested in the real-time\nevolution of the Schwinger mechanism, describing the instability of the bare\nvacuum due to quantum fluctuations, which manifests itself in the spontaneous\ncreation of electron-positron pairs. To make efficient use of our quantum\nresources, we map the original problem to a spin model by eliminating the gauge\nfields in favour of exotic long-range interactions, which have a direct and\nefficient implementation on an ion trap architecture. We explore the Schwinger\nmechanism of particle-antiparticle generation by monitoring the mass production\nand the vacuum persistence amplitude. Moreover, we track the real-time\nevolution of entanglement in the system, which illustrates how particle\ncreation and entanglement generation are directly related. Our work represents\na first step towards quantum simulating high-energy theories with atomic\nphysics experiments, the long-term vision being the extension to real-time\nquantum simulations of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 2016 15:57:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-28"}
