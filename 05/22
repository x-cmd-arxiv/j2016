These two domains\nshare the same feature space and class label space, but have significantly\ndifferent distributions. One domain has sufficient labels, named as source\ndomain, and the other domain has few labels, named as target do- main. The\nproblem is to learn a effective classifier for the target domain. In this\npaper, we propose a novel transfer learning method for this problem by learning\na partially shared classifier for the target domain, and weighting the source\ndomain data points. We learn some shared subspaces for both the data points of\nthe two domains, and a shared classifier in the shared subspaces. We hope that\nin the shared subspaces, the distributions of two domain can match each other\nwell, and to match the distributions, we weight the source domain data points\nwith different weighting factors. Moreover, we adapt the shared classifier to\neach domain by learning different adaptation functions. To learn the subspace\ntransformation matrices, the classifier parameters, and the adaptation\nparameters, we build a objective function with weighted clas- sification\nerrors, parameter regularization, local reconstruction regularization, and\ndistribution matching. This objective function is minimized by an itera- tive\nalgorithm.

In this work we study how various orbital (period, mass\nratio and eccentricity) and disc (viscosity) parameters affect the disc\nstructure in coplanar systems. We simulate such binaries with the use of a\nsmoothed particle hydrodynamics code. The main effects of the secondary on the\ndisc are its truncation and the accumulation of material inwards of truncation.\nWe find two cases with respect to the effects of eccentricity: (i) In circular\nor nearly circular prograde orbits, the disc maintains a rotating, constant in\nshape, configuration, which is locked to the orbital phase. The disc is smaller\nin size, more elongated and more massive for low viscosity parameter, small\norbital separation and/or high mass ratio. (ii) Highly eccentric orbits are\nmore complex, with the disc structure and total mass strongly dependent on the\norbital phase and the distance to the secondary. We also study the effects of\nbinarity in the disc continuum emission. Since the infrared and radio SED are\nsensitive to the disc size and density slope, the truncation and matter\naccumulation result in considerable modifications in the emergent spectrum.

When comparing high power\nperformance of piezoelectric materials of varying compositions and vibration\nmodes, there exists an inherent problem in comparing the mechanical quality\nfactor directly. Typically the behavior of the mechanical quality factor is\nreported as a function of tip vibration velocity of the sample. This paper\nshows why this approach can be inherently problematic and proposes an energy\napproach to characterize the mechanical quality factor as the solution. By\nutilizing mechanical energy density ($u_{e}$), the mass density of the material\nsystem ($\\rho$), and the vibration mode shape (e.g. $k_{31}$ and $k_{p}$) of\nthe sample are accounted for. Therefore, a better method to compare high power\nperformance of varying piezoelectric compositions is introduced. Furthermore,\nthe new method is applied to various compositions by using data available in\nthe literature. As a result, the high power behavior of the materials appear to\nbe significantly different when the new \"energy density approach\" is used to\ncompare the mechanical quality factor rather than vibration velocity. Also, the\ntechnique's ability to be utilized to consolidate data from different\nresonators to determine anisotropic loss factors is demonstrated on hard and\nsoft PZT samples of $k_{31}$ and $k_{p}$ geometries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 May 2016 18:48:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

To this end, we first\npropose a new isotropic potential for description of the plastic behavior of\nthe matrix that depends on both invariants of the strain-rate deviator. The\nrelative weight of the two invariants is described by a material parameter b.\nDepending on the sign of the parameter b, the new plastic potential for the\nmatrix is either interior to von Mises strain-rate potential (b <0), coincides\nwith it (b =0) or it is exterior to it. Next, an analytic criterion for a\nporous solid with matrix governed by the new strain-rate potential is obtained\nusing rigorous upscaling methods. Analysis is conducted for both tensile and\ncompressive axisymmetric loading scenarios and spherical void geometry. No\nsimplifying approximations are considered when estimating the local and overall\nplastic dissipation, respectively.

If this\nevidence is validated but the planet is disproved, the claims of other planets\nusing RVs will be seriously challenged.\n  We also describe a significant revision to the previously published RVs and\nthe full set of 1437 RVs now encompasses nearly 13 years. The sensitive orbital\ndynamics allow us to constrain the three-dimensional architecture with a broad\nprior probability distribution on the mutual inclination, which with posterior\nsamples obtained from an N-body Markov chain Monte Carlo is found to be 158.4\n+/- 1.2 deg. None of these samples are dynamically stable beyond 1 Myr.\nHowever, a grid search around the best-fitting solution finds a region that has\nmany models stable for 10 Myr, and includes one model within 1-sigma that is\nstable for at least 100 Myr. The planet's exceptional nature demands robust\nindependent verification and makes the theoretical understanding of its\nformation a worthy challenge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 May 2016 00:59:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jul 2016 05:41:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-28"}

Our dataset, spanning three epochs spaced\napart by a year during each of two periods (in 2002-2004 and 2011-2013), shows\nthat V Hya ejects high-speed (about 200-250 km/s) bullets once every ~8.5 yr.\nThe ejection axis flip-flops around a roughly eastern direction, both in and\nperpendicular to the sky-plane, and the radial velocities of the ejecta also\nvary in concert between low and high values.

In this paper we study the ability\nof convolutional networks to model correlations among regions of their input.\nWe theoretically analyze convolutional arithmetic circuits, and empirically\nvalidate our findings on other types of convolutional networks as well.\nCorrelations are formalized through the notion of separation rank, which for a\ngiven partition of the input, measures how far a function is from being\nseparable. We show that a polynomially sized deep network supports\nexponentially high separation ranks for certain input partitions, while being\nlimited to polynomial separation ranks for others. The network's pooling\ngeometry effectively determines which input partitions are favored, thus serves\nas a means for controlling the inductive bias. Contiguous pooling windows as\ncommonly employed in practice favor interleaved partitions over coarse ones,\norienting the inductive bias towards the statistics of natural images. Other\npooling schemes lead to different preferences, and this allows tailoring the\nnetwork to data that departs from the usual domain of natural imagery.

We present a new nonlinear mixed-effects scalar-on-function regression\nmodel with a Gaussian process prior focusing on variable selection from large\nnumber of candidates including both scalar and function variables. A novel\nvariable selection algorithm has been developed, namely functional least angle\nregression (fLARS). As they are essential for this algorithm, we studied the\nrepresentation of functional variables with different methods and the\ncorrelation between a scalar and a group of mixed scalar and functional\nvariables. We also propose two new stopping rules for practical usage.\n  This algorithm is able to do variable selection when the number of variables\nis larger than the sample size. It is efficient and accurate for both variable\nselection and parameter estimation. Our comprehensive simulation study showed\nthat the method is superior to other existing variable selection methods. When\nthe algorithm was applied to the analysis of the 3D kinetic movement data the\nuse of the non linear random-effects model and the function variables\nsignificantly improved the prediction accuracy for the clinical assessment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 May 2016 12:23:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

These differences may yield different predictions and parameter\nestimates from the same data. Given the increasing use of models to inform\npublic health decision-making, it is important to assess distinguishability\n(whether models can be distinguished based on fit to data) and inference\nrobustness (whether model inferences are robust to realistic variations in\nmodel structure). We examined the effects of uncertainty in model structure in\nepidemic cholera, testing a range of models based on known features of cholera\nepidemiology. We fit to simulated epidemic and long-term data, as well as data\nfrom the 2006 Angola epidemic. We evaluated model distinguishability based on\ndata fit, and whether parameter values and forecasts can accurately be inferred\nfrom incidence data. In general, all models were able to successfully fit to\nall data sets, even if misspecified. However, in the long-term data, the best\nmodel fits were achieved when the loss of immunity form matched those of the\nmodel that simulated the data. Two transmission and reporting parameters were\naccurately estimated across all models, while the remaining showed broad\nvariation across the different models and data sets. Forecasting efforts were\nnot successful early, but once the epidemic peak had been achieved, most models\nshowed similar accuracy. Our results suggest that we are unlikely to be able to\ninfer mechanistic details from epidemic case data alone, underscoring the need\nfor broader data collection. Nonetheless, with sufficient data, conclusions\nfrom forecasting and some parameter estimates were robust to variations in the\nmodel structure, and comparative modeling can help determine how variations in\nmodel structure affect conclusions drawn from models and data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 May 2016 13:35:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

The paper might affect group isomorphism also as we may\nconstruct graphs (corresponds to a particular group) in way so we can avoid it\nto be a triangle free graph. Since,for a given group G , each choice of a\ngenerating set will give a different Cayley graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 May 2016 22:58:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jun 2016 16:31:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-02"}
