Several\nfields, such as medical imaging, routinely use numerous very large images,\nwhich might also be 3D and/or captured at several frequency bands, all adding\nto the computational expense. Multiresolution analysis is a method of\nincreasing the efficiency of the segmentation process. One multiresolution\napproach is the coarse-to-fine segmentation strategy, whereby the segmentation\nstarts at a coarse resolution and is then fine-tuned during subsequent steps.\nThe starting resolution for segmentation is generally selected arbitrarily with\nno clear selection criteria. The research reported in this paper showed that\nstarting from different resolutions for image segmentation results in different\naccuracies and computational times, even for images of the same category\n(depicting similar scenes or objects). An automated method for resolution\nselection for an input image would thus be beneficial. This paper introduces a\nframework for the automated selection of the best resolution for image\nsegmentation. We propose a measure for defining the best resolution based on\nuser/system criteria, offering a trade-off between accuracy and computation\ntime. A learning approach is then introduced for the selection of the\nresolution, whereby extracted image features are mapped to the previously\ndetermined best resolution. In the learning process, class (i.e., resolution)\ndistribution is generally imbalanced, making effective learning from the data\ndifficult. Experiments conducted with three datasets using two different\nsegmentation algorithms show that the resolutions selected through learning\nenable much faster segmentation than the original ones, while retaining at\nleast the original accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 May 2016 17:09:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

The most studied TMs,\ni.e., Weyl and Dirac semimetals, feature quasiparticles that are direct\nanalogues of the textbook elementary particles. Moreover, the TMs known so far\ncan be characterized based on the dimensionality of the band crossing. While\nWeyl and Dirac semimetals feature zero-dimensional points, the band crossing of\nnodal-line semimetals forms a one-dimensional closed loop. In this paper, we\nidentify a TM which breaks the above paradigms. Firstly, the TM features\ntriply-degenerate band crossing in a symmorphic lattice, hence realizing\nemergent fermionic quasiparticles not present in quantum field theory.\nSecondly, the band crossing is neither 0D nor 1D. Instead, it consists of two\nisolated triply-degenerate nodes interconnected by multi-segments of lines with\ntwo-fold degeneracy. We present materials candidates. We further show that\ntriplydegenerate band crossings in symmorphic crystals give rise to a Landau\nlevel spectrum distinct from the known TMs, suggesting novel magneto-transport\nresponses. Our results open the door for realizing new topological phenomena\nand fermions including transport anomalies and spectroscopic responses in\nmetallic crystals with nontrivial topology beyond the Weyl/Dirac paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 May 2016 18:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-14"}

Often biological processes are mediated by a network of developmental\nand physiological components and, therefore, are better described by multiple\nphenotypes. In this article, we develop a multivariate model for functional\nmapping that can detect and characterize quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that\nsimultaneously control multiple dynamic traits. Because the true genotypes of\nQTLs are unknown, the measurements for the multiple dynamic traits are modeled\nusing a mixture distribution. The functional means of the multiple dynamic\ntraits are estimated using the nonparametric regression method, which avoids\nany parametric assumption on the functional means. We propose the profile\nlikelihood method to estimate the mixture model.

Experimental results demonstrate that it is at least as good as\nany other spanner construction, in terms of both the size and weight\nparameters. However, a rigorous proof for this statement has remained elusive.\n  In this work we fill in the theoretical gap via a surprisingly simple\nobservation: The greedy spanner is \\emph{existentially optimal} (or\nexistentially near-optimal) for several important graph families, in terms of\nboth the size and weight. Roughly speaking, the greedy spanner is said to be\nexistentially optimal (or near-optimal) for a graph family $\\mathcal G$ if the\nworst performance of the greedy spanner over all graphs in $\\mathcal G$ is just\nas good (or nearly as good) as the worst performance of an optimal spanner over\nall graphs in $\\mathcal G$.\n  Focusing on the weight parameter, the state-of-the-art spanner constructions\nfor both general graphs (due to Chechik and Wulff-Nilsen [SODA'16]) and\ndoubling metrics (due to Gottlieb [FOCS'15]) are complex. Plugging our\nobservation on these results, we conclude that the greedy spanner achieves\nnear-optimal weight guarantees for both general graphs and doubling metrics,\nthus resolving two longstanding conjectures in the area.\n  Further, we observe that approximate-greedy spanners are existentially\nnear-optimal as well. Consequently, we provide an $O(n \\log n)$-time\nconstruction of $(1+\\epsilon)$-spanners for doubling metrics with constant\nlightness and degree. Our construction improves Gottlieb's construction, whose\nruntime is $O(n \\log^2 n)$ and whose number of edges and degree are unbounded,\nand remarkably, it matches the state-of-the-art Euclidean result (due to\nGudmundsson et al.\\ [SICOMP'02]) in all the involved parameters (up to\ndependencies on $\\epsilon$ and the dimension).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 May 2016 20:45:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2020 22:59:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

In approaches that ignore the\ntime dimension and treat dynamic obstacles as static, frequent re-planning is\nunavoidable as the obstacles move, and their solutions are generally\nsub-optimal and can be incomplete. To achieve both optimality and completeness,\nit is necessary to consider the time dimension during planning. The notion of\nadaptive dimensionality has been successfully used in high-dimensional motion\nplanning such as manipulation of robot arms, but has not been used in the\ncontext of path planning in dynamic environments. In this paper, we apply the\nidea of adaptive dimensionality to speed up path planning in dynamic\nenvironments for a robot with no assumptions on its dynamic model.\nSpecifically, our approach considers the time dimension only in those regions\nof the environment where a potential collision may occur, and plans in a\nlow-dimensional state-space elsewhere. We show that our approach is complete\nand is guaranteed to find a solution, if one exists, within a cost\nsub-optimality bound. We experimentally validate our method on the problem of\n3D vehicle navigation (x, y, heading) in dynamic environments. Our results show\nthat the presented approach achieves substantial speedups in planning time over\n4D heuristic-based A*, especially when the resulting plan deviates\nsignificantly from the one suggested by the heuristic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 May 2016 21:08:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

We study analytically the effect\nof an extended confinement on the structure of the edge modes. We employ the\nsimplest model of the extended confinement in the form of potential step next\nto the hard wall. It is shown that, unlike the conventional quantum Hall\neffect, where all edge channels are chiral, in QAH effect, a complex structure\nof the boundary leads to nonchiral edge modes which are present on both sides\nof the ferromagnetic transition. Wave functions of nonchiral modes are\ndifferent above and below the transition: on the \"topological\" side, where the\nchiral edge mode is supported, nonchiral modes are \"repelled\" from the\nboundary, i.e. they are much less localized than on the \"trivial\" side. Thus,\nthe disorder-induced scattering into these modes will boost the extension of\nthe chiral edge mode. The prime experimental manifestation of nonchiral modes\nis that, by contributing to longitudinal resistance, they smear the QAH\ntransition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 May 2016 21:47:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

Extensive experiments on real and\nbenchmark data show that compared to the state-of-the-arts, ROSIE consistently\noutperformed on complex queries by orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 00:00:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

The second order force have a similar behavior with the larger decay\nfactor, namely $3\\over 2$. We make use of these properties to construct the\nkink lattice.

Since the\nmodel is Turing-complete, we propose a decidable underapproximation. First,\nusing a restriction similar to context-bounding, we underapproximate the global\ncontrol by a weak global control (i.e. DAGs possibly with self-loops), thereby\nlimiting the number of synchronisations between different threads. Second, we\nbound the number of reversals between non-decrementing and non-incrementing\nmodes of the counters. Under this restriction, we show that reachability\nbecomes NP-complete. In fact, it is poly-time reducible to satisfaction over\nexistential Presburger formulas, which allows one to tap into highly optimised\nSMT solvers. Our decidable approximation strictly generalises known decidable\nmodels including (i) weakly-synchronised ground-tree rewrite systems, and (ii)\nsynchronisation/reversal-bounded concurrent pushdown systems systems with\ncounters.

Within the framework of molecular geometrical\nsymmetry, we find a possibility that the Z = 12, N = 12 system would form an\noctahedral structure consisting of six points of alpha(4He) particles, yielding\nthe ground collectivity. With this point of view, we draw the following serial\nmolecular structures; the Z = 10, N = 10, 20Ne, corresponds to a hexahedral,\nthe Z = 8, N = 8, 16O, does to a tetrahedral, and the Z = 6, N = 6, 12C, does\nto a trigonal symmetry. Moreover, the Z = 2, N = 2, 4He(alpha), fits into a\ntetrahedral symmetry with four points of nucleons; two protons and two\nneutrons. The enhanced deformation at Z = 12 with N > 20 would be explained by\na deformed shape related to an Ethene(Ethylene)-like skeleton with six alpha\nparticles. The deformation at Z = 10, with N = 10 and 12, can be interpreted as\nbeing attributed to a hexahedral shape combined by five alpha particles as\nwell. By noticing that the Z = 4, N = 4 system is unstable to the ground state\nunder two-body system with two alpha particles, we conclude that alpha\nparticles, rather than the eight-protons-neutrons nucleon, govern the 8Be\nstability. Accordingly, the alpha particle should be a third nucleon, like a\nproton or a neutron, in a nucleus. We name it the 'Alpharon'. With this\npicture, we are able to open a new gate toward understanding of nuclear\nmany-body systems; nucleon-nucleon interaction, shell structures,\nnucleon-synthesis, and nuclear matters.

A pivotal recovery metric upon\nthe failure of a storage node is repair bandwidth cost which refers to the\namount of data that must be downloaded for regenerating the lost data. Since\nall the surviving nodes are not always accessible, we intend to introduce a\nclass of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes that can be re-used when the\nnumber of selected nodes varies yet yields close to optimal repair bandwidth.\nSuch codes provide flexibility in engaging more surviving nodes in favor of\nreducing the repair bandwidth without redesigning the code structure and\nchanging the content of the existing nodes. We call this property of MDS codes\nprogressive engagement. This name comes from the fact that if a failure occurs,\nit is shown that the best strategy is to incrementally engage the surviving\nnodes according to their accessing cost (delay, number of hops, traffic load or\navailability in general) until the repair-bandwidth or accessing cost\nconstraints are met. We argue that the existing MDS codes fail to satisfy the\nprogressive engagement property. We subsequently present a search algorithm to\nfind a new set of codes named rotation codes that has both progressive\nengagement and MDS properties. Furthermore, we illustrate how the existing\npermutation codes can provide progressive engagement by modifying the original\nrecovery scheme. Simulation results are presented to compare the repair\nbandwidth performance of such codes when the number of participating nodes\nvaries as well as their speed of single failure recovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 08:16:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

Despite recent\nadvances in developing scalable solvers, there are still many problems which\nare often very hard to solve. Typically the most advanced solvers include\nelements which are stochastic in nature. If a same instance is solved many\ntimes using different seeds then depending on the inherent characteristics of a\nproblem instance and the solver, one can observe a highly-variant distribution\nof times spanning multiple orders of magnitude. Therefore, to solve a problem\ninstance efficiently it is often useful to solve the same instance in parallel\nwith different seeds. With the proliferation of cloud computing, it is natural\nto think about an elastic solver which can scale up by launching searches in\nparallel on thousands of machines (or cores). However, this could result in\nconsuming a lot of energy. Moreover, not every instance would require thousands\nof machines. The challenge is to resolve the tradeoff between solution time and\nenergy consumption optimally for a given problem instance. We analyse the\nimpact of the number of machines (or cores) on not only solution time but also\non energy consumption. We highlight that although solution time always drops as\nthe number of machines increases, the relation between the number of machines\nand energy consumption is more complicated. In many cases, the optimal energy\nconsumption may be achieved by a middle ground, we analyse this relationship in\ndetail. The tradeoff between solution time and energy consumption is studied\nfurther, showing that the energy consumption of a solver can be reduced\ndrastically if we increase the solution time marginally. We also develop a\nprediction model, demonstrating that such insights can be exploited to achieve\nfaster solutions times in a more energy efficient manor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 08:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

We used a set of HARPS, SOPHIE, and\nELODIE radial velocities to search for the existence of orbiting companions to\nHD219828. A dynamical analysis is also performed to study the stability of the\nsystem and to constrain the orbital parameters and planet masses.

The same data confirms the\nexistence of a hot-neptune, HD219828b, with a minimum mass of 21 MEarth and a\nperiod of 3.83days. The dynamical analysis shows that the system is stable. The\nHD219828 system is extreme and unique in several aspects. First, among all\nknown exoplanet systems it presents an unusually high mass ratio. We also show\nthat systems like HD219828, with a hot neptune and a long-period massive\ncompanion are more frequent than similar systems with a hot jupiter instead.\nThis suggests that the formation of hot neptunes follows a different path than\nthe formation of their hot jovian counterparts.

Our new method delivers mean absolute deviations (MADs)\nfor main group bond lengths that are consistently below 1\\,pm, rotational\nconstants with MADs of 0.2\\%, and noncovalent distances with MADs below 1\\%.\nFor a large database of general main group thermochemistry and kinetics, it\nalso delivers a weighted mean absolute deviation below 4 kcal/mol, one of the\nlowest for long-range corrected meta-GGA functionals. We also discuss some\nconsequences of numerical sensitivity encountered for meta-GGAs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 11:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

We find in total 20 off-nuclear sources with luminosities above\nthe ULX limit, 14 of which are point-like sources. Furthermore we observe a\nmarginally significant deficit in the number of ULXs, with respect to the\nnumber expected from scaling relations of X-ray binaries with the star\nformation rate (SFR). Although the high metalicity of the galaxy could result\nin lower ULX numbers, the good agreement between the observed total X-ray\nluminosity of ULXs, and that expected from the relevant scaling relation\nindicates that this deficit could be the result of confusion effects. The\nintegrated spectrum of the galaxy shows the presence of a hot gaseous component\nwith kT = 0.72+-0.03 keV, contributing 20% of the soft (0.1-2.0 keV) unabsorbed\nluminosity of the galaxy.

We here advance an alternative\nformulation, where the RG-flow is organized in the energy-domain rather than in\nk-space. This has the advantage that it can also be applied to inhomogeneous\nmatter lacking a band-structure, such as disordered metals or molecules. The\nenergy-domain FRG ({\\epsilon}FRG) presented here accounts for Fermi-liquid\ncorrections to quasi-particle energies and particle-hole excitations.

B-Tree\napproach allows to determine the structure without any supervised learning or a\npriori knowlwdge. The space is Euclidean and isotropic. Unfortunately, there\nare no B-Tree implementations processing indices in a symmetrical and\nisotropical way.

While nonadiabatic\ncouplings generally lead to entanglement and to a failure of the BO\napproximation, surprisingly the degree of electron-nuclear entanglement is\nfound to be uncorrelated with the degree of validity of the BO approximation.\nThis is because while the degree of entanglement of BO states is determined by\ntheir deviation from the corresponding states in the crude BO approximation,\nthe accuracy of the BO approximation is dictated, instead, by the deviation of\nthe BO states from the exact electron-nuclear states. In fact, in the context\nof a minimal avoided crossing model, extreme cases are identified where an\nadequate BO state is seen to be maximally entangled, and where the BO\napproximation fails but the associated BO state remains approximately\nunentangled. Further, the BO states are found to not preserve the entanglement\nproperties of the exact electron-nuclear eigenstates, and to be completely\nunentangled only in the limit in which the BO approximation becomes exact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 14:39:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

The waves are probably driven by\nphotospheric motions and may transport energy up to prominences suspended in\nthe corona. Dissipation of wave energy can lead to heating of the cool\nprominence plasma, so contributing to the local energy balance within the\nprominence. Here we discuss the role of Alfv\\'en wave dissipation as a heating\nmechanism for the prominence plasma. We consider a slab-like quiescent\nprominence model with a transverse magnetic field embedded in the solar corona.\nThe prominence medium is modelled as a partially ionized plasma composed of a\ncharged ion-electron single fluid and two separate neutral fluids corresponding\nto neutral hydrogen and neutral helium. Friction between the three fluids acts\nas a dissipative mechanism for the waves. The heating caused by\nexternally-driven Alfv\\'en waves incident on the prominence slab is\nanalytically explored. We find that the dense prominence slab acts as a\nresonant cavity for the waves. The fraction of incident wave energy that is\nchannelled into the slab strongly depends upon the wave period, $P$. Using\ntypical prominence conditions, we obtain that wave energy trapping and\nassociated heating are negligible when $P \\gtrsim 100$ s, so that it is\nunlikely that those waves have a relevant influence on prominence energetics.\nWhen $1$ s $\\lesssim P \\lesssim 100$ s the energy absorption into the slab\nshows several sharp and narrow peaks, that can reach up to 100%, when the\nincident wave frequency matches a cavity resonance of the slab. Wave heating is\nenhanced at those resonant frequencies. Conversely, when $P \\lesssim 1$ s\ncavity resonances are absent, but the waves are heavily damped by the strong\ndissipation. We estimate that wave heating may compensate for about 10% of\nradiative losses of the prominence plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 15:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}

Based on principles from\ninformation theory, we have previously developed a new population genetic\nmodel, and applying it in simulations, we have recently hypothesized that all\nspecies maintain the maximum genomic complexity that is required by their niche\nand allowed by their mutation rate and selection intensity. Applying this idea\nto the complexity overhead of recombination maintenance, its costs must be more\nthan compensated by an additional capacity for complexity in recombining\npopulations. Here, we show a simple mechanism, where recombination helps to\nmaintain larger biases of alleles frequencies in a population, so the\nadvantageous alleles can have increased frequency. This allows recombining\npopulations to maintain higher fitness and phenotypic efficiency in comparison\nwith asexual populations with the same parameters. Random mating alone already\nsignificantly increases the ability to maintain genomic and phenotypic\ncomplexity. Sexual selection provides additional capacity for this complexity.\nThe model can be considered as a unifying synthesis of previous hypotheses\nabout the roles of recombination in Muller's ratchet, mutation purging and Red\nQueen dynamics, because the introduction of recombination both increases\npopulation frequencies of beneficial alleles and decreases detrimental ones. In\naddition, we suggest simple explanations for niche-dependent prevalence of\ntransient asexuality and the exceptional asexual lineage of Bdelloid rotifers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 15:14:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

During metaphase in the early C. elegans embryo, the spindle\nis aligned and centered on the anterior-posterior axis by a\nmicrotubule-dependent machinery that exerts restoring forces when the spindle\nis displaced from the center. To investigate the accuracy and stability of\ncentering, we tracked the position and orientation of the mitotic spindle\nduring the first cell division with high temporal and spatial resolution. We\nfound that the precision is remarkably high: the cell-to-cell variation in the\ntransverse position of the center of the spindle during metaphase, as measured\nby the standard deviation, was only 1.5% of the length of the short axis of the\ncell. Spindle position is also very stable: the standard deviation of the\nfluctuations in transverse spindle position during metaphase was only 0.5% of\nthe short axis of the cell. Assuming that stability is limited by fluctuations\nin the number of independent motor elements such as microtubules or dyneins\nunderlying the centering machinery, we infer that the number is on the order of\none thousand, consistent with the several thousand of astral microtubules in\nthese cells. Astral microtubules grow out from the two spindle poles, make\ncontact with the cell cortex, and then shrink back shortly thereafter. The high\nstability of centering can be accounted for quantitatively if, while making\ncontact with the cortex, the astral microtubules buckle as they exert\ncompressive, pushing forces. We thus propose that the large number of\nmicrotubules in the asters provides a highly precise mechanism for positioning\nthe spindle during metaphase while assembly is completed prior to the onset of\nanaphase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 15:14:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 06:36:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

Our aim is to improve the precision of\nthe radius measurements for the stars in AI Phe using high-precision photometry\nfrom WASP, and use these improved radius measurements together with estimates\nof the masses, temperatures and composition of the stars to place constraints\non the mixing length, helium abundance and age of the system. A best-fit ebop\nmodel is used to obtain lightcurve parameters, with their standard errors\ncalculated using a prayer-bead algorithm. These were combined with previously\npublished spectroscopic orbit results, to obtain masses and radii. A Bayesian\nmethod is used to estimate the age of the system for model grids with different\nmixing lengths and helium abundances.

Although elegant, the application of\nGPs is limited by computational and analytical intractabilities that arise when\ndata are sufficiently numerous or when employing non-Gaussian models.\nConsequently, a wealth of GP approximation schemes have been developed over the\nlast 15 years to address these key limitations. Many of these schemes employ a\nsmall set of pseudo data points to summarise the actual data. In this paper, we\ndevelop a new pseudo-point approximation framework using Power Expectation\nPropagation (Power EP) that unifies a large number of these pseudo-point\napproximations. Unlike much of the previous venerable work in this area, the\nnew framework is built on standard methods for approximate inference\n(variational free-energy, EP and Power EP methods) rather than employing\napproximations to the probabilistic generative model itself. In this way, all\nof approximation is performed at `inference time' rather than at `modelling\ntime' resolving awkward philosophical and empirical questions that trouble\nprevious approaches. Crucially, we demonstrate that the new framework includes\nnew pseudo-point approximation methods that outperform current approaches on\nregression and classification tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 15:53:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 16:26:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 14:58:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

Motivated by online platforms that rely on individual item scores\nfor content recommendation and team selection, we propose a special class of\nalgorithms that select items based solely on individual performance measures\nknown as test scores. The central contribution of this work is a novel and\nsystematic framework for designing test score based algorithms for a broad\nclass of naturally occurring utility functions. We introduce a new scoring\nmechanism that we refer to as replication test scores and prove that as long as\nthe objective function satisfies a diminishing returns property, one can\nleverage these scores to compute solutions that are within a constant factor of\nthe optimum.

For this more difficult problem, we show that replication test scores\ncan be used to develop an algorithm that approximates the optimum solution up\nto a logarithmic factor.

As a strong candidate for the applications among the limited list of\nsingle-phase multiferroic materials, BiFeO3 (BFO) is a quite attractive\nmaterial due to its multiferroic properties at room temperature (RT). However,\nBFO is widely known to have large leakage current and small spontaneous\npolarization due to the existence of crystalline defects such as oxygen\nvacancies. Furthermore, the magnetic moment of pure BFO is very weak owing to\nits antiferromagnetic nature. In this paper, the effects of Ni2+ substitution\non the magnetic properties of bulk BFO have been investigated.

This model is studied by the following\ntwo mutually parallel methods: the Wilson--Polchinski functional\nrenormalization group method (FRG), which is based on the exact functional\nequation for the generating functional of amputated connected Green's functions\n(ACGF), and the Heemskerk--Polchinski holographic renormalization group method\n(HRG), which is based on the functional Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equation for the\nholographic boundary action. Both functional equations are equivalent to\ninfinite hierarchies of integro-differential equations (coupled in the FRG\ncase) for the corresponding families of Green's functions (GF). The RG-flow\nequations can be derived explicitly for two-particle functions. Because the\nHRG-flow equation is closed (contains only a two-particle GF), the explicit\nanalytic solutions are obtained for the two-particle GF (in terms of the\nmodified Bessel functions $I$ and $K$) in the framework of the minimal\nholographic model and its simple generalization, and these solutions have a\nremarkable property of minimal dependence on the details of the random force\ncorrelator (the function of the energy pumping into the system).
