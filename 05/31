This result both motivates\nit's use and offers insight into computationally efficient design. For\ninstance, traditional representations of kinetic energy exploit the generalized\ninertia matrix whose derivatives are usually difficult to compute. We introduce\nhere a novel reformulation of rigid body kinetic energy designed explicitly for\nfast and accurate curvature calculation. Our theorem proves that the\nGauss-Newton Hessian under this formulation efficiently captures the kinetic\nenergy curvature, but requires only as much computation as a single evaluation\nof the traditional representation.

Inferring the\nsub-surface flow profile of supergranules from measurements of the surface and\nphotospheric wavefield is an important challenge faced by helioseismology.\nTraditionally, the inverse problem has been approached by studying the linear\nresponse of seismic waves in a horizontally translationally invariant\nbackground to the presence of the supergranule; following an iterative approach\nthat does not depend on horizontal translational invariance might perform\nbetter, since the misfit can be analyzed post iterations. In this work, we\nconstruct synthetic observations using a reference supergranule, and invert for\nthe flow profile using surface measurements of travel-times of waves belonging\nto modal ridges $f$ (surface-gravity) and $p_{1}$ through $p_{7}$ (acoustic).\nWe study the extent to which individual modes and their combinations contribute\nto infer the flow. We show that this method of non-linear iterative inversion\ntends to underestimate the flow velocities as well as inferring a shallower\nflow profile, with significant deviations from the reference supergranule near\nthe surface. We carry out a similar analysis for a sound-speed perturbation and\nfind that analogous near-surface deviations persist, although the iterations\nconverge faster and more accurately. We conclude that a better approach to\ninversion would be to expand the supergranule profile in an appropriate basis,\nthereby reducing the number of parameters being inverted for and appropriately\nregularizing them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2016 16:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

Although much has been done to prevent failures, network nodes\nand links are bound to fail eventually. Failure recovery processes are\ntherefore needed. Failure recovery is mainly influenced by (1) detection of the\nfailure, and (2) circumvention of the detected failure. However, especially in\nSDNs where controllers recompute network state reactively, this leads to high\ndelays. Hence, next to primary rules, backup rules should be installed in the\nswitches to quickly detour traffic once a failure occurs. In this work, we\npropose algorithms for computing an all-to-all primary and backup network\nforwarding configuration that is capable of circumventing link and node\nfailures. Omitting the high delay invoked by controller recomputation through\npreconfiguration, our proposal's recovery delay is close to the detection time\nwhich is significantly below the 50 ms rule of thumb. After initial recovery,\nwe recompute network configuration to guarantee protection from future\nfailures. Our algorithms use packet-labeling to guarantee correct and shortest\ndetour forwarding. The algorithms and labeling technique allow packets to\nreturn to the primary path and are able to discriminate between link and node\nfailures. The computational complexity of our solution is comparable to that of\nall-to-all-shortest paths computations. Our experimental evaluation on both\nreal and generated networks shows that network configuration complexity highly\ndecreases compared to classic disjoint paths computations. Finally, we provide\na proof-of-concept OpenFlow controller in which our proposed configuration is\nimplemented, demonstrating that it readily can be applied in production\nnetworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2016 18:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-31"}

This thesis is devoted to exploring asymptotic safety in infinite\ndimensional, or functional, truncations of the effective action as well as the\neffects that can be caused by the single field approximation in this context.\nIt begins with a comprehensive analysis of the three existing flow equations of\nthe single field f(R) truncation by determining their spaces of global fixed\npoint solutions and, where applicable, of corresponding eigenoperator\nsolutions. As a second result, it is then shown that one incarnation of the\nsingle field f(R) approximation actually breaks down in the sense that there is\nno physical content left to explore. In order to clarify whether such drastic\nfindings can be caused by the approximations used in setting up the\nrenormalisation group flow, we identify the single field approximation as a\nprime candidate and show in the more familiar context of scalar field theory\nthat it can indeed lead to many types of non-physical results. As a way to\navoid such non-physical behaviour we highlight the importance of the previously\nknown split Ward identity and exemplify its usefulness by fully restoring the\ncorrect physical picture in scalar field theory. Taking this result as evidence\nthat the split Ward identity may lead to well behaved functional truncations\nalso in gravity, we derive the flow equations of conformal gravity in a\nbi-field truncation of the effective action that goes beyond the local\npotential approximation in the fluctuation field. It is found that the split\nWard identity leads to a simplified set of renormalisation group equations for\nthe conformal factor that, while differing at crucial points, bear close\nresemblance to flow equations obtained in scalar field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2016 19:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-31"}

We make use of\nnewly calculated collisional rates to investigate the excitation of Class I\nmasers and to reconcile their observed properties with model results. We\nperformed LVG calculations with a plane-parallel slab geometry to compute the\npump and loss rates which regulate the interactions of the different maser\nsystems with the maser reservoir. We study the dependence of the pump rate, the\nloss rate, and the inversion efficiency of the pumping scheme of Class I masers\non the physics of the gas.

Second, we show that\nthe string-numeric conversion predicate is expressible in terms of the power\npredicate, string equations, and length function.

Our key motivation for building such a\nsolver is the observation that existing string solvers are not efficient at\nmodeling the string/bit-vector combination. Current approaches either reduce\nstrings to bit-vectors and use a bit-vector solver as a backend, or model\nbit-vectors as natural numbers and use a solver for the combined theory of\nstrings and natural numbers. Both these approaches are inefficient for\ndifferent reasons. Modeling strings as bit-vectors destroys structure inherent\nin string equations thus missing opportunities for efficiently deciding such\nformulas, and modeling bit-vectors as natural numbers is known to be\ninefficient. Hence, there is a clear need for a solver that models strings and\nbit-vectors natively.\n  Our solver Z3strBV is a decision procedure for the theory $T_{w,bv}$\ncombining solvers for bit-vector and string equations.

Considering a weak\natom-field coupling regime and large average number of photons in the cavity\nmode ($\\bar{n}$), one expects that a semiclassical theory could explain the\nwhole dynamics of the system. However, this system presents the generation of\ncorrelations between the atoms, which is a signature of the quantumness of the\ncavity field even in the limit of $\\bar{n} \\gg 1$ [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n\\textbf{107}, 153601 (2011)]. Here, we extend this result by investigating the\nrelaxation time for such a system. We have shown that the relaxation time of\nthe system varies proportionally to $\\bar{n}$ for a coherent driving, but it is\ninversely proportional to $\\bar{n}$ for an incoherent pumping. Thus, the time\nrequired to observe the manifestation of the quantum aspects of a cavity field\non the atomic correlations diverges as $\\bar{n}$ tends to macroscopic values\ndue to a coherent driving, while it goes to zero for incoherent pumping. For a\ncoherent driving, we can also see that this system presents metastability,\ni.e., firstly the atomic system reaches a quasi-stationary state which last for\na long time interval, but eventually it reaches the real steady state. We have\nalso discussed the effects of small atomic decay. In this case, the steady\ncorrelations between the atoms disappear for long times, but the intense cavity\nfield is still able to generate atomic correlations at intermediate times.\nThen, considering a real scenario, we would be able to monitor the quantumness\nof a cavity field in a certain time interval.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 02:50:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Sep 2016 17:25:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-14"}

Traps are those DNA sequences sharing significant similarity\nwith the original specific binding sites. It is an intriguing question how the\nnaturally occurring TFs and their specific binding sites are designed to manage\nthe retarding effects of such randomly occurring traps. We develop a simple\nrandom walk model on the site-specific binding of TFs with genomic DNA in the\npresence of sequence traps. Our dynamical model predicts that (a) the retarding\neffects of traps will be minimum when the traps are arranged around the\nspecific binding site such that there is a negative correlation between the\nbinding strength of TFs with traps and the distance of traps from the specific\nbinding site and (b) the retarding effects of sequence traps can be appeased by\nthe condensed conformational state of DNA. Our computational analysis results\non the distribution of sequence traps around the putative binding sites of\nvarious TFs in mouse and human genome clearly agree well the theoretical\npredictions. We propose that the distribution of traps can be used as an\nadditional metric to efficiently identify the specific binding sites of TFs on\ngenomic DNA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 04:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-22"}

Based on this\nperturbation, we find that the nature of the interactions is directly connected\nto the abundance distribution, and some characteristic behaviors, such as\nmultiple peaks in the abundance distribution and all species coexistence at\nmoderate values of $u$, are discovered in a wide class of the distribution of\nthe interactions. The all species coexistence collapses at a critical value of\n$u$, $u_c$, and this collapsing is regarded as a phase transition. To get more\nquantitative information, we also construct a non-perturbative theory on random\ngraphs based on techniques of statistical mechanics. The result shows those\ncharacteristic behaviors are sustained well even for not large $u$. For even\nsmaller values of $u$, extinct species start to appear and the abundance\ndistribution becomes rounded and closer to a standard functional form. Another\ninteresting finding is the non-monotonic behavior of diversity, which\nquantifies the number of coexisting species, when changing the ratio of\nmutualistic relations $\\Delta$. These results are examined by numerical\nsimulations, and the multiple peaks in the abundance distribution are confirmed\nto be robust against a certain level of modifications of the problem. The\nnumerical results also show that our theory is exact for the case without\nextinct species, but becomes less and less precise as the proportion of extinct\nspecies grows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 04:16:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

The STP extends the classical matrix product to two arbitrary\nmatrices. Under STP the set of matrices becomes a monoid (semi-group with\nidentity). Some related structures and properties are investigated. Then the\ngeneralized matrix addition is also introduced, which extends the classical\nmatrix addition to a class of two matrices with different dimensions.\n  Motivated by STP of matrices, two kinds of equivalences of matrices\n(including vectors) are introduced, which are called matrix equivalence\n(M-equivalence) and vector equivalence (V-equivalence) respectively. The\nlattice structure has been established for each equivalence. Under each\nequivalence, the corresponding quotient space becomes a vector space.

Here we make predictions from\ntheory that combines density functional theory with atomic multiplet-theory, on\nthe transition of valence when transferring from the atomic divalent limit to\nthe trivalent bulk, passing through different sized clusters, of selected\nrare-earths. We predict that Tm clusters show an abrupt change from pure\ndivalent to pure trivalent at a size of 6 atoms, while Sm and Tb clusters are\nrespectively pure divalent and trivalent up to 8 atoms. Larger Sm clusters are\nargued to likely make a transition to a mixed valent, or trivalent,\nconfiguration. The valence of all rare-earth clusters, as a function of size,\nis predicted from interpolation of our calculated results.

In biology, for example, most molecules only bind to a small number\nof other molecules, leading to sparse molecular interaction networks. To\nachieve sparseness, a common approach consists of applying weighted penalties\nto the number of links between nodes in the network and the complexity of the\ndynamics of existing links. The selection of proper weights, however, is\nnon-trivial. Alternatively, this paper proposes a novel data-driven method,\ncalled GESBL, that is able to penalise both network sparsity and model\ncomplexity without any tuning. GESBL combines Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL)\nand Group Sparse Bayesian Learning (GSBL) to introduce penalties for\ncomplexity, both in terms of element (system order of nonzero connections) and\ngroup sparsity (network topology). The paper considers a class of sparse linear\ntime-invariant networks where the dynamics are represented by multivariable ARX\nmodels. Data generated from sparse random ARX networks and synthetic gene\nregulatory networks indicate that our method, on average, considerably\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Depth super-resolution therefore emerged as a\nsolution to this problem.

By contrast, here, we introduce an\napproach to performing depth super-resolution in more challenging conditions,\nsuch as in outdoor scenes. To this end, we first propose to exploit semantic\ninformation to better constrain the super-resolution process. In particular, we\ndesign a co-sparse analysis model that learns filters from joint intensity,\ndepth and semantic information.

It is\ninterconnected to the peculiar role of strangeness, since the strange quark is\nrather light, but still much heavier than the up and down quarks. Thus, when\nstrangeness is involved one has to deal with spontaneous and explicit symmetry\nbreaking in QCD. It is well known that the antikaon interaction with nucleons\nis attractive, but how strong ? Is the interaction strong enough to bind\nnucleons to form kaonic nuclei and, if so, what are the properties (binding\nenergy, decay width)? There are controversial indications for such bound states\nand new results are expected to come soon. The existence of antikaon mediated\nbound states might have important consequences since it would open the\npossibility for the formation of cold baryonic matter of high density which\nmight have a severe impact in astrophysics for the understanding of the\ncomposi- tion of compact (neutron) stars.

The rate-independent flow rule for the delamination\nparameter is coupled with the momentum balance for the displacement, including\ninertia. This model features a nonsmooth constraint ensuring the continuity of\nthe displacements outside the crack set, which is marked by the support of the\ndelamination parameter. A weak solvability concept, generalizing the notion of\nenergetic solution for rate-independent systems to the present mixed\nrate-dependent/rate-independent frame, is proposed. Via refined variational\nconvergence techniques, existence of solutions is proved by passing to the\nlimit in approximating systems which regularize the nonsmooth constraint by\nconditions for adhesive contact. The presence of the inertial term requires the\ndesign of suitable recovery spaces small enough to provide compactness but\nlarge enough to recover the information on the crack set in the limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 10:32:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

An earlier paper considered overall maser morphology and\nconstraints on SiO maser excitation and pumping derived from these data. The\ngoal of the current paper is to use the measured polarization properties of\nindividual co-spatial components detected across multiple transitions to\nprovide constraints on several competing theories for the transport of\npolarized maser emission. This approach minimizes the significant effects of\nspatial blending. We present several diagnostic tests designed to distinguish\nkey features of competing theoretical models for maser polarization. The number\nof coincident features is limited by sensitivity however, particularly in the\nv=1 J=2-1 transition at 86 GHz, and deeper observations are needed. Preliminary\nconclusions based on the current data provide some support for: i)\nspin-independent solutions for linear polarization; ii) the influence of\ngeometry on the distribution of fractional linear polarization with intensity;\nand, iii) $\\pi/2$ rotations in linear polarization position angle arising from\ntransitions across the Van Vleck angle ($\\sin^2{\\theta}=2/3$) between the maser\nline-of-sight and magnetic field.

Facial analysis can be viewed as a two-fold problem,\nnamely (i) facial representation, and (ii) classification. So far, many face\nrepresentations have been proposed, a well-known method is the Local Binary\nPattern (LBP), which has witnessed a growing interest. In this respect, we\ntreat in this paper the issues of face representation as well as classification\nin a novel manner. On the one hand, we use a variant to LBP, so-called Complete\nLocal Binary Pattern (CLBP), which differs from the basic LBP by coding a given\nlocal region using a given central pixel and Sing_ Magnitude difference.\nSubsequently, most of LBPbased descriptors use a fixed grid to code a given\nfacial image, which technique is, in most cases, not robust to pose variation\nand misalignment. To cope with such issue, a representative Multi-Resolution\nHistogram (MH) decomposition is adopted in our work. On the other hand, having\nthe histograms of the considered images extracted, we exploit their sparsity to\nconstruct a so-called Sparse Representation Classifier (SRC) for further face\nclassification. Experimental results have been conducted on ORL face database,\nand pointed out the superiority of our scheme over other popular\nstate-of-the-art techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 11:19:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

For a function $f$ on $[-1,1]$ that is analytic in a\nBernstein ellipse with parameter $\\rho > 1$, and for a uniform perturbation\nlevel $\\epsilon$ on the function samples, we construct an asymptotically best\nextrapolant $e(x)$ as a least squares polynomial approximant of degree $M^*$\ngiven explicitly. We show that the extrapolant $e(x)$ converges to $f(x)$\npointwise in the interval $I_\\rho\\in[1,(\\rho+\\rho^{-1})/2)$ as $\\epsilon \\to\n0$, at a rate given by a $x$-dependent fractional power of $\\epsilon$.

In short,\nextrapolation enjoys a weak form of stability, up to a fraction of the\ncharacteristic smoothness length. The number of function samples, $N+1$, does\nnot bear on the size of the extrapolation error provided that it obeys the\noversampling condition. We also show that one cannot construct an\nasymptotically more accurate extrapolant from $N+1$ equally spaced samples than\n$e(x)$, using any other linear or nonlinear procedure. The proofs involve\noriginal statements on the stability of polynomial approximation in the\nChebyshev basis from equally spaced samples and these are expected to be of\nindependent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 12:35:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

For their numerical treatment, it is common practice to\ntransform the relations into a matrix-vector format. This transformation is\nusually performed using the so-called Voigt mapping. This mapping does not\npreserve tensor character leaving significant room for error as stress and\nstrain quantities follow from different mappings and thus have to be treated\ndifferently in certain mathematical operations. Despite its conceptual and\nnotational difficulties having been pointed out, the Voigt mapping remains the\nfoundation of most current finite element programmes. An alternative is the\nso-called Kelvin mapping which has recently gained recognition in studies of\ntheoretical mechanics. This article is concerned with benefits of the Kelvin\nmapping in numerical modelling tools such as finite element software. The\ndecisive difference to the Voigt mapping is that Kelvin's method preserves\ntensor character, and thus the numerical matrix notation directly corresponds\nto the original tensor notation. Further benefits in numerical implementations\nare that tensor norms are calculated identically without distinguishing stress\nor strain-type quantities and tensor equations can be directly transformed into\nmatrix equations without additional considerations. The only implementational\nchanges are related to a scalar factor in certain finite element matrices and\nhence, harvesting the mentioned benefits comes at very little cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 12:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

Measuring cold ions is difficult though.\nObservations have to be done at sufficiently high altitudes and typically in\nregions of space where spacecraft attain a positive charge due to solar\nillumination. Cold ions are therefore shielded from the satellite particle\ndetectors. Furthermore, spacecraft can only cover key regions of ion outflow\nduring segments of their orbit, so additional complications arise if continuous\nlongtime observations, such as during a geomagnetic storm, are needed.

The non-instrumented faces are\ncovered by reflecting Teflon coated with TPB. In this thesis we show that the\nLXSC can display an energy resolution of 5% FWHM, much better than that of\nconventional solid scintillators such as LSO/LYSO. The LXSC can measure the\ninteraction point of the incoming photon with a resolution in the three\ncoordinates of 1 mm. The very fast scintillation time of LXe (2 ns) and the\navailability of suitable sensors and electronics permits a coincidence\nresolution time (CRT) in the range of 100-200 ps, again much better than any\ncurrent PET-TOF system. The LXSC constitutes the core of a high-sensitivity,\nnuclear magnetic resonance compatible, PET device, with enhanced Time Of Flight\n(TOF) sensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 13:14:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

Under such guideline\n(referred to as 1:1), a MAC protocol attempts to initiate up to two\nsimultaneous transmissions in the FD bandwidth. Since in single-cell Wi-Fi\nnetworks MAC performance is bounded by the PHY layer capacity, this implies\ngains strictly less than 2x over half-duplex at the MAC layer. To face this\nlimitation, we argue for the 1:N design guideline. Under 1:N, FD MAC protocols\n'see' the FD bandwidth through N>1 orthogonal narrow-channel PHY layers. Based\non theoretical results and software defined radio experiments, we show the 1:N\ndesign can leverage the Wi-Fi capacity gain more than 2x at and below the MAC\nlayer. This translates the denser modulation scheme incurred by channel\nnarrowing and the increase in the spatial reuse offer enabled by channel\northogonality.

Simple formulas are derived for expressing the steady-state\ndistributions in terms of equilibrium distributions. The rate constant for\nradiative association is found to be generally small for all temperature\ncombinations. The photodissociation rate constant for quadrupole transitions is\nfound to dominate the rate constants for other H2 photodestruction mechanisms\nfor radiation temperatures less than or equal to 3000 K.

Spatial regularization through structured sparsity\noffers new perspectives in this context and reduces the risk of overfitting the\nmodel while providing interpretable neuroimaging signatures by forcing the\nsolution to adhere to domain-specific constraints. Total Variation (TV)\nenforces spatial smoothness of the solution while segmenting predictive regions\nfrom the background. We consider the problem of minimizing the sum of a smooth\nconvex loss, a non-smooth convex penalty (whose proximal operator is known) and\na wide range of possible complex, non-smooth convex structured penalties such\nas TV or overlapping group Lasso. Existing solvers are either limited in the\nfunctions they can minimize or in their practical capacity to scale to\nhigh-dimensional imaging data. Nesterov's smoothing technique can be used to\nminimize a large number of non-smooth convex structured penalties but\nreasonable precision requires a small smoothing parameter, which slows down the\nconvergence speed. To benefit from the versatility of Nesterov's smoothing\ntechnique, we propose a first order continuation algorithm, CONESTA, which\nautomatically generates a sequence of decreasing smoothing parameters. The\ngenerated sequence maintains the optimal convergence speed towards any globally\ndesired precision. Our main contributions are: To propose an expression of the\nduality gap to probe the current distance to the global optimum in order to\nadapt the smoothing parameter and the convergence speed.

Specifically, spatial crowdsourcing refers to sending a\nlocation-based request to workers according to their positions, and workers\nneed to physically move to specified locations to conduct tasks. Many works\nhave studied task assignment problems in spatial crowdsourcing, however, their\nproblem settings are different from each other. Thus, it is hard to compare the\nperformances of existing algorithms on task assignment in spatial\ncrowdsourcing. In this paper, we present a comprehensive experimental\ncomparison of most existing algorithms on task assignment in spatial\ncrowdsourcing. Specifically, we first give general definitions about spatial\nworkers and spatial tasks based on definitions in the existing works such that\nthe existing algorithms can be applied on the same synthetic and real data\nsets. Then, we provide an uniform implementation for all the tested algorithms\nof task assignment problems in spatial crowdsourcing (open sourced).

The advantages of dGFEM\nspace discretization with Rannacher smoothing as time integrator with nonsmooth\ninitial and boundary conditions are illustrated for European vanilla options,\ndigital call and American put options. The convection dominated Heston model\nfor vanishing volatility is efficiently solved utilizing the adaptive dGFEM.\nFor fast solution of the linear complementary problem of the American options,\na projected successive over relaxation (PSOR) method is developed with the norm\npreconditioned dGFEM.

Since in the process of retroreflection the turning\nsense of a circularly polarized beam of light does not change and the direction\nof propagation is inverted, the photon spin is inverted. Due to conservation of\nangular momentum a transfer of photon spin to electron orbital angular momentum\nof conduction electrons occurs. In the structures a circular movement of\nelectrons is blocked and therefore the transfered spin can be detected as a\nphotovoltage due to an electromotive force which is induced by the transfer of\nangular momentum. Depending on the polarization of the incident beam, a maximum\nphotovoltage of about 0,2 micro V was measured for both structures. The results\nare interpreted in terms of a classical electrodynamic model of the\nmonochromatic linearly polarized photon as a propagating solitary\nelectromagnetic wave of finite energy hf which carries an angular momentum\nh/2pi which is elaborated elsewhere where h is Plancks constant and f the\nfrequency of light. The relative values of the measured photovoltages for\ndifferent polarizations can well be explained by the electrodynamic model of a\nphoton and an associated spin angular momentum. The absolute values of the\nmeasured photovoltages are also consistent with the interpretation. The\nobserved effects are closely related to the lateral Fedorov Imbert shift of\nfocused beams in optics and the optical spin Hall effect and to other non\nlinear optical effects such as the inverse faraday effect for which a new\ninterpretation is given here in terms of the electrodynamic model of the photon\nand its spin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2016 18:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}
