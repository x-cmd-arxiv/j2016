In our experiment, the phases of\nthe laser beams are modulated at the frequencies f1 and f2, respectively. The\naction signals, such as photoluminescence and photocurrent, which result from\nthe absorption of two photons, are isolated at frequencies m f (f=|f1-f2|,\nm=0,1,2...). We demonstrate that the ratio of the amplitudes of the secondary\n(m=2) and the primary (m=1) signals is sensitive to the type of relaxation\nprocess taken place in the system and thus can be used for its identification.\nSuch sensitivity originates from cumulative effects of non-equilibrated state\nof the system between the light pulses. When the cumulative effects are small,\ni.e. the relaxation time is much shorter then the laser repetition rate or the\nlaser intensity is high enough to dominate the system behavior, the ratio\nachieves its reference value 1:4 (the signature of two-photon absorption). In\nthe intermediate regimes the ratio changes rapidly with the growth of intensity\nfrom zero value in case of second order relaxation process, while it\ndemonstrates slow monotonic decrease for linear relaxation. In the article we\nalso determine the value of the recombination rate in a GaP photodiode by using\nthe above approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2016 16:08:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 Jul 2016 20:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-30"}

The underlying CC retains\ncontrol of scheduling and transactional accesses, while SSN tracks the\nresulting dependencies. At commit time, SSN performs an efficient validation\ntest by examining only direct dependencies of the committing transaction to\ndetermine whether it can commit safely or must abort to avoid a potential\ndependency cycle.\n  SSN performs robustly for various workloads. It maintains the characteristics\nof the underlying CC without biasing toward certain types of transactions,\nthough the underlying CC might. Besides traditional OLTP workloads, SSN also\nallows efficient handling of heterogeneous workloads with long, read-mostly\ntransactions. SSN can avoid tracking the majority of reads (thus reducing the\noverhead of serializability certification) and still produce serializable\nexecutions with little overhead. The dependency tracking and validation tests\ncan be done efficiently, fully parallel and latch-free, for multi-version\nsystems on modern hardware with substantial core count and large main memory.\n  We demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy and robustness of SSN using extensive\nsimulations and an implementation that overlays snapshot isolation in ERMIA, a\nmemory-optimized OLTP engine that is capable of running different CC schemes.\nEvaluation results confirm that SSN is a promising approach to serializability\nwith robust performance and low overhead for various workloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2016 19:14:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2016 17:56:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 20:43:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2017 02:26:09 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 4 May 2017 14:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-22"}

The physical origin of the shift is\nthe subject of some debate, and has important implications for metallicity\nmeasurements based on strong lines at all redshifts. To investigate the origin\nof the O3N2 offset, we use a sample of ~100,000 star-forming galaxies from SDSS\nDR12 to probe the empirical correlations between emission line diagnostics and\nmeasurable galaxy physical properties. In particular, we examine how surface\ndensity of star formation, ionization parameter, nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O)\nratio, and stellar mass drive position in two key diagnostic diagrams: O3N2 and\n[OIII]/H$\\beta$ versus [SII]/H$\\alpha$ (O3S2). We show that, at fixed\n[OIII]/H$\\beta$, galaxies falling closer to the high-redshift locus in O3N2\nhave higher star formation density, stellar mass and N/O ratios. We also find a\ntight correspondence in the distributions of stellar mass and N/O in the\ndiagnostic diagrams. This relation, spanning a range of galaxy evolutionary\nstates, suggests that the N/O-$M_{*}$ relation is more fundamental than the\nN/O-metallicity relation. We argue that a tight N/O-$M_{*}$ relation is\nwell-motivated physically, and that the observed correlation of N/O with O/H in\nthe local universe is primarily a reflection of the existence of the\nmass-metallicity relation. Because the mass-metallicity relation evolves much\nmore rapidly with redshift than N/O-$M_{*}$, the N/O ratios of high redshift\ngalaxies are significantly elevated in comparison with local galaxies with the\nsame gas-phase O/H. The O3N2 shift and elevated N/O ratios observed in high\nredshift galaxies therefore come about as a natural consequence of the\nN/O-$M_{*}$ relation combined with the evolution of the mass-metallicity\nrelation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2016 20:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

Crosstalk distortion needs to be\ncompensated in order to obtain high quality measurements. We study\nphase-demodulation methods for null/mild, moderate, and severe levels of RGB\ncrosstalk. For null/mild crosstalk, we can estimate the searched phase-map\nusing Bruning's 3-step phase-shifting algorithm (PSA).

For severe RGB crosstalk, we expect non-sinusoidal fringes'\nprofiles (distorting harmonics) and significant uncertainties on the crosstalk\ncalibration (which produces pseudo-detuning error).

Increasingly, however, in several applications, ranging from\nranking to biometric screening to medicine, performance is measured not in\nterms of the full area under the ROC curve, but in terms of the \\emph{partial}\narea under the ROC curve between two false positive rates. In this paper, we\ndevelop support vector algorithms for directly optimizing the partial AUC\nbetween any two false positive rates. Our methods are based on minimizing a\nsuitable proxy or surrogate objective for the partial AUC error. In the case of\nthe full AUC, one can readily construct and optimize convex surrogates by\nexpressing the performance measure as a summation of pairwise terms. The\npartial AUC, on the other hand, does not admit such a simple decomposable\nstructure, making it more challenging to design and optimize (tight) convex\nsurrogates for this measure.\n  Our approach builds on the structural SVM framework of Joachims (2005) to\ndesign convex surrogates for partial AUC, and solves the resulting optimization\nproblem using a cutting plane solver. Unlike the full AUC, where the\ncombinatorial optimization needed in each iteration of the cutting plane solver\ncan be decomposed and solved efficiently, the corresponding problem for the\npartial AUC is harder to decompose. One of our main contributions is a\npolynomial time algorithm for solving the combinatorial optimization problem\nassociated with partial AUC. We also develop an approach for optimizing a\ntighter non-convex hinge loss based surrogate for the partial AUC using\ndifference-of-convex programming. Our experiments on a variety of real-world\nand benchmark tasks confirm the efficacy of the proposed methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2016 21:33:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-29"}

In simulation results on a simple 2D manipulator, we have observed\nthat measurement uncertainty leads to low impedance behaviors, a result in\ncontrast with the effects of process noise that creates stiff behaviors. This\nsuggests that taking into account measurement uncertainty could be a\npotentially very interesting way to approach problems involving uncertain\ncontact interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2016 22:12:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2018 18:01:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2021 19:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

The advantages of these social network services enable\nthem rapidly growing. However, the rise of social network services is leading\nto the increase of unwanted, disruptive information from spammers, malware\ndiscriminators, and other content polluters. Negative effects of social\nspammers do not only annoy users, but also lead to financial loss and privacy\nissues. There are two main challenges of spammer detection on Twitter. Firstly,\nthe data of social network scale with a huge volume of streaming social data.\nSecondly, spammers continually change their spamming strategy such as changing\ncontent patterns or trying to gain social influence, disguise themselves as far\nas possible. With those challenges, it is hard to directly apply traditional\nbatch learning methods to quickly adapt newly spamming pattern in the\nhigh-volume and real-time social media data. We need an anti-spammer system to\nbe able to adjust the learning model when getting a label feedback. Moreover,\nthe data on social media may be unbounded. Then, the system must allow update\nefficiency model in both computation and memory requirements. Online learning\nis an ideal solution for this problem. These methods incrementally adapt the\nlearning model with every single feedback and adjust to the changing patterns\nof spammers overtime. Our experiments demonstrate that an anti-spam system\nbased on online learning approach is efficient in fast changing of spammers\ncomparing with batch learning methods.

In the presence of disorder, it is widely admitted, as well as\nexperimentally and numerically verified, that the velocity presents a stretched\nexponential dependence in the force (the so-called 'creep law'), which is out\nof reach of linear response, or more generically of direct perturbative\nexpansions at small force. In dimension one, there is no exact analytical\nderivation of such a law, even from a theoretical physical point of view. We\npropose an effective model with two degrees of freedom, constructed from the\nfull spatially extended model, that captures many aspects of the creep\nphenomenology.

We show in this paper that also for non-linear problems, domain\ndecomposition methods can either be used directly as iterative solvers, or one\ncan use them as preconditioners for Newton's method. For the concrete case of\nthe parallel Schwarz method, we show that we obtain a preconditioner we call\nRASPEN (Restricted Additive Schwarz Preconditioned Exact Newton) which is\nsimilar to ASPIN (Additive Schwarz Preconditioned Inexact Newton), but with all\ncomponents directly defined by the iterative method. This has the advantage\nthat RASPEN already converges when used as an iterative solver, in contrast to\nASPIN, and we thus get a substantially better preconditioner for Newton's\nmethod.

Its purposes are to enhance as much as possible the beam quality\n(transverse geometric emittance of less than 3 pi.mm.mrad and longitudinal\nenergy spread close to 1 eV) and to transmit more than 60 % of ions.\n  Numerical simulations and experimental studies have shown that the required\nbeam quality can be reached only in term of the emittance. The energy spread is\nvery far from expected values. It is sensitive to the space charge and the\nbuffer gas diffusion and more importantly to the RF field derivative effect.\nThe latter arises at the RFQ exit and increases with the RF parameters (the\nfrequency and the amplitude of the RF voltage).\n  Studies allowing to enhance the cooled beam quality, mainly the energy spread\nreduction, are presented and discussed along this paper. They consist in\nimplementing a miniature RFQ at the RFQ exit. Using this method, it becomes\npossible to improve the cooled beam quality and to reach 1 eV of longitudinal\nenergy spread and around 1.75 {\\pi}.mm.mrad of transverse geometric emittance\nfor beam currents going up to 1 uA.\n  The transport of the cooled beam from SHIRaC towards a HRS has been done with\nan electrostatic quadrupole triplet.

We introduce in this paper MTFs on a simple model problem using\nconcepts familiar to researchers in domain decomposition. This allows us to get\na new understanding of MTFs and a natural block Jacobi iteration, for which we\ndetermine optimal relaxation parameters. We then show how iterative multitrace\nformulation solvers are related to a well known domain decomposition method\ncalled optimal Schwarz method: a method which used Dirichlet to Neumann maps in\nthe transmission condition. We finally show that the insight gained from the\nsimple model problem leads to remarkable identities for Calderon projectors and\nrelated operators, and the convergence results and optimal choice of the\nrelaxation parameter we obtained is independent of the geometry, the space\ndimension of the problem{\\color{black}, and the precise form of the spatial\nelliptic operator, like for optimal Schwarz methods.

An empirical scale factor has been used, which generates a signature\nflip of the deceleration parameter with time. To account for the\nnon-conservation of matter, a function of time f(t) is incorporated into the\nequation representing the density of matter. Its value at any instant of time\nis proportional to the matter content of the universe. The functional form of\nf(t) has been determined from the field equations by using an empirical scalar\nfield parameter expressed in terms of the scale factor. It is found to decrease\nwith time almost monotonically, implying a conversion of matter into dark\nenergy. Using this function f(t), the time variation of the density of matter\nhas been determined and also the expressions regarding the proportions of\nmatter and dark energy of the universe have been formulated. Time variation of\ngravitational constant, its fractional rate of change and the Brans-Dicke\ndimensionless parameter has been analyzed. The dependence of Brans-Dicke\nparameter upon the scalar field has been determined. The present study enables\nus to correlate the change of matter content with the change of deceleration\nparameter and gravitational constant without using any specific mechanism of\ninteraction between matter and scalar field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2016 20:44:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-07"}

This\ncondition imposes restrictions on the values attributed to the normalized\nabsorption coefficients for the compressional and shear-wave wavenumbers for\neach partial-wave mode n. The forbidden values produce negative axial radiation\nforce, absorption and extinction efficiencies, as well as an enhancement of the\nscattering efficiency, not in agreement with the conservation of energy law.\nNumerical results for the radiation force, extinction, absorption and\nscattering efficiencies are performed for three viscoelastic (VE) polymer\ncylinders immersed in a non-viscous host liquid (i.e. water) with particular\nemphasis on the shear-wave absorption coefficient of the cylinder, the\ndimensionless size parameter and the partial-wave mode number n. Mathematical\nconstraints are established for the non-dimensional absorption coefficients of\nthe longitudinal and shear waves for a cylinder (i.e. 2D case) and a sphere\n(i.e. 3D case) in terms of the sound velocities in the VE material. The\nanalysis suggests that the domain of validity for any viscoelastic model\ndescribing acoustic attenuation inside a lossy cylinder (or sphere) in a\nnon-viscous fluid must be verified based upon the optical theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2016 23:41:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jun 2016 10:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-03"}
