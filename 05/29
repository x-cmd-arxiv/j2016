Still, there is little\nagreement on which model to use as a building block for population-level\nanalyses, and models of variability are often treated as a subject of choice.\nWe investigate two competing models, the Doubly Stochastic Poisson (DSP) model\nassuming stochasticity at spike generation, and the Rectified Gaussian (RG)\nmodel that traces variability back to membrane potential variance, to analyze\nstimulus-dependent modulation of response statistics. Using a model of a pair\nof neurons, we demonstrate that the two models predict similar single-cell\nstatistics.

In order to test the models against\ndata, we build a population model to simulate stimulus change-related\nmodulations in response statistics. We use unit recordings from the primary\nvisual cortex of monkeys to show that while model predictions for variance are\nqualitatively similar to experimental data, only the RG model's predictions are\ncompatible with joint statistics.

This paper concerns\nitself with one popular topological feature, which is the number of\n$d-$dimensional holes in the dataset, also known as the Betti$-d$ number. The\npersistence of the Betti numbers over various scales is encoded into a\npersistence diagram (PD), which indicates the birth and death times of these\nholes as scale varies. A common way to compare PDs is by a point-to-point\nmatching, which is given by the $n$-Wasserstein metric. However, a big drawback\nof this approach is the need to solve correspondence between points before\ncomputing the distance; for $n$ points, the complexity grows according to\n$\\mathcal{O}($n$^3)$. Instead, we propose to use an entirely new framework\nbuilt on Riemannian geometry, that models PDs as 2D probability density\nfunctions that are represented in the square-root framework on a Hilbert\nSphere. The resulting space is much more intuitive with closed form expressions\nfor common operations. The distance metric is 1) correspondence-free and also\n2) independent of the number of points in the dataset. The complexity of\ncomputing distance between PDs now grows according to $\\mathcal{O}(K^2)$, for a\n$K \\times K$ discretization of $[0,1]^2$. This also enables the use of existing\nmachinery in differential geometry towards statistical analysis of PDs such as\ncomputing the mean, geodesics, classification etc. We report competitive\nresults with the Wasserstein metric, at a much lower computational load,\nindicating the favorable properties of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2016 16:55:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-31"}

It is generally believed that couplings\nbetween the normal matter and the superfluid components, and the starquakes,\nare the common causes of glitches. In this study, one famous glitching pulsar,\nPSR~J2021+4026, is investigated. PSR~J2021+4026 is the first variable gamma-ray\npulsar observed by Fermi. From the gamma-ray observations, it is found that the\npulsar experienced a significant flux drop, an increase in the spin-down rate,\na change in the pulse profile and a shift in the spectral cut-off to a lower\nenergy, simultaneously around 2011 October 16. To explain these effects on the\nhigh-energy emissions by the glitch of PSR~J2021+4026, we hypothesized the\nglitch to be caused by the rearrangement of the surface magnetic field due to\nthe crustal plate tectonic activities on the pulsar which is triggered by a\nstarquake. In this glitch event, the inclination angle of the magnetic dipole\naxis is slightly shifted. This proposition is then tested by numerical modeling\nusing a three-dimensional two-layer outer gap model. The simulation results\nindicate that a modification of the inclination angle can affect the pulse\nprofile and the spectral properties, which can explain the observation changes\nafter the glitch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2016 05:59:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

When\nthe number of examples ($n$) is much larger than the number of features ($d$),\na common strategy is to apply RCD to the dual problem. On the other hand, when\nthe number of features is much larger than the number of examples, it makes\nsense to apply RCD directly to the primal problem. In this paper we provide the\nfirst joint study of these two approaches when applied to L2-regularized ERM.\nFirst, we show through a rigorous analysis that for dense data, the above\nintuition is precisely correct. However, we find that for sparse and structured\ndata, primal RCD can significantly outperform dual RCD even if $d \\ll n$, and\nvice versa, dual RCD can be much faster than primal RCD even if $n \\ll d$.\nMoreover, we show that, surprisingly, a single sampling strategy minimizes both\nthe (bound on the) number of iterations and the overall expected complexity of\nRCD. Note that the latter complexity measure also takes into account the\naverage cost of the iterations, which depends on the structure and sparsity of\nthe data, and on the sampling strategy employed.

The evidence was a spike in apparent heat capacity during cooling\nthat could be fully reversed during reheating before any sign of ice\ncrystallization appeared. Here, we use decoupled-oscillator infrared\nspectroscopy to define the structural character of this phenomenon using\nsimilar down and upscan rates as in the calorimetric study.

The OH spectrum changes discontinuously at\nthe phase-transition temperature, indicating a discrete change in hydrogen-bond\nstructure. The spectral changes show that the low-temperature liquid is more\nstrongly hydrogen bonded and less disordered as compared to the\nhigh-temperature liquid. The spectrum of the low-temperature liquid is\nessentially that seen in low-density amorphous water. This similarity suggests\nthat the liquid-liquid transition observed here also exists in neat undercooled\nwater, providing a unified explanation for many of its anomalies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2016 09:56:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-31"}

For the central regions (5-100 kpc) of the M87 and\nPerseus clusters this analysis suggests that observed images are dominated by\nisobaric perturbations, followed by perturbations caused by bubbles of\nrelativistic plasma and weak shocks.

We observed Mrk 421 in the very high\nenergy (VHE) gamma-ray range with the Cherenkov telescope MAGIC-I from March\n2007 to June 2009 for a total of 96 hours of effective time after quality cuts.\nThe VHE flux variability is quantified with several methods, including the\nBayesian Block algorithm, which is applied to data from Cherenkov telescopes\nfor the first time. The 2.3 year long MAGIC light curve is complemented with\ndata from the Swift/BAT and RXTE/ASM satellites and the KVA, GASP-WEBT, OVRO,\nand Mets\\\"ahovi telescopes from February 2007 to July 2009, allowing for an\nexcellent characterisation of the multi-band variability and correlations over\nyear time scales. Mrk 421 was found in different gamma-ray emission states\nduring the 2.3 year long observation period. Flares and different levels of\nvariability in the gamma-ray light curve could be identified with the Bayesian\nBlock algorithm. The same behaviour of a quiet and active emission was found in\nthe X-ray light curves measured by Swift/BAT and the RXTE/ASM, with a direct\ncorrelation in time. The behaviour of the optical light curve of GASP-WEBT and\nthe radio light curves by OVRO and Mets\\\"ahovi are different as they show no\ncoincident features with the higher energetic light curves and a less variable\nemission. The fractional variability is overall increasing with energy. The\ncomparable variability in the X-ray and VHE bands and their direct correlation\nduring both high- and low-activity periods spanning many months show that the\nelectron populations radiating the X-ray and gamma-ray photons are either the\nsame, as expected in the Synchrotron-Self-Compton mechanism, or at least\nstrongly correlated, as expected in electromagnetic cascades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2016 15:35:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-15"}
