Empirical data show that divergence is mostly concentrated in\nnarrow genomic regions. This pattern may arise because differentiated loci\nprotect nearby mutations from gene flow, but recent theory suggests this\nmechanism is insufficient to explain the emergence of concentrated\ndifferentiation during biologically realistic timescales. Critically, earlier\ntheory neglects an inevitable consequence of genetic drift: stochastic loss of\nlocal genomic divergence. Here we demonstrate that the rate of stochastic loss\nof weak local differentiation increases with recombination distance to a\nstrongly diverged locus and, above a critical recombination distance, local\nloss is faster than local `gain' of new differentiation. Under high migration\nand weak selection this critical recombination distance is much smaller than\nthe total recombination distance of the genomic region under selection.\nConsequently, divergence between populations increases by net gain of new\ndifferentiation within the critical recombination distance, resulting in\ntightly-linked clusters of divergence. The mechanism responsible is the balance\nbetween stochastic loss and gain of weak local differentiation, a mechanism\nacting universally throughout the genome. Our results will help to explain\nempirical observations and lead to novel predictions regarding changes in\ngenomic architectures during adaptive divergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 16:01:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

The emission can be reconciled with an axisymmetric\ngeometry, where the lower density polar/rotation axis has a position angle of\n~50 degrees measured from north to east. However, this picture can not capture\nthe full morphological diversity, and discrete mass ejection events need to be\ninvoked to explain localized higher-density regions. The velocity traced by the\ngaseous NaCl line profiles is significantly lower than the average wind\nterminal velocity, and much slower than some of the fastest mass ejections,\nsignalling a wide range of characteristic speeds for the mass loss. Gaseous\nNaCl is detected far beyond the main dust condensation region.

Polymerization dynamics\nof actin filaments, comprising the structural core of filopodia, largely\ndetermine their instantaneous lengths and overall lifetimes. The polymerization\nreactions at the filopodial tip require transport of G-actin, which enter the\nfilopodial tube from the filopodial base and diffuse toward the filament barbed\nends near the tip. Actin filaments are mechanically coupled into a tight bundle\nby cross-linker proteins. Interestingly, many of these proteins are relatively\nshort, restricting the free diffusion of cytosolic G-actin throughout the\nbundle and, in particular, its penetration into the bundle core. To investigate\nthe effect of steric restrictions on G-actin diffusion by the porous structure\nof filopodial actin filament bundle, we used a particle-based stochastic\nsimulation approach. We discovered that excluded volume interactions result in\npartial and then full collapse of central filaments in the bundle, leading to a\nhollowed-out structure. The latter may further collapse radially due to the\nactivity of cross-linking proteins, hence producing conical-shaped filament\nbundles.

The appeal of SEMs in these settings stems from\ntheir simplicity and tractability, since they typically assume linear\ndependencies among observable variables. Acknowledging the limitations inherent\nto adopting linear models, the present paper advocates nonlinear SEMs, which\naccount for (possible) nonlinear dependencies among network nodes. The\nadvocated approach leverages kernels as a powerful encompassing framework for\nnonlinear modeling, and an efficient estimator with affordable tradeoffs is put\nforth. Interestingly, pursuit of the novel kernel-based approach yields a\nconvex regularized estimator that promotes edge sparsity, and is amenable to\nproximal-splitting optimization methods.

However, much information about the gray-box simulation is\ncontained in its space-time solution, which motivates us to estimate the\nadjoint gradient by leveraging the space-time solution. This article considers\na type of gray-box simulations where the flux function is partially unknown. A\nmethod is introduced to estimate the adjoint gradient at a cost independent of\nthe number of control variables. The method firstly infers a conservation law,\nnamed the twin model, from the space-time solution, and then applies the\nadjoint method to the inferred twin model to estimate the gradient. The method\nis demonstrated to achieve good gradient estimation accuracies in several\nnumerical examples. The main contributions of this paper are: a twin model\nmethod that enables the adjoint gradient computation for gray-box conservation\nlaw simulations; and an adaptive basis construction scheme that fully exploits\nthe information of gray-box solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 18:12:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}

So far, this spectral feature,\ndesignated as the \"21 micrometer\" feature, has been seen in 18 carbon-rich\nPPNe. The nature of the carriers of this feature remains unknown although many\ncandidate materials have been proposed. The 21 micrometer sources also exhibit\nan equally mysterious, unidentified emission feature peaking at 30 micrometer.\nWhile the 21 micrometer feature is exclusively seen in PPNe, a short-lived\nevolutionary stage between the end of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and\nplanetary nebula (PN) phases, the 30 micrometer feature is commonly observed in\nall stages of stellar evolution from the AGB through PPN to PNe phases. We\nderive the stellar mass loss rates (M_{loss}) of these 21 micrometer sources\nfrom their dust infrared (IR) emission, using the \"2-DUST\" radiative transfer\ncode for axisymmetric dusty systems which allows one to distinguish the mass\nloss rates of the AGB phase (\\dot{M_{AGB}}) from that of the superwind\n(\\dot_{M_{SW}}) phase.

In the first part we develop methods\nto obtain exact results in the AdS3/CFT2 correspondence. We consider the AdS_3\nx S^3 x T^4 background with pure Ramond-Ramond flux and we find the all-loop\nworldsheet S-matrix by exploiting the symmetries of the model in light-cone\ngauge. As we naturally include the massless modes on the worldsheet, we derive\nthe full set of Bethe-Yang equations. In the massive sector we give also a\nspin-chain description and we write down solutions compatible with crossing for\nthe scalar factors which are not constrained by simmetries. In the second part\nof the thesis we consider the so-called \"eta-deformation\" of the superstring on\nAdS_5 x S^5. We first discuss the effects of the deformation at the level of\nthe bosonic sigma-model, and we match the tree-level worldsheet scattering\nprocesses to the expansion of the q-deformed S-matrix. To identify the missing\nRamond-Ramond fields we then compute the action quadratic in fermions, and we\nprovide an alternative derivation by looking at the kappa-symmetry variations.\nThe resulting background fields do not solve the equations of motion of type\nIIB supergravity and we comment on this.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 19:57:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}

In\nparticular, we will show how direct RIXS spectra of magnetic excitations can\nreveal long-range orbital correlations in transition metal compounds, by\ndiscriminating different kind of orbital order in magnetic and\nantiferromagnetic systems. Moreover, we will show how RIXS spectra of\nquasiparticle excitations in superconductors can measure the superconducting\ngap magnitude, and reveal the presence of nodal points and phase differences of\nthe superconducting order parameter on the Fermi surface. This can reveal the\nproperties of the underlying pairing mechanism in unconventional\nsuperconductors, in particular cuprates and iron pnictides, discriminating\nbetween different superconducting order parameter symmetries, such as $s$, $d$\n(singlet pairing) and $p$ wave (triplet pairing).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 20:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-13"}

As another application of our\ntechnique, we consider the {\\em $k$-budgeted matroid basis} problem, where we\nbuild upon a recent rounding algorithm of \\cite{BansalN16} to obtain an\nimproved $n^{O(k^{1.5}/\\epsilon)}$-time algorithm that returns a solution that\nsatisfies (any) one of the budget constraints exactly and incurs a\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-violation of the other budget constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 20:30:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-12"}

The waveforms from binaries with non-spinning black holes\nhave mass-ratios $q = m_1/m_2 \\le 15$, and those with precessing, spinning\nblack holes have $q \\le 8$. The waveforms expand a moderate number of orbits in\nthe late inspiral, the burst during coalescence, and the ring-down of the final\nblack hole. Examples of waveforms in the catalog matched against the widely\nused approximate models are presented. In addition, predictions of the mass and\nspin of the final black hole by phenomenological fits are tested against the\nresults from the simulation bank.

Because of dysprosium's large electronic orbital\nangular momentum and large magnetic moment, the lifetime of the gas is limited\nnot by spontaneous emission from the light-matter coupling, as for gases of\nalkali-metal atoms, but by dipolar relaxation of the spin. This relaxation is\nsuppressed at large magnetic fields due to Fermi statistics.

In particular,\nthe method can be viewed as a Gauss-Seidel approach that requires only\nindependent element-by-element and face-by-face local solves in each iteration.\nAs such, it is well-suited for current and future computing systems with\nmassive concurrencies. Unlike conventional Gauss-Seidel schemes which are\npurely algebraic, the convergence of iHDG, thanks to the built-in HDG numerical\nflux, does not depend on the ordering of unknowns.

For the transport\nequation, the method is convergent regardless of mesh size $h$ and solution\norder $p$, and furthermore the convergence rate is independent of the solution\norder. For the linearized shallow water and the convection-diffusion equations\nwe show that the convergence is conditional on both $h$ and $p$.

Streaming high-definition video with low delay is difficult\nmainly due to (i) the stochastic nature of wireless channels and (ii) the\nfluctuating videos bit rate. To address this, we propose a novel delay-aware\nfountain coding (DAF) technique that integrates channel coding and video\ncoding. In this paper, we reveal that the fluctuation of video bit rate can\nalso be exploited to further improve fountain codes for wireless video\nstreaming. Specifically, we develop two coding techniques: the time-based\nsliding window and the optimal window-wise sampling strategy. By adaptively\nselecting the window length and optimally adjusting the sampling pattern\naccording to the ongoing video bit rate, the proposed schemes deliver\nsignificantly higher video quality than existing schemes, with low delay and\nconstant data rate. To validate our design, we implement the protocols of DAF,\nDAF-L (a low-complexity version) and the existing delay-aware video streaming\nschemes by streaming H.264/AVC standard videos over an 802.11b network on CORE\nemulation platform.

Direct\ncomparison between the behaviour of atomic lines (Fe I, Ti I, and Ca II) in the\nobserved spectra and synthetic atmospheric models provides compelling evidence\nthat effective temperature is the prime underlying variable driving the SpT\nsequence in CSGs. However, there is a clear correlation between SpT and\nluminosity, with later ones tending to correspond to more luminous stars with\nheavier mass loss. The population of CSGs in the SMC is characterised by a\nhigher degree of spectral variability, early spectral types (centred on type\nK1) and low mass-loss rates (at least as measured by dust-sensitive\nmid-infrared colours). The population in the LMC displays less spectroscopic\nvariability and later spectral types. The distribution of spectral types is not\nsingle-peaked. Instead, the brightest CSGs have a significantly different\ndistribution from less luminous objects, presenting mostly M subtypes (centred\non M2), and increasing mass-loss rates for later types. In conclusion, the\nobserved properties of CSGs in the SMC and the LMC cannot be described\ncorrectly by standard evolutionary models.

This\narchitecture will result in higher throughputs than conventional cellular\nnetworks, but with the increased potential for co-channel interference induced\nby randomly located cellular and D2D UEs. The physical channels which\nconstitute D2D communications can be expected to be complex in nature,\nexperiencing both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) conditions across\nclosely located D2D pairs. As well as this, given the diverse range of\noperating environments, they may also be subject to clustering of the scattered\nmultipath contribution, i.e., propagation characteristics which are quite\ndissimilar to conventional Rayeligh fading environments. To address these\nchallenges, we consider two recently proposed generalized fading models, namely\n$\\kappa-\\mu$ and $\\eta-\\mu$, to characterize the fading behavior in D2D\ncommunications. Together, these models encompass many of the most widely\nencountered and utilized fading models in the literature such as Rayleigh, Rice\n(Nakagami-$n$), Nakagami-$m$, Hoyt (Nakagami-$q$) and One-Sided Gaussian. Using\nstochastic geometry we evaluate the rate and bit error probability of D2D\nnetworks under generalized fading conditions. Based on the analytical results,\nwe present new insights into the trade-offs between the reliability, rate, and\nmode selection under realistic operating conditions. Our results suggest that\nD2D mode achieves higher rates over cellular link at the expense of a higher\nbit error probability. Through numerical evaluations, we also investigate the\nperformance gains of D2D networks and demonstrate their superiority over\ntraditional cellular networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 23:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-12"}

A composite density-temperature parameter $\\rho^\\gamma/T$,\noften used to represent combined pressure and temperature data, follows from\nthe model. The theory is in good agreement with experimental data for excess\n(over the crystal state) thermodynamics of molecular glass formers. We suggest\nthat the Kauzmann entropy crisis might be a signature of vanishing\nconfigurational entropy of a subset of degrees of freedom, multipolar rotations\nin our model. This scenario has observable consequences: (i) a dynamical\ncross-over of the relaxation time and (ii) the fragility index defined by the\nratio of the excess heat capacity and excess entropy at the glass transition.\nThe Kauzmann temperature of vanishing configurational entropy, and the\ncorresponding glass transition temperature, shift upward when the electric\nfield is applied. The temperature shift scales quadratically with the field\nstrength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 01:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

In contrast to the linear\nplasmonic scattering dominated by a bulk dipolar mode, a complex\nsurface-induced multipolar source at the doubled frequency sets a fundamental\nlimit to control the SH radiation from metallic nanostructures. In this work,\nwe harness plasmonic hybridization mechanism together with a special selection\nrule governing the SH radiation to achieve the high-intensity and\ntunable-direction emission by a metallic particle-in-cavity nanoantenna\n(PIC-NA). The nanoantenna is modelled with a first-principle, self-consistent\nboundary element method, which considers the depletion of pump waves. The giant\nSH enhancement arises from a hybridized gap plasmon resonance between the small\nparticle and the large cavity that functions as a concentrator and reflector.\nCentrosymmetry breaking of the PIC-NA not only modifies the gap plasmon mode\nboosting the SH signal, but also redirects the SH wave with a unidirectional\nemission.

While in atomic systems a\nbroad range of surface mobilities can be readily accessed, for colloids, owing\nto their large size, this window is substantially narrow and therefore imposes\nsevere restrictions in extending template-assisted growth techniques to steer\ntheir self-assembly. Here, we circumvented this fundamental limitation by\ndesigning templates with spatially varying feature sizes, in this case moire\npatterns, which in the presence of short-range depletion attraction presented\nsurface energy gradients for the diffusing colloids. The templates serve a dual\npurpose, first, directing the particles to target sites by enhancing their\nsurface mean free paths and second, dictating the size and symmetry of the\ngrowing crystallites. Using optical microscopy, we directly followed the\nnucleation and growth kinetics of colloidal islands on these surfaces at the\nsingle-particle level.

Two\nfundamental path-loss attenuation models (i.e., exponential and polynomial\npower-law models) are used to suitably model an erasure probability for packet\ntransmission. Then, under the two erasure models, we introduce a routing\nprotocol using percolation highway in 3D space, and then analyze its achievable\nthroughput scaling laws. It is shown that, under the two erasure models, the\naggregate throughput scaling $n^{\\min\\{1-\\lambda,1-\\mu,1-\\nu\\}}$ can be\nachieved in the 3D erasure network. This implies that the aggregate throughput\nscaling $n^{2/3}$ can be achieved in 3D cubic erasure networks while $\\sqrt{n}$\ncan be achieved in two-dimensional (2D) square erasure networks.

The models are Goldilocks-like in that they are just complicated\nenough to include a mechanism to stabilize the extra-dimensional size, yet\nsimple enough to solve the full 6D field equations using basic tools. The\nsolutions are not limited to the effective 4D regime with H << m_KK (the latter\nreferring to the mass splitting of the Kaluza-Klein excitations) because the\nfull 6D Einstein equations are solved. This allows an exploration of\ninflationary physics in a controlled regime away from the usual 4D lamp-post.\nThe inclusion of modulus stabilization is important as experience with string\nmodels teaches that this is usually what makes models fail: stabilization\nenergies dominate the shallow potentials required by slow roll and open up\ndirections to evolve that are steeper than those of the putative inflationary\ndirection. We explore three representative inflationary scenarios within this\nsimple setup. In one the radion is trapped in an inflaton-dependent local\nminimum whose non-zero energy drives inflation. Inflation ends as this energy\nrelaxes to zero when the inflaton finds its minimum. The others involve\npower-law solutions during inflation. One is an attractor whose features are\nrelatively insensitive to initial conditions but whose slow-roll parameters\ncannot be arbitrarily small; the other is not an attractor but can roll much\nmore slowly, until eventually decaying to the attractor. These solutions can\nsatisfy H > m_KK, but when they do standard 4D fluctuation calculations need\nnot apply. When in a 4D regime the solutions predict eta ~ 0 hence r ~ 0.11\nwhen n_s ~ 0.96 and so are ruled out if tensor modes remain unseen. Analysis of\ngeneral parameters is difficult without a full 6D fluctuation calculation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 06:26:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 05:00:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 20:13:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

In this paper, we suggest a two-stage\ninteraction identification method, called the interaction pursuit via distance\ncorrelation (IPDC), in the setting of high-dimensional multi-response\ninteraction models that exploits feature screening applied to transformed\nvariables with distance correlation followed by feature selection. Such a\nprocedure is computationally efficient, generally applicable beyond the\nheredity assumption, and effective even when the number of responses diverges\nwith the sample size. Under mild regularity conditions, we show that this\nmethod enjoys nice theoretical properties including the sure screening\nproperty, support union recovery, and oracle inequalities in prediction and\nestimation for both interactions and main effects.

Entire plain text file is read\none character at a time and according to the binary representation of ASCII\nvalue of the characters, entire plain text file is divided into n number of 16\nbit blocks. Then an agreed-upon symmetric key file is formed by dividing each\n16 bit block into two 8 bit sub blocks and by using Greatest Common Divisor\n(G.C.D) operation among them. The key size is 40 times the number of 16 bit\nblocks present in the plain text file as each block produces a key of size 40\nbits. The character corresponding to the G.C.D value for each block is stored\nin the cipher text file which is sent by the sender to the receiver along with\nthe symmetric key file. From the symmetric key file and the cipher text file,\nthe receiver by applying reverse procedure, gets back the original plain text\nfile. This technique has several merits, some of them are formation of\nsymmetric key file dynamically, achievement of 50% compression rate in the\ncipher text file, better security in terms of brute force attack and\napplicability of the technique for a large number of files of different size\nand type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 09:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-12"}

In this paper, we probe the dynamics of a\nfour-gene motif with dual strategies of regulation of gene expression. Some of\nthe functional characteristics are compared with those of a two-gene motif, the\ngenetic toggle, employing only transcriptional regulation. Both the motifs\ndefine positive feedback loops with the potential for bistability and\nhysteresis. The four-gene motif, contrary to the genetic toggle, is found to\nexhibit bistability even in the absence of cooperativity in the regulation of\ngene expression. The four-gene motif further exhibits a novel dynamical feature\nin which two regions of monostability with linear threshold response are\nseparated by a region of bistability with digital response.\n  Using the linear noise approximation (LNA), we further show that the\ncoefficient of variation (a measure of noise), associated with the protein\nlevels in the steady state, has a lower magnitude in the case of the four-gene\nmotif as compared to the case of the genetic toggle.

An agent takes adaptive actions to\nachieve a neighborhood to his advantage by rewiring a dissatisfying link with a\nprobability $p$ or switching strategy with a probability $1-p$. Numerical\nresults revealed two phases in the steady state. An active phase for\n$p<p_{\\text{cri}}$ has one connected network of agents using different\nstrategies who are continually interacting and taking adaptive actions. A\nfrozen phase for $p>p_{\\text{cri}}$ has three separate clusters of agents using\nonly R, P, and S, respectively with terminated adaptive actions. A mean-field\ntheory of link densities in co-evolving network is formulated in a general way\nthat can be readily modified to other co-evolving network problems of multiple\nstrategies. The analytic results agree with simulation results on ARPS well. We\npoint out the different probabilities of winning, losing, and drawing a game\namong the agents as the origin of the small discrepancy between analytic and\nsimulation results. As a result of the adaptive actions, agents of higher\ndegrees are often those being taken advantage of. Agents with a smaller\n(larger) degree than the mean degree have a higher (smaller) probability of\nwinning than losing. The results are useful in future attempts on formulating\nmore accurate theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 10:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-12"}

The Cox model may, however, be misspecified, and its proportionality\nassumption may not always be fulfilled. An alternative approach for survival\nprediction is random forests for survival outcomes. The standard split\ncriterion for random survival forests is the log-rank test statistics, which\nfavors splitting variables with many possible split points. Conditional\ninference forests avoid this split variable selection bias. However, linear\nrank statistics are utilized by default in conditional inference forests to\nselect the optimal splitting variable, which cannot detect non-linear effects\nin the independent variables. An alternative is to use maximally selected rank\nstatistics for the split point selection. As in conditional inference forests,\nsplitting variables are compared on the p-value scale. However, instead of the\nconditional Monte-Carlo approach used in conditional inference forests, p-value\napproximations are employed. We describe several p-value approximations and the\nimplementation of the proposed random forest approach. A simulation study\ndemonstrates that unbiased split variable selection is possible. However, there\nis a trade-off between unbiased split variable selection and runtime. In\nbenchmark studies of prediction performance on simulated and real datasets the\nnew method performs better than random survival forests if informative\ndichotomous variables are combined with uninformative variables with more\ncategories and better than conditional inference forests if non-linear\ncovariate effects are included.

This latter\nbasis set, now available for H--He, B--Ne, and Al--Ar, is shown to be very\nclose to the basis set limit. Apparent differences (which can reach 0.35\nkcal/mol for systems like CCl4) between orbital-based and CCSD-F12b basis set\nlimits disappear if basis sets with additional radial flexibility, such as\nACV{5,6}Z, are used for the orbital calculation.

This\nnon-accidental mutation is non-Lamarckian yet useful for evolution, and is due\nto evolved and continually evolving mutational mechanisms operating in the germ\ncells. However, this theory has left a fundamental problem open: If mutational\nmechanisms are not Lamarckian---if they are not \"aware\" of the environment and\nthe macroscale phenotype---then how could heritable novelty be due to anything\nother than accidental mutation? This paper aims to address this question by\narguing the following. Mutational mechanisms can be broadly construed as\nenacting local simplification operations on the DNA in germ cells, along with\ngene duplication. The joint action of these mutational operations and natural\nselection provides simplification under performance pressure. This joint action\ncreates from preexisting biological interactions new elements that have the\ninherent capacity to come together into unexpected useful interactions with\nother such elements, thus explaining nature's tendency for cooption. Novelty\nthus arises not from a local genetic accident but from gradual network-level\nevolution. Many empirical observations are explained from this perspective,\nfrom cooption and gene fusion at the molecular level, to the evolution of\nbehavior and instinct at the organismal level. Finally, the nature of\nmutational mechanisms and the need to study them in detail are described, and a\nconnection is drawn between evolution and learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 13:44:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 11:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

Thus, the entropy production rate can be a valuable measure\nfor the quantification of intracellular signal transduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 14:17:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 06:40:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2017 11:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-09"}

Using the \"floating\nsphere at emitter-plate potential\" (FSEPP) model, it re-examines the\nelectrostatics and mathematics of three simple systems of identical post-like\nemitters. For the isolated emitter, various approaches are noted. On need\nconsider only the effects of sphere charges and (for separated emitters) image\ncharges. For the 2-emitter system, formulas are found for \"charge-blunting\" and\n\"neighbour-field\" effects, for widely spaced and \"sufficiently closely spaced\"\nemitters. Mutual charge-blunting is always dominant, with a related (negative)\nfractional AFEF-change {\\delta}_two. For sufficiently small emitter spacing c,\n|{\\delta}_two| varies as 1/c; for large spacing, |{\\delta}_two| decreases as\n1/c^3. In a 3-emitter linear array, differential charge-blunting and\ndifferential neighbor-field effects occur, but the former are dominant, and\ncause the \"exposed\" outer emitters to have higher AFEF ({\\gamma}_0) than the\ncentral emitter ({\\gamma}_1). Formulas are found for the exposure ratio\n{\\Xi}={\\gamma}_0/{\\gamma}_1, for large and for sufficiently small separations.\nThe FSEPP model for an isolated emitter has accuracy around 30%. Line-charge\nmodels (LCMs) are an alternative, but an apparent difficulty with recent LCM\nmodels is identified. Better descriptions of array electrostatics may involve\ndeveloping good fitting equations for AFEFs derived from accurate numerical\nsolution of Laplace's equation, perhaps with equation form(s) guided\nqualitatively by FSEPP-model results. In existing fitting formulas, the\nAFEF-reduction decreases exponentially as c increases, which differs from\nFSEPP-model formulas.

In particular, we explore the behavior of the\nlog([OIII]5007/Hbeta)/([NII]6583/Halpha) (O3N2) and log[NII]6583/Halpha (N2)\nflux ratios since they are closely connected to different empirical\ncalibrations of the oxygen abundances in star forming galaxies.\n  We compute median growth curves of Halpha, Halpha/Hbeta, O3N2 and N2 up to\n2.5R_50 and 1.5 disk R_eff. The growth curves simulate the effect of observing\ngalaxies through apertures of varying radii. The median growth curve of the\nHalpha/Hbeta ratio monotonically decreases from the center towards larger\nradii, showing for small apertures a maximum value of ~10% larger than the\nintegrated one. The median growth curve of N2 shows a similar behavior,\ndecreasing from the center towards larger radii. No strong dependence is seen\nwith the inclination, morphological type and stellar mass for these growth\ncurves. Finally, the median growth curve of O3N2 increases monotonically with\nradius. However, at small radii it shows systematically higher values for\ngalaxies of earlier morphological types and for high stellar mass galaxies.\n  Applying our aperture corrections to a sample of galaxies from the SDSS\nsurvey at 0.02<=z<=0.3 shows that the average difference between fiber-based\nand aperture corrected oxygen abundances, for different galaxy stellar mass and\nredshift ranges, reaches typically to ~11%, depending on the abundance\ncalibration used. This average difference is found to be systematically biased,\nthough still within the typical uncertainties of oxygen abundances derived from\nempirical calibrations. Caution must be exercised when using observations of\ngalaxies for small radii (e.g. below 0.5R_eff) given the high dispersion shown\naround the median growth curves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 15:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

Near critical transitions small causes can lead to large effects\nand - for all practical purposes - irreversible changes in the properties of\nthe system. The Earth climate is multistable: present astronomical and\nastrophysical conditions support two stable regimes, the warm climate we live\nin, and a snowball climate, characterized by global glaciation. We first\nprovide an overview of methods and ideas relevant for studying the climate\nresponse to forcings and focus on the properties of critical transitions.\nFollowing an idea developed by Eckhardt and co. for the investigation of\nmultistable turbulent flows, we study the global instability giving rise to the\nsnowball/warm multistability in the climate system by identifying the climatic\nedge state, a saddle embedded in the boundary between the two basins of\nattraction of the stable climates. The edge state attracts initial conditions\nbelonging to such a boundary and is the gate facilitating noise-induced\ntransitions between competing attractors. We use a simplified yet Earth-like\nclimate model constructed by coupling a primitive equations model of the\natmosphere with a simple diffusive ocean.

We find situations where the\nMelancholia state has chaotic dynamics. In these cases, the basin boundary\nbetween the two basins of attraction is a strange geometric set with a nearly\nzero codimension, and relate this feature to the time scale separation between\ninstabilities occurring on weather and climatic time scales.

In\ncommunications technologies, the concept of MIMO (multiple input, multiple\noutput) exploits the idea of sending signals via many different rays which may\nreach the receiver. However, if we are concerned with the task of energy\ntransfer, still only one mode is exploited, even if multiple antennas are used\nto send power to the receiver. In the near-field scenario, this is the magnetic\ndipole mode of receiving coil antennas. In the far-field scenario, this is the\npropagating plane wave TEM mode. Recently, it was shown that using special\nartificial materials it is possible to ensure that all electromagnetic modes of\nfree space are conjugately matched to the modes of a material body and, thus,\nall modes deliver power to the body in the most effective way. Such a\nfascinating feature is acquired because the conjugate matching does not concern\nonly the propagating modes but, most importantly, is applied to all evanescent\nmodes. However, coupling to higher-order (mostly evanescent) modes is weak and\ndisappears in the limit of an infinite planar boundary. We show that properly\nperturbing the surface of the receiving or emitting body with, for example,\nrandomly distributed small particles we can open up channels for\nsuper-radiation into far zone. The currents induced in the small particles act\nas secondary sources which send the energy to travel far away from the surface\nand, reciprocally, receive power from far-located sources. We theoretically\npredict about 20-fold power transfer enhancement between the conjugately\nmatched power-receiving body (as compared with the ideal black body) and\nfar-zone sources. Reciprocally, the proposed structure radiates about 20 times\nmore power into far zone as compared with the same source over a perfect\nreflector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 12:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}
