A larger\nor more stable treatment effect is typically less sensitive to bias from\nunmeasured covariates, so it is important to recognize effect modification when\nit is present. We illustrate a recent proposal for conducting a sensitivity\nanalysis that empirically discovers effect modification by exploratory methods,\nbut controls the family-wise error rate in discovered groups. The example\nconcerns a study of mortality and use of the intensive care unit in 23,715\nmatched pairs of two Medicare patients, one of whom underwent surgery at a\nhospital identified for superior nursing, the other at a conventional hospital.\nThe pairs were matched exactly for 130 four-digit ICD-9 surgical procedure\ncodes and balanced 172 observed covariates. The pairs were then split into five\ngroups of pairs by CART in its effort to locate effect modification. The\nevidence of a beneficial effect of magnet hospitals on mortality is least\nsensitive to unmeasured biases in a large group of patients undergoing rather\nserious surgical procedures, but in the absence of other life-threatening\nconditions, such as a comorbidity of congestive heart failure or an emergency\nadmission leading to surgery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 16:06:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Dec 2016 22:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-12"}

Remarkably, we find that the inner HI disc\nwarps back towards the stellar mid-plane in a way that mirrors the warping of\nthe radio lobes. We suggest that the polar HI disc was accreted through a minor\nmerger, and that the torques causing it to warp in the inner regions are also\nresponsible for feeding the AGN. The \"S\" shape of the radio lobes would then be\ndue to the radio jets adapting to the changing angular momentum of the accreted\ngas. The extended radio jets are likely poorly collimated, which would explain\ntheir quick fading and, therefore, their rarity in galaxies similar to NGC\n3998. The fuelling of the central super-massive black hole is likely occurring\nvia \"discrete events\", suggested by the observed variability of the radio core\nand the extremely high core dominance, which we attribute to the formation and\nejection of a new jet resulting from a recent fuelling event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 16:08:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-10"}

We propose to shape transmit\nsignals at adjacent antennas with distinct interpolating filters which\nintroduces pulse shaping diversity eventually leading to improved SINR and\nthroughput at the UEs. In this technique, each antenna transmits its own data\nstream with a relative offset with respect to adjacent antenna. The delay which\nmust be a fraction of symbol period is interpolated with the pulse shaped\nsignal and generates a virtual MIMO channel that leads to improved diversity\nand SINR at the receiver. Note that non-integral sampling periods with\ninter-symbol interference (ISI) should be mitigated at the receiver. For this,\nwe propose to use a fractionally spaced equalizer (FSE) designed based on the\nminimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion. Simulation results show that for a\n2x2 MIMO and with inter-site-distance (ISD) of 50 m, the median received SINR\nand throughput at the UE improves by a factor of 11 dB and 2x, respectively,\nwhich verifies that pulse shaping can overcome poor SM gains in ultra-dense\nsmall cell networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 17:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

The vanishing of the time-dependent AB phase shift on the ordinary\nspace is preserved by the gauge and Lorentz symmetries. However, on the\nnoncomutative phase space, while the ordinary gauge symmetry can be kept by the\nSeiberg-Witten map, but the Lorentz symmetry is broken.

Deep searches for regular\nsatellites around KBOs are difficult due to observational limitations, but\nHaumea is one of the few for which sufficient data exist.

Despite remaining spatially unresolved, in IRS1 we detect\nabundant complex organic molecules, indicating that IRS1 is the most chemically\nevolved hot molecular core presented here. We observe a continuum that is\ndominated by absorption features with at least three strong emission lines,\npotentially from $\\rm CH_3OH$. The $\\rm CH_3OH$ lines which are purely in\nemission have higher excitation than the ones showing purely absorption.\nPotential reasons for that difference are discussed.\n  This is the first comprehensive comparison of observations of the high-mass\ncores NGC7538S and IRS1 and a chemical model. We have found that different\nchemical evolutionary stages can coexist in the same natal gas core. Our\nachievement illustrates the strength of chemical analysis for understanding\nHMSFRs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 14:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-14"}

Cosmic voids\nare usually identified in spectroscopic galaxy surveys, where 3D information\nabout the large-scale structure of the Universe is available. Although an\nincreasing amount of photometric data is being produced, its potential for void\nstudies is limited since photometric redshifts induce line-of-sight position\nerrors of $\\sim50$ Mpc/$h$ or more that can render many voids undetectable. In\nthis paper we present a new void finder designed for photometric surveys,\nvalidate it using simulations, and apply it to the high-quality photo-$z$\nredMaGiC galaxy sample of the Dark Energy Survey Science Verification (DES-SV)\ndata. The algorithm works by projecting galaxies into 2D slices and finding\nvoids in the smoothed 2D galaxy density field of the slice. Fixing the\nline-of-sight size of the slices to be at least twice the photo-$z$ scatter,\nthe number of voids found in these projected slices of simulated spectroscopic\nand photometric galaxy catalogs is within 20% for all transverse void sizes,\nand indistinguishable for the largest voids of radius $\\sim 70$ Mpc/$h$ and\nlarger. The positions, radii, and projected galaxy profiles of photometric\nvoids also accurately match the spectroscopic void sample. Applying the\nalgorithm to the DES-SV data in the redshift range $0.2<z<0.8$, we identify 87\nvoids with comoving radii spanning the range 18-120 Mpc/$h$, and carry out a\nstacked weak lensing measurement. With a significance of $4.4\\sigma$, the\nlensing measurement confirms the voids are truly underdense in the matter field\nand hence not a product of Poisson noise, tracer density effects or systematics\nin the data. It also demonstrates, for the first time in real data, the\nviability of void lensing studies in photometric surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 20:27:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 May 2016 09:36:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 14:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-28"}

This technique\nallowed us to build the first catalogue of Wolf-Rayet rich regions with\nspatially-resolved information, allowing to study the properties of these\ncomplexes in a 2D context. The detection technique is based on the\nidentification of the blue WR bump (around He II 4686 {\\AA}, mainly associated\nto nitrogen-rich WR stars, WN) and the red WR bump (around C IV 5808 {\\AA} and\nassociated to carbon-rich WR stars, WC) using a pixel-by-pixel analysis. We\nidentified 44 WR-rich regions with blue bumps distributed in 25 galaxies of a\ntotal of 558. The red WR bump was identified only in 5 of those regions. We\nfound that the majority of the galaxies hosting WR populations in our sample\nare involved in some kind of interaction process.

We conclude that other effects, such as the binary\nstar channel (which could extend the WR phase up to 10 Myr), fast rotation or\nother physical processes that causes the loss of observed Lyman continuum\nphotons, are very likely affecting the derived WR properties, and hence should\nbe considered when modelling the evolution of massive stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 21:12:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

While MRFs provide a\nsimple and often effective way to model the spatial dependencies in images,\nthey suffer from the fact that parameter estimation is difficult. In practice,\nthis means that MRFs typically have very simple structure that cannot\ncompletely capture the subtle characteristics of complex images.\n  In this paper, we present a novel Gaussian mixture Markov random field model\n(GM-MRF) that can be used as a very expressive prior model for inverse problems\nsuch as denoising and reconstruction. The GM-MRF forms a global image model by\nmerging together individual Gaussian-mixture models (GMMs) for image patches.\nIn addition, we present a novel analytical framework for computing MAP\nestimates using the GM-MRF prior model through the construction of surrogate\nfunctions that result in a sequence of quadratic optimizations. We also\nintroduce a simple but effective method to adjust the GM-MRF so as to control\nthe sharpness in low- and high-contrast regions of the reconstruction\nseparately.

Although this recurrence could not be solved\nanalytically, it allowed for numerical computations that, remarkably, suggested\nthat the variance of the search cost approached a value of $1.883$ when the\ntable was full. Furthermore, by using a non-standard mean-centered search\nalgorithm, this would imply that searches could be performed in expected\nconstant time even in a full table.\n  In spite of the time elapsed since these observations were made, no progress\nhas been made in proving them. In this paper we introduce a technique to work\naround the intractability of the recurrence equation by solving instead an\nassociated differential equation. While this does not provide an exact\nsolution, it is sufficiently powerful to prove a bound for the variance, and\nthus obtain a proof that the variance of Robin Hood is bounded by a small\nconstant for load factors arbitrarily close to 1. As a corollary, this proves\nthat the mean-centered search algorithm runs in expected constant time.\n  We also use this technique to study the performance of Robin Hood hash tables\nunder a long sequence of insertions and deletions, where deletions are\nimplemented by marking elements as deleted. We prove that, in this case, the\nvariance is bounded by $1/(1-\\alpha)+O(1)$, where $\\alpha$ is the load factor.\n  To model the behavior of these hash tables, we use a unified approach that\ncan be applied also to study the First-Come-First-Served and\nLast-Come-First-Served collision resolution disciplines, both with and without\ndeletions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2016 02:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-16"}

In their human infectious stage, immature, submillimetre-scale forms\nof the parasite known as cercariae swim in freshwater and infect humans by\npenetrating through the skin. This infection causes Schistosomiasis, a\nparasitic disease that is comparable to malaria in its global socio-economic\nimpact. Given that cercariae do not feed and hence have a finite lifetime of\naround 12 hours, efficient motility is crucial for the parasite's survival and\ntransmission of Schistosomiasis. However, a first-principles understanding of\nhow cercariae swim is lacking. Via a combined experimental, theoretical and\nrobotics based approach, we demonstrate that cercariae propel themselves\nagainst gravity by exploiting a unique elastohydrodynamic coupling. We show\nthat cercariae beat their tail in a periodic fashion while maintaining a fixed\nflexibility near their posterior and anterior ends.

The result indicates that the\noptimum sum DoF for the $K-$user IC is to achieve the sum DoF of $\\lim_{K\n\\rightarrow \\infty} {\\frac{Kr}{r^2-r+K}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{K}}{2}$ for an\nasymptotically large interference network. Thus, the DoF of the $K$-user IC\nusing reconfigurable antenna grows sublinearly with the number of the users,\nwhereas it grows linearly in the case where transmitters access to the CSI. In\naddition, we propose both achievability and converse proof so as to show that\nthis is the sum DoF of linear BIA with the reconfigurable antenna.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2016 04:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-16"}

The simultaneous Helioseismic and\nMagnetic Imager observations disclose that one footpoint of the MFRs originates\nin the penumbra or penumbra edge with a stronger magnetic field, while the\nother in the moss region with a weaker magnetic field. The significant\ndeviation of the axis of the MFRs from the main polarity inversion lines and\nassociated filaments suggests that the MFRs have ascended to a high altitude,\nthus being distinguishable from the source sigmoidal ARs. The more interesting\nthing is that, with the eruption of the MFRs, the average inclination angle and\ndirect current at the footpoints with stronger magnetic field tend to decrease,\nwhich is suggestive of a straightening and untwisting of the magnetic field in\nthe MFR legs. Moreover, the associated flare ribbons also display an\ninteresting evolution.

Finally, the straight parts of the two ribbons separate\nfrom each other, evolving into two widened parallel ones. These features mostly\nconforms to and supports the recently proposed three-dimensional standard\nCME/flare model, i.e., the twisted MFR eruption stretches and leads to the\nreconnection of the overlying field that transits from a strong to weak shear\nwith the increasing height.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2016 05:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

In the first construction suited to maximum-likelihood\ndecoding, these lattices are defined by sparse (low-density) or non-sparse\ninteger-check matrices.

This\nwell-known behaviour known as the Poynting effect is characterized by a\npositive normal stress. Surprisingly, biopolymer gels made of fibrous proteins\nsuch as fibrin and collagen, as well as many biological tissues exhibit the\nopposite effect, contracting under shear and displaying a negative normal\nstress. Here we show that this anomalous behaviour originates from the open\nnetwork structure of biopolymer gels, which facilitates interstitial fluid flow\nduring shear. Using fibrin networks with a controllable pore size as a model\nsystem, we show that the normal stress response to an applied shear is positive\nat short times, but decreases to negative values with a characteristic time\nscale set by pore size. Using a two-fluid model, we develop a quantitative\ntheory that unifies the opposite behaviours encountered in synthetic and\nbiopolymer gels. Synthetic polymer gels are impermeable to solvent flow and\nthus effectively incompressible at typical experimental time scales, whereas\nbiopolymer gels are effectively compressible. Our findings suggest a new route\nto tailor elastic instabilities such as the die-swell effect that often hamper\nprocessing of polymer materials and furthermore show that poroelastic effects\nplay a much more important role in the mechanical properties of cells and\ntissues than previously anticipated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2016 11:31:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Oct 2016 12:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

The DDC flow is driven by an unstable salinity difference\nand stabilized at the same time by a temperature difference. For these\nconditions the flow can be in the finger regime. We develop scaling laws for\nthree key response parameters of the system: The non-dimensional salinity flux\n$Nu_S$ mainly depends on the salinity Rayleigh number $Ra_S$, which measures\nthe strength of the salinity difference, and exhibits a very weak dependence on\nthe density ratio $\\Lambda$, which is the ratio of the buoyancy forces induced\nby two scalar differences. The non-dimensional flow velocity $Re$ and the\nnon-dimensional heat flux $Nu_T$ are dependent on both $Ra_S$ and $\\Lambda$.\nHowever, the rescaled Reynolds number $Re\\Lambda^{\\alpha^{\\rm eff}_u}$ and the\nrescaled convective heat flux $(Nu_T-1)\\Lambda^{\\alpha^{\\rm eff}_T}$ depend\nonly on $Ra_S$. The two exponents are dependent on the fluid properties and are\ndetermined from the numerical results. Moreover, the behaviors of $Nu_S$ and\n$Re\\Lambda^{\\alpha^{\\rm eff}_u}$ agree with the predictions of the\nGrossmann-Lohse theory which was originally developed for the\nRayleigh-B\\'{e}nard flow. The non-dimensional salt-finger width and the\nthickness of the velocity boundary layers, after being rescaled by\n$\\Lambda^{\\alpha^{\\rm eff}_u/2}$, collapse and obey a similar power-law scaling\nrelation with $Ra_S$. When $Ra_S$ is large enough, salt fingers do not extend\nfrom one plate to the other and horizontal zonal flows emerge in the bulk\nregion. We then show that the current scaling strategy can be successfully\napplied to the experimental results of a heat-copper-ion system~(Hage and\nTilgner, Phys.

However, nanostructures\ncomposed of high-dielectric materials such as noble metals can distort the\nfar-field radiation pattern. Nanoparticles also exhibit a more complex range of\ndistortions, because in addition to introducing a high dielectric surface, they\nalso act as efficient scatterers. Thus, the distortion effects of nanoparticles\nin single-emitter microscopy remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate\nthat metallic nanoparticles can significantly distort the accuracy of\nsingle-emitter imaging at distances exceeding 300 nm.

However, we also need to assign masses to the nuclei. There, the\nBorn-Oppenheimer picture does not account for the inertia of the electrons and\nonly bare nuclear masses are considered. Nowadays, experimental accuracy\nchallenges the theoretical predictions of rotational and vibrational spectra\nand requires to include the participation of electrons in the internal motion\nof the molecule. More than 80 years after the original work of Born and\nOppenheimer, this issue still is not solved in general. Here, we present a\ntheoretical and numerical framework to address this problem in a general and\nrigorous way. Starting from the exact factorization of the electron-nuclear\nwave function, we include electronic effects beyond the Born-Oppenheimer regime\nin a perturbative way via position-dependent corrections to the bare nuclear\nmasses. This maintains an adiabatic-like point of view: the nuclear degrees of\nfreedom feel the presence of the electrons via a single potential energy\nsurface, whereas the inertia of electrons is accounted for and the total mass\nof the system is recovered. This constitutes a general framework for describing\nthe mass acquired by slow degrees of freedom due to the inertia of light,\nbounded particles. We illustrate it with a model of proton transfer, where the\nlight particle is the proton, and with corrections to the vibrational spectra\nof molecules. Inclusion of the light particle inertia allows to gain orders of\nmagnitude in accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2016 15:21:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 15:05:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Jul 2016 12:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-30"}

A particularly\nremarkable phenomenon is the appearance of strongly fluctuating, chaotic\nactivity in networks of deterministic, but randomly connected rate units. How\nthis type of intrinsi- cally generated fluctuations appears in more realistic\nnetworks of spiking neurons has been a long standing question. To ease the\ncomparison between rate and spiking networks, recent works investigated the\ndynami- cal regimes of randomly-connected rate networks with segregated\nexcitatory and inhibitory populations, and firing rates constrained to be\npositive. These works derived general dynamical mean field (DMF) equations\ndescribing the fluctuating dynamics, but solved these equations only in the\ncase of purely inhibitory networks. Using a simplified excitatory-inhibitory\narchitecture in which DMF equations are more easily tractable, here we show\nthat the presence of excitation qualitatively modifies the fluctuating activity\ncompared to purely inhibitory networks. In presence of excitation,\nintrinsically generated fluctuations induce a strong increase in mean firing\nrates, a phenomenon that is much weaker in purely inhibitory networks.\nExcitation moreover induces two different fluctuating regimes: for moderate\noverall coupling, recurrent inhibition is sufficient to stabilize fluctuations,\nfor strong coupling, firing rates are stabilized solely by the upper bound\nimposed on activity, even if inhibition is stronger than excitation. These\nresults extend to more general network architectures, and to rate networks\nreceiving noisy inputs mimicking spiking activity. Finally, we show that\nsignatures of the second dynamical regime appear in networks of\nintegrate-and-fire neurons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 May 2016 15:43:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 13:44:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 13:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

Among these methods, continuous wavelet\ntransform (CWT) as one of the best time-frequency method has been used for both\nstationary and transitory signals. Some deficiencies of CWT are problem of\noverlapping and distortion ofsignals. In this condition, a large amount of\nredundant information exists so that it may cause false alarm or\nmisinterpretation of the operator. In this paper a modified method called Exact\nWavelet Analysis is used to minimize the effects of overlapping and distortion\nin case of gearbox faults. To implement exact wavelet analysis, Particle Swarm\nOptimization (PSO) algorithm has been used for this purpose. This method have\nbeen implemented for the acceleration signals from 2D acceleration sensor\nacquired by Advantech PCI-1710 card from a gearbox test setup in Amirkabir\nUniversity of Technology. Gearbox has been considered in both healthy and\nchipped tooth gears conditions.

The efficiency of this classifier is then\nevaluated with the other signals acquired from the setup test. The results show\nthat in comparison of CWT, PSO Exact Wavelet Transform has better ability in\nfeature extraction in price of more computational effort. In addition, PSO\nexact wavelet has better speed comparing to Genetic Algorithm (GA) exact\nwavelet in condition of equal population because of factoring mutation and\ncrossover in PSO algorithm.
