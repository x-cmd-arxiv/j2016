Recent work on scaling Bayesian inference has\nfocused on modifying the underlying algorithms to, for example, use only a\nrandom data subsample at each iteration. We leverage the insight that data is\noften redundant to instead obtain a weighted subset of the data (called a\ncoreset) that is much smaller than the original dataset. We can then use this\nsmall coreset in any number of existing posterior inference algorithms without\nmodification.

We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a number of synthetic\nand real-world datasets, and find that, in practice, the size of the coreset is\nindependent of the original dataset size.

Unlike in licensed bands, where multiple technologies could\ncoexist only in a primary-secondary DSA mode, a spectrum commons offers\ncompetition opportunities between multiple dominant technologies, such as Wi-Fi\nand the recently proposed LTE in the 5 GHz unlicensed band. In this paper we\nsystematically study the performance of different spectrum sharing schemes for\ninter-technology coexistence in a spectrum commons. Our contributions are\nthreefold. First, we propose a general framework for comparative analysis of\nspectrum sharing mechanisms in time and frequency, by studying the effect of\nkey constituent parameters. Second, we propose a novel throughput and\ninterference model for inter-technology coexistence, integrating different\ndistributed MAC sharing mechanisms at the same level of abstraction. Finally,\nwe present a case study of IEEE 802.11n Wi-Fi and LTE in the 5 GHz unlicensed\nband, in order to obtain generalizable insight into coexistence in a spectrum\ncommons. Our extensive simulation results show that LTE/Wi-Fi coexistence in\nthe 5 GHz band can be ensured simply through channel selection schemes, such\nthat time-sharing MAC mechanisms are irrelevant. We also show that, in the\ngeneral co-channel case, the coexistence performance of MAC sharing mechanisms\nstrongly depends on the interference coupling in the network, as determined by\nbuilding shielding. We thus identify two regimes: (i) low interference\ncoupling, e.g. residential indoor scenarios, where duty cycle mechanisms\noutperform sensing-based LBT mechanisms; and (ii) high interference coupling,\ne.g. open-plan indoor or outdoor hotspot scenarios, where LBT outperforms duty\ncycle mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 17:14:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Oct 2016 13:04:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

This can be done by supervised learning, where a policy\nfunction is tuned to minimize the difference between the predicted and\nground-truth actions. A policy function trained in this way however is known to\nsuffer from unexpected behaviours due to the mismatch between the states\nreachable by the reference policy and trained policy functions. More advanced\nalgorithms for imitation learning, such as DAgger, addresses this issue by\niteratively collecting training examples from both reference and trained\npolicies. These algorithms often requires a large number of queries to a\nreference policy, which is undesirable as the reference policy is often\nexpensive. In this paper, we propose an extension of the DAgger, called\nSafeDAgger, that is query-efficient and more suitable for end-to-end autonomous\ndriving. We evaluate the proposed SafeDAgger in a car racing simulator and show\nthat it indeed requires less queries to a reference policy. We observe a\nsignificant speed up in convergence, which we conjecture to be due to the\neffect of automated curriculum learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 17:40:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-23"}

Whether BP converges and if the\nsolution is a unique fixed point depends on both the structure and the\nparametrization of the model. To understand this dependence it is interesting\nto find \\emph{all} fixed points. In this work, we formulate a set of polynomial\nequations, the solutions of which correspond to BP fixed points. To solve such\na nonlinear system we present the numerical polynomial-homotopy-continuation\n(NPHC) method. Experiments on binary Ising models and on error-correcting codes\nshow how our method is capable of obtaining all BP fixed points. On Ising\nmodels with fixed parameters we show how the structure influences both the\nnumber of fixed points and the convergence properties. We further asses the\naccuracy of the marginals and weighted combinations thereof. Weighting\nmarginals with their respective partition function increases the accuracy in\nall experiments. Contrary to the conjecture that uniqueness of BP fixed points\nimplies convergence, we find graphs for which BP fails to converge, even though\na unique fixed point exists. Moreover, we show that this fixed point gives a\ngood approximation, and the NPHC method is able to obtain this fixed point.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 17:42:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 15:19:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 May 2017 14:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

Specifically, we observe that 1) page-granularity virtual memory\nunnecessarily triggers large memory operations, and 2) existing cache-line\ngranularity memory interface is inefficient for performing bulk data operations\nand operations that exhibit poor spatial locality. To address these problems,\nwe present a series of techniques in this thesis.\n  First, we propose page overlays, a framework augments the existing virtual\nmemory framework with the ability to track a new version of a subset of cache\nlines within each virtual page. We show that this extension is powerful by\ndemonstrating its benefits on a number of applications.\n  Second, we show that DRAM can be used to perform more complex operations than\njust store data. We propose RowClone, a mechanism to perform bulk data copy and\ninitialization completely inside DRAM, and Buddy RAM, a mechanism to perform\nbulk bitwise operations using DRAM. Both these techniques achieve an\norder-of-magnitude improvement in the efficiency of the respective operations.\n  Third, we propose Gather-Scatter DRAM, a technique that exploits DRAM\norganization to effectively gather/scatter values with a power-of-2 strided\naccess patterns. For these access patterns, GS-DRAM achieves near-ideal\nbandwidth and cache utilization, without increasing the latency of fetching\ndata from memory.\n  Finally, we propose the Dirty-Block Index, a new way of tracking dirty\nblocks.

(Random Struct Algorithms, 2015), we show how to deal with dependencies\ninduced by the recent tree MIS algorithms when they are executed on bounded\narboricity graphs. Specifically, we analyze a version of the tree MIS algorithm\nof Barenboim et al. and show that it runs in $O(\\mbox{poly}(\\alpha) \\cdot\n\\sqrt{\\log n \\cdot \\log\\log n})$ rounds in the $\\mathcal{CONGEST}$ model for\ngraphs with arboricity $\\alpha$.\n  While the main thrust of this paper is the new probabilistic analysis via\nread-$k$ inequalities, for small values of $\\alpha$, this algorithm is faster\nthan the bounded arboricity MIS algorithm of Barenboim et al. We also note that\nrecently (SODA 2016), Gaffari presented a novel MIS algorithm for general\ngraphs that runs in $O(\\log \\Delta) + 2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log\\log n})}$ rounds; a\ncorollary of this algorithm is an $O(\\log \\alpha + \\sqrt{\\log n})$-round MIS\nalgorithm on arboricity-$\\alpha$ graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 19:42:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-23"}

New\ninsight is provided into the eta parameter in the NEATM model and it is\nextended to thermal models besides NEATM. The role of surface material\nproperties on eta is examined using laboratory spectra of meteorites and other\nasteroid compositional proxies; the common assumption that emissivity e = 0.9\nin asteroid thermal models may not be justified and can lead to misestimating\nphysical parameters. In addition, indeterminacy in thermal modeling can limit\nits ability to uniquely determine temperature and other physical properties. A\nnew curve fitting approach allows thermal modeling to be done independent of\nvisible band observational parameters such as the absolute magnitude H.

However, all of these results suffer from two significant\nshortcomings: large memory requirement due to the need to store an explicit\nconvex decomposition of the current iterate, and as a consequence, large\nrunning-time overhead per iteration, and worst case convergence rate that\ndepends unfavorably on the dimension.\n  In this work we present a new conditional gradient variant and a\ncorresponding analysis that improves on both of the above shortcomings. In\nparticular: both memory and computation overheads are only linear in the\ndimension. Moreover, in case the optimal solution is sparse, the new\nconvergence rate replaces a factor which is at least linear in the dimension in\nprevious works, with a linear dependence on the number of non-zeros in the\noptimal solution.\n  At the heart of our method, and corresponding analysis, is a novel way to\ncompute decomposition-invariant away-steps. While our theoretical guarantees do\nnot apply to any polytope, they apply to several important structured polytopes\nthat capture central concepts such as paths in graphs, perfect matchings in\nbipartite graphs, marginal distributions that arise in structured prediction\ntasks, and more.

This\ndetermination relies on the calculation of deep-inelastic structure functions\nin the FONLL scheme, generalized to account for massive charm-initiated\ncontributions. In contrast to the usual situation in which the charm PDF is\nassumed to be generated perturbatively by pair radiation off gluons and light\nquarks, vanishing at a scale set by the value of the charm mass m_c, we find\nthat the fitted charm PDF vanishes within uncertainties at a scale Q~1.5 GeV\nfor all x<~0.1, independent of the value of m_c used in the coefficient\nfunctions. We also find some evidence that the charm PDF at large x>~0.1 and\nlow scales does not vanish, but rather has an \"intrinsic\" component, very\nweakly scale dependent and almost independent of the value of m_c, carrying\nabout 1% of the total momentum of the proton. The uncertainties in all other\nPDFs are only slightly increased by the inclusion of fitted charm, while the\ndependence of these PDFs on m_c is significantly reduced. When the EMC charm\nstructure function dataset is included, it is well described by the fit, and\nPDF uncertainties in the fitted charm PDF are significantly reduced, though we\nverify that excluding the EMC data does not qualitatively modify any of our\nfindings. The increased stability with respect to m_c persists at high scales\nand is the main implication of our results for LHC phenomenology. Fitting the\ncharm PDF modifies the predictions for processes such as high p_T and large\nrapidity charm pair production and Z+c production, and thus we expect that\nfuture LHC data will further constrain the charm content of the proton.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 20:02:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 21:56:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 15:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-24"}

The conservation of the total momentum gives the\nhole's kinematics, determining its velocity evolution. Our results explain many\nfeatures of the behavior of hole speed observed in numerical simulations,\nincluding self-acceleration at formation, and hole pushing and trapping by ion\nstreams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 20:08:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

Here we present a new\ngeneral-purpose, biologically-plausible neural implementation of approximate\ninference. The neural network represents uncertainty using Probabilistic\nPopulation Codes (PPCs), which are distributed neural representations that\nnaturally encode probability distributions, and support marginalization and\nevidence integration in a biologically-plausible manner. By connecting multiple\nPPCs together as a probabilistic graphical model, we represent multivariate\nprobability distributions. Approximate inference in graphical models can be\naccomplished by message-passing algorithms that disseminate local information\nthroughout the graph. An attractive and often accurate example of such an\nalgorithm is Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP), which uses local marginalization\nand evidence integration operations to perform approximate inference\nefficiently even for complex models. Unfortunately, a subtle feature of LBP\nrenders it neurally implausible. However, LBP can be elegantly reformulated as\na sequence of Tree-based Reparameterizations (TRP) of the graphical model. We\nre-express the TRP updates as a nonlinear dynamical system with both fast and\nslow timescales, and show that this produces a neurally plausible solution. By\ncombining all of these ideas, we show that a network of PPCs can represent\nmultivariate probability distributions and implement the TRP updates to perform\nprobabilistic inference. Simulations with Gaussian graphical models demonstrate\nthat the neural network inference quality is comparable to the direct\nevaluation of LBP and robust to noise, and thus provides a promising mechanism\nfor general probabilistic inference in the population codes of the brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 21:38:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

Because\nof proximity of the booster injector to the storage ring, the magnetic field of\nthe booster dipoles close to the ring can significantly alter the closed orbit\nin the storage ring being operated in the low energy region. This type of orbit\ndistortion can be a problem for certain precision experiments which demand a\nhigh degree of the energy consistency of the gamma-ray beam. This energy\nconsistency can be achieved by maintaining consistent aiming of the gamma-ray\nbeam, therefore, a steady electron beam orbit and angle at the Compton\ncollision point.

Tuning of parameters or choosing a completely\nnew algorithm is often needed to achieve a certain performance level,\nespecially when there is a limitation of the computation source. In this paper,\nwe focus on this problem and propose a framework to adaptively select the\n\"best\" algorithm-parameter combination and the computation platform under\nperformance and cost constraints at design time, and adapt the algorithms at\nruntime based on real-time inputs. This necessitates developing a mechanism to\nswitch between different algorithms as the nature of the input video changes.\nOur proposed algorithm calculates a similarity function between a test video\nscenario and each training scenario, where the similarity calculation is based\non learning a manifold of image features that is shared by both the training\nand test datasets. Similarity between training and test dataset indicates the\nsame algorithm can be applied to both of them and achieve similar performance.\nWe design a cost function with this similarity measure to find the most similar\ntraining scenario to the test data. The \"best\" algorithm under a given platform\nis obtained by selecting the algorithm with a specific parameter combination\nthat performs the best on the corresponding training data. The proposed\nframework can be used first offline to choose the platform based on performance\nand cost constraints, and then online whereby the \"best\" algorithm is selected\nfor each new incoming video segment for a given platform. In the experiments,\nwe apply our algorithm to the problems of pedestrian detection and tracking.

Unlike the traditional asynchronous proximal stochastic\ngradient descent (TAP-SGD) in which the master carries much of the computation\nload, the proposed algorithm off-loads the majority of computation tasks from\nthe master to workers, and leaves the master to conduct simple addition\noperations.

In this paper, we evaluate the statistical\nmultiplexing gain of VBS pools using a multi-dimensional Markov model, which\ncaptures the session-level dynamics and the constraints imposed by both radio\nand computational resources. Based on this model, we derive a recursive formula\nfor the blocking probability and also a closed-form approximation for it in\nlarge pools. These formulas are then used to derive the session-level\nstatistical multiplexing gain of both real-time and delay-tolerant traffic.\nNumerical results show that VBS pools can achieve more than 75% of the maximum\npooling gain with 50 VBSs, but further convergence to the upper bound\n(large-pool limit) is slow because of the quickly diminishing marginal pooling\ngain, which is inversely proportional to a factor between the one-half and\nthree-fourth power of the pool size. We also find that the pooling gain is more\nevident under light traffic load and stringent Quality of Service (QoS)\nrequirement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 May 2016 14:49:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

A common manifestation of spatial scales is the presence of (at least)\ntwo different scales of pores, which is commonly referred to as double\nporosity. To complicate things, the pore-network at each scale exhibits\ndifferent permeability, and these networks are connected through fissure and\nconduits. Although some models are available in the literature, they lack a\nstrong theoretical basis. This paper aims to fill this lacuna by providing the\nmuch needed theoretical foundations of the flow in porous media which exhibit\ndouble porosity/permeability. We first obtain a mathematical model for double\nporosity/permeability using the maximization of rate of dissipation hypothesis,\nand thereby providing a firm thermodynamic underpinning. We then present, along\nwith mathematical proofs, several important mathematical properties that the\nsolutions to the double porosity/permeability model satisfy. These properties\nare important in their own right as well as serve as good (mechanics-based) a\nposteriori measures to assess the accuracy of numerical solutions. We also\npresent several canonical problems and obtain the corresponding analytical\nsolutions, which are used to gain insights into the velocity and pressure\nprofiles, and the mass transfer across the two pore-networks. In particular, we\nhighlight how the solutions under the double porosity/permeability differ from\nthe corresponding solutions under Darcy equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 21:26:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2016 20:58:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Mar 2018 16:51:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-07"}

Our findings are as follows. (i) Memory\nprotects cooperation. (ii) To our surprise, greater memory size is unfavorable\nto evolutionary success when there is no threat. In the absence of threat,\nsubsequent generations lose their memory and are consequently invaded by\ndefectors. (iii) In contrast, the presence of an appropriate level of threat\ntriggers the emergence of a self-protection mechanism for cooperation, which\nmanifests itself as an increase in memory size within subsequent generations.\nOn the evolutionary level, memory size acts like an immune response of the\ngenerations against aggressive defection. (iv) Even more extreme threat results\nagain in defection. Our findings boil down to the following: The dose of the\nthreat makes the resistance for cooperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 May 2016 12:11:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 13:23:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 20:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-20"}

We explore the question of what effect magnetic shielding has on\ndetectable signals induced by exotic fields. Our general conclusion is that for\ncommon experimental geometries and conditions, magnetic shields should not\nsignificantly reduce sensitivity to exotic spin-dependent interactions,\nespecially when the technique of comagnetometry is used. However, exotic fields\nthat couple to electron spin can induce magnetic fields in the interior of\nshields made of a soft ferro- or ferrimagnetic material. This induced magnetic\nfield must be taken into account in the interpretation of experiments searching\nfor new spin-dependent interactions and raises the possibility of using a flux\nconcentrator inside magnetic shields to amplify exotic spin-dependent signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 May 2016 00:43:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}
