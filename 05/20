We investigate the spatial distribution of a collection of absorbing\ngas clouds, some associated with the dense, massive star-forming core NGC6334\nI, and others with diffuse foreground clouds. For the former category, we aim\nto study the dynamical properties of the clouds in order to assess their\npotential to feed the accreting protostellar cores.\n  Methods. We use spectral imaging from the Herschel SPIRE iFTS to construct a\nmap of HF absorption at 243 micron in a 6x3.5 arcmin region surrounding NGC6334\nI and I(N).\n  Results. The combination of new, spatially fully sampled, but spectrally\nunresolved mapping with a previous, single-pointing, spectrally resolved HF\nsignature yields a 3D picture of absorbing gas clouds in the direction of\nNGC6334. Toward core I, the HF equivalent width matches that of the spectrally\nresolved observation. The distribution of HF absorption is consistent with\nthree of the seven components being associated with this dense star-forming\nenvelope. For two of the remaining four components, our data suggest that these\nclouds are spatially associated with the larger scale filamentary star-forming\ncomplex. Our data also implies a lack of gas phase HF in the envelope of core\nI(N). Using a simple description of adsorption onto and desorption from dust\ngrain surfaces, we show that the overall lower temperature of the envelope of\nsource I(N) is consistent with freeze-out of HF, while it remains in the gas\nphase in source I.\n  Conclusions. We use the HF molecule as a tracer of column density in diffuse\ngas (n(H) ~ 10^2 - 10^3 cm^-3), and find that it may uniquely trace a\nrelatively low density portion of the gas reservoir available for star\nformation that otherwise escapes detection. At higher densities prevailing in\nprotostellar envelopes (>10^4 cm^-3), we find evidence of HF depletion from the\ngas phase under sufficiently cold conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2016 16:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-14"}

In this paper, a variant of SOM is proposed\ncalled AMSOM (Adaptive Moving Self-Organizing Map) that on the one hand creates\na more flexible structure where neuron positions are dynamically altered during\ntraining and on the other hand tackles the drawback of having a predefined grid\nby allowing neuron addition and/or removal during training. Experiments using\nmultiple literature datasets show that the proposed method improves training\nperformance of SOM, leads to a better visualization of the input dataset and\nprovides a framework for determining the optimal number and structure of\nneurons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2016 16:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-20"}

Chandra and XMM-Newton measurements in the\nsurrounding ~50 pc imply a much lighter population of IPs with $\\langle M_{\\rm\nWD} \\rangle \\approx 0.5 M_\\odot$. Here we use broad-band NuSTAR observations of\ntwo IPs: TV Columbae, which has a fairly typical but widely varying reported\nmass of $M_{\\rm WD} \\approx 0.5-1.0 M_\\odot$, and IGR J17303-0601, with a heavy\nreported mass of $M_{\\rm WD} \\approx 1.0-1.2 M_\\odot$. We investigate how\nvarying spectral models and observed energy ranges influence estimated white\ndwarf mass. Observations of the inner 10 pc can be accounted for by IPs with\n$\\langle M_{\\rm WD} \\rangle \\approx 0.9 M_\\odot$, consistent with that of the\nCV population in general, and the X-ray observed field IPs in particular. The\nlower mass derived by Chandra and XMM-Newton appears to be an artifact of\nnarrow energy band fitting. To explain the (unresolved) CHXE by IPs requires an\nX-ray (2-8 keV) luminosity function (XLF) extending down to at least\n$5\\times10^{31}$ erg/s.

Such\ntransitions in the model were first studied by Bouchet and Simonnet (2009) and\nare reminiscent of regime change phenomena in the weather and climate systems\nwherein extreme and abrupt qualitative changes occur, seemingly randomly, after\nlong periods of apparent stability. Mechanisms underlying regime transitions in\nthe model are not well understood yet. From the point of view of atmospheric\nand oceanic dynamics, a novel aspect of the model is the lack of any source of\nbackground gradient of potential-vorticity such as topography or planetary\ngradient of rotation rate (e.g., as in Charney & DeVore '79).\n  We consider perturbations that are embedded onto the system's chaotic\nattractor under the full nonlinear dynamics as bred vectors---nonlinear\ngeneralizations of the leading (backward) Lyapunov vector. We find that\nensemble predictions that use bred vector perturbations are more robust in\nterms of error-spread relationship than those that use Lyapunov vector\nperturbations. In particular, when bred vector perturbations are used in\nconjunction with a simple data assimilation scheme (nudging to truth), we find\nthat at least some of the evolved perturbations align to identify\nlow-dimensional subspaces associated with regions of large forecast error in\nthe control (unperturbed, data-assimilating) run; this happens less often in\nensemble predictions that use Lyapunov vector perturbations. Nevertheless, in\nthe inertial regime we consider, we find that (a) the system is more\npredictable when it is in the zonal regime, and that (b) the horizon of\npredictability is far too short compared to characteristic time scales\nassociated with processes that lead to regime transitions, thus precluding the\npossibility of predicting such transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2016 17:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-20"}

However, different simulations of dense\nassemblies of active particles, parametrised by a self-propulsion force, $f_0$,\nand persistence time, $\\tau_p$, appear to make contradictory predictions about\nthe influence of activity on characteristic features of glass, such as\nfragility. This calls for a broad conceptual framework to understand active\nglasses; here we extend the Random First-Order Transition (RFOT) theory to a\ndense assembly of self-propelled particles. We compute the active contribution\nto the configurational entropy using an effective medium approach - that of a\nsingle particle in a caging-potential. This simple active extension of RFOT\nprovides excellent quantitative fits to existing simulation results. We find\nthat whereas $f_0$ always inhibits glassiness, the effect of $\\tau_p$ is more\nsubtle and depends on the microscopic details of activity. In doing so, the\ntheory automatically resolves the apparent contradiction between the simulation\nmodels.

Incorporating stochastic immigration into a continuous time Markov\nchain model, we derive and analyze the associated master equation. By a\nstandard result, there exists a unique globally stable positive stationary\ndistribution. We show that such stationary distribution admits a bimodal\nprofile which implies that a strong Allee effect exists in the stochastic\nmodel. Such strong Allee effect disappears and threshold phenomenon emerges as\nthe total population size goes to infinity. Stochasticity vanishes and the\nmodel becomes deterministic as the total population size goes to infinity. This\nimplies that there is only one possible fate (either to die out or survive) for\na species constrained to a specific community and whether population eventually\ngoes extinct or persists does not depend on initial population density but on a\ncritical inherent constant determined by birth, death and mate limitation. Such\na conclusion interprets differently from the classical ordinary differential\nequation model and thus a paradox on strong Allee effect occurs. Such paradox\nillustrates the diffusion theory's dilemma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2016 19:17:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 May 2016 16:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

The foundation of this model is the\nasteroid rotation model of Marzari et al. (2011), which incorporates both the\nYORP effect and collisional evolution. This work adds to that model the\nrotational fission hypothesis and the binary evolution model of Jacobson &\nScheeres (2011). The asteroid population evolution model is highly constrained\nby these and other previous works, and therefore it has only two significant\nfree parameters: the ratio of low to high mass ratio binaries formed after\nrotational fission events and the mean strength of the binary YORP (BYORP)\neffect. We successfully reproduce characteristic statistics of the small\nasteroid population: the binary fraction, the fast binary fraction,\nsteady-state mass ratio fraction and the contact binary fraction. We find that\nin order for the model to best match observations, rotational fission produces\nhigh mass ratio ($> 0.2$) binary components with four to eight times the\nfrequency as low mass ratio ($< 0.2$) components, where the mass ratio is the\nmass of the secondary component divided by the mass of the primary component.\nThis is consistent with post-rotational fission binary system mass ratio being\ndrawn from either a flat or a positive and shallow distribution, since the high\nmass ratio bin is four times the size of the low mass ratio bin; this is in\ncontrast to the observed steady-state binary mass ratio, which has a negative\nand steep distribution. This can be understood in the context of the\nBYORP-tidal equilibrium hypothesis, which predicts that low mass ratio binaries\nsurvive for a significantly longer period of time than high mass ratio systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2016 21:54:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-10"}

We present models and\ns-process simulations that adopt a treatment of convective boundaries based on\nthe results of hydrodynamic simulations and on the theory of mixing due to\ngravity waves in the vicinity of convective boundaries. Hydrodynamics\nsimulations suggest the presence of convective boundary mixing (CBM) at the\nbottom of the thermal pulse-driven convective zone. Similarly,\nconvection-induced mixing processes are proposed for the mixing below the\nconvective envelope during third dredge-up where the 13C pocket for the s\nprocess in AGB stars forms. In this work we apply a CBM model motivated by\nsimulations and theory to models with initial mass $M = 2$ and $M = 3M_\\odot$,\nand with initial metal content Z = 0.01 and Z = 0.02. As reported previously,\nthe He-intershell abundance of 12C and 16O are increased by CBM at the bottom\nof pulse-driven convection zone.

We introduce the principle $ADC$, which asserts that linear order has an\ninfinite ascending or descending chain. The two are easily seen to be\nequivalent over the base system $RCA_0$ of second order arithmetic; they are\neven computably equivalent.

A closely\nrelated important aspect of the problem -- quantification of statistical\nsignificance of overlap of clusters, remains relatively unexplored. This paper\npresents the first theoretical and practical results on quantifying\nstatistically significant interactions between clusters in networks. Such\nproblems commonly arise in diverse applications, ranging from social network\nanalysis to systems biology. The paper addresses the problem of quantifying the\nstatistical significance of the observed overlap of the two clusters in an\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graph model. The analytical framework presented in the paper\nassigns a $p$-value to overlapping subgraphs by combining information about\nboth the sizes of the subgraphs and their edge densities in comparison to the\ncorresponding values for their overlapping component. This $p$-value is\ndemonstrated to have excellent discrimination properties in real applications\nand is shown to be robust across broad parameter ranges.\n  Our results are comprehensively validated on synthetic, social, and\nbiological networks. We show that our framework: (i) derives insight from both\nthe density and the size of overlap among communities (circles/pathways), (ii)\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods over all tested datasets, and\n(iii) when compared to other measures, has much broader application scope. In\nthe context of social networks, we identify highly interdependent (social)\ncircles and show that our predictions are highly co-enriched with known user\nfeatures. In networks of biomolecular interactions, we show that our method\nidentifies novel cross-talk between pathways, sheds light on their mechanisms\nof interaction, and provides new opportunities for investigations of\nbiomolecular interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2016 22:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-23"}

LDPM is formulated in\nthe framework of discrete mechanics and it simulates the heterogeneous\ndeformation of cemented granular systems by means of discrete\ncompatibility/equilibrium equations defined at the grain scale. A numerical\nstrategy is proposed to generate a realistic microstructure based on the actual\ngrain size distribution of a sandstone and the capabilities of the method are\nillustrated with reference to the particular case of Bleurswiller sandstone,\ni.e. a granular rock that has been extensively studied at the laboratory scale.\nLDPM micromechanical parameters are calibrated based on evidences from triaxial\nexperiments, such as hydrostatic compression, brittle failure at low\nconfinement and plastic behavior at high confinement. Results show that LDPM\nallows exploring the effect of fine-scale heterogeneity on the inelastic\nresponse of rock cores, achieving excellent quantitative performance across a\nwide range of stress conditions. In addition, LDPM simulations demonstrate its\ncapability of capturing different modes of strain localization within a unified\nmechanical framework, which makes this approach applicable for a wide variety\nof geomechanical settings. Such promising performance suggests that LDPM may\nconstitute a viable alternative to existing discrete numerical methods for\ngranular rocks, as well as a versatile tool for the interpretation of their\ncomplex deformation/failure patterns and for the development of continuum\nmodels capturing the effect of micro-scale heterogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 00:22:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-23"}

It is also notoriously difficult to solve in large-scale since\nstandard techniques require expensive matrix decompositions. An alternative, is\nthe conditional gradient method (aka Frank-Wolfe algorithm) that regained much\ninterest in recent years, mostly due to its application to this specific\nsetting. The key benefit of the CG method is that it avoids expensive matrix\ndecompositions all together, and simply requires a single eigenvector\ncomputation per iteration, which is much more efficient. On the downside, the\nCG method, in general, converges with an inferior rate. The error for\nminimizing a $\\beta$-smooth function after $t$ iterations scales like\n$\\beta/t$. This convergence rate does not improve even if the function is also\nstrongly convex.\n  In this work we present a modification of the CG method tailored for convex\noptimization over the spectrahedron. The per-iteration complexity of the method\nis essentially identical to that of the standard CG method: only a single\neigenvecor computation is required. For minimizing an $\\alpha$-strongly convex\nand $\\beta$-smooth function, the expected approximation error of the method\nafter $t$ iterations is: $$O\\left({\\min\\{\\frac{\\beta{}}{t}\n,\\left({\\frac{\\beta\\sqrt{\\textrm{rank}(\\textbf{X}^*)}}{\\alpha^{1/4}t}}\\right)^{4/3},\n\\left({\\frac{\\beta}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}\\lambda_{\\min}(\\textbf{X}^*)t}}\\right)^{2}\\}}\\right)\n,$$ where $\\textbf{X}^*$ is the optimal solution. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first result that attains provably faster convergence rates for a\nCG variant for optimization over the spectrahedron. We also present encouraging\npreliminary empirical results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 03:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-23"}

Second, a particular choice of the parameters\ninvolved in the formulation produces a $BF$-type action principle describing\nconformally anti-self-dual gravity. Therefore, the new action unifies both\ngeneral relativity and anti-self-dual gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 04:37:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-31"}

Here we\ninvestigate the role of downward magnetic pumping near the surface using a\nkinematic Babcock-Leighton model. We find that the pumping causes the poloidal\nfield to become predominately radial in the near-surface shear layer, which\nallows the negative radial shear to effectively act on the radial field to\nproduce a toroidal field. We observe a clear equatorward migration of the\ntoroidal field at low latitudes as a consequence of the dynamo wave even when\nthere is no meridional flow in the deep convection zone. Both the dynamo wave\nand the flux transport type solutions are thus able to reproduce some of the\nobserved features of the solar cycle, including the 11-year periodicity. The\nmain difference between the two types of solutions is the strength of the\nBabcock-Leighton source required to produce the dynamo action. A second\nconsequence of the magnetic pumping is that it suppresses the diffusion of\nfields through the surface, which helps to allow an 11-year cycle at\n(moderately) larger values of magnetic diffusivity than have previously been\nused.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 06:52:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jun 2016 20:03:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2016 11:10:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-29"}

We present analytical perturbative results (Magnus\nexpansion) in the quasi-static noise approximation combined with numerical\nsimulations for realistic 1/f noise spectra. The gate efficiency is studied as\na function of the gate duration, of the number $n$ of pulses, and of the\nhigh-frequency roll-off. We find that the gate error is non-monotonic in $n$,\ndecreasing as $n^{-\\alpha}$ in the asymptotic limit, $\\alpha \\geq 2$ depending\non the DD sequence. In this limit $\\pi_z$-Urhig is the most efficient scheme\nfor quasi-static 1/f noise, but it is highly sensitive to the soft UV-cutoff.\nFor small number of pulses, $\\pi_z$ control yields anti-Zeno behavior, whereas\n$\\pi_y$ pulses minimize the error for a finite $n$.

This has\nbeen interpreted as resulting from breakup of the weakly bound nucleus prior to\nreaching the fusion barrier, reducing the probability of complete fusion. This\npaper investigates how these conclusions are affected by lifetimes of the\nresonant states that are populated prior to breakup. If the mean life of a\npopulated resonance is much longer than the fusion timescale, then its breakup\ncannot suppress complete fusion. For short-lived resonances, the situation is\nmore complex. This work includes the mean life of the short-lived 2+ resonance\nin 8Be in classical dynamical model calculations to determine its effect on\nenergy and angular correlations of the breakup fragments and on predictions of\nfusion suppression. Coincidence measurements of breakup fragments produced in\nreactions of 9Be with 144Sm, 168Er, 186W, 196Pt, 208Pb and 209Bi at energies\nbelow the barrier are re-analysed. Predictions of breakup observables and of\ncomplete and incomplete fusion at energies above the fusion barrier are made\nusing the classical dynamical simulation code PLATYPUS, modified to include the\nlifetimes of short-lived resonant states. The agreement of the breakup\nobservables is improved when lifetime effects are included. The predicted\nsuppression of complete fusion due to breakup is nearly independent of Z, with\nan average value of 9%, below the experimentally determined fusion suppression\nof 30% in these systems. This more realistic treatment of breakup leads to the\nconclusion that the suppression of complete fusion cannot be fully explained by\nbreakup prior to reaching the fusion barrier. Other mechanisms that can\nsuppress complete fusion must be investigated. A candidate is cluster transfer\nthat produces the same nuclei as incomplete fusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 07:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

We compare\ntwo different dust models, and find that dust parameters and thus the spectral\nenergy distribution in the infrared domain are sensitive to the adopted dust\nmodel. In general, the THEMIS model reproduces the observed emission in the\ninfrared wavelength domain better than the popular Zubko et al. BARE-GR-S\nmodel.

Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) have shown to operate on 2D images with great success for a\nvariety of tasks. Lifting convolution operators to 3D (3DCNNs) seems like a\nplausible and promising next step. Unfortunately, the computational complexity\nof 3D CNNs grows cubically with respect to voxel resolution. Moreover, since\nmost 3D geometry representations are boundary based, occupied regions do not\nincrease proportionately with the size of the discretization, resulting in\nwasted computation.

The\noriginal framework was derived for monotone systems and all the extensions\nrelied on monotone systems theory.

Therefore, a lot of recent applications in machine\nlearning exploited properties of non-quadratic error functionals based on $L_1$\nnorm or even sub-linear potentials corresponding to quasinorms $L_p$ ($0<p<1$).\nThe back side of these approaches is increase in computational cost for\noptimization.

In a previous study using fully-compliant elastic\ntubes, a `pointed' air finger was found to propagate at high speed and low\npressure, which may enable rapid reopening of highly collapsed airways with\nminimal tissue damage (Heap & Juel 2008). In this paper, we identify the\nselection mechanism of that pointed finger, which remained unexplained, by\nconducting an experimental study in a rigid rectangular Hele-Shaw channel with\nan elastic top boundary. The constitutive behaviour of this elasto-rigid\nchannel is broadly similar to that of an elastic tube, but unlike the tube the\nchannel's cross-section adopts self-similar shapes from the undeformed state to\nthe point of first near wall contact. The simplification of the vessel geometry\nenables the systematic investigation of the reopening dynamics in terms of\ninitial collapse. We find that for low levels of initial collapse, a single\ncentred symmetric finger propagates in the channel and its shape is set by the\ntip curvature. As the level of collapse increases, the channel cross-section\ndevelops a central region of near opposite wall contact, and the finger shape\nevolves smoothly towards a `flat-tipped' finger whose geometry is set by the\nstrong depth gradient near the channel walls. We show that the flat-tipped mode\nof reopening is analogous to the pointed finger observed in tubes. Its\npropagation is sustained by the vessel's extreme cross-sectional profile at\nhigh collapse, while vessel compliance stabilises it. A simple scaling argument\nbased on the dissipated power reveals that this reopening mode is preferred at\nhigher propagation speeds when it becomes favourable to displace the elastic\nchannel wall rather than the viscous fluid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 10:51:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}

The fluids have the\nmatched density but different viscosity. A smooth viscosity stratification is\nachieved due to the presence of a thin mixed layer between the fluids. The\nresults show that the presence of slip exhibits a promise for stabilizing the\nmiscible flow system by raising the critical Reynolds number at the onset and\ndecreasing the bandwidth of unstable wave numbers beyond the threshold of the\ndominant instability. This is different from its role in the case of a single\nfluid down a slippery substrate where slip destabilizes the flow system at the\nonset. Though the stability properties are analogous to the same flow system\ndown a rigid substrate, slip is shown to delay the surface mode instability for\nany viscosity contrast. It has a damping/promoting effect on the overlap modes\n(which exist due to the overlap of critical layer of dominant disturbance with\nthe mixed layer) when the mixed layer is away/close from/to the slippery\ninclined wall. The trend of slip effect is influenced by the location of the\nmixed layer, the location of more viscous fluid and the mass diffusivity of the\ntwo fluids. The stabilizing characteristics of slip can be favourably used to\nsuppress the non-linear breakdown which may happen due to the coexistence of\nthe unstable modes in a flow over a substrate with no slip. The results of the\npresent study suggest that it is desirable to design a slippery surface with\nappropriate slip sensitivity in order to meet a particular need for a specific\napplication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 10:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

An\nunexpected phenomenon of structural transformation at the atomic level above a\ncertain value of the strain was revealed in cumulene chain (carbyne-{\\beta}).\nThis phenomenon is a consequence of stability loss of the old equilibrium\natomic positions that occur at small strain, and appearance of two new stable\nequilibrium positions near each of them. The aforementioned restructuring gives\nrise to a softening of {\\pi}-mode whose frequency tends to zero in a certain\nregion of amplitudes when carbon atoms begin to vibrate near new equilibrium\npositions.

The information content of Stokes measurements close to the diffraction\nlimit of the 1.5 m GREGOR telescope is analyzed.

Highly sensitive full Stokes measurements of a quiet-Sun region at\ndisk center in the deep photospheric Fe I lines in the 1.56 {\\mu}m region were\nobtained with the infrared spectropolarimeter GRIS at the GREGOR telescope.\nNoise statistics and Stokes V asymmetries were analyzed and compared to a\nsimilar data set of the Hinode spectropolarimeter (SOT/SP).

Opinion formation is a complex process affected by the\ninterplay of different elements, including the individual predisposition, the\ninfluence of positive and negative peer interaction (social networks playing a\ncrucial role in this respect), the information each individual is exposed to,\nand many others. Several models inspired from those in use in physics have been\ndeveloped to encompass many of these elements, and to allow for the\nidentification of the mechanisms involved in the opinion formation process and\nthe understanding of their role, with the practical aim of simulating opinion\nformation and spreading under various conditions. These modelling schemes range\nfrom binary simple models such as the voter model, to multi-dimensional\ncontinuous approaches.

Deep neural networks can capture\ncomplex non-linear features; however this ability comes at the cost of high\ncomputational and memory requirements. State-of-art networks require billions\nof arithmetic operations and millions of parameters. To enable embedded devices\nsuch as smartphones, Google glasses and monitoring cameras with the astonishing\npower of deep learning, dedicated hardware accelerators can be used to decrease\nboth execution time and power consumption. In applications where fast\nconnection to the cloud is not guaranteed or where privacy is important,\ncomputation needs to be done locally. Many hardware accelerators for deep\nneural networks have been proposed recently. A first important step of\naccelerator design is hardware-oriented approximation of deep networks, which\nenables energy-efficient inference.

This study focuses on the phenomenon of bi-drifting, an effect where\nthe drift direction of subpulses is systematically different in different pulse\nprofile components. Bi-drifting is extremely rare in the pulsar population.\nVarious tools in PSRSALSA, including those allowing quantification of\nperiodicities in the subpulse modulation, their flux distribution, and\npolarization properties, are exploited to obtain a comprehensive picture of the\nradio properties of PSR B1839-04. In particular, the second harmonic in the\nfluctuation spectra of the subpulse modulation is exploited to convincingly\ndemonstrate the existence of bi-drifting. Bi-drifting is confirmed with a\ncompletely independent method allowing the average modulation cycle to be\ndetermined. Polarization measurements were used to obtain a robust constraint\non the magnetic inclination angle of less than 35 deg. Two distinct emission\nmodes are discovered to be operating, with periodic subpulse modulation being\npresent only during the weaker mode. Despite the variability of the modulation\ncycle and interruption by mode-changes, the modulation pattern responsible for\nthe bi-drifting is strictly phase locked over a timescale of years such that\nthe variability is identical in the different components. The phase locking\nimplies that a single physical origin is responsible for both drift directions.\nPhase locking is hard to explain for many models, including those specifically\nproposed in the literature to explain bi-drifting, and they are therefore shown\nto be implausible. It is argued that within the framework of circulating\nbeamlets, bi-drifting could occur if the circulation were severely distorted,\npossibly by distortions in the magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 15:57:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

New metrics are needed for\ncomparing and evaluating closed-loop algorithm performance that address the\nspecific needs of closed-loop neuromodulation controllers. Approach: A metric\nis proposed for system performance that includes normalized terms that can be\nused to compare algorithm performance for a patient. This metric was evaluated\nusing two closed-loop control algorithms that were tested in patients with\nParkinson's Disease (PD) who experience rest tremor. Main Results: The metric's\nresulting balance between tremor treatment and power savings varied on a per\npatient and algorithm basis. This was expected given how each trial resulted in\na variable reduction in stimulation power at the cost of additional tremor for\nthe patient when compared to open-loop stimulation. Significance: The proposed\nmetric will aid in clinical evaluation of new algorithms and provide a\nbenchmark for future system designers. This will be important given the growing\npotential applications of dynamically adjusted neural stimulation.\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02384421.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2016 18:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-31"}

We hypothesize that individuals can be\ncharacterized by their own network with unique architecture and resulting\ndynamics. With respect to architecture, we show that individuals vulnerable to\ndeveloping MD are those with strong connections between symptoms: e.g., only\none night of poor sleep suffices to make a particular person feel tired. Such\nvulnerable networks, when pushed by forces external to the system such as\nstress, are more likely to end up in a depressed state; whereas networks with\nweaker connections tend to remain in or return to a healthy state. We show this\nwith a simulation in which we model the probability of a symptom becoming\nactive as a logistic function of the activity of its neighboring symptoms.\nAdditionally, we show that this model potentially explains some well-known\nempirical phenomena such as spontaneous recovery as well as accommodates\nexisting theories about the various subtypes of MD. To our knowledge, we offer\nthe first intra-individual, symptom-based, process model with the potential to\nexplain the pathogenesis and maintenance of major depression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 08:47:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 08:57:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

We show that all the solutions of the Einstein gravity with\nnegative cosmological constants solve the equations of motion of considered\nmodel. Then we find an expression for the off-shell conserved charges of this\nmodel. By considering the near horizon geometry of a three dimensional black\nhole in the Gaussian null coordinates, we find near horizon conserved charges\nand their algebra. The obtained algebra is centrally extended. By writing the\nalgebra of conserved charges in terms of Fourier modes and considering the BTZ\nblack hole solution as an example, one can see that the charge associated with\nrotations along $\\mathcal{Y}_{0}$ coincides exactly with the angular momentum,\nand he charge associated with time translations $\\mathcal{T}_{0}$ is the\nproduct of the black hole entropy and its temperature.
