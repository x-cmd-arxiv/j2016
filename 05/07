Proactive caching to user terminals is considered,\nin which the caches are filled by the server in advance during the placement\nphase, without knowing the user requests. Each user requests a single file, and\nall the requests are satisfied simultaneously through a shared error-free link\nduring the delivery phase.\n  First, centralized coded caching is studied assuming both the number and the\nidentity of the active users in the delivery phase are known by the server\nduring the placement phase.

The standard\nmethod is a multiscale Mutual Information B-spline algorithm that dynamically\ngenerates an average template as an intermediate registration target. We\ndetermined that this method performs poorly when registering CLARITY brains to\nthe Allen Institute's Mouse Reference Atlas (ARA), because the image histogram\nstatistics are poorly matched. Therefore, we developed a method (Mask-LDDMM)\nfor registering CLARITY images, that automatically find the brain boundary and\nlearns the optimal deformation between the brain and atlas masks. Using\nMask-LDDMM without an average template provided better results than the\nstandard approach when registering CLARITY brains to the ARA. The LDDMM\npipelines developed here provide a fast automated way to anatomically annotate\nCLARITY images.

This relationship can\nbe mediated by unobserved systems, modelled by random variables in the\nclassical case or joint quantum systems in the quantum case. One way to\ndifferentiate between the correlations realisable by two different causal\nstructures is to use entropy vectors, i.e., vectors whose components correspond\nto the entropies of each subset of the observed variables. To date, the\nstarting point for deriving entropic constraints within causal structures are\nthe so-called Shannon inequalities (positivity of entropy, conditional entropy\nand conditional mutual information). In the present work we investigate what\nhappens when non-Shannon entropic inequalities are included as well. We show\nthat in general these lead to tighter outer approximations of the set of\nrealisable entropy vectors and hence enable a sharper distinction of different\ncausal structures. Since non-Shannon inequalities can only be applied amongst\nclassical variables, it might be expected that their use enables an entropic\ndistinction between classical and quantum causal structures. However, this\nremains an open question. We also introduce techniques for deriving inner\napproximations to the allowed sets of entropy vectors for a given causal\nstructure. These are useful for proving tightness of outer approximations or\nfor finding interesting regions of entropy space. We illustrate these\ntechniques in several scenarios, including the triangle causal structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2016 20:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Oct 2016 09:39:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 12:49:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 11 Mar 2018 16:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-15"}

We show that, in the direction of moving clusters, low CMB\nmultipoles impose intensity and polarization spectral distortions with\ndifferent frequency dependences. The polarization signal primarily probes the\nquadrupole moment of the CMB, with a significant contribution from the\nprimordial dipole and octupole moments. For a typical cluster velocity of 1000\nkm/s, corrections to the quadrupole-induced polarization of a non-moving\ncluster are of the order of 2-10% between 200-600 GHz, and depend on cluster's\nposition on the sky, velocity magnitude and direction of motion. We also find\nthat the angular dependence of the signal varies with frequency of observation.\nThe distinct frequency and angular dependences of the polarization induced by\nthe primordial dipole and octupole can be exploited to measure them despite\nother physical effects and foregrounds. Contrary to polarization, intensity\ndistortions are affected by all the CMB multipoles, so they cannot be readily\nused to probe the low multipoles at higher redshifts.

In this work, we present experimental data\nshowing prime factorization by utilizing spin wave interference. The prime\nfactorization includes three major steps. First, general type computer\ncalculates the sequence of numbers mkmod(N), where N is the number to be\nfactorized, m is a randomly chosen positive integer, and k=0,1,2,3,4,5,6 .. .\nNext, the period of calculated sequence r is determined by exploiting spin wave\ninterference.

The correction\nto these energies can be obtained from the poles of a single particle Green's\nfunction derived from a many-body perturbation theory. From a computational\nperspective, the accuracy and efficiency of such an approach depends on how a\nself energy term that properly accounts for dynamic screening of electrons is\napproximated. The $G_0W_0$ approximation is a widely used technique in which\nthe self energy is expressed as the convolution of a non-interacting Green's\nfunction ($G_0$) and a screened Coulomb interaction ($W_0$) in the frequency\ndomain. The computational cost associated with such a convolution is high due\nto the high complexity of evaluating $W_0$ at multiple frequencies. In this\npaper, we discuss how the cost of $G_0W_0$ calculation can be reduced by\nconstructing a low rank approximation to the frequency dependent part of $W_0$.\nIn particular, we examine the effect of such a low rank approximation on the\naccuracy of the $G_0W_0$ approximation.

Simulations\nshow that with reasonable outside biological knowledge, the new method performs\nnoticeably better than current stage-wise strategies, especially when the\nmarginal strength of main effects is weak.\n  The proposed method is designed for single-cohort analyses.

It amounts to solving a specific two-players\nreachability game, called simulation game. We offer the first conditional lower\nbounds for this problem, and we relate its complexity (for computation,\nverification, and certification) to some variants of $n\\times n$ matrix\nmultiplication.\n  We show that any $O(n^{\\alpha})$-time algorithm for simulation games, even\nrestricting to acyclic games/structures, can be used to compute $n\\times n$\nboolean matrix multiplication (BMM) in $O(n^{\\alpha})$ time. This is the first\nevidence that improving the existing $O(n^{3})$-time solutions may be\ndifficult, without resorting to fast matrix multiplication.

In the cyclic case, a $\\max$-semi-boolean\nmatrix multiplication (MSBMM) is used, i.e., a matrix multiplication on the\nsemi-ring $(\\max,\\times)$ where one matrix contains only $0$'s and $1$'s. This\nMSBMM is computable (hence verifiable) in truly subcubic\n$n^{(3+\\omega)/2+o(1)}$ time by reduction to $(\\max,\\min)$-multiplication.\n  Finally, we show a reduction from MSBMM to cyclic simulation games which\nimplies a separation between the cyclic and the acyclic cases, unless MSBMM can\nbe verified in $n^{\\omega+o(1)}$ time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2016 08:18:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 15:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

In particular,\nchiral anomaly turns out to be the underlying mechanism for the negative\nlongitudinal magnetoresistivity in a Weyl metal phase. Existence of a\ndissipationless current channel causes enhancement of electric currents along\nthe direction of a pair of Weyl points or applied magnetic fields ($B$).\nHowever, temperature ($T$) dependence of the negative longitudinal\nmagnetoresistivity has not been understood yet in the presence of disorder\nscattering since it is not clear at all how to introduce effects of disorder\nscattering into the \"topological-in-origin\" transport coefficient at finite\ntemperatures. The calculation based on the Kubo formula of the current-current\ncorrelation function is simply not known for this anomalous transport\ncoefficient. Combining the renormalization group analysis with the Boltzmann\ntransport theory to encode the chiral anomaly, we reveal how disorder\nscattering renormalizes the distance between a pair of Weyl points and such a\nrenormalization effect modifies the topological-in-origin transport coefficient\nat finite temperatures. As a result, we find breakdown of $B/T$ scaling, given\nby $B/T^{1 + \\eta}$ with $0 < \\eta < 1$.

Quantitative\nexperiments have revealed two characteristic input-output relations of the\nsystem: First, in a static chemoattractant gradient, the shapes of the\nintracellular gradients of the signaling molecules are determined by the\nrelative steepness, rather than the absolute concentration, of the\nchemoattractant gradient along the cell body. Second, upon a spatially\nhomogeneous temporal increase in the input stimulus, the intracellular\nsignaling molecules are transiently activated such that the response magnitudes\nare dependent on fold changes of the stimulus, not on absolute levels. However,\nthe underlying mechanism that endows the system with these response properties\nremains elusive. Here, by adopting a widely used modeling framework of\ndirectional sensing, local excitation and global inhibition (LEGI), we propose\na hypothesis that the two rescaling behaviors stem from a single design\nprinciple, namely, invariance of the governing equations to a scale\ntransformation of the input level.

Extra antennas help by\nfocusing the transmission and reception of signal energy into ever-smaller\nregions of space. This brings huge improvements in throughput. However, it\nrequires a large number of Radio Frequency (RF) chains (usually equal to number\nof transmit antennas), which is a major drawback. One approach to overcome\nthese issues is to use Spatial Modulation (SM). In SM, an index of transmit\nantenna is used as an additional source of information to improve the overall\nspectral efficiency. In particular, a group of any number of information bits\nis mapped into two constellations: a signal constellation based on modulation\nscheme and a spatial constellation to encode the index of the transmit antenna.\nHowever, a low spectral efficiency is main drawback of SM. Therefore, a\ncombination of SM with Spatial Multiplexing is an effective way to increase\nspectral efficiency with limited number of RF chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2016 09:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}
