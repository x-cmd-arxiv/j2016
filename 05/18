In most of the cases simple\nmeasures based on the degree sequence (or functionals of these such as\nentropies over degree and joint degree distributions) appear to be highly\ninformative features for automatic classification and provide nontrivial\ninformation on the associated dynam- ical process, working even better than\nmore sophisticated topological metrics. It is thus an open question why these\nseemingly simple measures capture so much information. Here we prove that,\nunder suitable conditions, there exist a bijection between the adjacency matrix\nof an HVG and its degree sequence, and we give an explicit construction of such\nbijection. As a consequence, under these conditions HVGs are unigraphs and the\ndegree sequence fully encapsulates all the information of these graphs, thereby\ngiving a plausible reason for its apparently unreasonable effectiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 16:11:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

Uncertainties due to extrapolations from\naccelerator data, at a maximum energy of $\\sim$ one TeV in the p-p center of\nmass, to 250 TeV ($3\\times10^{19}$ eV in a cosmic ray proton's lab frame)\nintroduce significant uncertainties in predictions of $<X_{max}>$.

This is ideal for the\nfaithful transmission of information, but prohibits an interaction between the\nphotons as required for a plethora of applications in optical quantum\ninformation processing. The long-standing challenge here is to realise a\ndeterministic photon-photon gate. This requires an interaction so strong that\nthe two photons can shift each others phase by pi. For polarisation qubits,\nthis amounts to the conditional flipping of one photon's polarisation to an\northogonal state. So far, only probabilistic gates based on linear optics and\nphoton detectors could be realised, as \"no known or foreseen material has an\noptical nonlinearity strong enough to implement this conditional phase\nshift...\" [Science 318, 1567]. Meanwhile, tremendous progress in the\ndevelopment of quantum-nonlinear systems has opened up new possibilities for\nsingle-photon experiments.

Applications like\nsingle-photon switches and transistors, two-photon gateways, nondestructive\nphoton detectors, photon routers and nonlinear phase shifters have been\ndemonstrated, but none of them with the ultimate information carriers, optical\nqubits.

The specification and assignment of these orthogonal sets to a regular\ntessellation of hexagonal cells have been solved regardless of the parity and\nsize of $m$ (where $2^m$ is the length of the codewords). In particular, when\nthe re-use distance is $D=4$ the number of users per cell is $2^{m-2}$ for\nalmost all $m$, which is twice as many as can be obtained by the best known\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 18:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-18"}

In this work, we model the evolution of Li abundance\nin canonical red giants including the accretion of a sub-stellar mass\ncompanion. We consider a wide range of stellar and companion masses, Li\nabundances, stellar metallicities, and planetary orbital periods. Based on our\ncalculations, companions with masses lower than 15 M_J dissolve in the\nconvective envelope and can induce Li enrichment in regimes where extra mixing\ndoes not operate. Our models indicate that the accretion of a substellar\ncompanion can explain abundances up to A(Li)~2.2, setting an upper limit for\nLi-rich giants formed by this mechanism. Giants with higher abundances need\nanother mechanism to be explained.

In this paper, we\ntreat Review Rating Prediction as a multi-class classification problem, and\nbuild sixteen different prediction models by combining four feature extraction\nmethods, (i) unigrams, (ii) bigrams, (iii) trigrams and (iv) Latent Semantic\nIndexing, with four machine learning algorithms, (i) logistic regression, (ii)\nNaive Bayes classification, (iii) perceptrons, and (iv) linear Support Vector\nClassification. We analyse the performance of each of these sixteen models to\ncome up with the best model for predicting the ratings from reviews. We use the\ndataset provided by Yelp for training and testing the models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 20:52:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-19"}

Identification of conserved moieties gives insight into\nthe structure and function of metabolic networks and facilitates metabolic\nmodelling. All moiety conservation relations can be represented as nonnegative\ninteger vectors in the left null space of the stoichiometric matrix\ncorresponding to a biochemical network. Algorithms exist to compute such\nvectors based only on reaction stoichiometry but their computational complexity\nhas limited their application to relatively small metabolic networks. Moreover,\nthe vectors returned by existing algorithms do not, in general, represent\nconservation of a specific moiety with a defined atomic structure.

The water anomalies are greatly amplified in metastable\n(supercooled/stretched) regions. This makes difficult a complete experimental\ndescription since, beyond certain limits, the metastable phase necessarily\ntransforms into the stable one. Theoretical interpretation of the water\nanomalies could then be based on simulation results of well validated water\nmodels. But the analysis of the simulations has not yet reached a consensus. In\nparticular, one of the most popular theoretical scenarios -involving the\nexistence of a liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP)- is disputed by several\nauthors. In this work we propose to use a number of exact thermodynamic\nrelations which can be tested in a region of the phase diagram outside the LLCP\nthus avoiding the problems associated to the coexistence region. The central\nproperty connected to other water anomalies is the locus of temperatures at\nwhich the density along isobars attain a maximum (TMD line) or a minimum (TmD),\ncomputed via simulations for a successful water model, TIP4P/2005. Next, we\nhave evaluated the vapor-liquid spinodal in the region of large negative\npressures. The shape of these curves and their connection to the extrema of\nresponse functions (isothermal compressibility and heat capacity at constant\npressure) may help to elucidate the validity of the theoretical proposals. In\nthis way we are able to present for the first time a comprehensive scenario of\nthe thermodynamic water anomalies for TIP4P/2005 and their relation to the\nvapor-liquid spinodal. The overall picture shows a remarkable similarity with\nthe corresponding one for the ST2 water model, for which the existence of a\nLLCP has been demonstrated in recent years. It also provides a hint as to where\nthe long-sought for extrema in response functions might become accessible to\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 22:17:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Aug 2016 16:22:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

While the SAAF formulation is\nglobally conservative, the LS formulation need a correction in void. The price\nto pay for this fix is the loss of symmetry of the bilinear form.

To be usable in\nstand-alone systems, facial attributes must be extracted from images\nautomatically and reliably.

To test the stability of the networks, we generated adversarial\nimages -- formed by adding imperceptible non-random perturbations to original\ninputs which result in classification errors -- via a novel fast flipping\nattribute (FFA) technique. We show that FFA generates more adversarial examples\nthan other related algorithms, and that DCNNs for certain attributes are\ngenerally robust to adversarial inputs, while DCNNs for other attributes are\nnot. This result is surprising because no DCNNs tested to date have exhibited\nrobustness to adversarial images without explicit augmentation in the training\nprocedure to account for adversarial examples. Finally, we introduce the\nconcept of natural adversarial samples, i.e., images that are misclassified but\ncan be easily turned into correctly classified images by applying small\nperturbations. We demonstrate that natural adversarial samples commonly occur,\neven within the training set, and show that many of these images remain\nmisclassified even with additional training epochs.

Yet,\nthe codes being deployed in practice are fairly short. In this work, we address\nwhat we view as the main coding theoretic barrier to deploying longer codes in\nstorage: at large lengths, failures are not independent and correlated failures\nare inevitable. This motivates designing codes that allow quick data recovery\neven after large correlated failures, and which have efficient encoding and\ndecoding. We propose that code design for distributed storage be viewed as a\ntwo-step process. The first step is choose a topology of the code, which\nincorporates knowledge about the correlated failures that need to be handled,\nand ensures local recovery from such failures. In the second step one specifies\na code with the chosen topology by choosing coefficients from a finite field.\nIn this step, one tries to balance reliability (which is better over larger\nfields) with encoding and decoding efficiency (which is better over smaller\nfields).

The trials of the catalytic\nNH3 synthesis and the oscillatory NO+H2 reaction have revealed that the\nthermodynamics of the local structure determines the properties and\nmultiplicity of the reaction intermediates enabling the peculiar macroscopic\nkinetics and specific catalytic activity. Structure and activity of catalytic\nsites are correlated within a realistic model, where total undercoordination of\nadjacent surface atoms and enthalpy of local reaction is taken as a descriptor\nfor structure and activity, respectively. The model has specified the resonant\ncatalytic centers for NH3 synthesis on metal surfaces in close agreement with\nexperimental data. The basal planes of noble metals are less active than Fe-\nand Ru-based catalysts, whereas an extraordinary activity of small Pt, Ir and\nRh clusters can be expected. A strong advantage of imperfections compared to\nperfect areas in the surface wave nucleation is evaluated.

Although many efforts have been made to search for\nthe purported EM counterpart of GW150914, the first gravitational wave event\ndetected by LIGO, only Fermi/GBM reported an excess above background (i.e.\nGW150914-GBM) at 0.4 s after the LIGO trigger time, that is possibly associated\nwith this GW event (Connaughton et al. 2016). However, since there is no\nsignificant detection by the INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS around the time of GW150914-GBM,\na great debate has been raised about whether GW150914-GBM is of astrophysical\norigin and associated with the GW150914 (Savchenko et al. 2016). In order to\nanswer this question, we re-analyzed the GBM data with a straightforward but\nsophisticated method. We find that the excess of GW150914-GBM mostly comes from\nthose detectors with bad viewing angles to the GW event, whereas the good\nviewing detectors see nothing significant beyond background fluctuation around\nthe trigger time of GW150914.

Given that GW150914-GBM is the only\nevent found by GBM that is possibly associated with this GW event in a\ncomprehensive search, we conclude that GBM did not detect any electromagnetic\nradiation from the GW150914.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 05:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-19"}

Because of\nnature of the proton-proton processes, observables based on the measurement of\nthe direction and energy of leptons provide the most precise signatures. In the\npresent paper, we concentrate on the angular distribution of Drell-Yan process\nleptons, in the lepton-pair rest-frame. The vector nature of the intermediate\nstate imposes that distributions are to a good precision described by spherical\npolynomials of at most second order.\n  We show that with the proper choice of the coordinate frames, only one\ncoefficient in this polynomial decomposition remains sizable, even in the\npresence of one or two high $p_T$ jets. The necessary stochastic choice of the\nframes relies on probabilities independent from any coupling constants.\n  This remains true when one or two partons accompany the lepton pairs. In this\nway electroweak effects can be better separated from strong interaction ones\nfor the benefit of the interpretation of the measurements.\n  Our study exploits properties of single gluon emission matrix elements which\nare clearly visible if a conveniently chosen form of their representation is\nused. We rely also on distributions obtained from matrix element based Monte\nCarlo generated samples of events with two leptons and up to two additional\npartons in test samples. Incoming colliding protons' partons are distributed\naccordingly to PDFs and are strictly collinear to the corresponding beams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 06:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-21"}

A large increase of the\nSommerfeld coefficient is observed with both decreasing band filling and\nisovalent substitution (K, Rb, Cs) revealing a strong enhancement of electron\ncorrelations and the possible proximity of these materials to a Mott insulator.\nThis trend is well reproduced theoretically by our Density-Functional Theory +\nSlave-Spin (DFT+SS) calculations, confirming that 122-iron pnictides are\neffectively Hund metals, in which sizable Hund's coupling and orbital\nselectivity are the key ingredients for tuning correlations. We also find\ndirect evidence for the existence of a coherence-incoherence crossover between\na low-temperature heavy Fermi liquid and a highly incoherent high-temperature\nregime similar to heavy fermion systems. In the superconducting state, clear\nsignatures of multiband superconductivity are observed with no evidence for\nnodes in the energy gaps, ruling out the existence of a doping-induced change\nof symmetry (from s to d-wave). We argue that the disappearance of the electron\nband in the range 0.4<x<1.0 is accompanied by a strong-to-weak coupling\ncrossover and that this shallow band remains involved in the superconducting\npairing, although its contribution to the normal state fades away. Differences\nbetween hole- and electron-doped BaFe2As2 series are emphasized and discussed\nin terms of strong pair breaking by potential scatterers beyond the Born limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 09:05:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jun 2016 10:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

By offloading the\ncomputationally intensive workloads to the MEC server, the quality of\ncomputation experience, e.g., the execution latency, could be greatly improved.\nNevertheless, as the on-device battery capacities are limited, computation\nwould be interrupted when the battery energy runs out. To provide satisfactory\ncomputation performance as well as achieving green computing, it is of\nsignificant importance to seek renewable energy sources to power mobile devices\nvia energy harvesting (EH) technologies. In this paper, we will investigate a\ngreen MEC system with EH devices and develop an effective computation\noffloading strategy. The execution cost, which addresses both the execution\nlatency and task failure, is adopted as the performance metric. A\nlow-complexity online algorithm, namely, the Lyapunov optimization-based\ndynamic computation offloading (LODCO) algorithm is proposed, which jointly\ndecides the offloading decision, the CPU-cycle frequencies for mobile\nexecution, and the transmit power for computation offloading. A unique\nadvantage of this algorithm is that the decisions depend only on the\ninstantaneous side information without requiring distribution information of\nthe computation task request, the wireless channel, and EH processes. The\nimplementation of the algorithm only requires to solve a deterministic problem\nin each time slot, for which the optimal solution can be obtained either in\nclosed form or by bisection search. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is shown\nto be asymptotically optimal via rigorous analysis. Sample simulation results\nshall be presented to verify the theoretical analysis as well as validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 09:19:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Several of them are\npassively reduced by the design of the TM housing. This system is a\nthick-walled aluminium box that holds the shadow sensors and shields the TM.\nThe housing has an effect on the mechanical, thermal and magnetic environment\naround the TM. All of them have been analysed. The mechanical vibrations have\nto fit the launch environment and the modes have to be outside of the\nmeasurement range (0.0001 - 1 Hz). The magnetic field has to be reduced by a\n0.01 factor.

We found that both the rest-frame\ncolour distributions in the (U-B) vs. (B-V) plane and the S\\'ersic index\ndistributions are well fitted by a sum of two Gaussians, with a remarkable\nconsistency of red-spheroidal and blue-disky galaxy populations, over the\nexplored redshift ($0.5<z<1$) and luminosity ($-1.5<B-B_*<1.0$) ranges. The\ncombination of the UBV rest-frame colour and S\\'ersic index $n$ as a function\nof redshift and luminosity allows us to present the structure of early- and\nlate-type galaxies and their evolution. We found that early type galaxies\ndisplay only a slow change of their concentrations since $z\\sim1$; it is\nalready established by $z\\sim1$ and depends much more strongly on their\nluminosities. In contrast, late-type galaxies get clearly more concentrated\nwith cosmic time since $z\\sim1$, with only little evolution in colour, which\nremains dependent mainly on their luminosity. This flipped luminosity (mass)\nand redshift dependence likely reflects different evolutionary tracks of early-\nand late-type galaxies before and after $z\\sim1$. The combination of rest-frame\ncolours and S\\'ersic index $n$ as a function of redshift and luminosity leads\nto a precise statistical description of the structure of galaxies and their\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 10:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

We\ncharacterize the formation redshift-stellar mass relation for\nintermediate-redshift passive galaxies. We find that at $z\\sim1$ stellar\npopulations in low-mass passive galaxies are younger than in high-mass passive\ngalaxies, similarly to what is observed at the present epoch. Over the full\nanalyzed redshift and stellar mass range, the $D4000$ index increases with\nredshift, while $H\\delta_{A}$ gets lower. This implies that the stellar\npopulations are getting older with increasing stellar mass. Comparison to the\nspectra of passive galaxies in the SDSS survey shows that the shape of the\nrelations of $D4000$, and $H\\delta_{A}$ with stellar mass has not changed\nsignificantly with redshift. Assuming a single burst formation, this implies\nthat high-mass passive galaxies formed their stars at $z_{form}\\sim2$, while\nlow-mass galaxies formed their main stellar population more recently, at\n$z_{form}\\sim1$. The consistency of these results, obtained using two\nindependent estimator of the formation redshift ($D4000$ and $H\\delta_{A}$),\nfurther strengthens a scenario in which star formation proceeds from higher- to\nlower-mass systems as time passes, i.e. what has become known as the\n'downsizing' picture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 10:03:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 17:41:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

Our method relies on a combination of Sequential Monte\nCarlo for likelihood approximation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo for parameter\nsampling. We demonstrate the capabilities of our inference framework on two\nsimple examples in which the lineage tree information is necessary: one in\nwhich the cell phenotype can only switch at cell division and another where the\ncell type fluctuates randomly over timescales that extend well beyond the\nlifetime of a single cell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 10:52:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2016 16:24:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

The\nLandau--de Gennes equation coupled to an externally-prescribed flow field is\nthe basis for the study: this is solved numerically in a periodic spatial\ndomain. The focus is on a limiting case where the advection is passive, such\nthat variations in the liquid-crystal properties do not feed back into the\nequation for the fluid velocity. The main tool for analyzing the results (both\nwith and without flow) is the identification of the fixed points of the\ndynamical equations without flow, which are relevant (to varying degrees) when\nflow is introduced. The fixed points are classified as stable/unstable and\nfurther as either uniaxial or biaxial. Accordingly, various models of passive\nshear flow are investigated, with the main focus being on the case where\ntumbling is absent from the model. In this scenario, not only must advection of\nthe $Q$-tensor be considered, but also its co-rotation relative to the local\nvorticity field. Thus, only the biaxial fixed point survives as a solution of\nthe $Q$-tensor dynamics under the imposition of a general flow field. For\ncertain flows for which co-rotation effects can effectively be ignored along\ntrajectories, both families of fixed points survive. In this scenario, the\nsystem exhibits coarsening arrest, whereby the liquid-crystal domains are\n`frozen in' to the flow structures and the growth in their size is thus\nlimited. The outcome (biaxial final state or a mixture of both families of\nfixed points) can be understood in terms of the flow time- and length-scales\nthat manifest themselves through the co-rotational derivative.

In this work we study two different interpretations for KPFM\non semiconductors: the contact potential difference (CPD) interpretation, which\ninterprets the measured potential as the work function difference between the\nsample and the probe, and a newer, alternative, interpretation proposed by\nBaumgart, Helm and Schmidt (BHS).

High-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction often requires hundreds of\nthousands of single-particle images. Particle extraction from experimental\nmicrographs thus can be laborious and presents a major practical bottleneck in\ncryo-EM structural determination. Existing computational methods of particle\npicking often use low-resolution templates as inputs for particle matching,\nmaking it possible to cause reference-dependent bias. It is critical to develop\na highly efficient template-free method to automatically recognize particle\nimages from cryo-EM micrographs. Results: We developed a deep learning-based\nalgorithmic framework, DeepEM, for single-particle recognition from noisy\ncryo-EM micrographs, enabling automated particle picking, selection and\nverification in an integrated fashion. The kernel of DeepEM is built upon a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) of eight layers, which can be recursively\ntrained to be highly \"knowledgeable\". Our approach exhibits improved\nperformance and high precision when tested on the standard KLH dataset.\nApplication of DeepEM to several challenging experimental cryo-EM datasets\ndemonstrates its capability in avoiding selection of un-wanted particles and\nnon-particles even when true particles contain fewer features. Conclusions: The\nDeepEM method derived from a deep CNN allows automated particle extraction from\nraw cryo-EM micrographs in the absence of templates, which demonstrated\nimproved performance, objectivity and accuracy. Application of this novel\napproach is expected to free the labor involved in single-particle\nverification, thus promoting the efficiency of cryo-EM data processing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 12:15:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Dec 2016 07:22:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-05"}

First, we propose\nPINlogger.js which is a JavaScript-based side channel attack revealing user\nPINs on an Android mobile phone. In this attack, once the user visits a website\ncontrolled by an attacker, the JavaScript code embedded in the web page starts\nlistening to the motion and orientation sensor streams without needing any\npermission from the user. By analysing these streams, it infers the user's PIN\nusing an artificial neural network.

Traditionally, such requirements have been\nmodel-checked via a reduction to the unbounded case by unfolding the model\naccording to the cost bound. This exacerbates the state space explosion problem\nand significantly increases runtime. In this paper, we present three new\nalgorithms to model-check time- and cost-bounded properties for Markov decision\nprocesses and probabilistic timed automata that avoid unfolding. They are based\non a modified value iteration process, on an enumeration of schedulers, and on\nstate elimination techniques. We can now obtain results for any cost bound on a\nsingle state space no larger than for the corresponding unbounded or\nexpected-value property. In particular, we can naturally compute the cumulative\ndistribution function at no overhead. We evaluate the applicability and compare\nthe performance of our new algorithms and their implementation on a number of\ncase studies from the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 12:34:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-19"}

In many cases, gradients of secreted signaling\nmolecules - morphogens - guide this process. The continuous positional\ninformation provided by the gradient is converted into discrete cell types by\nthe downstream transcriptional network that responds to the morphogen. A\nmechanism commonly used to implement a sharp transition between two adjacent\ncell fates is the genetic toggle switch, composed of cross-repressing\ntranscriptional determinants. Previous analyses emphasize the steady state\noutput of these mechanisms. Here, we explore the dynamics of the toggle switch\nand use exact numerical simulations of the kinetic reactions, the Chemical\nLangevin Equation, and Minimum Action Path theory to establish a framework for\nstudying the effect of gene expression noise on patterning time and boundary\nposition. This provides insight into the time scale, gene expression\ntrajectories and directionality of stochastic switching events between cell\nstates. Taking gene expression noise into account predicts that the final\nboundary position of a morphogen-induced toggle switch, although robust to\nchanges in the details of the noise, is distinct from that of the deterministic\nsystem. Moreover, stochastic switching introduces differences in patterning\ntime along the morphogen gradient that result in a patterning wave propagating\naway from the morphogen source. The velocity of this wave is influenced by\nnoise; the wave sharpens and slows as it advances and may never reach steady\nstate in a biologically relevant time. This could explain experimentally\nobserved dynamics of pattern formation. Together the analysis reveals the\nimportance of dynamical transients for understanding morphogen-driven\ntranscriptional networks and indicates that gene expression noise can\nqualitatively alter developmental patterning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 14:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

We constructed broad-band, optical/UV/X-ray\nspectral energy distributions over three X-ray flux intervals. We fitted them\nwith a model which accounts for the disc and the X-ray coronal emission and the\nwarm absorber (well established in this source). The three flux spectra are\nwell fitted by the model we considered. The disc inner temperature remains\nconstant at ~2 eV, while X-rays are variable both in spectral slope and\nnormalization. The absorber covers almost 90% of the central source. It is\noutflowing with a velocity less than 2.3*10^4 km/s (3sigma upper limit), and\nhas a column density of ~10^23.2. Its ionization parameter varies by a factor\nof 1.6, and it is in photo-ionizing equilibrium with the ionizing flux. It is\nlocated at a distance of less than 0.35 pc from the central source and its\nrelative thickness, DR/R is less than 0.1. The absorber' s ionization parameter\nvariations can explain the larger than average amplitude of the X-ray\nvariations. The absence of optical/UV variations (consistent with the high\nblack hole mass estimate) argues against the presence of inward propagating\ndisc fluctuations and strong X-ray illumination of the disc (in agreement with\nthe low ratio of X-ray over the bolometric luminosity of ~20-35). We estimate\nan upper limit for the mass outflow of ~5 solar masses per year (~2.3 times the\nEddington mass accretion rate). If the outflow rate is indeed that high, then\nit must be a short-lived episode in the quasar's life time. Finally, we\nestimate an upper limit for the kinetic power of the outflow of ~1.4*10^43\nergs/s. This outflow cannot deploy significant mechanical energy to the\nsurrounding ISM of the quasar's host galaxy, but is sufficient to heat the ISM\nto 10^7 K and to produce a fast decline to the star formation rate of the\ngalaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 14:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

Since the\nclocks of the devices are not synchronized and their energy-budgets are\nlimited, usually duty-cycled, asynchronous discovery protocols are applied.\nOnly if two devices are awake at the same point in time, they can rendezvous.\nCurrently, time-slotted protocols, which subdivide time into multiple intervals\nwith equal lengths (slots), are considered to be the most efficient discovery\nschemes. In this paper, we break away from the assumption of slotted time. We\npropose a novel, continuous-time discovery protocol, which temporally decouples\nbeaconing and listening. Each device periodically sends packets with a certain\ninterval, and periodically listens for a given duration with a different\ninterval. By optimizing these interval lengths, we show that this scheme can,\nto the best of our knowledge, outperform all known protocols such as DISCO,\nU-Connect or Searchlight significantly. For example, Searchlight takes up to\n740 % longer than our proposed technique to discover a device with the same\nduty-cycle. Further, our proposed technique can also be applied in widely-used\nasymmetric purely interval-based protocols such as ANT or Bluetooth Low Energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 15:28:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 10:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-14"}

The time scales of\nboth processes can be either of the same or of very different orders of\nmagnitude. In the latter case the two trajectories linger within a finite but\nsmall distance (with respect to the overall extent of the attractor) for\nexceedingly long times and therefore remain partially predictable.\n  Tests for distinguishing chaos from laminar flow widely use the time\nevolution of inter-orbital correlations as an indicator.

We assume that in a technical system several processes\ninteract. If we observe these processes with sensors, we are able to model the\nobservations (samples) with a probabilistic model, where, in an ideal case, the\ncomponents of the parametric mixture density model we use, correspond to the\nprocesses in the real world. Eventually, at run-time, novel processes emerge in\nthe technical systems such as in the case of an unpredictable failure. As a\nconsequence, new kinds of samples are observed that require an adaptation of\nthe model. CANDIES relies on mixtures of Gaussians which can be used for\nclassification purposes, too. New processes may emerge in regions of the\nmodels' input spaces where few samples were observed before (low-density\nregions) or in regions where already many samples were available (high-density\nregions). The latter case is more difficult, but most existing solutions focus\non the former. Novelty detection in low- and high-density regions requires\ndifferent detection strategies. With CANDIES, we introduce a new technique to\ndetect novel processes in high-density regions by means of a fast online\ngoodness-of-fit test. For detection in low-density regions we combine this\napproach with a 2SND (Two-Stage-Novelty-Detector) which we presented in\npreliminary work. The properties of CANDIES are evaluated using artificial data\nand benchmark data from the field of intrusion detection in computer networks,\nwhere the task is to detect new kinds of attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 15:47:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-19"}

The condensations must be sufficiently massive, dense and\ncool to be gravitationally unstable, so that they start to contract; {\\it and}\nthey must then radiate away thermal energy fast enough for self-gravity to\nremain dominant, so that they continue to contract. For the metallicities and\ntemperatures in local star forming clouds, this second requirement is only met\nrobustly when the gas couples thermally to the dust, because this delivers the\ncapacity to radiate across the full bandwidth of the continuum, rather than\njust in a few discrete spectral lines. This translates into a threshold for\nvigorous star formation, which can be written as a minimum ram-pressure Pcrit ~\n4 10^-11 dyne. Pcrit is independent of temperature, and corresponds to flows\nwith molecular hydrogen number-density nH2 and velocity v satisfying nH2 v^2 >\n800 cm^-3 (km/s)^2.

There are many advantages\nto taking the optimization perspective: convergence guarantees, improved\nperformance in certain regimes, and a methodology for incorporating the latest\ndevelopments in optimization techniques. However, LP decoding, when implemented\nwith standard LP solvers, does not easily scale to the blocklengths of modern\nerror-correction codes. In earlier work, we showed that by drawing on\ndecomposition methods from optimization theory, specifically the alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM), we could build an LP decoding solver\nthat was competitive with BP, both in terms of performance and speed. We also\nobserved empirically that LP decoders have much better high-SNR performance in\nthe \"error floor\" regime, a trait of particular relevance to optical transport\nand storage applications. While our previous implementation was in floating\npoint, in this paper we report initial results of a fixed-point, hardware-based\nrealization of our ADMM-LP decoder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 20:41:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-23"}

To\ngenerate an $N$-solitary waveform from desired discrete spectrum (eigenvalue\nand discrete spectral amplitudes), we use the Darboux Transform. We explain how\nto the norming factors must be set in order to have the desired discrete\nspectrum. To derive these norming factors, we study the evolution of nonlinear\nspectrum by adding a new eigenvalue and its spectral amplitude. We further\nsimplify the Darboux transform algorithm.\n  We propose a novel algorithm (to the best of our knowledge) to numerically\ncompute the nonlinear Fourier Transform (NFT) of a given pulse. The NFT\nalgorithm, called forward-backward method, is based on splitting the signal\ninto two parts and computing the nonlinear spectrum of each part from boundary\n($\\pm\\infty$) inward. The nonlinear spectrum (discrete and continuous) derived\nfrom efficiently combining both parts has a promising numerical precision. This\nmethod can use any of one-step discretization NFT methods, e.g. Crank-Nicolson,\nas an NFT kernel for the forward or backward part. Using trapezoid rule of\nintegral, we use an NFT kernel (we called here Trapezoid discretization NFT) in\nforward-backward method which results discrete spectral amplitudes with a very\ngood numerical precision.\n  These algorithms, forward-backward method and Darboux transform, are used in\n[1],[2] for design and detection of phase-modulated 2-soliton pulses, and more\nrecently, in [3] for design and detection of more complex pulses with 7\neigenvalues and modulation of spectral phase. For those soliton pulses, the\ndiscrete spectral amplitudes (in particular, phase) of both eigenvalues are\nquite precisely estimated using the forward-backward method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 07:37:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-23"}
