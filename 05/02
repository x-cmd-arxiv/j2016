In an off-line phase, Vito, our self-taught artificial agent, learns\na representative decision process model through exploration of the\ncomputational model: it learns how the model behaves under change of\nparameters. The agent then automatically learns an optimal strategy for on-line\npersonalization. The algorithm is model-independent; applying it to a new model\nrequires only adjusting few hyper-parameters of the agent and defining the\nobservations to match.

If not accounted for, even a small orbital eccentricity can cause a\npotentially significant systematic error in the mass parameters of an\ninspiralling binary. Gravitational-wave search templates typically rely on the\nquasi-circular approximation, which provides relatively simple expressions for\nthe gravitational-wave phase to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order. The\nquasi-Keplerian formalism provides an elegant but complex description of the\npost-Newtonian corrections to the orbits and waveforms of inspiralling binaries\nwith any eccentricity. Here we specialize the quasi-Keplerian formalism to\nbinaries with low eccentricity. In this limit the non-periodic contribution to\nthe gravitational-wave phasing can be expressed explicitly as simple functions\nof frequency or time, with little additional complexity beyond the well-known\nformulas for circular binaries. These eccentric phase corrections are computed\nto 3PN order and to leading order in the eccentricity for the standard PN\napproximants. For a variety of systems these eccentricity corrections cause\nsignificant corrections to the number of gravitational wave cycles that sweep\nthrough a detector's frequency band. This is evaluated using several measures,\nincluding a modification of the useful cycles. We also evaluate the role of\nperiodic terms that enter the phasing and discuss how they can be incorporated\ninto some of the PN approximants. While the eccentric extension of the PN\napproximants is our main objective, this work collects a variety of results\nthat may be of interest to others modeling eccentric relativistic binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2016 20:22:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jun 2016 00:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-30"}

Here, we develop a theoretical method to calculate\nthe circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in\nHg$_{0.3}$Cd$_{0.7}$Te/HgTe/Hg$_{0.3}$Cd$_{0.7}$Te quantum wells (HgTe QWs)\nbased on the realistic eight-band $\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}$ model with\ndensity matrix formalism.

In addition, this method is extended to study the pure spin\ncurrents (PSCs) in HgTe QWs injected by linearly polarized light at normal\nincidence.

To examine the\nrole of the various conformations for a given $r$, we study the conditional\ndistribution, $P(R_g | r)$, of the radius of gyration for a given value of $r$.\n$P(R_g|r)$ is found to vary more gently compared to the corresponding variation\nin the excess hydration free energy.

For the third-order anisotropic\nterm, numerical tests show that it can cause the stationary droplet to become\nout-of-round, which suggests the isotropic property of the LBE needs to be\nseriously considered in the pseudopotential LB model. By adopting the classical\nequilibrium moment or setting the so-called \"magic\" parameter to 1/12, the\nanisotropic term can be eliminated, which is found from the present third-order\nanalysis and also validated numerically.

The coronal\nmagnetic field data are reconstructed from the photospheric vector magnetograms\nobtained by the Hinode satellite and using the nonlinear force-free field\nextrapolation method developed in our previous work (He et al., 2011). The 3-D\nforce-free factor $\\alpha$, 3-D current density, and 3-D magnetic energy\ndensity are employed to analyze the coronal data. The distributions of $\\alpha$\nand current density reveal a prominent magnetic connectivity with strong\nnegative $\\alpha$ values and strong current density before the flare. This\nmagnetic connectivity extends along the main polarity inversion line and is\nfound to be totally broken after the flare. The distribution variation of\nmagnetic energy density reveals the redistribution of magnetic energy before\nand after the flare. In the lower space of the modeling volume the increase of\nmagnetic energy dominates, and in the higher space the decrease of energy\ndominates. The comparison with the flare onset imaging observation exhibits\nthat the breaking site of the magnetic connectivity and site with the highest\nvalues of energy density increase coincide with the location of flare initial\neruption. We conclude that a cramped positive $\\alpha$ region appearing in the\nphotosphere causes the breaking of the magnetic connectivity. A scenario for\nflare initial eruption is proposed in which the Lorentz force acting on the\nisolated electric current at the magnetic connectivity breaking site lifts the\nassociated plasmas and causes the initial ejection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 06:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-03"}

Indeed, a major finding of the work is\nstrong temperature dependence of the extent of structural heterogeneity.\nDistinct signature of static and dynamic heterogeneity of ethanol molecules is\nalso found to appear with lowering of temperature.

In particular, considering that each human action\nin the datasets is performed several times by different subjects, we were able\nto precisely quantify the effect of inter- and intra-subject variability, so as\nto figure out the impact of several learning approaches in terms of\nclassification performance. The net result is that standard testing strategies\nconsisting in cross-validating the algorithm using typical splits of the data\n(holdout, k-fold, or one-subject-out) is always outperformed by a\n\"personalization\" strategy which learns how a subject is performing an action.\nIn other words, it is advantageous to customize (i.e., personalize) the method\nto learn the actions carried out by each subject, rather than trying to\ngeneralize the actions executions across subjects.

Many\nschemes have been proposed to solve this problem, but most of them use\nnetwork-wide broadcasts to ensure the availability of a new address. This\nbecomes extremely difficult as network size grows. In this paper, we propose an\naddress allocation algorithm which avoids network-wide broadcasts to allocate\naddress to a new node. Moreover, the algorithm allocates addresses dynamically\nsuch that the network maintains an \"IP resembles topology\" state.

Manifold-based\nsurface construction techniques are well known in geometric modelling and a\nnumber of variants exist. Common to all is the concept of constructing a smooth\nsurface by blending together overlapping patches (or, charts), as in\ndifferential geometry description of manifolds. Each patch on the surface has a\ncorresponding planar patch with a smooth one-to-one mapping onto the surface.\nIn our implementation, manifold techniques are combined with conformal\nparametrisations and the partition-of-unity method for deriving smooth basis\nfunctions on unstructured quadrilateral meshes. Each vertex and its adjacent\nelements on the surface control mesh have a corresponding planar patch of\nelements. The star-shaped planar patch with congruent wedge-shaped elements is\nsmoothly parameterised with copies of a conformally mapped unit square. The\nconformal maps can be easily inverted in order to compute the transition\nfunctions between the different planar patches that have an overlap on the\nsurface. On the collection of star-shaped planar patches the partition of unity\nmethod is used for approximation. The smooth partition of unity, or blending\nfunctions, are assembled from tensor-product b-spline segments defined on a\nunit square. On each patch a polynomial with a prescribed degree is used as a\nlocal approximant. To obtain a mesh-based approximation scheme, the\ncoefficients of the local approximants are expressed in dependence of vertex\ncoefficients. This yields a basis function for each vertex of the mesh which is\nsmooth and non-zero over a vertex and its adjacent elements. Our numerical\nsimulations indicate the optimal convergence of the resulting approximation\nscheme for Poisson problems and near optimal convergence for thin-plate and\nthin-shell problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 10:35:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

For the analysis of the\nasymptotic behaviour close to the boundary of state space, we provide the\ndescription of a naturally appearing heteroclinic network. Due to the symmetry,\nthe heteroclinic network induces a quotient network. This quotient network is\ninvestigated as well. In the literature this model was already studied, but\nunfortunately the results stated there are invalid, as we will show in this\npaper. It turns out that certain types of behaviour are never possible or\nappear in the system only for some parameter values, contradicting what was\nstated before in the literature. Moreover, the parameter space (-1,1)x(-1,1) is\ndivided into four regions where we observe either irregular behaviour, or\npreference to follow an itinerary consisting of strategies for which one or the\nother agent does not lose, or they alternate in winning.

Although EVs are inherently with limited travelling distance, such\nlimitation could be overcome by deploying public Charging Stations (CSs) to\nrecharge EVs battery during their journeys. In this paper we propose a novel\ncommunication framework for on-the-move EV charging scenario, based on the\nPublish/Subscribe (P/S) mechanism for disseminating necessary CS information to\nEVs, in order for them to make optimized decisions on where to charge. A core\npart of our communication framework is the utilization of Road Side Units\n(RSUs) to bridge the information flow from CSs to EVs, which has been regarded\nas a type of cost-efficient communication infrastructure. Under this design, we\nintroduce two complementary communication modes of signalling protocols, namely\nPush and Pull Modes, in order to enable the required information dissemination\noperation. Both analysis and simulation show the advantage of Pull Mode, in\nwhich the information is cached at RSUs to support asynchronous communication.\nWe further propose a remote reservation service based on the Pull Mode, such\nthat the CS-selection decision making can utilize the knowledge of EVs'\ncharging reservation, as published from EVs through RSUs to CSs. Results show\nthat both the performance at CS and EV sides are further improved based on\nusing this anticipated information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 11:05:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 07:28:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 May 2016 10:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

Spammers abuse SNSs as vehicles to spread spams rapidly and\nwidely. Spams, unsolicited or inappropriate messages, significantly impair the\ncredibility and reliability of services. Therefore, detecting spammers has\nbecome an urgent and critical issue in SNSs. This paper deals with Follow spam\nin Twitter. Instead of spreading annoying messages to the public, a spammer\nfollows (subscribes to) legitimate users, and followed a legitimate user. Based\non the assumption that the online relationships of spammers are different from\nthose of legitimate users, we proposed classification schemes that detect\nfollow spammers. Particularly, we focused on cascaded social relations and\ndevised two schemes, TSP-Filtering and SS-Filtering, each of which utilizes\nTriad Significance Profile (TSP) and Social status (SS) in a two-hop subnetwork\ncentered at each other. We also propose an emsemble technique,\nCascaded-Filtering, that combine both TSP and SS properties.

Recent near-infrared (IR) images suggest a relatively\ndepleted cavity within ~200 au, while former mid-IR data indicate the presence\nof dust at separations shorter than ~100 au. We obtained multi-wavelength\nimages in the near-IR in J, H2, H3 and Ks bands with the IRDIS camera and a\n0.95-1.35 micrometers spectral data cube with the IFS. Data were acquired in\npupil-tracking mode, thus allowing for angular differential imaging. We\ndiscovered several new structures inside 1\", of which the most prominent is a\nbright ring with sharp edges (semi-major axis: 0.4\") featuring a strong\nnorth-south brightness asymmetry. Other faint structures are also detected from\n0.4\" to 1\" in the form of concentric ringlets and at least one spiral arm.\nFinally, the VISIR data at 8.6 micrometers suggests the presence of an\nadditional dust population closer in. Besides, we do not detect companions more\nmassive than 1-3 mass of Jupiter. The performance of SPHERE allows us to\nresolve the extended dust component, which was previously detected at thermal\nand visible wavelengths, into very complex patterns with strong asymmetries ;\nthe nature of these asymmetries remains to be understood. Scenarios involving\nshepherding by planets or dust-gas interactions will have to be tested against\nthese observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 13:10:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-03"}

This calibration involves a scale which\ndepends on the cosmological model, however the evolution of the effective M(z)\nbetween two redshifts with BAO observations is independent of this scale. The\nline of sight BAO scale can be used to extend this calibration to redshifts\nnear z. As an application, using BOSS BAO at z=0.32 and 2.34, JLA supernova at\nlow $z$ and Hubble Space Telescope SN at z>1.7, we find a statistically\ninsignificant downward shift M(2.34)-M(0.32)=-0.08$\\pm$0.15.

For sophisticated\nfinite element discretisations on unstructured grids an efficient\nimplementation can be very time consuming and requires the programmer to have\nin-depth knowledge of the mathematical theory, parallel computing and\noptimisation techniques on manycore CPUs. In this paper we show how the\ndevelopment of bespoke multigrid preconditioners can be simplified\nsignificantly by using a framework which allows the expression of the each\ncomponent of the algorithm at the correct abstraction level. Our approach (1)\nallows the expression of the finite element problem in a language which is\nclose to the mathematical formulation of the problem, (2) guarantees the\nautomatic generation and efficient execution of parallel optimised low-level\ncomputer code and (3) is flexible enough to support different abstraction\nlevels and give the programmer control over details of the preconditioner.

We further aim to\ndetermine the effect of H2O line cooling on the energy balance in the inner\ncircumstellar envelope. We use two radiative-transfer codes to model molecular\nemission lines of CO and H2O towards four M-type AGB stars. We focus on\nspectrally resolved observations of CO and H2O from HIFI. The observations are\ncomplemented by ground-based CO observations, and spectrally unresolved CO and\nH2O observations with PAC. The observed line profiles constrain the velocity\nstructure throughout the circumstellar envelopes (CSEs), while the CO\nintensities constrain the temperature structure in the CSEs. The H2O\nobservations constrain the o-H2O and p-H2O abundances relative to H2. Finally,\nthe radiative-transfer modelling allows to solve the energy balance in the CSE,\nin principle including also H2O line cooling. The fits to the line profiles\nonly set moderate constraints on the velocity profile, indicating shallower\nacceleration profiles in the winds of M-type AGB stars than predicted by\ndynamical models, while the CO observations effectively constrain the\ntemperature structure. Including H2O line cooling in the energy balance was\nonly possible for the low-mass-loss-rate objects in the sample, and required an\nad hoc adjustment of the dust velocity profile in order to counteract extreme\ncooling in the inner CSE. H2O line cooling was therefore excluded from the\nmodels. The constraints set on the temperature profile by the CO lines\nnevertheless allowed us to derive H2O abundances. The derived H2O abundances\nconfirm previous estimates and are consistent with chemical models. However,\nthe uncertainties in the derived abundances are relatively large, in particular\nfor p-H2O, and consequently the derived o/p-H2O ratios are not well\nconstrained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 14:30:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-15"}

Agents move to neighborhoods where\ntheir wealth is not lesser than that of some proportion of their neighbors, the\nthreshold level. As in the case of the classic Schelling model where\nsegregation obtains between two races, we find here that wealth-based\nsegregation occurs and persists. However, introducing uncertainty into the\ndecision to move - that is, with some probability, if agents are allowed to\nmove even though the threshold level condition is contravened - we find that\neven for small proportions of such disallowed moves, the dynamics no longer\nyield segregation but instead sharply transition into a persistent mixed wealth\ndistribution. We investigate the nature of this sharp transformation between\nsegregated and mixed states, and find that it is because of a non-linear\nrelationship between allowed moves and disallowed moves. For small increases in\ndisallowed moves, there is a rapid corresponding increase in allowed moves, but\nthis tapers off as the fraction of disallowed moves increase further and\nfinally settles at a stable value, remaining invariant to any further increase\nin disallowed moves. It is the overall effect of the dynamics in the initial\nregion (with small numbers of disallowed moves) that shifts the system away\nfrom a state of segregation rapidly to a mixed wealth state.\n  The contravention of the tolerance condition could be interpreted as public\npolicy interventions like minimal levels of social housing or housing benefit\ntransfers to poorer households. Our finding therefore suggests that it might\nrequire only very limited levels of such public intervention - just sufficient\nto enable a small fraction of disallowed moves, because the dynamics generated\nby such moves could spur the transformation from a segregated to mixed\nequilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 14:35:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 May 2017 05:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}

The situation is analogous for the use of nuclear norm\nregularization for low-rank recovery of Hermitian positive semidefinite\nmatrices with given trace. In the present paper, we discuss several strategies\nto deal with this situation, from simple to more complex. As a starting point,\nwe consider empirical risk minimization (ERM). It follows from existing theory\nthat ERM enjoys better theoretical properties w.r.t.~prediction and\n$\\ell_2$-estimation error than $\\ell_1$-regularization. In light of this, we\nargue that ERM combined with a subsequent sparsification step like thresholding\nis superior to the heuristic of using $\\ell_1$-regularization after dropping\nthe sum constraint and subsequent normalization.\n  At the next level, we show that any sparsity-promoting regularizer under\nsimplex constraints cannot be convex. A novel sparsity-promoting regularization\nscheme based on the inverse or negative of the squared $\\ell_2$-norm is\nproposed, which avoids shortcomings of various alternative methods from the\nliterature.

Hence we investigate the influence of small scale turbulence on large\nscale MHD processes by utilizing a subgrid-scale (SGS) turbulence model. We\nverify the applicability of our SGS model and then use it to investigate the\ninfluence of turbulence on the plasmoid instability.

The increasing number of PEVs makes the use of\ndistributed charging coordinating strategies preferable to centralized ones. In\nthis paper, we propose an agent-based method which enables a fully distributed\nsolution of the PEVs Coordinated Charging (PEV-CC) problem. This problem aims\nat coordinating the charging schedules of a fleet of PEVs to minimize costs of\nserving demand subject to individual PEV constraints originating from battery\nlimitations and charging infrastructure characteristics. In our proposed\napproach, each PEVs charging station is considered as an agent that is equipped\nwith communication and computation capabilities. Our multiagent approach is an\niterative procedure which finds a distributed solution for the first order\noptimality conditions of the underlying optimization problem through local\ncomputations and limited information exchange with neighboring agents. In\nparticular, the updates for each agent incorporate local information such as\nthe Lagrange multipliers, as well as enforcing the local PEVs constraints as\nlocal innovation terms. Finally, the performance of our proposed algorithm is\nevaluated on a fleet of 100 PEVs as a test case, and the results are compared\nwith the centralized solution of the PEV-CC problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 13:52:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

This problem is a very useful example for the Compressive Sensing\n(CS) theoretical study. In this study, the equivalence of Sudoku puzzles L0 and\nL1 minimizations is analyzed. In particular, 17-clue (smallest number of clues)\nuniquely completable puzzles with sparse optimization algorithms are studied\nand divided into two types, namely, type-I and -II puzzles. The solution of L1\nminimization for the type-I puzzles is unique, and the sparse optimization\nalgorithms can solve all of them exactly. By contrast, the solution of L1\nminimization is not unique for the type-II puzzles, and the results of\nalgorithms are incorrect for all these puzzles. Each empty cell for all type-II\npuzzles is examined. Results show that some cells can change the equivalence of\nL0 and L1 minimizations. These results may be helpful for the study of\nequivalence of L0 and L1 norm minimization in CS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 10:46:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2017 12:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-07"}

The\nsmall-scale flow is chosen to be a local analog of the classical Roberts cells,\nconsisting of strongly helical vortex rolls. The large-scale flow is a shearing\nmotion in either the radial or the latitudinal directions. In the absence of\nlarge-scale shear, the small-scale flow is an efficient dynamo, in agreement\nwith previous results. Adding increasingly large shear flows strongly\nsuppresses the dynamo efficiency, indicating that shear is not always a\nfavourable ingredient in dynamo action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 11:27:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2016 10:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-20"}
