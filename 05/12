These jets supposedly possess relativistic motion and are\noriented close to the line of sight of the observer and accordingly the\nrelativistic Doppler beaming makes them look much brighter than they really are\nin their respective rest-frames. The flux boosting due to the relativistic\nbeaming is a very sensitive factor of the jet orientation angle, as seen by the\nobserver. Quite often large bends are seen in these jets, with misalignments\nbeing $90^\\circ$ or more and might imply a change in the orientation angle that\ncould cause a large change in the relativistic beaming factor. Such large bends\nshould show high contrasts in the brightness of the jets, before and after the\nmisalignments, if relativistic beaming does play an important role in these\njets. It needs to be kept in mind that sometimes a small intrinsic change in\nthe jet angle might appear as a much larger misalignment due to the geometrical\nprojection effects, especially when seen close to the line of sight. Of course\nwhat really matters is the final orientation angle of the jet with respect to\nthe observer's line of sight. Taking the geometrical projection effects\nproperly into account, we calculate the consequences of the presumed\nrelativistic beaming and demonstrate that there ought to be large brightness\nratios in jets before and after the observed misalignments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 16:07:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 May 2016 15:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-11"}

We study in this work changes to tensor-mode\nperturbations (TMPs) that can arise in various proposed modified gravity (MG)\ntheories. These include additional friction effects, nonstandard dispersion\nrelations involving a massive graviton, a modified speed, and a small-scale\nmodification. We introduce a physically motivated parameterization of these\neffects and use current available data to obtain exclusion regions in the\nparameter spaces. Taking into account the foreground subtraction, we then\nperform a forecast analysis focusing on tensor-mode MG parameters as\nconstrained by future experiments COrE, Stage-IV and PIXIE. For a fiducial\nvalue of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0.01$, we find that an additional\nfriction of $3.5\\sim4.5\\%$ compared to GR will be detected at $3$-$\\sigma$ by\nthese experiments, while a decrease in friction will be more difficult to\ndetect. The speed of gravitational waves needs to be by $5\\sim15\\%$ different\nfrom the speed of light for detection. We find that the minimum detectable\ngraviton mass is about $7.8\\sim9.7\\times 10^{-33}$ eV, which is of the same\norder of magnitude as the graviton mass that allows massive gravity theories to\nproduce cosmic acceleration. Finally, we study TMPs in MG during inflation\nusing our parameterization. We find that the tensor spectral index is related\nto $r$ and the friction parameter $\\nu_0$ by $n_T=-3\\nu_0-r/8$. Assuming that\nthe friction parameter is unchanged throughout the history of the Universe and\nis much larger than $r$, future experiments will be able to distinguish this MG\nconsistency relation from the standard inflation one, and thus can be used as a\nfurther test of MG. In summary, TMPs and cosmic-microwave-background B-mode\npolarization provide a complementary avenue to test gravity theories.\n(Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 16:33:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Dec 2016 19:47:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

We present a novel approach for Bayesian estimation\nof the Poisson process model parameters by reparameterising in terms of a\ntuning parameter $m$. This paper presents a method for choosing the optimal\nvalue of m that near-orthogonalises the parameters, which is achieved by\nminimising the correlation between the asymptotic posterior distribution of the\nparameters.

In the case of metals and alloys, the liquid phase is the parent phase\nof materials production. The conditions of the crystallization process control\nthe as-solidified material in its chemical and physical properties. Nucleation\ninitiates the crystallization of a liquid. It selects the crystallographic\nphase, stable or meta-stable. Its detailed knowledge is therefore mandatory for\nthe design of materials. We present techniques of containerless processing for\nnucleation studies of metals and alloys. We demonstrate the power of these\nmethods for crystal nucleation of stable solids but in particular also for\ninvestigations of crystal nucleation of metastable solids at extreme\nundercooling. This concerns the issue of heterogeneous versus homogeneous\nnucleation and non-equilibrium conditions. The results are analyzed within\nclassical nucleation theory, where the activation energy of homogeneous\nnucleation depends on the interfacial energy and the difference of Gibbs free\nenergies of solid and liquid. The interfacial energy acts as barrier for the\nnucleation process. Its experimental determination is difficult in the case of\nmetals. In the second part of this work we therefore explore the use of\ncolloidal suspensions as models for the crystallization process. Their\nnucleation process is observed in situ by optical techniques and ultra-small\nangle X-ray diffraction using high intensity synchrotron radiation. It allows\nan unambiguous discrimination of homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation as\nwell as the determination of the interfacial free energy of the solid-liquid\ninterface.

However, the joint optimization of the relay matrix and the source\nprecoder for the energy-flow-assisted (EFA) and the non-EFA (NEFA) schemes is\nintractable. The original rate maximization problem is transformed into an\nequivalent weighted mean square error minimization problem and optimized\niteratively, where the global optimum of the nonconvex source precoder\nsubproblem is achieved by semidefinite relaxation and rank reduction. The\niterative algorithm finally converges. Then, the simplified EFA and NEFA\nschemes are proposed based on channel diagonalization, such that the matrices\noptimizations can be simplified to power optimizations. Closed-form solutions\ncan be achieved. Simulation results reveal that the EFA schemes can outperform\nthe NEFA schemes. Additionally, deploying more antennas at the relay increases\nthe dimension of the signal space at the relay.

In this study,\nkinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations are used to numerically quantify the\ncomplex bimolecular charge carrier recombination behavior in idealized\nphase-separated blends. Recent KMC simulations have identified how the\nencounter-limited bimolecular recombination rate in these blends deviates from\nthe often used Langevin model and have been used to construct the new power\nmean mobility model. Here, we make a challenging but crucial expansion to this\nwork by determining the charge carrier concentration dependence of the\nencounter-limited bimolecular recombination coefficient. In doing so, we find\nthat an accurate treatment of the long-range electrostatic interactions between\ncharge carriers is critical, and we further argue that many previous KMC\nsimulation studies have used a Coulomb cutoff radius that is too small, which\ncauses a significant overestimation of the recombination rate.

We report here\nthe results of magnetization, heat-capacity, and magnetoresistance studies in\nthe temperature (T) range 1.8-300 K. The results establish that there is a\nlong-range magnetic order of an antiferromagnetic type below (TN= ) 18.5 K,\ndespite a much large value (about 80 K) of paramagnetic Curie temperature with\na positive sign characteristic of ferromagnetic interaction. We attribute this\nto geometric frustration. The most interesting finding is that there is an\nadditional magnetic anomaly below about 55 K before the onset of long range\norder in the magnetic susceptibility data. Concurrent with this observation,\nthe sign of isothermal entropy change remains positive above TN with a broad\npeak above TN. This observation indicates the presence of ferromagnetic\nclusters before the onset of long range magnetic order. Thus, this compound may\nserve as an example for a situation in which magnetic frustration due to\ngeometrical reasons is faced by competition with such precursor effects. There\nis also a reversal of the sign of entropy-change in the curves for lower final\nfields (for H less than 30 kOe) on entering into magnetically ordered state\nconsistent with the entrance into antiferromagnetic state. The\nmagnetoresistance behavior is consistent with above conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 17:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

One possible scenario is the accretion of this medium by an\nintermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) at the centre of the cluster. In this work,\nwe aim at modelling the cluster colour-excess profile as a tracer of the ICM\ndensity, both with and without an IMBH. Comparing the profiles with\nobservations allows us to test the existence of IMBHs and their possible role\nin the cleansing of the ICM. We derive the intracluster density profiles from\nhydrodynamical models of accretion onto a central IMBH in a GC and we determine\nthe corresponding dust density. This model is applied to a list of 25 Galactic\nGCs. We find that central IMBHs decrease the ICM by several orders of\nmagnitude. In a subset of 9 clusters, the absence of the black hole combined\nwith a low intracluster medium temperature would be at odds with present gas\nmass content estimations. As a result, we conclude that IMBHs are an effective\ncleansing mechanism of the ICM of GCs. We construct synthetic extinction maps\nfor M 62 and {\\omega} Cen, two clusters in the small subset of 9 with observed\n2D extinction maps. We find that under reasonable assumptions regarding the\nmodel parameters, if the gas temperature in M 62 is close to 8000 K, an IMBH\nneeds to be invoked. Further ICM observations regarding both the gas and dust\nin GCs could help to settle this issue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 18:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

The simulations follow three\nexponential disks of different mass but similar circular velocity, radial\nscalelength, and (constant) scale height. The disks develop different\nnon-axisymmetric patterns, ranging from feeble, long-lived multiple arms to\nstrong, rapidly-evolving few-armed spirals. These fluctuations induce radial\nmigration through secular changes in the angular momentum of disk particles,\nmixing the disk radially and blurring pre-existing gradients. Migration affects\nprimarily stars with small vertical excursions, regardless of spiral pattern.\nThis \"provenance bias\" largely determines the vertical structure of migrating\nstars: inward migrators thin down as they move in, whereas outward migrators do\nnot thicken up but rather preserve the disk scale height at destination.\nMigrators of equal birth radius thus develop a strong scale-height gradient,\nnot by flaring out as commonly assumed, but by thinning down as they spread\ninward. Similar gradients have been observed for low-[$\\alpha$/Fe]\nmono-abundance populations (MAPs) in the Galaxy but our results argue against\ninterpreting them as a consequence of radial migration. This is because outward\nmigration does not lead to thickening, implying that the maximum scale height\nof any population should reflect its value at birth. In contrast, Galactic MAPs\nhave scale heights that increase monotonically outwards, reaching values that\ngreatly exceed those at their presumed birth radii. Given the strong vertical\nbias affecting migration, a proper assessment of the importance of radial\nmigration in the Galaxy should take carefully into account the strong radial\ndependence of the scale heights of the various stellar populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 20:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

The main contribution of this work\nis to introduce designs for LLO CV-QKD based on self-coherence phase sharing,\nin which the phase reference information and the quantum information are\ncoherently obtained from a single optical wavefront.

First,\nthe input-output feedback linearization method is utilized assuming that the\ninternal dynamics is Input-to-State Stable (ISS) to obtain linearized\nsubsystems of agents. Consequently, we propose local dynamic controllers for\nagents such that the linearized subsystems have an identical closed-loop\ndynamics which has a single pole at the origin whereas other poles are on the\nopen left half complex plane. This allows us to deal with distinct agents\nhaving arbitrarily vector relative degrees and to derive rank-$1$ cooperative\ncontrol inputs for those homogeneous linearized dynamics which results in a\nminimum rank distributed dynamic consensus controller for the initial nonlinear\nMAS. Moreover, we prove that the coupling strength in the consensus protocol\ncan be arbitrarily small but positive and hence our consensus design is\nnon-conservative. Next, our design approach is further strengthened by tackling\nthe problem of randomly switching communication topologies among agents where\nwe relax the assumption on the balance of each switched graph and derive a\ndistributed rank-$1$ dynamic consensus controller. Lastly, a numerical example\nis introduced to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 01:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Then we build an analytical toy model of a\ntime-dependent process both in the Boyer-Lindquist and Kerr-Schild coordinate\nsystems in which the force-free plasma injected continuously is filling a\nvacuum, and suggest that the structure of the steady outward Poynting flux is\ncausally constructed by the displacement current and the cross-field current at\nthe in-going boundary between the plasma and the vacuum.

Prior work has reported that a finite length\n$L_\\infty$ of the capillary groove can remain indefinitely filled with liquid\neven when large shear stresses are applied. The mechanism preventing full\ndrainage is attributed to a balance between the shear-driven flow and a\ncounterflow driven by capillary pressures caused by deformation of the free\nsurface. The final equilibrium length $L_\\infty$ is uniquely determined by\nphysical properties of the filling liquid as well as the geometry and\nwettability of the capillary. In this work, we examine closely the approach to\nthe final equilibrium length $L_\\infty$ and report a crossover to a slow\ndrainage regime that cannot be described by conventional dynamic models\nconsidering solely hydrodynamic and capillary forces. The slow drainage regime\nobserved in experiments can be instead modeled by a kinetic equation describing\na sequence of random thermally activated transitions between multiple\nmetastable states caused by surface defects with nanoscale dimensions. Our\nfindings provide new insights on the critical role that natural or engineered\nsurface roughness with nanoscale dimensions can play in the imbibition and\ndrainage of capillaries and other dynamic wetting processes in microscale\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 03:36:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-19"}

Therefore, new energy saving schemes must take SDN into account,\nwhich is extremely important considering the rapidly increasing energy\nconsumption from Telecom and ISP networks. At the same time, the introduction\nof SDN in a current network must be incremental in most cases, for both\ntechnical and economic reasons. During this period, operators have to manage\nhybrid networks, where SDN and traditional protocols coexist. In this paper, we\nstudy the energy efficient traffic engineering problem in hybrid SDN/IP\nnetworks. We first formulate the mathematic optimization model considering\nSDN/IP hybrid routing mode. As the problem is NP-hard, we propose the fast\nheuristic algorithm named HEATE (Hybrid Energy-Aware Traffic Engineering). In\nour proposed HEATE algorithm, the IP routers perform the shortest path routing\nusing the distribute OSPF link weight optimization. The SDNs perform the\nmulti-path routing with traffic flow splitting by the global SDN controller.\nThe HEATE algorithm finds the optimal setting of OSPF link weight and splitting\nratio of SDNs. Thus traffic flow is aggregated onto partial links and the\nunderutilized links can be turned off to save energy. By computer simulation\nresults, we show that our algorithm has a significant improvement in energy\nefficiency in hybrid SDN/IP networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 04:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-13"}

This is a challenging\nscenario due to the existence of multiple, large, and independently moving\nobjects in the environment, which often leads to excessive portion of outliers\nand results in erroneous motion estimation. Existing algorithms cannot cope\nwith such situations well. This paper proposes a new algorithm for relative\npose using a multi-camera system with multiple non-overlapping individual\ncameras. The method works robustly even when the numbers of outliers are\noverwhelming. By exploiting specific prior knowledge of driving scene we have\ndeveloped an efficient 4-point algorithm for multi-camera relative pose, which\nadmits analytic solutions by solving a polynomial root-finding equation, and\nruns extremely fast (at about 0.5$u$s per root). When the solver is used in\ncombination with RANSAC, we are able to quickly prune unpromising hypotheses,\nsignificantly improve the chance of finding inliers. Experiments on synthetic\ndata have validated the performance of the proposed algorithm. Tests on real\ndata further confirm the method's practical relevance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 06:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-13"}

Given a finite metric space $(X,d)$ and a collection of balls of radii\n$\\{r_1\\geq \\cdots \\ge r_k\\}$, the NUkC problem is to find a placement of their\ncenters on the metric space and find the minimum dilation $\\alpha$, such that\nthe union of balls of radius $\\alpha\\cdot r_i$ around the $i$th center covers\nall the points in $X$. This problem naturally arises as a min-max vehicle\nrouting problem with fleets of different speeds.\n  The NUkC problem generalizes the classic $k$-center problem when all the $k$\nradii are the same (which can be assumed to be $1$ after scaling). It also\ngeneralizes the $k$-center with outliers (kCwO) problem when there are $k$\nballs of radius $1$ and $\\ell$ balls of radius $0$.

Previous studies have analyzed\nwhether populations have the capacity to keep up with shifting temperature\nisoclines, and have mathematically determined the combination of growth and\ndispersal that is needed to achieve this. However, the rate of isocline\nmovement can be highly variable, with much uncertainty associated with yearly\nshifts. The same is true for population growth rates. Growth rates can be\nvariable and uncertain, even within suitable habitats for growth. In this paper\nwe reanalyze the question of population persistence in the context of the\nuncertainty and variability in isocline shifts and rates of growth.\nSpecifically, we employ a stochastic integrodifference equation model on a\npatch of suitable habitat that shifts poleward at a random rate. We derive a\nmetric describing the asymptotic growth rate of the linearized operator of the\nstochastic model and yielding a threshold criterion for population persistence.\nWe demonstrate that the variability in the yearly shift and in the growth rate\nhas a significant negative effect on the persistence in the sense that it\ndecreases the threshold criterion for population persistence. Mathematically,\nwe show how the persistence metric can be connected to the principal eigenvalue\nproblem for a related integral operator, at least for the case where isocline\nshifting speed is deterministic. Analysis of dynamics for the case where the\ndispersal kernel is Gaussian leads to the existence of a critical shifting\nspeed. Finally we illustrate our different results for butterfly population\nusing numerical simulations and demonstrate how increased variances in isocline\nshifts and growth rates translate into decreased likelihoods of persistence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 07:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-13"}

This is because\nprobability density functions do not exist for functional data. As a\nconsequence, the classical Bayes classifier using density quotients needs to be\nmodified. We propose to use density ratios of projections on a sequence of\neigenfunctions that are common to the groups to be classified. The density\nratios can then be factored into density ratios of individual functional\nprincipal components whence the classification problem is reduced to a sequence\nof nonparametric one-dimensional density estimates. This is an extension to\nfunctional data of some of the very earliest nonparametric Bayes classifiers\nthat were based on simple density ratios in the one-dimensional case. By means\nof the factorization of the density quotients the curse of dimensionality that\nwould otherwise severely affect Bayes classifiers for functional data can be\navoided. We demonstrate that in the case of Gaussian functional data, the\nproposed functional Bayes classifier reduces to a functional version of the\nclassical quadratic discriminant. A study of the asymptotic behavior of the\nproposed classifiers in the large sample limit shows that under certain\nconditions the misclassification rate converges to zero, a phenomenon that has\nbeen referred to as \"perfect classification\". The proposed classifiers also\nperform favorably in finite sample applications, as we demonstrate in\ncomparisons with other functional classifiers in simulations and various data\napplications, including wine spectral data, functional magnetic resonance\nimaging (fMRI) data for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\npatients, and yeast gene expression data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 07:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-13"}

To date, application to the cell of\ntypical size with molecular resolution is still far from realization. In this\narticle, we present a new parallel stochastic method for particle\nreaction-diffusion systems.

For two-level parallelization, we\nintroduced isolated subdomain and tri-stage lockstep communication for\nprocess-level, and voxel-locking techniques for thread-level. We performed a\nseries of parallel runs on RIKEN's K computer. For a fine lattice that had\nrelatively low occupancy, pSpatiocyte achieved 7686 times speedup with 663552\ncores relative to 64 cores from the viewpoint of strong scaling and exhibited\n74\\% parallel efficiency. As for weak scaling, efficiencies at least 60% were\nobserved up to 663552 cores.

The scientists who started their scientific publications after\n1980 were taken into consideration only. It is detected that the power\ncoefficient in the stretch exponent starts from one for low-cited authors and\nhas to trend to smaller values for scientists with large number of citation. At\nthe same time, the power coefficient in tail drops for large-cited authors. One\npossible explanation for the origin of the stretch-exponential distribution for\ncitation of individual author is done.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 09:37:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-13"}

Remarkably, the phenomenon involves a balance\nbetween sound attenuation and shear, such that viscosity vanishes in the final\nexpression of the velocity field. For this reason, the effect of viscosity has\nlong been ignored in acoustic streaming experiments. Here, we show\nexperimentally that the viscosity plays a major role in cavities such as the\nstreaming induced by surface acoustic waves in sessile droplets. We develop a\nnumerical model based on the spatial filtering of the streaming source term to\ncompute the induced flow motion with dramatically reduced computational\nrequirements. We evidence that acoustic fields in droplets are a superposition\nof a chaotic field and a few powerful caustics. It appears that the caustics\ndrive the flow, which allows a qualitative prediction of the flow structure.\nFinally, we reduce the problem to two dimensionless numbers related to the\nsurface and bulk waves attenuation and simulate hemispherical sessile droplets\nresting on a lithium niobate substrate for a range of parameters. Even in such\na baseline configuration, we observe at least four distinct flow regimes. For\neach of them, we establish a correlation of the average streaming speed in the\ndroplet, which is increasingly dependent on the bulk wave attenuation as the\nviscosity increases. These correlations extend our results to a wide range of\nfluids and actuation frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 11:27:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-13"}

Thus the majority voter plays a pivotal role in ensuring\nthe correct operation of the system. The fundamental assumption implicit in the\nTMR scheme is that the majority voter does not become faulty, which may not\nhold well for implementations based on latest technology nodes with dimensions\nof the order of just tens of nanometers.

Finally, for the 2 by 2 channel, the power\nallocation scheme of the constant envelope signaling is compared with that of\nthe conventional case, in which the constraint is on the average transmitted\npower. It is observed that when the condition number of the channel is close to\none, both schemes have a similar trend while this is not the case as the\ncondition number grows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 12:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-13"}

A\nbetter understanding of these challenges can help researchers and practitioners\nbetter address them. Existing research does not analyse UX challenges in\nrelation to other software quality characteristics including usability. In this\nempirical study, we have interviewed 17 practitioners from eight software\ndevelopment companies. Their responses are coded and analysed with thematic\nanalysis. We report 11 challenges that practitioners face in their work with\nUX. Some of these challenges partly overlap with those reported in existing\nliterature about usability or software quality characteristics. In contrast to\nthese overlaps, the participants of our study either view many of the\nchallenges unique to UX, or more severe than for usability or other quality\ncharacteristics. Although at a superficial level challenges with UX and other\nquality characteristics overlap, we differentiate these challenges at a deeper\nlevel through two main aspects of UX: subjectivity and emergent nature. In\nparticular, we identify at least five issues that are essential to the very\nnature of UX, and add at least seven extra difficulties to the work of\npractitioners. These difficulties can explain why practitioners perceive the\nchallenges to be more severe than for other quality characteristics. Our\nfindings can be useful for researchers in identifying industrially relevant\nresearch areas and for practitioners to learn from empirically investigated\nchallenges and base their improvement efforts on such knowledge. Investigating\nthe overlaps can help finding research areas not only for enhancing practice of\nUX but also software quality in general. It also makes it easier for\npractitioners to spot, better understand as well as find mitigation strategies\nfor UX challenges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 12:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-13"}

In recent years, many works have been mainly focused on detecting\npornographic images and videos based on visual content, particularly on the\ndetection of skin color. Although these approaches provide good results, they\ngenerally have the disadvantage of a high false positive rate since not all\nimages with large areas of skin exposure are necessarily pornographic images,\nsuch as people wearing swimsuits or images related to sports.

This results in a large prefactor,\nwhich is very sensitive to the global properties of the star, that multiplies\nthe torque. This large factor is compensated by a very small multiplicative\nfactor, $E_{2}$. Although this is mathematically accurate, depending on the\napplication this can lead to significant errors. The problem is even more\nsevere, since the calculation of $E_{2}$ itself is non-trivial, and different\nauthors have obtained inconsistent values of $E_{2}$. Moreover, many codes\n(e.g. BSE, StarTrack, MESA) interpolate (and sometimes extrapolate) a fit of\n$E_{2}$ values to the stellar mass, often in regimes where this is not sound\npractice.

Most of the existing approaches estimate the number of pedestrians\nwithin one frame, which results in inconsistent predictions in terms of time.\nThis paper, for the first time, introduces a quadratic programming model with\nthe network flow constraints to improve the accuracy of crowd counting.\nFirstly, the foreground of each frame is segmented into groups, each of which\ncontains several pedestrians. Then, a regression-based map is developed in\naccordance with the relationship between low-level features of each group and\nthe number of people in it. Secondly, a directed graph is constructed to\nsimulate constraints on people's flow, whose vertices represent groups of each\nframe and arcs represent people moving from one group to another. Then, the\npeople flow can be viewed as an integer flow in the constructed digraph.\nFinally, by solving a quadratic programming problem with network flow\nconstraints in the directed graph, we obtain consistency in people counting.\nThe experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the crowd\ncounting errors and improve the accuracy. Moreover, this method can also be\napplied to any ultramodern group-based regression counting approach to get\nimprovements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 14:12:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 14:22:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-18"}

The main problem seems to be\nhow to achieve small CP violation in the strong interactions despite large CP\nviolation in weak interactions. Observation of CP violation is exclusively\nthrough the Higgs--Yukawa interactions. In this paper, we show that with\nminimal assumptions on the structure of mass (Yukawa) matrices they do not\ncontribute to the strong CP problem and thus we can provide a pathway to a\nsolution of the strong CP problem within the structures of the Standard Model\nand no extension at the electroweak scale is needed. However, to address the\nflavor puzzle, models based on minimal SU(3) flavor groups leading to the\nproposed flavor matrices are favored. Though we refrain from an explicit a UV\ncompletion of the Standard Model, we provide a simple requirement those models\nshould have to intrinsically not show a strong CP problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 May 2016 15:42:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 08:37:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-17"}

We study the\nturbulent damping of precessional fluid motions, as a result of this\ninstability, in the simplest local computational model of a giant planet (or\nstar), with and without a weak internal magnetic field. Our aim is to determine\nthe outcome of this instability, and its importance in driving tidal evolution\nof the spin-orbit angle in precessing planets (and stars). We find that this\ninstability produces turbulent dissipation that is sufficiently strong that it\ncould drive significant tidal evolution of the spin-orbit angle for hot\nJupiters with orbital periods shorter than about 10-18 days. If this mechanism\nacts in isolation, this evolution would be towards alignment or anti-alignment,\ndepending on the initial angle, but the ultimate evolution (if other tidal\nmechanisms also contribute) is expected to be towards alignment. The turbulent\ndissipation is proportional to the cube of the precession frequency, so it\nleads to much slower damping of stellar spin-orbit angles, implying that this\ninstability is unlikely to drive evolution of the spin-orbit angle in stars\n(either in planetary or close binary systems).
