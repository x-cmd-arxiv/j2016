To understand the success and limitations\nof RNNs, it is critical that we advance our analysis of their fundamental\nmemory properties. We focus on echo state networks (ESNs), which are RNNs with\nsimple memoryless nodes and random connectivity. In most existing analyses, the\nshort-term memory (STM) capacity results conclude that the ESN network size\nmust scale linearly with the input size for unstructured inputs. The main\ncontribution of this paper is to provide general results characterizing the STM\ncapacity for linear ESNs with multidimensional input streams when the inputs\nhave common low-dimensional structure: sparsity in a basis or significant\nstatistical dependence between inputs. In both cases, we show that the number\nof nodes in the network must scale linearly with the information rate and\npoly-logarithmically with the ambient input dimension. The analysis relies on\nadvanced applications of random matrix theory and results in explicit\nnon-asymptotic bounds on the recovery error. Taken together, this analysis\nprovides a significant step forward in our understanding of the STM properties\nin RNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2016 16:02:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2016 13:14:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 15:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-30"}

The general structure for the AQD scheme has been\nobtained using a group theoretic structure of the operators introduced in\n(Shukla et al., Phys. Lett. A, 377 (2013) 518). The effect of different types\nof noises (e.g., amplitude damping and phase damping noise) on the proposed\nscheme is investigated, and it is shown that the proposed AQD is robust and\nuses optimized amount of quantum resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2016 16:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

This work,\ntherefore, stresses that instead of guaranteeing a certain (low) false negative\nrate for a small constant set of publicly known HTs, a rigorous HT detection\ntool should take into account these newly discovered HT design principles and\nhence guarantee the detection of an exponentially large class (exponential in\nnumber of wires in IP core) of HTs with negligible false negative rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2016 19:21:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 19:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-14"}

The emitted signals and their properties depend\nupon the internal properties of the neutron star. In neutron stars, the most\nimportant physical properties of the fluid core are the viscosity of the fluid,\nthe stratification of flow in the equilibrium state and the adiabatic sound\nspeed. Such models were previously studied by van Eysden and Melatos [73] and\nBennett et al. [26] following simple assumptions on all contributing factors,\nin which the post-glitch relaxation phase could be driven by the well-known\nprocess of Ekman pumping [76, 17]. We explore the hydrodynamic properties of\nthe flow of fluid during this phase following more relaxed assumptions on the\nstratification of flow and the pressure-density gradients within the neutron\nstar than previously studied. We calculate the time-scales of duration as well\nas the amplitudes of the resulting gravitational wave signals, and we detail\ntheir dependence on the physical properties of the fluid core.

The dark matter and MOND components have a common origin,\nrepresenting different phases of a single underlying substance. In galaxies,\ndark matter thermalizes and condenses to form a superfluid phase. The\nsuperfluid phonons couple to baryonic matter particles and mediate a MOND-like\nforce. This framework naturally distinguishes between galaxies (where MOND is\nsuccessful) and galaxy clusters (where MOND is not): dark matter has a higher\ntemperature in clusters, and hence is in a mixture of superfluid and normal\nphase. The rich and well-studied physics of superfluidity leads to a number of\nstriking observational signatures, which we briefly discuss. Remarkably the\ncritical temperature and equation of state of the dark matter superfluid are\nsimilar to those of known cold atom systems.

We\nfind two universal classes of behaviours: the mobility network is featured by a\nsmall-world property, $N(l_B) \\simeq e^{-l_B}$, whereas the attention network\nis characterised by a self-similar property $N(l_B) \\simeq l_B^{-\\gamma}$. In\nparticular, with the increasing of the length of box $l_B$, the degree\ncorrelation of the network changes from positive to negative which indicates\nthat there are two layers of structure in the mobility network. We use the\nresults of network renormalisation to detect the community and map the\nstructure of the mobility network. Further, we located the most relevant\nwebsites visited in these communities, and identified three typical\nlocation-based behaviours, including the shopping, dating, and taxi-calling.\nFinally, we offered a revised geometric network model to explain our findings\nin the perspective of spatial-constrained attachment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2016 02:22:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jul 2016 16:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-13"}

First,\nfor the TDMA MECO system with infinite or finite computation capacity, the\noptimal resource allocation is formulated as a convex optimization problem for\nminimizing the weighted sum mobile energy consumption under the constraint on\ncomputation latency. The optimal policy is proved to have a threshold-based\nstructure with respect to a derived offloading priority function, which yields\npriorities for users according to their channel gains and local computing\nenergy consumption. As a result, users with priorities above and below a given\nthreshold perform complete and minimum offloading, respectively. Moreover, for\nthe cloud with finite capacity, a sub-optimal resource-allocation algorithm is\nproposed to reduce the computation complexity for computing the threshold.\nNext, we consider the OFDMA MECO system, for which the optimal resource\nallocation is formulated as a non-convex mixed-integer problem. To solve this\nchallenging problem and characterize its policy structure, a sub-optimal\nlow-complexity algorithm is proposed by transforming the OFDMA problem to its\nTDMA counterpart.

However, the practical impact of\nOT is still limited because of its computational burden. We propose a new class\nof stochastic optimization algorithms to cope with large-scale problems\nroutinely encountered in machine learning applications. These methods are able\nto manipulate arbitrary distributions (either discrete or continuous) by simply\nrequiring to be able to draw samples from them, which is the typical setup in\nhigh-dimensional learning problems. This alleviates the need to discretize\nthese densities, while giving access to provably convergent methods that output\nthe correct distance without discretization error. These algorithms rely on two\nmain ideas: (a) the dual OT problem can be re-cast as the maximization of an\nexpectation ; (b) entropic regularization of the primal OT problem results in a\nsmooth dual optimization optimization which can be addressed with algorithms\nthat have a provably faster convergence. We instantiate these ideas in three\ndifferent setups: (i) when comparing a discrete distribution to another, we\nshow that incremental stochastic optimization schemes can beat Sinkhorn's\nalgorithm, the current state-of-the-art finite dimensional OT solver; (ii) when\ncomparing a discrete distribution to a continuous density, a semi-discrete\nreformulation of the dual program is amenable to averaged stochastic gradient\ndescent, leading to better performance than approximately solving the problem\nby discretization ; (iii) when dealing with two continuous densities, we\npropose a stochastic gradient descent over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space\n(RKHS).

To understand how this mechanism works, we\nneed to characterize the geometry and the physical state of the accreting\nmatter at cosmological redshifts. The few high quality X-ray spectra of distant\nQSO have been collected by adding sparse pointings of single objects obtained\nduring X-ray monitoring campaigns. This could have introduced spurious spectral\nfeatures due to source variability. Here we present a single epoch,\nhigh-quality X-ray spectrum of the z=3.62 quasar B1422+231 whose flux is\nenhanced by gravitationally lensing (F$_{2-10 keV}\\sim$10$^{-12}$erg s$^{-1}$\ncm$^{-2}$). The X-ray spectrum of B1422+231 is found to be very similar to the\none of a typical nearby Seyfert galaxy. Neutral absorption is detected\n(N$_{H}\\sim$5$\\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ at the redshift of the source) while a\nstrong absorption edge is measured at E$\\sim$7.5 keV with an optical depth of\n$\\tau\\sim$0.14.

These findings confirm that\ngravitational lensing is effective to obtain good quality X-ray spectral\ninformation of quasar at high-z, moreover they support the idea that the same\ngeneral picture characterizing active galactic nuclei in the nearby Universe is\nvalid also at high redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2016 09:07:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

Equity\nconcerns most often relate to fairly allocating workloads and to balancing the\nutilization of resources, and many practical applications have been reported in\nthe literature. However, there has been only limited discussion about how\nworkload equity should be modeled in VRPs, and various measures for optimizing\nsuch objectives have been proposed and implemented without a critical\nevaluation of their respective merits and consequences.\n  This article addresses this gap with an analysis of classical and alternative\nequity functions for biobjective VRP models. In our survey, we review and\ncategorize the existing literature on equitable VRPs. In the analysis, we\nidentify a set of axiomatic properties that an ideal equity measure should\nsatisfy, collect six common measures, and point out important connections\nbetween their properties and those of the resulting Pareto-optimal solutions.\nTo gauge the extent of these implications, we also conduct a numerical study on\nsmall biobjective VRP instances solvable to optimality. Our study reveals two\nundesirable consequences when optimizing equity with nonmonotonic functions:\nPareto-optimal solutions can consist of non-TSP-optimal tours, and even if all\ntours are TSP optimal, Pareto-optimal solutions can be workload inconsistent,\ni.e. composed of tours whose workloads are all equal to or longer than those of\nother Pareto-optimal solutions. We show that the extent of these phenomena\nshould not be underestimated. The results of our biobjective analysis are valid\nalso for weighted sum, constraint-based, or single-objective models. Based on\nthis analysis, we conclude that monotonic equity functions are more appropriate\nfor certain types of VRP models, and suggest promising avenues for further\nresearch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2016 10:07:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2018 17:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

The main conclusion is that the relative\nintensification of the continuum of the scattering states compared to the\nquasi-particle peak makes the matter more fluent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2016 13:01:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 13:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

The two approaches provide estimates for $\\alpha$ that are\nin agreement within statistical uncertainties and very stable against several\nconsistency tests. Considering the $T$--$B$ and $E$--$B$ information jointly,\nwe find $\\alpha = 0.31^{\\circ} \\pm 0.05^{\\circ} \\, ({\\rm stat.})\\, \\pm\n0.28^{\\circ} \\, ({\\rm syst.})$ from the harmonic analysis and $\\alpha =\n0.35^{\\circ} \\pm 0.05^{\\circ} \\, ({\\rm stat.})\\, \\pm 0.28^{\\circ} \\, ({\\rm\nsyst.})$ from the stacking approach. These constraints are compatible with no\nparity violation and are dominated by the systematic uncertainty in the\norientation of Planck's polarization-sensitive bolometers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2016 13:35:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Aug 2016 16:46:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

The dynamics of\nthis game is affected by a number of parameters and processes, namely the\ntopology of interactions among the agents, the synergy factor, and the strategy\nrevision phase. The latter is a process that allows agents to change their\nstrategy. Notably, rational agents tend to imitate richer neighbors, in order\nto increase the probability to maximize their payoff. By implementing a\nstochastic revision process, it is possible to control the level of noise in\nthe system, so that even irrational updates may occur. In particular, in this\nwork we study the effect of noise on the macroscopic behavior of a finite\nstructured population playing the Public Goods Game.

Among the current SPDs1,detectors based on\nsuperconducting nanowires have outstanding performance2, but are limited in\ntheir ability to be integrated into large scale arrays due to the engineering\ndifficulty of high-bandwidth cryogenic electronic readout3-8. Here, we address\nthis problem by demonstrating a scalable single-photon imager using a single\ncontinuous photon-sensitive superconducting nanowire microwave-plasmon\ntransmission line. By appropriately designing the nanowire's local\nelectromagnetic environment so that the nanowire guides microwave plasmons, the\npropagating voltages signals generated by a photon-detection event were slowed\ndown to ~ 2% of the speed of light. As a result, the time difference between\narrivals of the signals at the two ends of the nanowire naturally encoded the\nposition and time of absorption of the photon. Thus, with only two readout\nlines, we demonstrated that a 19.7-mm-long nanowire meandered across an area of\n286 {\\mu}m * 193 {\\mu}m was capable of resolving ~590 effective pixels while\nsimultaneously recording the arrival times of photons with a temporal\nresolution of 50 ps.

This code is built as a\nsuperstructure for the computer algebra package by Shevchenko and Sokolsky\n(1993a) for normalization of Hamiltonian systems of ordinary differential\nequations, in order that high complexity problems of normalization could be\nsolved. As an example, a resonant normal form of a Hamiltonian describing the\nhyperboloidal precession of a dynamically symmetric satellite is derived by\nmeans of the numeric deduction technique. The technique provides a considerable\neconomy, about 30 times in this particular application, in computer memory\nconsumption. It is naturally parallelizable. Thus the economy of memory\nconsumption is convertible into a gain in computation speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2016 12:52:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-08"}
