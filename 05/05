While it\nhas been suggested that the central engines of some GRBs are newly born\nmagnetars, we aim to relate the behaviors of magnetars to the optical\nre-brightenings. A newly born magnetar will lose its rotational energy in the\nform of Poynting-flux, which may be converted into a wind of electron-positron\npairs through some magnetic dissipation processes. As proposed by Dai (2004),\nthis wind will catch up with the GRB outflow and a long-lasting reverse shock\nwould form. By applying this scenario to GRB afterglows, we find that the\nreverse shock propagating back into the electron-positron wind can lead to an\nobservable optical re-brightening and a simultaneous X-ray plateau (or X-ray\nshallow decay). In our study, we select four GRBs, i.e., GRB 080413B, GRB\n090426, GRB 091029, and GRB 100814A, of which the optical afterglows are well\nobserved and show clear re-brightenings.

A critical step in replicating the self-interference is the estimation\nof the multi-path channel through which the transmitted signal propagates to\nthe antenna. Since there is no prior model on the number of multipath\nreflections, current techniques assume a tap delay line filter (in the RF and\ndigital domain) with a large number of taps, and estimate the taps in the\nanalog and the digital domain. Assuming such a model leads to a large\nform-factor for the analog and RF circuits and increased complexity in the\ndigital domain.\n  In this paper, using a linearization technique, we show that the\nself-interference channel in an indoor environment can be effectively modelled\nas $H(f)=C_0 + C_1f$ in the frequency domain. Thus, the effective\nself-interference channel can be represented by two parameters $C_0$ and $C_1$,\nirrespective of the multipath environment.

In this work, we\ntested both the VALC and the C7 semi-empirical models by computing their\nemission spectrum in the frequency range from 2 GHz to 10 THz, at solar limb\naltitudes.

Thus far, the process for designing retrofitted type\nsystems has been largely ad hoc, because evaluating multiple variations of a\ntype system on large bodies of existing code is a significant undertaking.\n  We present trace typing: a framework for automatically and quantitatively\nevaluating variations of a retrofitted type system on large code bases. The\ntrace typing approach involves gathering traces of program executions,\ninferring types for instances of variables and expressions occurring in a\ntrace, and merging types according to merge strategies that reflect specific\n(combinations of) choices in the source-level type system design space.\n  We evaluated trace typing through several experiments. We compared several\nvariations of type systems retrofitted onto JavaScript, measuring the number of\nprogram locations with type errors in each case on a suite of over fifty\nthousand lines of JavaScript code. We also used trace typing to validate and\nguide the design of a new retrofitted type system that enforces fixed object\nlayout for JavaScript objects. Finally, we leveraged the types computed by\ntrace typing to automatically identify tag tests --- dynamic checks that refine\na type --- and examined the variety of tests identified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2016 17:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-05"}

The simulation covers the full solid angle to allow the\nemergence of large-scale convective modes.

The damper is assumed to consist of a shaft, with or\nwithout a spherical bulge, oscillating axially in a containing cylinder filled\nwith a viscoplastic material of Bingham type. The response of the damper to a\nforced sinusoidal displacement is studied. In the bulgeless case the\nconfiguration is the annular analogue of the well-known lid-driven cavity\nproblem, but with a sinusoidal rather than constant lid velocity. Navier slip\nis applied to the shaft surface in order to bound the reaction force to finite\nvalues. Starting from a base case, several problem parameters are varied in\nturn in order to study the effects of viscoplasticity, slip, damper geometry\nand oscillation frequency to the damper response. The results show that,\ncompared to Newtonian flow, viscoplasticity causes the damper force to be less\nsensitive to the shaft velocity; this is often a desirable damper property. The\nbulge increases the required force on the damper mainly by generating a\npressure difference across itself; the latter is larger the smaller the gap\nbetween the bulge and the casing is. At high yield stresses or slip\ncoefficients the amount of energy dissipation that occurs due to sliding\nfriction at the shaft-fluid interface is seen to increase significantly. At low\nfrequencies the flow is in quasi steady state, dominated by viscoplastic\nforces, while at higher frequencies the fluid kinetic energy storage and\nrelease also come into the energy balance, introducing hysteresis effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2016 19:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-05"}

Global multi-fluid simulations using a\nfull treatment of the pressure tensor are used to evaluate the influence of\ntemperature anisotropies on the magnetospheric dynamics for an idealized\nsubstorm. The simulations are able to resolve the development of conics over\nthe polar cap which eventually turn into beams in the lobes. Entry of this\nplasma, particularly heavy ions with high Tparallel, leads to a faster\nreconnection rate, additional turbulence within the reconnection region, and\nthe substorm onset time occurs approximately 5 min earlier relative to\nisotropic simulations. The anisotropic treatment yields much more intense\nauroral currents on the nightside associated with onset and a faster expansion\nphase of the substorm. The plasma entering into the current sheet experiences\nstronger heating in the anisotropic simulations, which increases plasma\ntransport into the equatorial dayside. Hence, the convection of the\nplasmasphere towards the dayside magnetosphere during the growth phase is\naccompanied by a relative increase in Tparallel.

In 2012 the Organisation for\nEconomic Co-operation and Development completed a benchmark study that is\nperhaps the most complete published comparison performed. Despite this, various\nresults from the simulators were often significantly different because of\ninconsistencies in modeling decisions involving reprocessing strategies,\nrefueling behavior, reactor end-of-life handling, etc. This work identifies and\nquantifies the effects of selected modeling choices that may sometimes be taken\nfor granted in the fuel cycle simulation domain. Four scenarios are compared\nusing combinations of fleet-based or individually modeled reactors with monthly\nor quarterly (3-month) time steps. The scenarios approximate a transition from\nthe current U.S. once-through light water reactor fleet to a full sodium fast\nreactor fuel cycle. The Cyclus fuel cycle simulator's plug-in capability along\nwith its market-like dynamic material routing allow it to be used as a level\nplaying field for comparing the scenarios. When under supply-constraint\npressure, the four cases exhibit noticeably different behavior. Fleet-based\nmodeling is more efficient in supply-constrained environments at the expense of\nlosing insight on issues such as realistically suboptimal fuel distribution and\nchallenges in reactor refueling cycle staggering. Finer-grained time steps\nenable more efficient material use in supply-constrained environments resulting\nin lower standing inventories of separated Pu. Large simulations with\nfleet-based reactors run much more quickly than their individual reactor\ncounterparts. Gaining a better understanding of how these and other modeling\nchoices affect fuel cycle dynamics will enable making more deliberate decisions\nwith respect to trade-offs such as computational investment vs. realism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2016 19:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-05"}

We analyze such quantum\ncomputing by allowing coupling to external modes, under the condition that the\nexternal influence must be soft-enough in order not to offset the basic\nproperties of the system. We derive model-independent bounds on some crucial\ntime-scales, such as the times of gate operation, decoherence, maximal\nentanglement and total scrambling.

Spin-SILC is an internal linear combination method that uses\nspin wavelets to analyse the spin-2 polarisation signal $P = Q + iU$. The\nwavelets are additionally directional (non-axisymmetric). This allows different\nmorphologies of signals to be separated and therefore the cleaning algorithm is\nlocalised using an additional domain of information. The advantage of spin\nwavelets over standard scalar wavelets is to simultaneously and\nself-consistently probe scales and directions in the polarisation signal $P = Q\n+ iU$ and in the underlying $E$ and $B$ modes, therefore providing the ability\nto perform component separation and $E$-$B$ decomposition concurrently for the\nfirst time. We test Spin-SILC on full-mission Planck simulations and data and\nshow the capacity to correctly recover the underlying cosmological $E$ and $B$\nmodes. We also demonstrate a strong consistency of our CMB maps with those\nderived from existing component separation methods. Spin-SILC can be combined\nwith the pseudo- and pure $E$-$B$ spin wavelet estimators presented in a\ncompanion paper to reliably extract the cosmological signal in the presence of\ncomplicated sky cuts and noise. Therefore, it will provide a\ncomputationally-efficient method to accurately extract the CMB $E$ and $B$\nmodes for future polarisation experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2016 20:06:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Aug 2016 15:03:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-24"}

Data, generated from millions of\nInternet-connected sensors, will drive new IoT applications and services. A key\nrequirement is the ability to aggregate, preprocess, index, store and analyze\ndata with minimal latency so that time-to-insight can be reduced. In the\nfuture, we expect real-time data collection and analysis to be performed both\non small devices (e.g., in hubs and appliances) as well in server-based\ninfrastructure. The ability to localize sensitive data to the home, and thus\npreserve privacy, is a key driver for small-device deployment.\n  In this paper, we present an efficient architecture for time-series data\nmanagement that provides a high data ingestion rate, while still being\nsufficiently lightweight that it can be deployed in embedded environments or\nsmall virtual machines. Our solution strives to minimize overhead and explores\nwhat can be done without complex indexing schemes that typically, for\nperformance reasons, must be held in main memory. We combine a simple in-memory\nhierarchical index, log-structured store and in-flight sort, with a\nhigh-performance data pipeline architecture that is optimized for multicore\nplatforms. We show that our solution is able to handle streaming insertions at\nover 4 million records per second (on a single x86 server) while still\nretaining SQL query performance better than or comparable to existing RDBMS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2016 21:00:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 16:15:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-10"}

Therefore, if we examine the braingraphs of $n$ subjects,\nthen we have $n$ graphs on the very same, anatomically identified vertex set.\nIt is a natural idea to describe the $k$-frequently appearing edges in these\ngraphs: the edges that are present between the same two vertices in at least\n$k$ out of the $n$ graphs.

In view of this, we derive a pricing\nscheme whose Nash equilibria coincide with the network's socially optimum\nstates, and we propose a distributed learning method based on the Boltzmann\ndistribution of statistical mechanics.

As of the past asymptotes, for a smooth transition only\nKasner regime in Gauss-Bonnet is an option.

Magnetar giant\nflares, driven by the reconfiguration of the magnetosphere, however, can\nproduce both contemporaneous bursts at other wavelengths as well as\nafterglow-like emission. We conclude that the best chances are: (i) prompt\nshort GRB-like emission; (ii) a contemporaneous optical flash that can reach\nnaked eye peak luminosity (but only for a few milliseconds); (iii) a high\nenergy afterglow emission.

Moreover, $\\mathcal{G}$ can be\nenhanced to support efficient update operations: After processing $\\mathcal{G}$\nin $O(w f_{\\mathcal{A}})$ time, we can insert/delete any (sub)string of length\n$y$ into/from an arbitrary position of $T$ in $O((y+ \\log N\\log^* M)\nf_{\\mathcal{A}})$ time, where $f_{\\mathcal{A}} = O(\\min \\{ \\frac{\\log\\log M\n\\log\\log w}{\\log\\log\\log M}, \\sqrt{\\frac{\\log w}{\\log\\log w}} \\})$. This yields\nthe first fully dynamic LCE data structure.

On top\nof the above contributions, we show several applications of our data structures\nwhich improve previous best known results on grammar-compressed string\nprocessing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 04:29:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2016 12:46:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-28"}

An\nimportant problem in dynamic network research is community detection, which\nidentifies groups of topologically related nodes. Typically, this problem is\napproached by assuming either that each time point has a distinct community\norganization or that all time points share one community organization. In\nreality, the truth likely lies between these two extremes, since some time\nperiods can have community organization that evolves while others can have\ncommunity organization that stays the same. To find the compromise, we consider\ncommunity detection in the context of the problem of segment detection, which\nidentifies contiguous time periods with consistent network structure.\nConsequently, we formulate a combined problem of segment community detection\n(SCD), which simultaneously partitions the network into contiguous time\nsegments with consistent community organization and finds this community\norganization for each segment. To solve SCD, we introduce SCOUT, an\noptimization framework that explicitly considers both segmentation quality and\npartition quality. SCOUT addresses limitations of existing methods that can be\nadapted to solve SCD, which typically consider only one of segmentation quality\nor partition quality. In a thorough evaluation, SCOUT outperforms the existing\nmethods in terms of both accuracy and computational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 05:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-06"}

The solver is\ncustomized to effectively eliminate the numerical Cerenkov instability (NCI)\nwhich arises when a plasma (neutral or non-neutral) relativistically drifts on\na grid when using the PIC algorithm. We control the EM dispersion curve in the\ndirection of the plasma drift of a FDTD Maxwell solver by using a customized\nhigher order finite difference operator for the spatial derivative along the\ndirection of the drift ($\\hat 1$ direction). We show that this eliminates the\nmain NCI modes with moderate $\\vert k_1 \\vert$, while keeps additional main NCI\nmodes well outside the range of physical interest with higher $\\vert k_1\n\\vert$. These main NCI modes can be easily filtered out along with first\nspatial aliasing NCI modes which are also at the edge of the fundamental\nBrillouin zone. The customized solver has the possible advantage of improved\nparallel scalability because it can be easily partitioned along $\\hat 1$ which\ntypically has many more cells than other directions for the problems of\ninterest. We show that FFTs can be performed locally to current on each\npartition to filter out the main and first spatial aliasing NCI modes, and to\ncorrect the current so that it satisfies the continuity equation for the\ncustomized spatial derivative. This ensures that Gauss' Law is satisfied.

In\nMapReduce, the reducer produces an output from a list of inputs. Due to the\nscheduling policy of the platform, the inputs may arrive at the reducers in\ndifferent order. The commutativity problem of reducers asks if the output of a\nreducer is independent of the order of its inputs. Although the problem is\nundecidable in general, the MapReduce programs in practice are usually used for\ndata analytics and thus require very simple control flow. By exploiting the\nsimplicity, we propose a programming language for reducers where the\ncommutativity problem is decidable. The main idea of the reducer language is to\nseparate the control and data flow of programs and disallow arithmetic\noperations in the control flow. The decision procedure for the commutativity\nproblem is obtained through a reduction to the equivalence problem of streaming\nnumerical transducers (SNTs), a novel automata model over infinite alphabets\nintroduced in this paper. The design of SNTs is inspired by streaming\ntransducers (Alur and Cerny, POPL 2011). Nevertheless, the two models are\nintrinsically different since the outputs of SNTs are integers while those of\nstreaming transducers are data words. The decidability of the equivalence of\nSNTs is achieved with an involved combinatorial analysis of the evolvement of\nthe values of the integer variables during the runs of SNTs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 05:53:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2016 07:07:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 05:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-03"}

To this end, the diffusion coefficients are\nfirst obtained for a granular binary mixture in spatially inhomogeneous states\nclose to the simple shear flow. In this situation, the set of coupled Boltzmann\nequations are solved by means of a Chapman-Enskog-like expansion around the\n(local) shear flow distributions for each species, thereby retaining all the\nhydrodynamic orders in the shear rate $a$. Due to the anisotropy induced by the\nshear flow, three tensorial quantities $D_{ij}$, $D_{p,ij}$, and $D_{T,ij}$ are\nrequired to describe the mass transport process instead of the conventional\nscalar coefficients.

We investigate both effects by\nmolecular-dynamics simulations on melts of fully-flexible linear chains ranging\nfrom dimers ($M=2$) up to entangled polymers ($M=200$). The corresponding\natomic liquid is also considered as reference system. To disentangle the\ninfluence of the local geometry and the bond arrangements, and reveal their\ninterplay, we define suitable measures of the anisotropy emphasising either the\nformer or the latter aspect. Connectivity anisotropy, as measured by the\ncorrelation between the initial bond orientation and the direction of the\nsubsequent monomer displacement, shows a slight enhancement due to the local\norder at times shorter than the structural relaxation time. At intermediate\ntimes - when the monomer displacement is comparable to the bond length - a\npronounced peak and then decays slowly as $t^{-1/2}$, becoming negligible when\nthe displacements is as large as about five bond lengths, i.e. about four\nmonomer diameters or three Kuhn lengths. Local-geometry anisotropy, as measured\nby the correlation between the initial orientation of a characteristic axis of\nthe Voronoi cell and the subsequent monomer dynamics, is affected at shorter\ntimes than the structural relaxation time by the cage shape with antagonistic\ndisturbance by the connectivity. Differently, at longer times, the connectivity\nfavours the persistence of the local-geometry anisotropy which vanishes when\nthe monomer displacement exceeds the bond length. Our results strongly suggest\nthat the sole consideration of the local order is not enough to understand the\nmicroscopic origin of the rattling amplitude of the trapped monomer in the cage\nof the neighbours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 12:35:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-06"}

We use the texture\ndescriptor as a clue in searching for matching patches from the known region.\nTo ensure the structure faithful to the original image, a geometric constraint\nmetric is formally defined that is applied directly to the patch synthesis\nprocedure. We extensively conducted our experiments on a wide range of testing\nimages on various scenarios and contents by arbitrarily specifying the target\nthe regions for inference followed by using existing evaluation metrics to\nverify its texture coherency and structural consistency.

The Ising model is used to show the convergence\nproperties in the calculation of the DOS, as well as the critical temperature,\nwhile the calculation of the number $\\pi$ by multiple dimensional integration\nis used in the continuum approximation. In each case, the error is obtained\nseparately for each walker at a fixed time, $t$; then, the average over $m$\nwalkers is performed. It is observed that the error goes as $1/\\sqrt{m}$.\nHowever, if the number of walkers increases above a certain critical value\n$m>m_x$, the error reaches a constant value (i.e. it saturates). This occurs\nfor both algorithms; however, it is shown that for a given system, the $1/t$\nalgorithm is more efficient and accurate than the similar version of the WL\nalgorithm. It follows that it makes no sense to increase the number of walkers\nabove a critical value $m_x$, since it does not reduces the error in the\ncalculation.

Bisumth based chalcogenides are exemplary strong three dimensional\ntopological insulators that host an odd number of massless Dirac fermionic\nstates on all surfaces. A departure from this notion is the idea of a weak\ntopological insulator, wherein only certain surface terminations host surface\nstates characterized by an even number of Dirac cones leading to exciting new\nphysics. Experimentally however, weak topological insulators have proven to be\nelusive. Here, we report a discovery of a weak topological insulator (WTI),\nBiSe, of the Bi-chalcogenide family with an indirect band gap of 42 meV. Its\nstructural unit consists of bismuth bilayer (Bi$_2$), a known quantum spin hall\ninsulator sandwiched between two units of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ which are three\ndimensional strong topological insulators. Angle resolved photo-emission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) measurements on cleaved single crystal flakes along with\ndensity fucntional theory (DFT) calculations confirm the existence of weak\ntopological insulating state of BiSe. Additionally, we have carried out\nmagneto-transport measurements on single crystal flakes as well as thin films\nof BiSe, which exhibit clear signatures of weak anti-localization at low\ntemperatures, consistent with the properties of topological insulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 14:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-06"}

In this paper, a\ntwo-layer coalitional game is developed for distributed sensing and access in\nmultichannel CR ad hoc networks where the SUs' transmission opportunities are\ncommensurate with their sensing contributions, thus fostering cooperation and\neliminating free-riders. Numerical results show that the proposed two-layer\ngame is computationally efficient and outperforms previously investigated\ncollaborative sensing and spectrum access approaches for heterogeneous\nmultichannel CR networks in terms of energy efficiency, throughput, SU\nfairness, and complexity.

This represents an unexplained anomaly in\nconventional physics and calls for a reworking of the concepts of time and\nspace. Here I explain how the anomaly can be resolved by allowing dynamics to\nemerge phenomenologically. The resolution offers a picture of time and space\nthat lies below our everyday experience, and one in which their differences are\nepiphenomenal rather than elemental.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 09:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-14"}

In the\nNLF model the consumer price index (CPI) exhibits a finite time singularity of\nthe type $1/(t_c -t)^{(1- \\beta)/\\beta}$, with $\\beta>0$, predicting a blow up\nof the economy at a critical time $t_c$. However, this model fails in\ndetermining $t_c$ in the case of weak hyperinflation regimes like, e.g., that\noccurred in Israel. To overcome this trouble, the NLF model is extended by\nintroducing a parameter $\\gamma$, which multiplies all therms with past growth\nrate index (GRI). In this novel approach the solution for CPI is also analytic\nbeing proportional to the Gaussian hypergeometric function\n$_2F_1(1/\\beta,1/\\beta,1+1/\\beta;z)$, where $z$ is a function of $\\beta$,\n$\\gamma$, and $t_c$.
