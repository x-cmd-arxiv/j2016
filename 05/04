The consequences of these features can be larger\nthe larger the system size leading to a localization of the fluctuation modes\nand a relaxation time that remains finite in the thermodynamic limit.

This feature is coined as \"quantum supremacy\"\nand one aspect or another of such quantum computational supremacy might be\nbrought about in experiments in the near future: by implementing quantum\nerror-correction, systems of non-interacting bosons, exotic new phases of\nmatter called anyons, quantum annealing, or in various other ways.\n  A main concern regarding the feasibility of quantum computers is that quantum\nsystems are inherently noisy: we cannot accurately control them, and we cannot\naccurately describe them. We will describe an optimistic hypothesis of quantum\nnoise that would allow quantum computing and a pessimistic hypothesis that\nwouldn't. The quantum computer puzzle is deciding between these two hypotheses.\n  Here is a brief summary of the author's pessimistic point of view as\nexplained in the paper: understanding quantum computers in the presence of\nnoise requires consideration of behavior at different scales. In the small\nscale, standard models of noise from the mid-90s are suitable, and quantum\nevolutions and states described by them manifest a very low-level computational\npower. This small-scale behavior has far-reaching consequences for the behavior\nof noisy quantum systems at larger scales. On the one hand, it does not allow\nreaching the starting points for quantum fault tolerance and quantum supremacy,\nmaking them both impossible at all scales. On the other hand, it leads to novel\nimplicit ways for modeling noise at larger scales and to various predictions on\nthe behavior of noisy quantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2016 17:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

To extract the WL signal from\nastronomical observations, galaxy shapes must be measured and corrected for the\npoint spread function (PSF) of the imaging system with extreme accuracy. Future\nWL missions (such as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, WFIRST) will use\na family of hybrid nearinfrared CMOS detectors (HAWAII-4RG) that are untested\nfor accurate WL measurements. Like all image sensors, these devices are subject\nto conversion gain nonlinearities (voltage response to collected photo-charge)\nthat bias the shape and size of bright objects such as reference stars that are\nused in PSF determination. We study this type of detector nonlinearity (NL) and\nshow how to derive requirements on it from WFIRST PSF size and ellipticity\nrequirements. We simulate the PSF optical profiles expected for WFIRST and\nmeasure the fractional error in the PSF size and the absolute error in the PSF\nellipticity as a function of star magnitude and the NL model. For our nominal\nNL model (a quadratic correction), we find that, uncalibrated, NL can induce an\nerror of 0.01 (fractional size) and 0.00175 (absolute ellipticity error) in the\nH158 bandpass for the brightest unsaturated stars in WFIRST. In addition, our\nsimulations show that to limit the bias of the size and ellipticity errors in\nthe H158 band to approximately 10% of the estimated WFIRST error budget, the\nparameter of our quadratic NL model must be calibrated to about 1% and 2.4%,\nrespectively.

First, we consider the problem of testing the hypothesis that the\nsupport of the data-generating probability distribution is a well-behaved\nmanifold of intrinsic dimension $d_1$ versus the alternative that it is of\ndimension $d_2$, with $d_{1}<d_{2}$.

In the\nCP-conserving limit of the theory, such a diphoton resonance may be identified\nwith the heavier CP-even $H$ boson, whose gluon-fusion production and decay\ninto two photons are enhanced by loops of the lightest supersymmetric partner\nof the top quark $\\tilde{t}_1$ when its mass $m_{\\tilde{t}_1}$ happens to be\nnear the $\\tilde{t}^*_1\\tilde{t}_1$ threshold, i.e.~for\n$m_{\\tilde{t}_1}\\!\\simeq \\!\\frac12 M_H$. The scenario requires a relatively low\nsupersymmetry-breaking scale $M_S\\stackrel{<}{{}_\\sim} 1$ TeV, but large values\nof the higgsino mass parameter, $\\mu \\stackrel{>}{{}_\\sim} 1$ TeV, that lead to\na strong $H \\tilde{t}^*_1 \\tilde{t}_1$ coupling. Such parameters can\naccommodate the observed mass and standard-like couplings of the 125 GeV $h$\nboson in the MSSM, while satisfying all other constraints from the LHC and dark\nmatter searches. Additional enhancement to the diphoton rate could be provided\nby Coulombic QCD corrections and, to a lesser extent, by resonant contributions\ndue to $\\tilde{t}_1^* \\tilde{t}_1$ bound states.

The central idea of these tests is to determine the\naverage ellipticity of all galaxies with shape measurements in a grid in the\npixel plane. The distribution of the absolute values of these averaged\nellipticities can be compared to randomized catalogues; a difference points to\nsystematics in the data. In addition, we introduce a method to quantify the\nspatial correlation of the additive bias, which suppresses the contribution\nfrom cosmic shear and therefore eases the identification of a\nposition-dependent additive shear bias in the data. We apply these tests to the\npublicly available shear catalogues from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope\nLensing Survey (CFHTLenS) and the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) and find evidence\nfor a small but non-negligible residual additive bias at small scales. As this\nresidual bias is smaller than the error on the shear correlation signal at\nthose scales, it is highly unlikely that it causes a significant bias in the\npublished cosmic shear results of CFHTLenS. In CFHTLenS, the amplitude of this\nsystematic signal is consistent with zero in fields where the number of stars\nused to model the PSF is higher than average, suggesting that the\nposition-dependent additive shear bias originates from undersampled PSF\nvariations across the image.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2016 20:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 15:19:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-24"}

Understanding these observations will require\nwell-developed theory in addition to numerical simulations. Here we present\ntheoretical models for the temperature structure and atmospheric circulation of\ndry, tidally locked rocky exoplanets with grey radiative transfer and test them\nusing a general circulation model (GCM). First, we develop a\nradiative-convective model that captures surface temperatures of slowly\nrotating and cool atmospheres. Second, we show that the atmospheric circulation\nacts as a global heat engine, which places strong constraints on large-scale\nwind speeds. Third, we develop a radiative-convective-subsiding model which\nextends our radiative-convective model to hot and thin atmospheres. We find\nthat rocky planets develop large day-night temperature gradients at a ratio of\nwave-to-radiative timescales up to two orders of magnitude smaller than the\nvalue suggested by work on hot Jupiters. The small ratio is due to the heat\nengine inefficiency and asymmetry between updrafts and subsidence in convecting\natmospheres. Fourth, we show using GCM simulations that rotation only has a\nstrong effect on temperature structure if the atmosphere is hot or thin. Our\nmodels let us map out atmospheric scenarios for planets such as GJ 1132b and\nshow how thermal phase curves could constrain them.

Existing approaches of coercion\nresistant authentication systems (CRAS) propose authentication factors such as\nimplicit learning tasks, which are non-transferable, but still have the\ndrawback that an attacker can force the victim (causing stress) to perform the\ntask in order to gain unauthorized access. Alternatively, there could be cases\nwhere the user could claim that they were coerced into giving up the\nauthentication materials, whereas in reality they acted as an insider attacker.\nTherefore, being able to detect stress during authentication also helps to\nachieve non-repudiation in such cases. To address these concerns, we need CRAS\nthat have both the non-transferable property as well as a mechanism to detect\nstress related to coercion. In this paper, we study the feasibility of using\nChill (intensely pleasurable) music as a stimulus to elicit unique\nneuro-physiological responses that can be used as an authenticating factor for\nCRAS. Chill music and stress are both stimuli for a neuro-chemical called\nDopamine. However, they release the Dopamine at different parts of the brain,\nresulting in different neuro-physiological responses, which gives us both the\nnon-transferable and stress-detection properties necessary for CRAS. We have\nexperimentally validated our proposed Chill music based CRAS using human\nsubjects and measuring their neuro-physiological responses on our prototype\nsystem. Based on the 100 samples collected from the subjects, we were able to\nsuccessfully authenticate the subjects with an accuracy of over 90\\%.

However, such a calculation is approximate in nature, since it has\nbeen performed by assuming a high capillary number regime. In this work, we go\none step further, and utilize a Hamiltonian formulation to obtain an analytical\nexact solution for Q(t), now valid for arbitrary values of the capillary\nnumber. Moreover, this Hamiltonian scheme is applied to calculate the\ncorresponding injection rate that minimizes fingering formation in a uniform\nthree-dimensional porous media. An analysis of the improvement offered by these\nexact injection rate expressions in comparison with previous approximate\nresults is also provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2016 20:21:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

Our\nimplementation requires no such workspace and can be plug-compatible with the\nstandard DGEMM interface. Conventional wisdom: it is hard to demonstrate\nspeedup on multi-core architectures.

In the real world, bacteria are more likely to live\nin physically structured habitats as colonies, within which individual cells\nvary in their access to nutrients. The dynamics of bacterial growth in such\nconditions is poorly understood, and, unlike that for liquid culture, there is\nnot a standard broadly used mathematical model for bacterial populations\ngrowing in colonies in three dimensions (3-d). By extending the classic Monod\nmodel of resource-limited population growth to allow for spatial heterogeneity\nin the bacterial access to nutrients, we develop a 3-d model of colonies, in\nwhich bacteria consume diffusing nutrients in their vicinity. By following the\nchanges in density of E.coli in liquid and embedded in glucose-limited soft\nagar, we evaluate the fit of this model to experimental data. The model\naccounts for the experimentally observed presence of a sub-exponential,\ndiffusion-limited growth regime in colonies, which is absent in liquid\ncultures.

Under this\nsetting, we are interested in devising linear encoding and decoding schemes\nthat minimize the communication cost involved. We show that the optimal\nsolution to this problem is closely related to the notion of maximally\nrecoverable codes (MRCs), which were originally introduced in the context of\ncoding for storage systems. In the context of storage, MRCs guarantee optimal\nerasure protection when the system is partially constrained to have local\nparity relations among the storage nodes. In our problem, we show that optimal\nsolutions exist if and only if MRCs of certain kind (identified by the desired\nlinear functions) exist. We consider point-to-point and broadcast versions of\nthe problem, and identify connections to MRCs under both these settings. For\nthe point-to-point setting, we show that our linear-encoder based achievable\nscheme is optimal even when non-linear encoding is permitted.

The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images provided by the Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly (AIA) on board \\textit{Solar Dynamics Observatory} disclose that the\nCME first appears as a bubble-like structure. Subsequently, its expansion forms\nthe CME and causes a quasi-circular EUV wave. Interestingly, both the CME and\nthe wave front are clearly visible at all of the AIA EUV passbands. Through a\ndetailed kinematical analysis, it is found that the expansion of the CME\nundergoes two phases: a first phase with a strong but transient lateral\nover-expansion followed by a second phase with a self-similar expansion. The\ntemporal evolution of the expansion velocity coincides very well with the\nvariation of the 25--50 keV hard X-ray flux of the associated flare, which\nindicates that magnetic reconnection most likely plays an important role in\ndriving the expansion. Moreover, we find that, when the velocity of the CME\nreaches $\\sim$600 km s$^{-1}$, the EUV wave starts to evolve into a shock wave,\nwhich is evidenced by the appearance of a type II radio burst. The shock's\nformation height is estimated to be $\\sim$0.2$R_{sun}$, which is much lower\nthan the height derived previously. Finally, we also study the thermal\nproperties of the CME and the EUV wave.

An analysis of\nHI at the tangent points, where the distance to the gas can be estimated with\nreasonable accuracy, shows a sharp transition at Galactic radii $R\\lesssim 2.4$\nkpc from the extended neutral gas layer characteristic of much of the Galactic\ndisk, to a thin Gaussian layer with FWHM $\\sim 125$ pc. An anti-correlation\nbetween HI and $\\gamma$-ray emission at latitudes $10^{\\circ} \\leq |b| \\leq\n20^{\\circ}$ suggests that the boundary of the extended HI layer marks the walls\nof the Fermi Bubbles. With HI we are able to trace the edges of the voids from\n$|z| > 2$ kpc down to $z\\approx0$, where they have a radius $\\sim 2$ kpc. The\nextended HI layer likely results from star formation in the disk, which is\nlimited largely to $R \\gtrsim 3$ kpc, so the wind may be expanding into an area\nof relatively little HI. Because the HI kinematics can discriminate between gas\nin the Galactic center and foreground material, 21cm HI emission may be the\nbest probe of the extent of the nuclear wind near the Galactic plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2016 04:31:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

Employing the renormalization group equations at\nthe two-loop level and the central values for the world average masses of the\ntop quark ($m_t=173.34$ GeV) and the Higgs boson ($m_h=125.09$ GeV), we perform\nparameter scans to identify the parameter region for resolving the electroweak\nvacuum instability problem. Next we interpret the recent ATLAS and CMS search\nlimits at the LHC Run-2 for the sequential $Z$' boson to constrain the\nparameter region in our model. Combining the constraints from the electroweak\nvacuum stability and the LHC Run-2 results, we find a bound on the $Z$' boson\nmass as $m_{Z'} \\gtrsim 3.5$ TeV. We also calculate self-energy corrections to\nthe SM Higgs doublet field through the heavy states, the right-handed neutrinos\nand the $Z$' boson, and find the naturalness bound as $m_{Z'} \\lesssim 7$ TeV,\nin order to reproduce the right electroweak scale for the fine-tuning level\nbetter than 10\\%. The resultant mass range of $3.5$ TeV $\\lesssim m_{Z'}\n\\lesssim 7$ TeV will be explored at the LHC Run-2 in the near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2016 06:41:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 11:56:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Jul 2016 06:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

We present the X-Random and X-Fixed bootstrap bandits which correspond\nto the two well-known approaches for conducting bootstraps on models, in the\nliterature. The proposed methods are compared to other popular solutions for\nlinear stochastic bandit problems, namely, OFUL, LinUCB and Thompson Sampling.\nThe comparisons are carried out using a simulation study on a hierarchical\nprobability meta-model, built from published data of experiments, which are run\non real systems.

One of the proposed methods, X-Random bootstrap, performs better\nthan the baselines in-terms of cumulative regret across various degrees of\nnoise and different number of trials. In certain settings the cumulative regret\nof this method is less than half of the best baseline. The X-Fixed bootstrap\nperforms comparably in most situations and particularly well when the number of\ntrials is low.

The method is generic,\nlanguage independent and can be used for generation of labeled documents\ndatasets (both scanned and cameracaptured) in any cursive and non-cursive\nlanguage, e.g., English, Russian, Arabic, Urdu, etc. To assess the\neffectiveness of the presented method, two different datasets in English and\nRussian are generated using the presented method.

A decoupled time-stepping scheme is\nintroduced, which guarantees that the discrete solution has bounded discrete\nenergy, and the finite element spaces are chosen to be compatible with the\nnonlinear structure of the equations. Based on the boundedness of the discrete\nenergy, we prove the convergence of the finite element solutions by utilizing a\nuniform $L^{3+\\delta}$ regularity of the discrete harmonic vector fields,\nestablishing a discrete Sobolev embedding inequality for the N\\'ed\\'elec finite\nelement space, and introducing a $\\ell^2(W^{1,3+\\delta})$ estimate for fully\ndiscrete solutions of parabolic equations.

It provides sequentially calculated estimates of\nthe system states along with a corresponding covariance matrix. For nonlinear\nsystems, the extended Kalman filter is often used which is derived from the\nKalman filter by linearization around the current estimate. A key issue in\nmetrology is the evaluation of the uncertainty associated with the Kalman\nfilter state estimates. The \"Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in\nMeasurements\" (GUM) and its supplements serve as the de facto standard for\nuncertainty evaluation in metrology. We explore the relationship between the\ncovariance matrix produced by the Kalman filter and a GUM-compliant uncertainty\nanalysis. In addition, also the results of a Bayesian analysis are considered.\nFor the case of linear systems with known system matrices, we show that all\nthree approaches are compatible. When the system matrices are not precisely\nknown, however, or when the system is nonlinear, this equivalence breaks down\nand different results can be reached then. Though for precisely known nonlinear\nsystems the result of the extended Kalman filter still corresponds to the\nlinearized uncertainty propagation of GUM. The extended Kalman filter can\nsuffer from linearization and convergence errors. These disadvantages can be\navoided to some extent by applying Monte Carlo procedures, and we propose such\na method which is GUM-compliant and can also be applied online during the\nestimation. We illustrate all procedures in terms of a two-dimensional dynamic\nsystem and compare the results with those obtained by particle filtering, which\nhas been proposed for the approximate calculation of a Bayesian solution.\nFinally, we give some recommendations based on our findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2016 11:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

We showed that the small compact cluster produces a slight distorted\nscattered wave field in the transverse direction, which can be attributed to\nthe simultaneous oscillations of the pairs of tubes within the cluster aligned\nin a perpendicular direction to the incoming wave. However, no signature of a\nmultiple-scattering regime has been observed from this model, while it has been\nclearly observable for the large compact cluster model. Furthermore, we pointed\nout the importance of the geometrical shape of the monolithic model on the\ninteraction of $f$-mode waves with a sunspot in a high frequency range ($\\nu =$\n5 mHz). These results are a contribution to the observational effort to\ndistinguish seismically between different configurations of magnetic flux tubes\nwithin sunspots and plage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2016 12:38:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-05"}

There are three known sources of the memory effect: (i) the\nloss of energy to future null infinity by massless fields or particles, (ii)\nthe ejection of massive particles to infinity from a bound system and (iii)\nhomogeneous, source-free gravitational waves. In the context of linearized\ntheory, we show that asymptotic conditions controlling these known sources of\nthe gravitational memory effect rule out any other possible sources with\nphysically reasonable stress-energy tensors. Except for the source-free\ngravitational waves, the two other known sources produce gravitational memory\nwith E-mode radiation strain, characterized by a certain curl-free sky pattern\nof their polarization. Thus our results show that the only known source of\nB-mode gravitational memory is of primordial origin, corresponding in the\nlinearized theory to a homogeneous wave entering from past null infinity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2016 13:30:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 14:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

Applying this functor to the\nprop LieB of Lie bialgebras we show that universal formality maps for\nquantizations of Lie bialgebras are in in 1-1 correspondence with prop\nmorphisms from the minimal resolution AssB_infty of the prop of associative\nbialgebras to the polydifferential prop DLieB_infty satisfying certain boundary\nconditions.

We derive analytically the noise level at which a B clone gets\nactivated, in the absence of cross-talk, and find that this increases with the\nstrength of idiotypic interactions and with the number of T cells signalling\nthe B clone. We also derive, analytically and numerically, via population\ndynamics, the critical line where clonal cross-talk arises. Our approach allows\nus to derive the B clone size distribution, which can be experimentally\nmeasured and gives important information about the adaptive immune system\nresponse to antigens and vaccination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2016 14:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

If the ejecta\nmagnetization is not high enough to suppress the RS, a strong RS emission\ncomponent, usually peaking in the optical/IR band early on, would give\nimportant contribution to early afterglow light curves. In the radio band,\nsynchrotron self-absorption may suppress early RS emission, and also delay the\nRS peak time. In this paper, we calculate the self-absorbed RS emission in the\nradio band for different dynamical conditions. In particular, we stress that\nthe RS radio emission is subject to self-absorption in both reverse and forward\nshocks. We calculate the ratio between the reverse to forward shock flux at the\nRS peak time for different frequencies, which is a measure of the detectability\nof the RS emission component. We then constrain the range of physical\nparameters for a detectable RS, in particular the role of magnetization. We\nnotice that unlike optical RS emission which is enhanced by moderate\nmagnetization, a moderately magnetized ejecta does not necessarily produce a\nbrighter radio RS due to the self-absorption effect. For typical parameters,\nthe RS emission component would not be detectable below 1 GHz unless the medium\ndensity is very low (e.g. $n < 10^{-3} ~{\\rm cm^{-3}}$ for ISM and $A_* <\n5\\times 10^{-4}$ for wind).

While fire whirls have long been\nstudied for fire safety applications, previous research has yet to harness\ntheir potential burning efficiency for enhanced combustion. This paper presents\nlaboratory studies of fire whirls initiated as pool fires, but where the fuel\nsits on a water surface, seeding an idea of exploiting the high-efficiency of\nfire whirls for oil-spill remediation. We show the transition from a pool fire,\nto a fire whirl, and then to a previously unobserved state, a blue whirl. A\nblue whirl is smaller, very stable, and burns completely blue-violet in a\nhydrocarbon flame, indicating soot-free burning. The combination of fast mixing\nand the water-surface boundary creates the conditions leading to nearly\nsoot-free combustion. With the worldwide need to reduce emissions from both\nwanted and unwanted combustion, discovery of this new state points to new\npathways for highly efficient and low-emission energy production and fuel-spill\ncleanup. Because current methods to generate a stable vortex are difficult, we\nalso propose that the blue whirl may serve as a research platform for\nfundamental studies of vortices in fluid mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 May 2016 15:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

The confined DNA segment maintains its\ntranslational mobility and exhibits the main geometrical features of the\ncanonical B form. To accommodate itself within the nanopore, the DNA end-to-end\nlength increases from 3.85 nm up to approximately 4.1 nm, due to a 0.3 nm\nelastic expansion of the strand termini. The canonical Watson-Crick H-bond\nnetwork is essentially conserved throughout encapsulation, showing that the\ncontact between the DNA segment and the hydrophobic carbon walls results in\nminor rearrangements of the nucleotides H-bonding.

Such orbits could be the\nresult of strong scatterings with other giant planets. The same dynamical\ninstability that produces these scatterings may also cause habitable planets in\ninterior orbits to become ejected, destroyed, or be transported out of the\nhabitable zone. We say that a habitable planet has resilient habitability if it\nis able to avoid ejections and collisions and its orbit remains inside the\nhabitable zone. Here we model the orbital evolution of rocky planets in\nplanetary systems where giant planets become dynamically unstable. We measure\nthe resilience of habitable planets as a function of the observed, present-day\nmasses and orbits of the giant planets. We find that the survival rate of\nhabitable planets depends strongly on the giant planet architecture. Equal-mass\nplanetary systems are far more destructive than systems with giant planets of\nunequal masses. We also establish a link with observation; we find that giant\nplanets with present-day eccentricities higher than 0.4 almost never have a\nhabitable interior planet. For a giant planet with an present-day eccentricity\nof 0.2 and semimajor axis of 5 AU orbiting a Sun-like star, 50% of the orbits\nin the habitable zone are resilient to the instability.

Identifying possible replacements\nwith the adequate characteristics requires an intense R&D, which was recently\nstarted, also in collaborations across the various experiments. Possible\ncandidates have been proposed and are thoroughly investigated. Some tests on\none of the most promising candidate - HFO-1234ze, an allotropic form of\ntetrafluoropropane- have already been reported.

From the current-voltage\ncharacteristics measured with and without illumination by LED light of 470 nm\nwavelength, the current-breakdown voltage, $V_I$, and from linear fits of the\nvoltage dependence of the SiPM gain, measured by recording pulse-area spectra,\nthe gain-breakdown voltage, $V_G$, have been obtained. The voltage dependence\nof the Geiger-breakdown probability was determined from the fraction of zero\nphotoelectron events with LED illumination. By comparing the results to a model\ncalculation, the photodetection-breakdown voltage, $V_{PD}$, has been\ndetermined. Within experimental uncertainties, $V_I$ and $V_{PD}$ are equal and\nindependent of pixel size.

Our approach to the latter space and its role\nin functional analysis is novel. In fact, we establish several chains of\ninclusion relations between $M^{2,1}_\\text{a}(\\mathbb{R})$ and the more common\nLipschitz and Sobolev spaces, including Sobolev spaces of fractional order.\n  Next we introduce an appropriate metric for describing the distance of a\nfunction belonging to one of the latter spaces from a Bernstein space. It will\nbe used for estimating remainders and studying rates of convergence.\n  In the main part, we present the desired extensions.

We present an analysis of three\nobservations, including two with the Subaru telescope in 2010 February (Misawa\net al. 2013) and 2014 April (Misawa et al. 2014), separated by 4 years, and one\nwith the Very Large Telescope, separated from the second Subaru observation by\n$\\sim$2 months.

The velocities of intrinsic NALs appear to\ncluster around values of $v_{ej}$ $\\sim$ 59,000, 43,000, and 29,000 km/s, which\nis reminiscent of filamentary structures obtained by numerical simulations.\nThere are no common intrinsic NALs at the same redshift along the two\nsightlines, implying that the transverse size of the NAL absorbers should be\nsmaller than the sightline distance between two lensed images. In addition to\nthe NALs with large ejection velocities of $v_{ej}$ > 1,000 km/s, we also\ndetect broader proximity absorption lines (PALs) at $z_{abs}$ $\\sim$ $z_{em}$.\nThe PALs are likely to arise in outflowing gas at a distance of r $\\leq$ 620 pc\nfrom the central black hole with an electron density of $n_e$ $\\geq$\n8.7$\\times$10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$.
