Multipliers are expressions whose (summed) product\nwith a PDE (system) yields a local divergence identity which has the physical\nmeaning of a continuity equation involving a conserved density and a spatial\nflux for solutions of the PDE (system). On spatial domains, the integral form\nof a continuity equation yields a conserved integral. When a PDE (system) is\nvariational, multipliers correspond to symmetries of the variational principle,\nand the local divergence identity relating a multiplier to a conserved integral\nis the same as the variational identity used in Noether's theorem for\nconnecting conserved integrals to invariance of a variational principle. From\nthis viewpoint, the multiplier method is shown to constitute a modern form of\nNoether's theorem in which the variational principle is not used. When a PDE\n(system) is non-variational, multipliers are shown to be an adjoint counterpart\nto symmetries, and the local divergence identity relating a multiplier to a\nconserved integral is shown to be an adjoint generalization of the variational\nidentity underling Noether's theorem. Two main results are established for PDE\nsystems having a solved-form for leading derivatives, which encompasses all\ntypical PDEs of physical interest. First, all non-trivial conserved integrals\nare shown to arise from non-trivial multipliers in a one-to-one manner, taking\ninto account certain equivalence freedoms. Second, a scaling formula based on\ndimensional analysis is derived to obtain the conserved density and spatial\nflux in any conserved integral, just using the corresponding multiplier and the\ngiven PDE system.

To reduce false positives, detection methods\nfrequently rely on linear modeling of rank-based normalized or log-transformed\ngene expression data. Unfortunately, these approaches do not correspond to the\nsimplest model of eQTL action, and thus yield estimates of eQTL association\nthat can be uninterpretable and inaccurate. In this paper we propose a new,\nlog-of-linear model for eQTL action, termed ACME, that captures allelic\ncontributions to cis-acting eQTLs in an additive fashion, yielding effect size\nestimates that correspond to a biologically coherent model of cis-eQTLs. We\ndescribe a non-linear least-squares algorithm to fit the model by maximum\nlikelihood, and obtain corresponding $p$-values. We perform careful\ninvestigation of the model using a combination of simulated data and data from\nthe Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Our results reveal little\nevidence for dominance effects, a parsimonious result that accords with a\nsimple biological model for allele-specific expression and supports use of the\nACME model. We show that Type-I error is well-controlled under our approach in\na realistic setting, so that rank-based normalizations are unnecessary.\nFurthermore, we show that such normalizations can be detrimental to power and\nestimation accuracy under the proposed model. We then provide summaries of ACME\neffect sizes for whole-genome cis-eQTLs in the GTEx data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 May 2016 20:48:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2017 04:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-08"}

There have been claims that many hot Jupiter's\nexhibit vertical profiles with increasing temperature with decreasing pressure\nin the infrared photosphere that leads to the reversal of molecular absorption\nbands into emission features (an inversion). However, these claims have been\nbased on broadband photometry rather than the unambiguous identification of\nemission features with spectroscopy, and the chemical species that could cause\nthe thermal inversions by absorbing stellar irradiation at high altitudes have\nnot been identified despite extensive theoretical and observational effort.\nHere we present high precision HST WFC3 observations of the dayside emission\nspectrum of the hot Jupiter HD209458b; the first exoplanet suggested to have a\nthermal inversion.

If the pulse amplitude varies very slowly, the system adiabatically\nfollows the instantaneous Floquet states, which acquire dynamical phases that\ndepend on the evolution of the quasienergies over time. The difference between\nthe phases acquired by the two Floquet states corresponds to a qubit state\nrotation, generalizing the notion of Rabi oscillations to the case of large\ndriving amplitudes. If the pulse amplitude changes very fast, the evolution is\nnon-adiabatic, with transitions taking place between the Floquet states.

It is shown that the information measure of a function is related\nto the time complexity of search problems concerning the functions in question.\nFormally, given a Turing reduction from a search problem f(x)=y to another\nfunction g(x), the amount of information about f(x)=y provided by querying g(x)\nis exactly equal to the average mutual information I(f;g). As a result, the\naverage number of queries is I(f=y)/I(f;g), where I(f) is amount of\nself-information about the event {f=y}. In the idea case, if I(f=y)/I(f;g) is\npolynomial in the size of input and the function g(x) can be computed in\npolynomial time, then the problem f(x)=y also has polynomial-time algorithm.

We apply various techniques to analyze the filamentary and magnetic\nstructure of the resulting cloud, including the DisPerSE filament-finding\nalgorithm in 3D. The largest structure that forms is a 1-2 parsec-long\nfilament, with smaller connecting sub-filaments. We find that our simulated\nclouds, wherein magnetic forces and turbulence are comparable, coherent\norientation of the magnetic field depends on the virial parameter. Subvirial\nclumps undergo strong gravitational collapse and magnetic field lines are\ndragged with the accretion flow. We see evidence of filament-aligned flow and\naccretion flow onto the filament in the subvirial cloud. Magnetic fields\noriented more parallel in the subvirial cloud and more perpendicular in the\ndenser, marginally bound cloud. Radiative feedback from a 16 Msun star forming\nin a cluster in one of our simulations ultimately results in the destruction of\nthe main filament, the formation of an HII region, and the sweeping up of\nmagnetic fields within an expanding shell at the edges of the HII region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2016 02:57:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 18:04:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

In this\npaper, we consider the problem of designing revenue optimal dynamic mechanism\nfor a setting where an auctioneer sells a set of items to a buyer in multiple\nstages. At each stage, there could be multiple items for sale but each item can\nonly appear in one stage. The type of the buyer at each stage is thus a\nmulti-dimensional vector characterizing the buyer's valuations of the items at\nthat stage and is assumed to be stage-wise independent.\n  In particular, we propose a novel class of mechanisms called bank account\nmechanisms. Roughly, a bank account mechanism is no different from any\nstage-wise individual mechanism except for an augmented structure called bank\naccount, a real number for each node that summarizes the history so far. We\nfirst establish that the optimal revenue from any dynamic mechanism in this\nsetting can be achieved by a bank account mechanism, and we provide a simple\ncharacterization of the set of incentive compatible and ex-post individually\nrational bank account mechanisms. Based on these characterizations, we then\ninvestigate the problem of finding the (approximately) optimal bank account\nmechanisms. We prove that there exists a simple, randomized bank account\nmechanism that approximates optimal revenue up to a constant factor. Our result\nis general and can accommodate previous approximation results in single-shot\nmulti-dimensional mechanism design. Based on the previous mechanism, we further\nshow that there exists a deterministic bank account mechanism that achieves\nconstant-factor approximation as well. Finally, we consider the problem of\ncomputing optimal mechanisms when the type space is discrete and provide an\nFPTAS via linear and dynamic programming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2016 03:44:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jul 2016 00:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-07"}

However, due to (a) the fact that\nprevious works mainly focus on system design aspects, and (b) the lack of real\ndeployments, it is not clearly understood yet to what extent inter-domain SDN\ncan improve performance.\n  To this end, in this work, we make the first effort towards analytically\nstudying the effects of routing centralization on the performance of\ninter-domain routing, and, in particular, the convergence time of BGP.\nSpecifically, we propose a Markovian model for inter-domain networks, where a\nsubset of nodes (domains) coordinate to centralize their inter-domain routing.\nWe then derive analytic results that quantify the BGP convergence time under\nvarious network settings (like, SDN penetration, topology, BGP configuration,\netc.).

Employing single particle correlation functions, we present an\nexplicit form for layer-layer entanglement Hamiltonian whose spectrum is\nentanglement spectrum. We demonstrate that in the absence of trigonal warping,\nat zero on-site energy difference exact correspondence is established between\nentanglement spectrum and energy spectrum of monolayer which means that the\nentanglement spectrum perfectly reflects the edge state properties of the\nbilayer. We also show that trigonal warping breaks down such a perfect\ncorrespondence, however, in $\\Gamma$-K direction in hexagonal Brillouin zone,\ntheir behaviors are remarkably the same for particular relevances of hopping\nparameters. In the presence of an on-site energy difference the symmetry of\nentanglement spectrum is broken with opening an indirect entanglement gap. We\nalso study the effects of a perpendicular magnetic field on both energy and the\nentanglement spectrum of the bilayer in the presence of trigonal warping and\non-site energy difference.

The key concept in many photonic applications is the \"critical\ncoupling\" condition: at criticality, all the energy fed to the system via an\ninput channel is dissipated within the system itself. Although this idea was\ncrucial to enhance the efficiency of many devices, it was never considered in\nthe context of systems operating in a non-perturbative regime. In this\nso-called strong coupling regime, the matter and light degrees of freedom are\nin fact mixed into dressed states, leading to new eigenstates called\npolaritons. Here we demonstrate that the strong coupling regime and the\ncritical coupling condition can indeed coexist; in this situation, which we\nterm strong critical coupling, all the incoming energy is converted into\npolaritons. A semiclassical theory - equivalently applicable to acoustics or\nmechanics - reveals that the strong critical coupling corresponds to a special\ncurve in the phase diagram of the coupled light-matter oscillators. In the more\ngeneral case of a system radiating via two scattering ports, the phenomenology\ndisplayed is that of coherent perfect absorption (CPA), which is then naturally\nunderstood and described in the framework of critical coupling. Most\nimportantly, we experimentally verify polaritonic CPA in a semiconductor-based\nintersubband-polariton photonic-crystal membrane resonator. This result opens\nnew avenues in the exploration of polariton physics, making it possible to\ncontrol the pumping efficiency of a system almost independently of its Rabi\nenergy, i.e., of the energy exchange rate between the electromagnetic field and\nthe material transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2016 15:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-31"}

The new census of members is\nnearly complete for Ks<16.8 at Aj<1.5 in IC 348 and for Ks<16.2 at Aj<3 in NGC\n1333, which correspond to masses of <=0.01 Msun for ages of 3 Myr according to\ntheoretical evolutionary models.

It would be surprising if the\ninitial mass functions of these clusters differ significantly given their\nsimilar stellar densities and formation environments.

The three\nstrategies examined were authority, scarcity and social proof, and the emails\nwere either genuine, phishing or spear-phishing. Of the three strategies, the\nuse of authority was the most effective strategy in convincing users that a\nlink in an email was safe. When detecting phishing and spear-phishing emails,\nusers performed the worst when the emails used the authority principle and\nperformed best when social proof was present. Overall, users struggled to\ndistinguish between genuine and spear-phishing emails. Finally, users who were\nless impulsive in making decisions generally were less likely to judge a link\nas safe in the fraudulent emails.

To manipulate translation quality, two translation\nmethods are used: machine and crowdsourced. The chosen translation written\nlanguage pair is from English to Simplified Chinese, as these are the official\nlanguages of world's two largest economies (U.S.A and China respectively) that\nalso have large e-tailing markets. A model based on an integration of two\ntheories, DeLone & McLean's Information Systems Success Model, and Perceived\nRisk Theory, has been developed for testing the impact of translated\ninformation quality. The moderating effect of translation method and\ne-retailer's brand influencing customers' tolerance of imperfect translation is\nalso considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 May 2016 03:43:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-06"}
