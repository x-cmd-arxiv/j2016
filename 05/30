It has previously been\nestablished using projection methods that such subnetwork dynamics generically\ninvolves memory of the past, and that the memory functions can be calculated\nexplicitly for biochemical reaction networks made up of unary and binary\nreactions. However, many established network models involve also\nMichaelis-Menten kinetics, to describe e.g. enzymatic reactions. We show that\nthe projection approach to subnetwork dynamics can be extended to such\nnetworks, thus significantly broadening its range of applicability. To derive\nthe extension we construct a larger network that represents enzymes and enzyme\ncomplexes explicitly, obtain the projected equations, and finally take the\nlimit of fast enzyme reactions that gives back Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The\ncrucial point is that this limit can be taken in closed form. The outcome is a\nsimple procedure that allows one to obtain a description of subnetwork\ndynamics, including memory functions, starting directly from any given network\nof unary, binary and Michaelis-Menten reactions. Numerical tests show that this\nclosed form enzyme elimination gives a much more accurate description of the\nsubnetwork dynamics than the simpler method that represents enzymes explicitly,\nand is also more efficient computationally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2016 16:06:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

In\nprinciple, MCMC is an exact probabilistic method which, however, often suffers\nfrom exponentially slow mixing. In contrast, BP is a deterministic method,\nwhich is typically fast, empirically very successful, however in general\nlacking control of accuracy over loopy graphs. In this paper, we introduce MCMC\nalgorithms correcting the approximation error of BP, i.e., we provide a way to\ncompensate for BP errors via a consecutive BP-aware MCMC. Our framework is\nbased on the Loop Calculus (LC) approach which allows expressing the BP error\nas a sum of weighted generalized loops. Although the full series is\ncomputationally intractable, it is known that a truncated series, summing up\nall 2-regular loops, is computable in polynomial-time for planar pair-wise\nbinary GMs and it also provides a highly accurate approximation empirically.\nMotivated by this, we first propose a polynomial-time approximation MCMC scheme\nfor the truncated series of general (non-planar) pair-wise binary models. Our\nmain idea here is to use the Worm algorithm, known to provide fast mixing in\nother (related) problems, and then design an appropriate rejection scheme to\nsample 2-regular loops. Furthermore, we also design an efficient rejection-free\nMCMC scheme for approximating the full series. The main novelty underlying our\ndesign is in utilizing the concept of cycle basis, which provides an efficient\ndecomposition of the generalized loops. In essence, the proposed MCMC schemes\nrun on transformed GM built upon the non-trivial BP solution, and our\nexperiments show that this synthesis of BP and MCMC outperforms both direct\nMCMC and bare BP schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 May 2016 18:24:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Sep 2016 05:48:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Oct 2016 02:58:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2016 14:55:22 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 01:32:03 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 03:20:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

They also showed that the\nminimum number of edges that occur in a $C_{2k+1}$ for $k\\ge2$ is at least\n$11n^2/144-O(n)$, and conjectured that for any $k\\ge2$, the correct lower bound\nshould be $2n^2/9-O(n)$. Very recently, F\\\"uredi and Maleki constructed a\ncounterexample for $k=2$ and proved asymptotically matching lower bound, namely\nthat for any $\\varepsilon>0$ graphs with $(1+\\varepsilon)n^2/4$ edges contain\nat least $(2+\\sqrt{2})n^2/16 \\approx 0.2134n^2$ edges that occur in $C_5$.\n  In this paper, we use a different approach to tackle this problem and obtain\nthe following stronger result: Any $n$-vertex graph with at least $\\lfloor\nn^2/4\\rfloor+1$ edges has at least $(2+\\sqrt{2})n^2/16-O(n^{15/8})$ edges that\noccur in $C_5$.

To deal\nwith these massive data, elaborated sequence analysis pipelines are employed. A\ncore component of such pipelines is a read mapping module whose accuracy\nstrongly affects the quality of resulting variant calls.\n  We propose a dynamic read mapping approach that significantly improves read\nalignment accuracy. The general idea of dynamic mapping is to continuously\nupdate the reference sequence on the basis of previously computed read\nalignments. Even though this concept already appeared in the literature, we\nbelieve that our work provides the first comprehensive analysis of this\napproach.\n  To evaluate the benefit of dynamic mapping, we developed a software pipeline\n(http://github.com/karel-brinda/dymas) that mimics different dynamic mapping\nscenarios. The pipeline was applied to compare dynamic mapping with the\nconventional static mapping and, on the other hand, with the so-called\niterative referencing - a computationally expensive procedure computing an\noptimal modification of the reference that maximizes the overall quality of all\nalignments. We conclude that in all alternatives, dynamic mapping results in a\nmuch better accuracy than static mapping, approaching the accuracy of iterative\nreferencing.\n  To correct the reference sequence in the course of dynamic mapping, we\ndeveloped an online consensus caller named OCOCO\n(http://github.com/karel-brinda/ococo). OCOCO is the first consensus caller\ncapable to process input reads in the online fashion.\n  Finally, we provide conclusions about the feasibility of dynamic mapping and\ndiscuss main obstacles that have to be overcome to implement it.

We approach this question for\nnetworks with linear time-invariant dynamics by relating internal network\nfeedbacks to the statistical prevalence of connectivity motifs, a set of\nsurprisingly simple and local statistics of connectivity. This results in a\nreduced order model of the network input-output dynamics in terms of motifs\nstructures. As an example, the new formulation dramatically simplifies the\nclassic Erdos-Renyi graph, reducing the overall network behavior to one\nproportional feedback wrapped around the dynamics of a single node. For general\nnetworks, higher-order motifs systematically provide further layers and types\nof feedback to regulate the network response. Thus, the local connectivity\nshapes temporal and spectral processing by the network as a whole, and we show\nhow this enables robust, yet tunable, functionality such as extending the time\nconstant with which networks remember past signals. The theory also extends to\nnetworks composed from heterogeneous nodes with distinct dynamics and\nconnectivity, and patterned input to (and readout from) subsets of nodes.

We finally show that they\noutperform the state-of-the-art methods in the low sample regime on benchmark\ndatasets (MNIST and CIFAR10). The obtained results demonstrate very clear\nimprovement, especially in the context of small sample regimes with data laying\nin a low dimensional manifold.

A general, recent approach to optimise such \"nested\"\nfunctions is the method of auxiliary coordinates (MAC). MAC introduces an\nauxiliary coordinate for each data point in order to decouple the nested model\ninto independent submodels. This decomposes the optimisation into steps that\nalternate between training single layers and updating the coordinates. It has\nthe advantage that it reuses existing single-layer algorithms, introduces\nparallelism, and does not need to use chain-rule gradients, so it works with\nnondifferentiable layers. With large-scale problems, or when distributing the\ncomputation is necessary for faster training, the dataset may not fit in a\nsingle machine. It is then essential to limit the amount of communication\nbetween machines so it does not obliterate the benefit of parallelism. We\ndescribe a general way to achieve this, ParMAC. ParMAC works on a cluster of\nprocessing machines with a circular topology and alternates two steps until\nconvergence: one step trains the submodels in parallel using stochastic\nupdates, and the other trains the coordinates in parallel. Only submodel\nparameters, no data or coordinates, are ever communicated between machines.\nParMAC exhibits high parallelism, low communication overhead, and facilitates\ndata shuffling, load balancing, fault tolerance and streaming data processing.\nWe study the convergence of ParMAC and propose a theoretical model of its\nruntime and parallel speedup. We develop ParMAC to learn binary autoencoders\nfor fast, approximate image retrieval.

The results\nshow that, in the case of translucent clouds, the currently adopted rate for\nheating of whole grains to temperatures in excess of 70 K is underestimated by\napproximately two orders of magnitude in astrochemical numerical simulations.\nAdditionally, grains are heated by CRs to modest temperatures (20--30 K) with\nintervals of a few years, which reduces the possibility of ice chemical\nexplosions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2016 07:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

Here we describe how\nspatial variations in the amplitude and orientation of realistic image\ndistortions convolve with the measured shear field, mixing the even-parity\nconvergence and odd-parity modes, and bias the shear power spectrum. Many of\nthese biases can be removed by calibration to external data, the survey itself,\nor by modelling in simulations. The uncertainty in the calibration must be\nmarginalised over and we calculate how this propagates into parameter\nestimation, degrading the dark energy Figure-of-Merit. We find that noise-like\nbiases affect dark energy measurements the most, while spikes in the bias power\nhave the least impact, reflecting their correlation with the effect of\ncosmological parameters. We argue that in order to remove systematic biases in\ncosmic shear surveys and maintain statistical power effort should be put into\nimproving the accuracy of the bias calibration rather than minimising the size\nof the bias. In general, this appears to be a weaker condition for bias\nremoval. We also investigate how to minimise the size of the calibration set\nfor a fixed reduction in the Figure-of-Merit.

The approach followed so\nfar, inspired by the seminal proposal of the Datta and Das spin modulator, has\nrelied on the spin-orbit field as a medium for electrical control of the spin\nstate. However, the still standing challenge is to find a material whose\nspin-orbit-coupling (SOC) is weak enough to transport spins over long\ndistances, while also being strong enough to allow their electrical\nmanipulation. Here we demonstrate a radically different approach by engineering\na heterostructure from atomically thin crystals, which are \"glued\" by weak van\nder Waals (vdW) forces and which combine the superior spin transport properties\nof graphene with the strong SOC of the semiconducting MoS$_{2}$. The spin\ntransport in the graphene channel is modulated between ON and OFF states by\ntuning the spin absorption into the MoS$_{2}$ layer with a gate electrode.

The reason for this is poorly\nunderstood, but may reflect differences in planet occurrence around the\nrelatively high-mass stars that have been surveyed, or may be the result of\ntidal destruction of such planets. K2-39 is an evolved star with a\nspectroscopically derived stellar radius and mass of\n$3.88^{+0.48}_{-0.42}~\\mathrm{R_\\odot}$ and\n$1.53^{+0.13}_{-0.12}~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$, respectively, and a very close-in\ntransiting planet, with $a/R_\\star = 3.4$.

RF is a popular and useful tool for non-linear\nmulti-variate classification and regression, which yields a good trade-off\nbetween robustness (low variance) and adaptiveness (low bias). Direct\ninterpretation of a RF model is difficult, as the explicit ensemble model of\nhundreds of deep trees is complex. Nonetheless, it is possible to visualize a\nRF model fit by its mapping from feature space to prediction space. Hereby the\nuser is first presented with the overall geometrical shape of the model\nstructure, and when needed one can zoom in on local details. Dimensional\nreduction by projection is used to visualize high dimensional shapes. The\ntraditional method to visualize RF model structure, partial dependence plots,\nachieve this by averaging multiple parallel projections. We suggest to first\nuse feature contributions, a method to decompose trees by splitting features,\nand then subsequently perform projections. The advantages of forest floor over\npartial dependence plots is that interactions are not masked by averaging. As a\nconsequence, it is possible to locate interactions, which are not visualized in\na given projection. Furthermore, we introduce: a goodness-of-visualization\nmeasure, use of colour gradients to identify interactions and an out-of-bag\ncross validated variant of feature contributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2016 12:24:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 13:06:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 12:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-05"}

The Hough transform is a pattern\nrecognition technique, which is mainly used to detect straight lines in digital\nimages and which has been recently extended to the automatic recognition of\nalgebraic plane curves. Although defined in very different ways, in numerical\napplications both transforms ultimately take an image as an input and provide,\nas an output, a function defined on a parameter space. The parameters in this\nspace describe a family of curves, which represent either the integration\ndomains considered in the (generalized) Radon transform, or the curves to be\ndetected by means of the Hough transform. In both cases, the 2D plot of the\nintensity values of the output function is the so-called (Radon or Hough)\nsinogram. While the Hough sinogram is produced by an algorithm whose\nimplementation requires that the parameter space be discretized in cells, the\nRadon sinogram is mathematically defined on a continuous parameter space, which\nin turn may need to be discretized just for physical or numerical reasons. In\nthis paper, by considering a more general and n-dimensional setting, we prove\nthat, whether the input image is described as a set of points (possibly with\ndifferent intensity values) or as a piecewise constant function, its (rescaled)\nHough sinogram converges to the corresponding Radon sinogram as the\ndiscretization step in the parameter space tends to zero. We also show that\nthis result may have a notable impact on the image reconstruction problem of\ninverting the Radon sinogram recorded by a medical imaging scanner, and that\nthe description of the Hough transform problem within the framework of\nregularization theory for inverse problems is worth investigating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2016 12:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-31"}

From our simulations covering up\nto ~350 ms after bounce, we show that the development of the standing accretion\nshock instability (SASI) differs significantly depending on the stiffness of\nnuclear EoS. Generally, the SASI activity occurs more vigorously in models with\nsofter EoS. By evaluating the gravitational-wave (GW) emission, we find a new\nGW signature on top of the previously identified one, in which the typical GW\nfrequency increases with time due to an accumulating accretion to the\nproto-neutron star (PNS). The newly observed quasi-periodic signal appears in\nthe frequency range from ~100 to 200 Hz and persists for ~150 ms before\nneutrino-driven convection dominates over the SASI. By analyzing the cycle\nfrequency of the SASI sloshing and spiral modes as well as the mass accretion\nrate to the emission region, we show that the SASI frequency is correlated with\nthe GW frequency. This is because the SASI-induced temporary perturbed mass\naccretion strike the PNS surface, leading to the quasi-periodic GW emission.\nOur results show that the GW signal, which could be a smoking-gun signature of\nthe SASI, is within the detection limits of LIGO, advanced Virgo, and KAGRA for\nGalactic events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2016 13:09:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Aug 2016 11:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

For many of\nbiologically relevant cases the structure of protein-protein complexes remain\nunknown. Therefore computational techniques, including molecular docking, have\nbecome a valuable part of drug discovery pipelines.

Additionally, some knowledge of the approximate\nlocation and/or the shape of the active site is also required. Such limitations\narise mostly from the enormous number of degrees of freedom of protein-protein\nsystems. In this paper, an efficient computational method for protein-protein\ndocking is proposed and initially tested on a single docking case. The proposed\nmethod is based on a two-step procedure. In the first step, CABS-dock web\nserver for protein-peptide docking is used to dock a peptide, which is the\nappropriate protein fragment responsible for the protein-protein interaction,\nto the other protein partner. During peptide docking, no knowledge about the\nbinding site, nor the peptide structure, is used and the peptide is allowed to\nbe fully flexible. In the second step, the docked peptide is used in the\nstructural adjustment of protein complex partners. The proposed method allowed\nus to obtain a high accuracy model, therefore it provides a promising framework\nfor further advances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2016 15:12:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-31"}

We also show that 60\nindividuals with Autistic Spectrum Disorder, and 60 individuals with\nSchizophrenia have significantly higher (>2.0) scale-free exponents (2.4 se\n.03, 2.3 se .04), indicating more fractionated and less controllable dynamics\nin the brain networks revealed in resting state. Finally we show that the\nexponent values vary with phenotypic measures of atypical disease severity\nindicating that the global topology of the network itself can provide specific\ndiagnostic biomarkers for atypical brain activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2016 15:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-31"}

However, in\norder to realise the full potential of these surveys, we need to ensure that we\nare using the correct analysis: a relativistic analysis, which has been widely\nstudied recently. In this work, the known relativistic overdensity of galaxy\nsurveys is re-examined. Unlike in previous works, a consistent approach for\nincorporating both the relativistic number-count overdensity and the\nrelativistic cosmic magnification overdensity in the total observed overdensity\nof a generic survey, is presented. Since in practice, analyses are often done\nfor specific sample types (flux-limited or volume-limited) the approach in this\nwork allows for the total observed overdensity to be easily reduced to either\nof the individual overdensities by applying the same limiting conditions as for\nextracting the corresponding data samples. This is not obvious, or in some\ncases not possible, with the results of previous works. Thus, the calculations\nin this work serve to generalise the expression for the total observed\noverdensity. However, care must be taken to apply it appropriately: the type of\nthe data sample in consideration needs to be taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 May 2016 12:57:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 09:44:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 2019 06:37:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 17:29:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 16 May 2022 12:30:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

To this end, we\nconsider that the stellar object is spherically symmetric, static and\nanisotropic in nature and follows the density profile given by Mak and Harko\n(2002), which satisfies all the physical conditions. To investigate different\nproperties of the ultra-dense strange stars we have employed the MIT bag model\nfor the quark matter. Our investigation displays an interesting feature that\nthe anisotropy of compact stars increases with the radial coordinate and\nattains its maximum value at the surface which seems an inherent property for\nthe singularity free anisotropic compact stellar objects. In this connection we\nalso perform several tests for physical features of the proposed model and show\nthat these are reasonably acceptable within certain range. Further, we find\nthat the model is consistent with the energy conditions and the compact stellar\nstructure is stable with the validity of the TOV equation and Herrera cracking\nconcept.
