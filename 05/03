High state flares exhibit a narrow range of\namplitudes with a striking cut-off at a maximum amplitude. Optical fluxes\ncorrelate with X-ray fluxes in the high state, but in the low state they are\nanti-correlated. These patterns can be seen clearly in both flux-flux diagrams\nand cross-correlation functions and are consistent between MAXI and GBM. The\nhigh state correlation arises promptly with at most a few minutes lag. We\nattribute this to thermal reprocessing of X-ray flares.

Since the observing strategy can lead to\nartifacts in the data, we investigate the effects of telescope-pointing offsets\n(called dithers) on the $r$-band coadded 5$\\sigma$ depth yielded after the\n10-year survey. We analyze this survey depth for several geometric patterns of\ndithers (e.g., random, hexagonal lattice, spiral) with amplitude as large as\nthe radius of the LSST field-of-view, implemented on different timescales (per\nseason, per night, per visit). Our results illustrate that per night and per\nvisit dither assignments are more effective than per season. Also, we find that\nsome dither geometries (e.g., hexagonal lattice) are particularly sensitive to\nthe timescale on which the dithers are implemented, while others like random\ndithers perform well on all timescales. We then model the propagation of depth\nvariations to artificial fluctuations in galaxy counts, which are a systematic\nfor large-scale structure studies. We calculate the bias in galaxy counts\ncaused by the observing strategy, accounting for photometric calibration\nuncertainties, dust extinction, and magnitude cuts; uncertainties in this bias\nlimit our ability to account for structure induced by the observing strategy.\nWe find that after 10 years of the LSST survey, the best dither strategies lead\nto uncertainties in this bias smaller than the minimum statistical floor for a\ngalaxy catalog as deep as $r$$<$27.5. A few of these strategies bring the\nuncertainties close to the statistical floor for $r$$<$25.7 after only one year\nof survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 16:38:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 20:01:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}

The finite volume method used belongs to a\nvery popular class of methods for solving Newtonian flow problems, which use\nthe SIMPLE algorithm to solve the discretised set of equations, and have\nmatured over the years. By regularising the Bingham constitutive equation it is\neasy to extend such a solver to Bingham flows since all that this requires is\nto modify the viscosity function. This is a tempting approach, since it\nrequires minimum programming effort and makes available all the existing\nfeatures of the mature finite volume solver. On the other hand, regularisation\nintroduces a parameter which controls the error in addition to the grid\nspacing, and makes it difficult to locate the yield surfaces. Furthermore, the\nequations become stiffer and more difficult to solve, while the discontinuity\nat the yield surfaces causes large truncation errors. The present work attempts\nto investigate the strengths and weaknesses of such a method by applying it to\nthe lid-driven cavity problem for a range of Bingham and Reynolds numbers (up\nto 100 and 5000 respectively).

For some $\\mathcal{S}_1 \\subset [d],\n\\mathcal{S}_2 \\subset {[d] \\choose 2}$, with $|\\mathcal{S}_1| \\ll d,\n|\\mathcal{S}_2| \\ll d^2$, the function $f$ is now assumed to be of the form:\n$\\sum_{p \\in \\mathcal{S}_1}\\phi_{p} (x_p) + \\sum_{(l,l^{\\prime}) \\in\n\\mathcal{S}_2}\\phi_{(l,l^{\\prime})} (x_l,x_{l^{\\prime}})$. Assuming we have the\nfreedom to query $f$ anywhere in its domain, we derive efficient algorithms\nthat provably recover $\\mathcal{S}_1,\\mathcal{S}_2$ with finite sample bounds.\nOur analysis covers the noiseless setting where exact samples of $f$ are\nobtained, and also extends to the noisy setting where the queries are corrupted\nwith noise. For the noisy setting in particular, we consider two noise models\nnamely: i.i.d Gaussian noise and arbitrary but bounded noise. Our main methods\nfor identification of $\\mathcal{S}_2$ essentially rely on estimation of sparse\nHessian matrices, for which we provide two novel compressed sensing based\nschemes. Once $\\mathcal{S}_1, \\mathcal{S}_2$ are known, we show how the\nindividual components $\\phi_p$, $\\phi_{(l,l^{\\prime})}$ can be estimated via\nadditional queries of $f$, with uniform error bounds. Lastly, we provide\nsimulation results on synthetic data that validate our theoretical findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 18:32:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 14:47:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 15:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-09"}

Therefore, a variety of bonding\nmodels have been developed, each defining the structure of molecules in a\ndifferent manner with the goal of explaining and predicting chemical\nproperties. This thesis describes the initial development of gradient bundle\nanalysis (GBA), a chemical bonding model that creates a high resolution picture\nof chemical interactions within the charge density framework. GBA is based on\nconcepts from the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), but uses a more\ncomplete picture of the topology and geometry of the electron charge density to\nunderstand and predict bonding interactions. Gradient bundles are defined as\nvolumes bounded by zero-flux surfaces (ZFSs) in the gradient of the charge\ndensity with well-defined energies. The structure of gradient bundles provides\nan avenue for detecting the locations of valence electrons, which correspond to\nreactive regions in a molecule. The number of electrons in bonding regions,\nwhich are defined by the lowering of kinetic energy in gradient bundles, is\nfound to correlate to bond dissociation energy in diatomic molecules.\nFurthermore, site reactivity can be understood and predicted by observing the\nmotion of ZFSs bounding gradient bundles and calculating condensed gradient\nbundle Fukui functions. Using only the ground state charge density, I present\npreliminary results for a method that predicts which regions in a molecule are\nmost likely to undergo nucleophilic and electrophilic attack, effectively\nlocating the HOMO and LUMO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 18:48:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-03"}

Recent galaxy formation simulations\nhave demonstrated the need for active CR transport either in the form of\ndiffusion or streaming to successfully launch winds in galaxies. However, due\nto computational limitations, most previous simulations have modeled CR\ntransport isotropically. Here, we discuss high resolution simulations of\nisolated disk galaxies in a $10^{11}\\rm{M_\\odot}$ halo with the moving mesh\ncode {\\sc Arepo} that include injection of CRs from supernovae, advective\ntransport, CR cooling, and CR transport through isotropic or anisotropic\ndiffusion. We show that either mode of diffusion leads to the formation of\nstrong bipolar outflows. However, they develop significantly later in the\nsimulation with anisotropic diffusion compared to the simulation with isotropic\ndiffusion. Moreover, we find that isotropic diffusion allows most of the CRs to\nquickly diffuse out of the disk, while in the simulation with anisotropic\ndiffusion, most CRs remain in the disk once the magnetic field becomes\ndominated by its azimuthal component, which occurs after $\\sim 300\\,{\\rm\nMyrs}$. This has important consequences for the gas dynamics in the disk. In\nparticular, we show that isotropic diffusion strongly suppresses the\namplification of the magnetic field in the disk compared to anisotropic or no\ndiffusion models.

In the previous paper in this series, we\nshowed that gravity alone can drive turbulence in galactic disks, regulate\ntheir Toomre $Q$ parameters to $\\sim$ 1, and transport mass inwards at a rate\nsufficient to fuel star formation in the centers of present-day galaxies. In\nthis paper we extend our models to include the effects of star formation\nfeedback. We show that feedback suppresses galaxies' star formation rates by a\nfactor of $\\sim$ 5 and leads to the formation of a multi-phase atomic and\nmolecular ISM. Both the star formation rate and the phase balance produced in\nour simulations agree well with observations of nearby spirals. After our\ngalaxies reach steady state, we find that the inclusion of feedback actually\nlowers the gas velocity dispersion slightly compared to the case of pure\nself-gravity, and also slightly reduces the rate of inward mass transport.\nNevertheless, we find that, even with feedback included, our galactic disks\nself-regulate to $Q$ $\\sim$ 1, and transport mass inwards at a rate sufficient\nto supply a substantial fraction of the inner disk star formation. We argue\nthat gravitational instability is therefore likely to be the dominant source of\nturbulence and transport in galactic disks, and that it is responsible for\nfueling star formation in the inner parts of galactic disks over cosmological\ntimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 15:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

We also derive the AGN bolometric\nluminosity ($\\sim10^{14}L_\\odot$) of our Hot DOG sample by using IR SEDs\ndecomposition. The derived merger fraction and AGN bolometric luminosity\nrelation is well consistent with the variability-based model prediction (Hickox\net al. 2014). Both the high merger fraction in IR-luminous AGN sample and\nrelatively low merger fraction in UV/optical-selected, unobscured AGN sample\ncan be expected in the merger-driven evolutionary model.

The encoder assesses a\nrandom process that the remote estimator seeks to estimate based on information\nsent to it by the encoder via the channel. The channel is affected by Bernoulli\ndrops. The instantaneous probability of a drop is governed by a finite state\nmachine (FSM). The state of the FSM is denoted as the channel state. At each\ntime step, the encoder decides whether to attempt a transmission through the\npacket-drop link. The sequence of encoder decisions is the input to the FSM.\nThis paper seeks to design an encoder, transmission policy and remote estimator\nthat minimize a finite-horizon mean squared error cost.

The GDoF region is parameterized by\n$\\alpha$, which links the interference-to-noise ratio (INR) to the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) via $INR=SNR^{\\alpha}$. A new outer bound for the\nGDoF region is established by maximizing a bound on the weighted sum-rate of\nthe two users, which in turn is obtained by using a combination of genie-aided\nside-information and an extremal inequality. The maximum weighted sum-rate in\nthe high SNR regime is shown to occur when the transmission covariance matrix\nof the interfering transmitter has full rank. An achievability scheme based on\nblock-Markov encoding and backward decoding is developed which uses\ninterference quantization and digital multicasting to take advantage of the\nchannel statistics of the cross-link, and the scheme is separately shown to be\nGDoF-optimal in both the weak ($\\alpha\\leq1$) and strong ($\\alpha>1$)\ninterference regimes. This is the first complete characterization of the GDoF\nregion of any interference network with delayed CSIT, as well as the first such\nGDoF characterization of a MIMO network with delayed CSIT and arbitrary number\nof antennas at each node. For all antenna tuples, the GDoF region is shown to\nbe equal to or larger than the degrees of freedom (DoF) region over the entire\nrange of $\\alpha$, which leads to a V-shaped maximum sum-GDoF as a function of\n$\\alpha$, with the minimum occurring at $\\alpha=1$. The delayed CSIT GDoF\nregion and the sum-DoF are compared with their counterparts under perfect CSIT,\nthereby characterizing all antenna tuples and ranges of $\\alpha$ for which\ndelayed CSIT is sufficient to achieve the perfect CSIT GDoF region or sum-DoF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 21:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

In this study, we\nsuggest a wetting theory that is applicable to any droplet size based on the\nfree energy landscape analysis of various wetting modes of finite-sized\ndroplets on a 2D textured surface.

By using the available\nmultiwavelength data of various surveys in the COSMOS field, we built a parent\nsample of 33 quasars brighter than $J=20$ mag, identified by reliable X-ray to\nradio wavelength selection techniques.

This problem can be\nseen as a variant of the one-commodity pickup and delivery vehicle routing\nproblem, where multiple visits are allowed to be performed at each station,\ni.e., the demand of a station is allowed to be split. Moreover, a vehicle may\ntemporarily drop its load at a station, leaving it in excess or, alternatively,\ncollect more bikes from a station (even all of them), thus leaving it in\ndefault. Both cases require further visits in order to meet the actual demands\nof such station. This paper deals with a particular case of the SBRP, in which\nonly a single vehicle is available and the objective is to find a least-cost\nroute that meets the demand of all stations and does not violate the minimum\n(zero) and maximum (vehicle capacity) load limits along the tour. Therefore,\nthe number of bikes to be collected or delivered at each station should be\nappropriately determined in order to respect such constraints. We propose an\niterated local search (ILS) based heuristic to solve the problem. The ILS\nalgorithm was tested on 980 benchmark instances from the literature and the\nresults obtained are quite competitive when compared to other existing methods.\nMoreover, our heuristic was capable of finding most of the known optimal\nsolutions and also of improving the results on a number of open instances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 22:44:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 May 2016 00:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-05"}

If these are pulsars, this would bring\nthe total number of MSPs at |b| > 5 degrees to 106. We find this number to be\nin excellent agreement with predictions from a new population synthesis of MSPs\nthat predicts 100-126 high-latitude 3FGL MSPs depending on the choice of\nhigh-energy emission model. If, however, these are dark matter substructures,\nwe can place upper limits on the number of Galactic subhalos surviving today\nand on dark matter annihilation cross sections. These limits are beginning to\napproach the canonical thermal relic cross section for dark matter particle\nmasses below ~100 GeV in the bottom quark annihilation channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2016 00:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

However, ZIA contains one major security weakness - unauthorized\nphysical access to the token, e.g., during lunch-time or upon theft, allows the\nattacker to have unfettered access to the terminal.\n  In this paper, we address this gaping vulnerability with ZIA systems by\n(un)locking the authentication token with the user's walking pattern as she\napproaches the terminal to access it. Since a user's walking or gait pattern is\nbelieved to be unique, only that user (no imposter) would be able to unlock the\ntoken to gain access to the terminal in a ZIA session. While walking-based\nbiometrics schemes have been studied in prior literature for other application\nsettings, our main novelty lies in the careful use of: (1) multiple sensors\navailable on the current breed of devices (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope and\nmagnetometer), and (2) multiple devices carried by the user (in particular, an\n\"in-pocket\" smartphone and a \"wrist-worn\" smartwatch), that all capture unique\nfacets of user's walking pattern.

This paper proposes a diagonal unloading\n(DU) method which extends the conventional response power beamforming method by\nimposing an additional constraint to the covariance matrix of the array output\nvector. The regularization is obtained by subtracting a given amount of white\nnoise from the main diagonal of the covariance matrix. Specifically, the DU\nbeamformer aims at subtracting the signal subspace from the noisy signal space\nand it is computed by constraining the regularized covariance matrix to be\nnegative definite. It is hence a data-dependent covariance matrix conditioning\nmethod. We show how to calculate precisely the unloading parameter, and we\npresent an eigenvalue analysis for comparing the proposed DU beamforming, the\nminimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) filter and the multiple signal\nclassification (MUSIC) method. Theoretical analysis and experiments with\nacoustic sources demonstrate that the DU beamformer localization performance is\ncomparable to that of MVDR and MUSIC. Since the DU beamformer computational\ncost is comparable to that of a conventional beamformer, the proposed method\ncan be attractive in array processing due to its simplicity, effectiveness and\ncomputational efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2016 09:31:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-18"}

The DAWs are spontaneously excited in the dust medium and found\nto propagate in the direction of ion drift (along the gravity) above a\nthreshold discharge current at lower pressure. The excitation of such low\nfrequency wave is a result of the ion--dust streaming instability in the dust\ncloud. The characteristics of the propagating dust acoustic wave get modified\nin presence of a floating cylindrical object of radius larger than the dust\nDebye length. Instead of propagating in the vertical direction, the DAWs are\nfound to propagate obliquely in presence of the floating object (kept either\nvertically or horizontally). In addition, horizontally aligned floating object\ngives rise to form a wave structure in the cone shaped dust cloud in the sheath\nregion. The change in the propagation characteristics of DAWs are explained on\nthe basis of modified potential (or electric field) distribution, which is a\nconsequence of coupling of sheaths formed around the cylindrical object and the\ncathode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2016 11:59:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

Matsumura and T.\nNishida in [23] in the case p = 2 and d = 3, for solutions with high Sobolev\nregularity. Our method relies on refined time weighted inequalities in the\nFourier space, and is likely to be effective for other hyperbolic/parabolic\nsystems that are encountered in fluid mechanics or mathematical physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2016 13:12:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

Interestingly,\nthe computational complexity of the minimum vertex covering problem in graphs\nis closely related to the core percolation problem, where the core is a special\nsubgraph obtained by the greedy leaf removal procedure. Here, by generalizing\nthe greedy leaf removal procedure in graphs to hypergraphs, we introduce two\ngeneralizations of core percolation in graphs to hypergraphs, related to the\nminimum hyperedge cover problem and the minimum vertex cover problem on\nhypergraphs, respectively. We offer analytical solutions of these two core\npercolations for random hypergraphs with arbitrary vertex degree and hyperedge\ncardinality distributions.

In this work, we develop a\nperturbation theory of DMRG (PT-DMRG) to largely increase its accuracy in an\nextremely simple and efficient way. By using the canonical matrix product state\n(MPS) representation for the ground state of the considered system, a set of\northogonal basis functions $\\left\\lbrace | \\psi_i \\rangle \\right\\rbrace$ is\nintroduced to describe the perturbations to the ground state obtained by the\nconventional DMRG. The Schmidt numbers of the MPS that are beyond the bond\ndimension cut-off are used to define such perturbation terms. The perturbed\nHamiltonian is then defined as $\\tilde{H}_{ij}= \\langle \\psi_i | \\hat{H} |\n\\psi_j \\rangle$; its ground state permits to calculate physical observables\nwith a considerably improved accuracy as compared to the original DMRG results.\nWe benchmark the second-order perturbation theory with the help of\none-dimensional Ising chain in a transverse field and the Heisenberg chain,\nwhere the precision of DMRG is shown to be improved $\\rm O(10)$ times.\nFurthermore, for moderate length $L$ the errors of DMRG and PT-DMRG both scale\nlinearly with $L^{-1}$. The linear relation between the dimension cut-off of\nDMRG and that of PT-DMRG with the same precision shows a considerable\nimprovement of efficiency, especially for large dimension cut-off's.

For the statistical study\nreported here, we have identified events with steep (narrowband) microwave\nspectra that do not show a significant trapped component and at the same time\nshow evidence of source uniformity, which simplifies the data analysis greatly.\nInitially, we identified a subset of more than 20 radio bursts with such narrow\nspectra, having low- and high-frequency spectral indices larger than 3 in\nabsolute value. A steep low-frequency spectrum implies that the emission is\nnonthermal (for optically-thick thermal emission, the spectral index cannot be\nsteeper than 2), and the source is reasonably dense and uniform. A steep\nhigh-frequency spectrum implies that no significant electron trapping occurs;\notherwise a progressive spectral flattening would be observed. Roughly half of\nthese radio bursts have RHESSI data, which allows for detailed, joint\ndiagnostics of the source parameters and evolution. Based on an analysis of\nradio-to-X-ray spatial relationships, timing, and spectral fits, we conclude\nthat the microwave emission in these narrowband bursts originates directly from\nthe acceleration regions, which have relatively strong magnetic field, high\ndensity, and low temperature. In contrast, the thermal X-ray emission comes\nfrom a distinct loop with smaller magnetic field, lower density, but higher\ntemperature. Therefore, these flares occurred likely due to interaction between\ntwo (or more) magnetic loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2016 15:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

It is found\nthat for an InAs UTB confined in [001] orientation, uniaxial compressive strain\nin [100] or [110] orientation shrinks the band gap meanwhile reduces\n(increases) transport (transverse) effective masses. Thus it improves the ON\nstate current of both n-type and p-type UTB InAs TFETs without lowering the\nsource density of states. Applying the strain locally in the source region\nmakes further improvements by suppressing the OFF state leakage. For p-type\nTFETs, the locally strained area can be extended into the channel to form a\nquantum well, giving rise to even larger ON state current that is comparable to\nthe n-type ones. Therefore strain engineering is a promising option for\nimproving complementary circuits based on UTB III-V TFETs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2016 15:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}

The\naverage electricity reduction across these studies is 4.5%. However, 4.5% may\nbe a positively-biased estimate of the savings achievable across the entire\npopulation because all 12 studies are likely to be prone to opt-in bias hence\nnone test the effect of disaggregated feedback on the general population.\nDisaggregation may not be required to achieve these savings: Aggregate feedback\nalone drives 3% reductions; and the 4 studies which directly compared aggregate\nfeedback against disaggregated feedback found that aggregate feedback is at\nleast as effective as disaggregated feedback, possibly because web apps are\nviewed less often than in-home-displays (in the short-term, at least) and\nbecause some users do not trust fine-grained disaggregation (although this may\nbe an issue with the specific user interface studied). Disaggregated\nelectricity feedback may help a motivated sub-group of the population to save\nmore energy but fine-grained disaggregation may not be necessary to achieve\nthese energy savings. Disaggregation has many uses beyond those discussed in\nthis paper but, on the specific question of promoting energy reduction in the\ngeneral population, there is no robust evidence that current forms of\ndisaggregated energy feedback are more effective than aggregate energy\nfeedback. The effectiveness of disaggregated feedback may increase if the\ngeneral population become more energy-conscious (e.g. if energy prices rise or\nconcern about climate change deepens); or if users' trust in fine-grained\ndisaggregation improves; or if innovative new approaches or alternative\ndisaggregation strategies (e.g. disaggregating by behaviour rather than by\nappliance) out-perform existing feedback. We also discuss opportunities for new\nresearch into the effectiveness of disaggregated feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 May 2016 15:58:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 May 2016 15:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-05"}

Unmodified\nand CTAB and oleate-modified calcium carbonate nanoparticles were prepared\nusing the wet carbonation technique for paper coating. CTAB (cationic\nsurfactant) and sodium oleate (anionic surfactant) were used to modify the\nsize, morphology, and surface properties of the precipitated nanoparticles. The\nobtained particles were characterized by XRD, FT-IR spectroscopy, zeta\npotential measurements, TGA and TEM. Coating colors were formulated from the\nprepared unmodified and modified calcium carbonates and examined by creating a\nthin coating layer on reference paper. The effect of calcium carbonate particle\nsize and surface modification on paper properties, such as coating thickness,\ncoating weight, surface roughness, air permeability, brightness, whiteness,\nopacity, and hydrophobicity, were investigated and compared with GCC calcium\ncarbonate-coated papers. The obtained calcium carbonate nanoparticles are in\nthe calcite phase. The morphology of the prepared calcium carbonate\nnanoparticles is rhombohedral, and the average particle diameter is <100 nm.\nCompared to commercial GCC, the use of unmodified and CTAB- and oleate-modified\ncalcium carbonate nanoparticles in paper coating improves the properties of\npaper. The highest measured paper properties were observed for paper coated\nwith oleate-modifed nanoparticles, where an increase in smoothness (decrease in\npaper roughness) (+23%), brightness (+1.3%), whiteness (+2.8%), and opacity\n(+2.3%) and a decrease in air permeability (-26%) was obtained with 25% less\ncoat weight. The WCA at 10 min was about 112{\\deg} for the paper coated with\noleate-modified nanoparticles and 42{\\deg} for paper coated with CTAB-modified\nnanoparticles compared to 104{\\deg} for GCC-coated paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 May 2016 23:37:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}
