Hence we propose a novel online framework for error-bounded\ntrajectory compression and ageing called the Amnesic Bounded Quadrant System\n(ABQS), whose core is the Bounded Quadrant System (BQS) algorithm family that\nincludes a normal version (BQS), Fast version (FBQS), and a Progressive version\n(PBQS).

We discuss the origins and evolution of radial metallicity\ngradients in discs of spiral galaxies using an analytical chemical evolution\nmodel. We explain how radial metallicity gradients in stellar populations are\ndetermined by three factors: the radial metallicity profile of the star-forming\nISM, radial changes in the star-formation history (in particular inside-out\nformation), and radial mixing of stars. Under reasonable assumptions,\ninside-out formation steepens the negative ISM metallicity gradient, but\ncontributes positively to the stellar metallicity gradient, up to inverting the\nmetallicity profile to a positive d[Fe/H]/dR. This reconciles steep negative\nd[Fe/H]/dR in some high redshift galaxies to generally flatter gradients in\nlocal observations.\n  We discuss the evidence for inverse radial metallicity gradients (positive\nd[X/H]/dR) at high redshifts and the inverse relationship between azimuthal\nvelocity and the metallicity (positive dV_{\\phi}/d[Fe/H]) of stars for the\nMilky Way's thick disc. The former can be achieved by high central gas-loss\nrates and re-distribution processes, e.g. re-accretion of enriched material in\nconjunction with inside-out formation, and near-disc galactic fountaining. For\nthe Milky Way thick disc, we show that the positive dV_{\\phi}/d[Fe/H]\ncorrelation points to comparable timescales for inside-out formation, initial\nmetal enrichment and SNIa enrichment. We argue that the original ISM\nmetallicity gradient could be inferred with better data from the\nhigh-metallicity tail of the alpha enhanced population.

Inspired by the geometric characterization of\nstationary spacetimes in terms of standard stationary ones [24], we obtain an\nanalogous geometric characterization of when a Brinkmann spacetime is isometric\nto a standard Brinkmann spacetime.

We\nfind that to maintain non-negligible misalignment between the extended outer\ndisk and the planet's orbital plane, and to ensure coherent disk precession,\nthe disk surface density must be sufficiently large so that the self-gravity\ntorque overcomes the tidal torque from the central star. Our analysis and\nquantitative results can be used to constrain the parameters of transiting\ncircumplanetary disks that may be detected in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2016 20:34:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2016 16:46:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-18"}

A direct numerical\napproximation of such problems is prohibitively expensive as it requires\nresolving the microscopic variations over a much larger physical domain of\ninterest. The heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM) is an efficient framework\nto approximate the solutions of multiscale problems. In HMM, one assumes an\nincomplete macroscopic model which is coupled to a known but expensive\nmicroscopic model. The micromodel is solved only locally to upscale the\nparameter values which are missing in the macromodel. The resulting macroscopic\nmodel can then be solved at a cost independent of the small scales in the\nproblem.\n  In general, the accuracy of the HMM is related to how good the upscaling step\napproximates the right macroscopic quantities. The analysis of the method, that\nwe consider here, was previously addressed only in purely periodic media\nalthough the method itself is numerically shown to be applicable to more\ngeneral settings. In the present study, we consider a more realistic setting by\nassuming a locally-periodic medium where slow and fast variations are allowed\nat the same time. We then prove that HMM captures the right macroscopic\neffects. The generality of the tools and ideas in the analysis allows us to\nestablish convergence rates in a multi-dimensional setting.

EDA as a constituent-based\narchitecture is used to deploy WSNs according to energy dissipation through\ntheir constituents. This view of overall energy consumption in WSNs can be\napplied to optimising and balancing energy consumption and increasing the\nnetwork lifetime. Refer back to the architecture, we introduce a single overall\nmodel and propose a feasible formulation to express the overall energy\nconsumption of a generic wireless sensor network application in terms of its\nenergy constituents. The formulation offers a concrete expression for\nevaluating the performance of WSN application, optimising its constituents\noperations, and designing more energy-efficient applications. The ultimate aim\nis to produce an energy map architecture of a generic WSN application that\ncomprises essential and definable energy constituents and the relationships\nbetween these constituents to explore strategies for minimising the overall\nenergy consumption of the application. Later, parameters affecting energy in\nWSNs are extracted. The dependency between these parameters and the average\nenergy consumption of an application is then investigated. A few statistical\ntools are applied for parameter reduction followed by random forest regression\nto model energy consumption per delivered packet with and without parameter\nreduction to determine the reduction in accuracy due to reduction. Finally, an\nenergy-efficient dynamic topology management algorithm is proposed based on the\nEDA model and the prevalent parameters. The performance of the new topology\nmanagement algorithm, which employs Dijkstra to find energy-efficient lowest\ncost paths among nodes, is compared to similar topology management algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 00:41:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-12"}

Therefore, the\nmissing fluctuation in the total matter is imprinted on the large scale\nstructure, say the suppression of the matter power spectrum $\\Delta P/P\\approx\n-8f_{\\nu}$ at the scales $k\\gg k_{fs}$. In this paper, instead of considering\nthe linear perturbation theory, which is well understood in the presence of\nneutrino, we propose to use the cross correlation between the Rees-Sciama\neffect and weak lensing to probe the neutrino mass.

In contrast to other popular 2D semiconductors (e.g.\ntransition metal dichalcogenides MX2) for which defects typically induce\nharmful traps, we show that the electronic activities of defects in 2D\nperovskites are significantly tunable. For example, even with a fixed lattice\norientation, one can change the synthesis conditions to convert a line defect\n(edge or grain boundary) from electron acceptor to inactive site without deep\ngap states. We show that this difference originates from the enhanced ionic\nbonding in these perovskites compared with MX2.

The reward is a motivation for\nmining process but also could be an incentive for attacks such as selfish\nmining. In this paper we propose a solution for one of the major problems in\nBitcoin : selfish mining or block-withholding attack. This attack is conducted\nby adversarial or selfish miners in order to either earn undue rewards or waste\nthe computational power of honest miners. Contrary to recent solutions, our\nsolution, ZeroBlock, prevents block-withholding using a technique free of\ntimestamp that can be forged. Moreover, we show that our solution is compliant\nwith nodes churn.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 07:00:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2016 09:24:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 May 2017 09:18:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-04"}

P-splines have three properties that make them very\npopular as reduced rank smoothers: i) the basis and the penalty are sparse,\nenabling efficient computation, especially for Bayesian stochastic simulation;\nii) it is possible to flexibly `mix-and-match' the order of B-spline basis and\npenalty, rather than the order of penalty controlling the order of the basis as\nin spline smoothing; iii) it is very easy to set up the B-spline basis\nfunctions and penalties. The discrete penalties are somewhat less interpretable\nin terms of function shape than the traditional derivative based spline\npenalties, but tend towards penalties proportional to traditional spline\npenalties in the limit of large basis size. However part of the point of\nP-splines is not to use a large basis size. In addition the spline basis\nfunctions arise from solving functional optimization problems involving\nderivative based penalties, so moving to discrete penalties for smoothing may\nnot always be desirable. The purpose of this note is to point out that the\nthree properties of basis-penalty sparsity, mix-and-match penalization and ease\nof setup are readily obtainable with B-splines subject to derivative based\npenalization. The penalty setup typically requires a few lines of code, rather\nthan the two lines typically required for P-splines, but this one off\ndisadvantage seems to be the only one associated with using derivative based\npenalties. As an example application, it is shown how basis-penalty sparsity\nenables efficient computation with tensor product smoothers of scattered data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 07:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-10"}

To be compliant with mobile applications further development is\nneeded. In this work, we present a compact and mobile experiment, which we\nrecently used to achieve the first inertial measurements with an atomic\naccelerometer onboard an aircraft. By integrating classical inertial sensors\ninto our apparatus, we are able to operate the atomic sensor well beyond its\nstandard operating range, corresponding to half of an interference fringe. We\nreport atom-based acceleration measurements along both the horizontal and\nvertical axes of the aircraft with one-shot sensitivities of $2.3 \\times\n10^{-4}\\,g$ over a range of $\\sim 0.1\\,g$. The same technology can be used to\ndevelop cold-atom gyroscopes, which could surpass the best optical gyroscopes\nin terms of long-term sensitivity. Our apparatus was also designed to study\nmulti-axis atom interferometry with the goal of realizing a full inertial\nmeasurement unit comprised of the three axes of acceleration and rotation.\nFinally, we present a compact and tunable laser system, which constitutes an\nessential part of any cold-atom-based sensor. The architecture of the laser is\nbased on phase modulating a single fiber-optic laser diode, and can be tuned\nover a range of 1 GHz in less than 200 $\\mu$s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 07:42:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-06"}

The purpose of this study was to develop a computer-aided diagnostic\nsystem for AD using MRI, which is based on the automatic volumetry of segmented\nbrain images and generation of three-dimensional cortical thickness images\nusing the Eulerian partial differential equation (PDE) approach. We\ninvestigated the effect of the inhomogeneity of magnetic field strength and\nstatistical noise on the accuracy of our automatic volumetry and the PDE\napproach using the simulated MR images generated from BrainWeb.

The cortical thickness obtained by the PDE method tended to\ndecrease with increasing statistical noise. When we applied our method to\nclinical data, the cortical thinning due to brain atrophy was clearly\ndemonstrated in patients with brain atrophy.

Although person re-identification research is making\nprogress, it still faces some challenges such as varying poses, illumination\nand viewpoints. For feature representation in re-identification, existing works\nusually use low-level descriptors which do not take full advantage of body\nstructure information, resulting in low representation ability.\n%discrimination. To solve this problem, this paper proposes the mid-level\nbody-structure based feature representation (BSFR) which introduces body\nstructure pyramid for codebook learning and feature pooling in the vertical\ndirection of human body. Besides, varying viewpoints in the horizontal\ndirection of human body usually causes the data missing problem, $i.e.$, the\nappearances obtained in different orientations of the identical person could\nvary significantly. To address this problem, the orientation driven bag of\nappearances (ODBoA) is proposed to utilize person orientation information\nextracted by orientation estimation technic. To properly evaluate the proposed\napproach, we introduce a new re-identification dataset (Market-1203) based on\nthe Market-1501 dataset and propose a new re-identification dataset (PKU-Reid).\nBoth datasets contain multiple images captured in different body orientations\nfor each person.

The resulting light curves and spectral sequence are\nanalyzed and modelled with hydrodynamical and analytical models, with\nparticular focus on the early emission. Results. iPTF15dtg is a slow rising SN\nIc, similar to SN 2011bm. Hydrodynamical modelling of the bolometric properties\nreveals a large ejecta mass ($\\sim$10 $M_{\\odot}$) and strong $^{56}$Ni mixing.\nThe luminous early emission can be reproduced if we account for the presence of\nan extended ($\\sim$500 R$_{\\odot}$), low-mass ($\\sim$0.045 M$_{\\odot}$)\nenvelope around the progenitor star. Alternative scenarios for the early peak,\nsuch as the interaction with a companion, a shock-breakout (SBO) cooling tail\nfrom the progenitor surface, or a magnetar-driven SBO are not favored. The\nlarge ejecta mass and the presence of H and He free extended material around\nthe star suggest that the progenitor of iPTF15dtg was a massive ($\\gtrsim$ 35\nM$_{\\odot}$) WR star suffering strong mass loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 09:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

We investigate\nthe long-term stability region of WASP-12b and HD 189733b in case of planar and\ninclined motion of these satellites and show that unlike the classical exomoons\norbiting the planet, Io-sized Trojans can be stable for the whole systems life\ntime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 10:30:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 May 2016 10:54:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

This is a well-studied topic in the literature but some of\nthe published results appear to be discordant. To address this issue we provide\nan in-depth investigation of the case $b = 0$, which is most relevant for our\napplications. Our approach is based on a new and surprisingly simple\nrepresentation of $P_{n}^{(an+\\alpha,\\,\\beta)}(1-2\\lambda^{2}),\\:a>-1$ in terms\nof two integrals.

As a consequence we prove that if\n$a\\in(\\frac{2\\lambda}{1-\\lambda},\\infty)$ then\n$\\lambda^{an}P_{n}^{(an+\\alpha,\\beta)}(1-2\\lambda^{2})$ shows exponential decay\nand we derive simple exponential upper bounds in this region.

The safety of the train traffic relies thereby on\napplication data correctness, errors inside them can cause safety issues such\nas derailments or collisions. Given the high level of safety required by such a\nsystem, its verification is a critical concern. In addition to the safety, an\ninterlocking must also ensure that availability properties, stating that no\ntrain would be stopped forever in a station, are satisfied.

However, there are two implementation issues,\nnamely the interference and backhaul issues. To resolve these issues, we\npropose a novel network architecture called the backhaul-limited cached dense\nwireless network (C-DWN), where a physical layer (PHY) caching scheme is\nemployed at the base stations (BSs) but only a fraction of the BSs have wired\npayload backhauls. The PHY caching can replace the role of wired backhauls to\nachieve both the cache-induced MIMO cooperation gain and cache-assisted\nMultihopping gain. Two fundamental questions are addressed. Can we exploit the\nPHY caching to achieve linear capacity scaling with limited payload backhauls?\nIf so, how much cache is needed? We show that the capacity of the\nbackhaul-limited C-DWN indeed scales linearly with the number of BSs if the BS\ncache size is larger than a threshold that depends on the content popularity.\nWe also quantify the throughput gain due to cache-induced MIMO cooperation over\nconventional caching schemes (which exploit purely the cached-assisted\nmultihopping). Interestingly, the minimum BS cache size needed to achieve a\nsignificant cache-induced MIMO cooperation gain is the same as that needed to\nachieve the linear capacity scaling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 12:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

An acquisition\nprotocol was designed for imaging hippocampal inner structure at 7T. It relies\non a compromise between anatomical details visibility and robustness to motion.\nIn order to reduce acquisition time and motion artifacts, the full slab\ncovering the hippocampus was split into separate slabs with lower acquisition\ntime. A robust registration approach was implemented to combine the acquired\nslabs within a final 3D-consistent high-resolution slab covering the whole\nhippocampus. Evaluation was performed on 50 subjects overall, made of three\ngroups of subjects acquired using three acquisition settings; it focused on\nthree issues: visibility of hippocampal inner structure, robustness to motion\nartifacts and registration procedure performance.RESULTS:Overall, T2-weighted\nacquisitions with interleaved slabs proved robust. Multi-slab registration\nyielded high quality datasets in 96 % of the subjects, thus compatible with\nfurther analyses of hippocampal inner structure.CONCLUSION:Multi-slab\nacquisition and registration setting is efficient for reducing acquisition time\nand consequently motion artifacts for ultra-high resolution imaging of the\ninner structure of the hippocampus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 12:38:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-10"}

These latent factors can be used to\nproduce low-dimensional visualisations of the data that emphasise age-specific\neffects once the shared effects have been accounted for. The analysis of two\ndatasets consisting of individuals born prematurely as well as healthy controls\nprovides evidence to suggest that the separation between males and females\nbecomes increasingly larger as the brain transitions from adolescence to\nadulthood.

Therefore, in the case when no graph is\navailable, graph signal processing tools cannot be used anymore. Researchers\nhave proposed approaches to infer a graph topology from observations of signals\non its nodes. Since the problem is ill-posed, these approaches make\nassumptions, such as smoothness of the signals on the graph, or sparsity\npriors. In this paper, we propose a characterization of the space of valid\ngraphs, in the sense that they can explain stationary signals. To simplify the\nexposition in this paper, we focus here on the case where signals were i.i.d.\nat some point back in time and were observed after diffusion on a graph. We\nshow that the set of graphs verifying this assumption has a strong connection\nwith the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, and forms a convex set. Along\nwith a theoretical study in which these eigenvectors are assumed to be known,\nwe consider the practical case when the observations are noisy, and\nexperimentally observe how fast the set of valid graphs converges to the set\nobtained when the exact eigenvectors are known, as the number of observations\ngrows. To illustrate how this characterization can be used for graph recovery,\nwe present two methods for selecting a particular point in this set under\nchosen criteria, namely graph simplicity and sparsity. Additionally, we\nintroduce a measure to evaluate how much a graph is adapted to signals under a\nstationarity assumption. Finally, we evaluate how state-of-the-art methods\nrelate to this framework through experiments on a dataset of temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 13:01:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2017 22:57:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 13:46:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2017 16:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

In previous pQCD predictions for Higgs boson\nhadroproduction, it has been conventional to assume that the renormalization\nscale $\\mu_r$ of the QCD coupling $\\alpha_s(\\mu_r)$ is the Higgs mass, and then\nto vary this choice over the range $1/2 m_H < \\mu_r < 2 m_H $ in order to\nestimate the theory uncertainty. However, this error estimate is only sensitive\nto the non-conformal $\\beta$ terms in the pQCD series, and thus it fails to\ncorrectly estimate the theory uncertainty in cases where pQCD series has large\nhigher order contributions, as is the case for Higgs boson hadroproduction.\nFurthermore, this \\mbox{\\it ad hoc} choice of scale and range gives pQCD\npredictions which depend on the renormalization scheme being used, in\ncontradiction to basic RG principles. In contrast, after applying the PMC, we\nobtain next-to-next-to-leading order RG resummed pQCD predictions for Higgs\nboson hadroproduction which are renormalization-scheme independent and have\nminimal sensitivity to the choice of the initial renormalization scale.

The motivation behind using two predictors is driven by the\nfact that predictors have different prediction accuracy which is directly\nrelated to the embedding capacity and quality of the stego image. The key\nfeature of the proposed algorithm lies in using two predictors without the need\nto communicate additional overhead with the stego image. Basically, the\nidentification of the predictor that is used during embedding is done through a\nset of rules. The proposed algorithm is further extended to use two and three\nbins in the prediction errors histogram in order to increase the embedding\ncapacity.

According to such\na scheme, a simple multiplication is used to superimpose one SU symbol on a\nblock of multiple PU symbols.The scope of this paper is to extend such a\nparadigm to a multicarrier CR network, where the PU employs an orthogonal\nfrequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation scheme. To improve its\nachievable data rate, besides transmitting over the subcarriers unused by the\nPU, the SU is also allowed to transmit multiple block-precoded symbols in\nparallel over the OFDM subcarriers used by the primary system. Specifically,\nthe SU convolves its block-precoded symbols with the received PU data in the\ntime-domain, which gives rise to the term convolutive superposition. An\ninformation-theoretic analysis of the proposed scheme is developed, which\nconsiders different amounts of network state information at the secondary\ntransmitter, as well as different precoding strategies for the SU. Extensive\nsimulations illustrate the merits of our analysis and designs, in comparison\nwith conventional CR schemes, by considering as performance indicators the\nergodic capacity of the considered systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 14:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-10"}

The physics of their strong stellar\nwinds is still poorly understood. In the standard model, stellar pulsations\nextend the atmosphere, allowing a wind to be driven through radiation pressure\non condensing dust particles. Here we investigate the onset of the wind, using\nnearby RGB stars drawn from the Hipparcos catalogue. We find a sharp onset of\ndust production when the star first reaches a pulsation period of 60 days. This\napproximately co-incides with the point where the star transitions to the first\novertone pulsation mode. Models of the spectral energy distributions show\nstellar mass-loss rate suddenly increases at this point, by a factor of ~10\nover the existing (chromospherically driven) wind. The dust emission is\nstrongly correlated with both pulsation period and amplitude, indicating\nstellar pulsation is the main trigger for the strong mass loss, and determines\nthe mass-loss rate. Dust emission does not strongly correlate with stellar\nluminosity, indicating radiation pressure on dust has little effect on the\nmass-loss rate. RGB stars do not normally appear to produce dust, whereas dust\nproduction by asymptotic giant branch stars appears commonplace, and is\nprobably ubiquitous above the RGB-tip luminosity. We conclude that the strong\nwind begins with a step change in mass-loss rate, and is triggered by stellar\npulsations. A second rapid mass-loss-rate enhancement is suggested when the\nstar transitions to the fundamental pulsation mode, at a period of ~300 days.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 15:23:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

In a companion paper (Part I), we systematically derived a\ntwo moment bulk cloud microphysics model for collision and coalescence in warm\nrain based on the kinetic coalescence equation (KCE) and used stochastic\napproximations to close the higher order moment terms, and do so independently\nof the collision kernel. Conservation of mass and consistency of droplet number\nconcentration of the evolving cloud properties were combined with numerical\nsimulations to reduce the parametrization problem to three key parameters.\n  Here, we constrain these three parameters based on the physics of collision\nand coalescence resulting in a \"region of validity.\" Furthermore, we\ntheoretically validate the new bulk model by deriving a subset of the \"region\nof validity\" that contains stochastic parameters that skillfully reproduces an\nexisting model based on an a priori droplet size distribution by Seifert and\nBeheng (2001). The stochastic bulk model is empirically validated against this\nmodel, and parameter values that faithfully reproduce detailed KCE results are\nidentified.\n  Furthermore, sensitivity tests indicate that the stochastically derived model\ncan be used with a time step as large as 30 seconds without significantly\ncompromising accuracy, which makes it very attractive to use in medium to long\nrange weather prediction models. These results can be explored in the future to\nselect parameters in the \"region of validity\" that are conditional on\nenvironmental conditions and the age of the cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 08:43:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jun 2016 13:54:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

We\nshow that dynamical stability, quantified via systems local response to\nexternal perturbations, coincides with the minimal internal perturbation able\nto destabilize the equilibrium. First, by reformulating a result of control\ntheory, we explain that harmonic external perturbations reflect the spectral\nsensitivity of the Jacobian matrix at the equilibrium, with respect to constant\nchanges of its coefficients. However, for this equivalence to hold, imaginary\nchanges of the Jacobian's coefficients have to be allowed. The connection with\ndynamical stability is thus lost for real dynamical systems. We show that this\nissue can be avoided, thus recovering the fundamental link between dynamical\nand structural stability, by considering stochastic noise as external and\ninternal perturbations. More precisely, we demonstrate that a system's local\nresponse to white-noise perturbations directly reflects the intensity of\ninternal white noise that it can accommodate before asymptotic mean-square\nstability of the equilibrium is lost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 09:58:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-28"}

The fundamental Gaussian\nTEM00 mode is the most common of the Gaussian modes present in various optical\ndevices, systems and equipment.

Such circular apertures include irises, spatial filters, circular\nPhoto-Detectors (PDs) and optical mounts with circular rims. The magnitude of\noptical power passing through a finite-sized circular aperture is\nwell-documented for cases where the Gaussian beam passes through the center of\nthe clear circular aperture, and is chopped off symmetrically in all radial\ndirections on a given plane. More often than not, a non-axial incident Gaussian\nBeam is not blocked in a radially uniform manner by a circular aperture. Such\nsituations arise due to a lateral displacement of the beam from tilted glass\nblocks, manufacturing errors and imperfect surface flatness or parallelness of\nsurfaces.
