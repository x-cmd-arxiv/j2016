Fundamental parameters can be derived to high\nprecision from binary modelling and provide crucial constraints for seismic\nmodelling. High-order gravity modes are sensitive to the conditions near the\nconvective core and therefore allow for a determination of parameters\ndescribing interior physics, especially the convective-core overshooting\nparameter. KIC\\,10080943 is a binary system that contains two gravity- and\npressure-mode hybrid pulsators. A detailed observational study has provided\nfundamental and seismic parameters for both components. We aim to find a model\nthat is able to predict the observed g-mode period spacings and stellar\nparameters of both components of KIC 10080943.

The masses of our best models are somewhat below\nthe values estimated from binarity, which is a consequence of the low observed\nmean g-mode period spacing. We find that the amount of core overshooting and\ndiffusive mixing can be well constrained by the equal-age requirement for the\ntwo stars, however, we find no significant difference for different shapes of\ncore overshooting. The measured rotation rates are within the limit of validity\nfor the first-order perturbation approximation. We can find a good fit by using\nthe traditional approximation for the pulsations, when taking slightly younger\nmodels with a higher asymptotic period spacing.

Active transport is most beneficial when trafficking occurs\nover large distances, for instance up to the order of 1 metre in neurons. Here\nwe explain how intermittent active transport allows for faster equilibration\nupon a change in concentration triggered by biochemical stimuli. Moreover, we\nshow how intermittent active excursions induce qualitative changes in the noise\nin effectively one-dimensional systems such as dendrites. Thereby they allow\nfor significantly improved signalling precision in the sense of a smaller\nrelative deviation in the concentration read-out by the receptor.

The low radiation pressure from the M-dwarf host\nstar was shown to play a major role in the dynamics of the escaping gas. Yet by\nitself it cannot explain the time-variable spectral features detected in each\ntransit. Here we investigate the combined role of radiative braking and stellar\nwind interactions using numerical simulations with the EVaporating Exoplanet\ncode (EVE) and we derive atmospheric and stellar properties through the direct\ncomparison of simulated and observed spectra. Our simulations match the last\ntwo epochs well. The observed sharp early ingresses come from the abrasion of\nthe planetary coma by the stellar wind. Spectra observed during the transit can\nbe produced by a dual exosphere of planetary neutrals (escaped from the upper\natmosphere of the planet) and neutralized protons (created by charge-exchange\nwith the stellar wind). We find similar properties at both epochs for the\nplanetary escape rate (2.5x10$^{8}$ g/s), the stellar photoionization rate\n(2x10$^{-5}$ /s), the stellar wind bulk velocity (85 km/s), and its kinetic\ndispersion velocity (10 km/s). We find high velocities for the escaping gas\n(50-60 km/s) that may indicate MHD waves that dissipate in the upper atmosphere\nand drive the planetary outflow. In the last epoch the high density of the\nstellar wind (3x10$^{3}$ /cm3) led to the formation of an exospheric tail\nmainly composed of neutralized protons.

The\nasymptotic procedure leads to a great reduction in complexity for the numerical\nsolution since it involves solving only the exterior boundary value problem.\nFurthermore we introduce a new fem/bem coupling procedure for the transmission\nproblem and consider the implementation of the Galerkin elements for the\nperfect conductor problem and present numerical experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 17:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-26"}

We use the red clump stars selected spectroscopically from\nAPOGEE (APO Galactic Evolution Experiment), with known distances and radial\nvelocities, to measure the radial component of the Galactocentric velocities\nwithin 5 kpc$<R<$16 kpc, $|b|<5^\\circ$ and within 20 degrees from the\nSun-Galactic center line. The average Galactocentric radial velocity is\n$V_R=(1.48\\pm 0.35)[R({\\rm kpc})-(8.8\\pm 2.7)]$ km/s outwards in the explored\nrange, with a higher contribution from stars below the Galactic plane. Two\npossible explanations can be given for this result: i) the mean orbit of the\ndisk stars is intrinsically elliptical with a Galactocentric radial gradient of\neccentricity around 0.01 kpc$^{-1}$; or ii) there is a net secular expansion of\nthe disk, in which stars within $R\\approx 9-11$ kpc are migrating to the region\n$R\\gtrsim 11$ kpc at the rate of $\\sim 2$ M$_\\odot $/yr, and stars with\n$R\\lesssim 9$ kpc are falling toward the center of the Galaxy.

In the gravity-driven shear flow, size segregation is triggered by\nthe percolation of small particles through the opened voids (kinetic sieving),\nand large particles are accumulated in the upper layer. One hypothesis for the\nupward migration of large particles is the squeeze expulsion mechanism, which\nremains yet ambiguous due to limited evidences from either physical or\nnumerical experiments. Here we show statistically how the percolation of small\nparticles facilitates the upward movement of large particles. We found that in\nlarge particles, the mechanical anisotropy (strong force network) coincides\nwith the geometric anisotropy (contact network), which indicates squeeze, and\nthe connectivity of large particles is much higher when they are squeezed\nthrough small particles. The presence of small particles filling the voids\nhinders the downward movements and provides dynamic steps for the climbing\nlarge particles.

It sequentially\ncancels out the known interferences at each node so that wireless multi-hop\ntransmission can achieve a similar throughput as single-hop transmission.\nExisting work on E2E-KIC assumed that the interference of a transmitter to\nthose nodes outside the transmitter's communication range is negligible. In\npractice, however, this assumption is not always valid. There are many cases\nwhere a transmitter causes notable interference to nodes beyond its\ncommunication distance. From a wireless networking perspective, such\ninterference is caused by a node to other nodes that are multiple hops away,\nthus we call it multi-hop interference. The presence of multi-hop interference\nposes fundamental challenges to E2E-KIC, where known procedures cannot be\ndirectly applied. In this paper, we propose an E2E-KIC approach which allows\nthe existence of multi-hop interference. In particular, we present a method\nthat iteratively cancels unknown interferences transmitted across multiple\nhops. We analyze mathematically why and when this approach works and the\nperformance of it.

The large redshift differences of\n~1000 km/s, on average, between the BOSS-pipeline and HeII-centroid redshifts\nsuggest there are significant biases in a portion of BOSS quasar redshift\nmeasurements. Adopting the HeII-based redshifts shows that CIV does not exhibit\na ubiquitous blueshift for all quasars, given the precision probed by our\nmeasurements.

We oppose this opinion\nand show that two main factors are responsible for the extremely low intensity\nof the observed stellar EBL: (1) a low mean surface brightness of galaxies,\nwhich causes a low luminosity density in the local Universe, and (2) light\nextinction due to absorption by galactic and intergalactic dust. Dust produces\na partial opacity of galaxies and of the Universe. The galactic opacity reduces\nthe intensity of light from more distant background galaxies obscured by\nforeground galaxies. The effective extinction AV for light passing through a\ngalaxy is 0.2 mag. This causes that distant background galaxies do not\ncontribute to the EBL significantly. In addition, light of distant galaxies is\ndimmed due to absorption by intergalactic dust. Even a minute intergalactic\nopacity of 1x10^(-2) mag per Gpc is high enough to produce significant effects\non the EBL. The absorbed starlight heats up the galactic and intergalactic dust\nand is further re-radiated at the IR, FIR and micro-wave spectrum. Assuming\nstatic infinite universe with no galactic and intergalactic dust, the stellar\nEBL should be as high as the surface brightness of stars. However, if dust is\nconsidered, the predicted stellar EBL is about 290 nWm^(-2)sr^(-1), which is\nonly 5 times higher than the observed value. Hence, the presence of dust has\nhigher impact on the EBL than currently assumed. In the expanding universe, the\ncalculated value of the EBL is further decreased, because the obscuration\neffect and intergalactic absorption become more pronounced at high redshifts\nwhen the matter was concentrated at smaller volume than at present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 21:43:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-27"}

In this paper, we\npresent a weakly supervised approach to automatically obtain spatio-temporal\nannotations of an actor in action videos. We first obtain a large number of\naction proposals in each video. To capture a few most representative action\nproposals in each video and evade processing thousands of them, we rank them\nusing optical flow and saliency in a 3D-MRF based framework and select a few\nproposals using MAP based proposal subset selection method. We demonstrate that\nthis ranking preserves the high quality action proposals. Several such\nproposals are generated for each video of the same action.

The overtaken solar wind forms a sheath of\ncompressed plasma at the front of ICMEs. Magnetic clouds (MCs) are a subset of\nICMEs with specific properties (e.g. the presence of a flux rope). When ICMEs\npass near Earth, ground observations indicate that the flux of galactic cosmic\nrays (GCRs) decreases. The main aims of this paper are to find: common plasma\nand magnetic properties of different ICME sub-structures, and which ICME\nproperties affect the flux of GCRs near Earth. We use a superposed epoch method\napplied to a large set of ICMEs observed \\insitu\\ by the spacecraft ACE,\nbetween 1998 and 2006. We also apply a superposed epoch analysis on GCRs time\nseries observed with the McMurdo neutron monitors. We find that slow MCs at 1\nAU have on average more massive sheaths. We conclude that it is because they\nare more effectively slowed down by drag during their travel from the Sun. Slow\nMCs also have a more symmetric magnetic field and sheaths expanding similarly\nas their following MC, while in contrast, fast MCs have an asymmetric magnetic\nprofile and a compressing sheath in compression. In all types of MCs, we find\nthat the proton density and the temperature, as well as the magnetic\nfluctuations can diffuse within the front of the MC due to 3D reconnection.\nFinally, we derive a quantitative model which describes the decrease of cosmic\nrays as a function of the amount of magnetic fluctuations and field strength.\nThe obtained typical profiles of sheath/MC/GCR properties corresponding to\nslow, mid, and fast ICMEs, can be used for forecasting/modelling these events,\nand to better understand the transport of energetic particles in ICMEs. They\nare also useful for improving future operative space weather activities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2016 03:01:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2016 21:37:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-10"}

For the other two CT candidates, the non-detection of the\nline could be because of the low number of counts in their X-ray spectra, but\ntheir location in the L$_{\\rm 2-10\\,keV}$/L$_{12\\mu m}$ plot supports their CT\nclassification. Although a higher number of CT sources could be hidden among\nthe X-ray undetected DOGs, our results indicate that DOGs could be as well\ncomposed of only a fraction of CT AGN plus a number of moderate to highly\nabsorbed AGN, as previously suggested. From our study of the X-ray undetected\nDOGs in the CDF-S, we estimate a percentage between 13 and 44% of CT AGN among\nthe whole population of DOGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2016 08:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-10"}

The main focus is on the\nconcept of centrality, which is used to investigate the embeddedness of firms\nfrom a particular country within the global network. The study results in three\ncontributions. First, to the best of our knowledge for the first time we can\ninvestigate the topology as well as the concept of centrality in corporate\nnetworks at a global scale, allowing for the largest cross-country comparison\never done in interlocking directorates literature. We demonstrate, amongst\nother things, extremely similar network topologies, yet large differences\nbetween countries when it comes to the relation between economic prominence\nindicators and firm centrality. Second, we introduce two new metrics that are\nspecifically suitable for comparing the centrality ranking of a partition to\nthat of the full network. Using the notion of centrality persistence we propose\nto measure the persistence of a partition's centrality ranking in the full\nnetwork. In the board interlock network, it allows us to assess the extent to\nwhich the footprint of a national network is still present within the global\nnetwork. Next, the measure of centrality ranking dominance tells us whether a\npartition (country) is more dominant at the top or the bottom of the centrality\nranking of the full (global) network. Finally, comparing these two new measures\nof persistence and dominance between different countries allows us to classify\nthese countries based the their embeddedness, measured using the relation\nbetween the centrality of a country's firms on the national and the global\nscale of the board interlock network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2016 09:03:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-27"}

In a plane-wave framework with periodic boundary\nconditions, this coupling is affected by the spurious interaction between the\n2D material and its periodic images.

This situation naturally leads us to\nconsider the case where all the dangerous soft supersymmetry breaking terms\nsuch as the scalar masses and scalar couplings are absent, while only the\nunified gaugino mass term and the mu term are non-vanishing at the grand\nunification scale. We revisit this simple situation taking into account the\nobserved Higgs boson mass, 125 GeV. Since the gaugino mass and the mu term are\nfixed in order to explain the Higgs boson and the Z boson masses, there is no\nfree parameter left in this scenario. We find that there are three independent\nparameter sets exist including ones which have not been discussed in the\nliterature. We also find that the abundance of the dark matter can be explained\nby relic gravitinos which are non-thermally produced as decay products of the\nSUSY particles while satisfying constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We\ndiscuss the effects of the gravity mediation which generically give\ncontribution to the soft terms of the order of the gravitino mass.

Here we show instead that it is\npossible to correctly classify a signal even if it does not contain any\npredictive information about the decision. We first define a simple stochastic\nmodel that mimics the random decision process between two equivalent\nalternatives, and generate a large number of independent trials that contain no\nchoice-predictive information. The trials are first time-locked to the time\npoint of the final event and then classified using standard machine-learning\ntechniques. The resulting classification accuracy is above chance level long\nbefore the time point of time-locking. We then analyze the same trials using\ninformation theory. We demonstrate that the high classification accuracy is a\nconsequence of time-locking and that its time behavior is simply related to the\nlarge relaxation time of the process. We conclude that when time-locking is a\ncrucial step in the analysis of neural activity patterns, both the emergence\nand the timing of the classification accuracy are affected by structural\nproperties of the network that generates the signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2016 11:17:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jun 2016 12:23:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-21"}

The recent\nproposed set of Gaia FGK benchmark stars of Heiter et al. (2015) has no\nrecommended stars within the critical metallicity range of $-2.0 <$ [Fe/H] $<\n-1.0$ dex. In this paper, we aim to add candidate Gaia benchmark stars inside\nof this metal-poor gap.

The procedure used to determine the stellar\nparameters was similar to Heiter et al. (2015) and Jofre et al. (2014) for\nconsistency. The effective temperature (T$_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) of all candidate\nstars was determined using the Infrared Flux Method utilizing multi-band\nphotometry. The surface gravity (log g) was determined through fitting stellar\nevolutionary tracks. The [Fe/H] was determined using four different\nspectroscopic methods fixing the T$_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and log g from the values\ndetermined independent of spectroscopy. We discuss, star-by-star, the quality\nof each parameter including how it compares to literature, how it compares to a\nspectroscopic run where all parameters are free, and whether Fe I\nionisation-excitation balance is achieved.

These\nstars can be used for calibration and validation purpose of stellar parameter\nand abundance pipelines and should be of highest priority for future\ninterferometric studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2016 11:20:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-03"}

We evaluate the\napplicability of 1D climate models to estimate the potential habitability of\nEarth-like exoplanets by comparing our 1D model results to those of 3D climate\nstudies in the literature. We applied a cloud-free 1D radiative-convective\nclimate model to calculate the climate of Earth-like planets around different\ntypes of main-sequence stars with varying surface albedo and relative humidity\nprofile. These parameters depend on climate feedbacks that are not treated\nself-consistently in most 1D models. We compared the results to those of 3D\nmodel calculations in the literature and investigated to what extent the 1D\nmodel can approximate the surface temperatures calculated by the 3D models. The\n1D parameter study results in a large range of climates possible for an\nEarth-sized planet with an Earth-like atmosphere and water reservoir at a\ncertain stellar insolation. At some stellar insolations the full spectrum of\nclimate states could be realized, i.e., uninhabitable conditions as well as\nhabitable surface conditions, depending only on the relative humidity and\nsurface albedo assumed. When treating the surface albedo and the relative\nhumidity profile as parameters in 1D model studies and using the habitability\nconstraints found by recent 3D modeling studies, the same conclusions about the\npotential habitability of a planet can be drawn as from 3D model calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2016 11:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

We\nargue that the spectral evolution of the ULX can be explained by\nsuper-Eddington accretion models, where in this case we view the ULX down the\nevacuated funnel along its rotation axis, bounded by its massive radiatively\ndriven wind. The spectral changes then originate in enhanced geometric beaming\nas the accretion rate increases and wind funnel narrows, causing the scattered\nflux from the central regions of the supercritical flow to brighten faster than\nthe isotropic thermal emission from the wind, and so the curved hard spectral\ncomponent to dominate at the highest luminosities. The wind also Compton\ndown-scatters photons at the edge of the funnel, resulting in the peak energy\nof the spectrum decreasing. We also confirm that Holmberg IX X-1 displays\nspectral degeneracy with luminosity, and suggest that the observed differences\nare naturally explained by precession of the black hole rotation axis for the\nsuggested wind geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2016 12:05:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

Three asymptotic\nregimes are distinguished as t tends to infinity, the first being a regime\nahead of the propagating disturbance that is dominated by the linearised\nequation. The analysis of this leads to the determination of the speed of the\nleading edge of the propagating disturbance and implies that in the second,\ntransition, regime the solution takes the form of a modulated travelling wave.\nIn a third regime the solution approaches a nearly periodic steady state, where\nthe period is obtained on matching with the modulated travelling wave. Detailed\nanalysis of this pattern is also presented. The analysis is completed by\ncontrasting the formal asymptotic description of the solution with numerical\ncomputations. It is assumed for the above analysis that the initial disturbance\ndecays faster than an exponential rate; in this case a critical exponential\ndecay rate at the leading edge of the front and propagation speed are found.

This problem is known to be\n\\emph{NP-hard} in general. We prove that as soon as the number of equations is\non the order of the number of unknowns, TAF recovers the solution exactly (up\nto a global unimodular constant) with high probability and complexity growing\nlinearly with both the number of unknowns and the number of equations. Our TAF\napproach adopts the \\emph{amplitude-based} empirical loss function, and\nproceeds in two stages. In the first stage, we introduce an\n\\emph{orthogonality-promoting} initialization that can be obtained with a few\npower iterations. Stage two refines the initial estimate by successive updates\nof scalable \\emph{truncated generalized gradient iterations}, which are able to\nhandle the rather challenging nonconvex and nonsmooth amplitude-based objective\nfunction. In particular, when vectors $\\bm{x}$ and $\\bm{a}_i$'s are\nreal-valued, our gradient truncation rule provably eliminates erroneously\nestimated signs with high probability to markedly improve upon its untruncated\nversion. Numerical tests using synthetic data and real images demonstrate that\nour initialization returns more accurate and robust estimates relative to\nspectral initializations. Furthermore, even under the same initialization, the\nproposed amplitude-based refinement outperforms existing Wirtinger flow\nvariants, corroborating the superior performance of TAF over state-of-the-art\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2016 13:57:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jul 2016 20:19:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2016 23:40:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 16 Oct 2016 19:02:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 20 Aug 2017 20:55:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-22"}

These observations contradict both assumptions\nand predictions of the highly successful Core Accretion model of planet\nformation. Here we explore predictions of the alternative Tidal Downsizing (TD)\nscenario of planet formation. In TD, small planets and planetesimal debris is\nmade only when gas fragments, predecessors of giant planets, are tidally\ndisrupted.

A detected gas giant planet implies in TD that its\npredecessor fragment was not disputed, potentially explaining why DDs are less\nlikely to be found around stars with gas giants.

Partial attempts to extend this calculation for a\nthermal electron plasma in the relativistic regime have been done but cannot be\napplied to a general relativistic electron distribution. Here we derive a\ngeneral form of the SZ effect polarization valid in the full relativistic\napproach for both thermal and non-thermal electron plasmas, as well as for a\ngeneric combination of various electron population co-spatially distributed in\nthe environments of galaxy clusters or radiogalaxy lobes.

We found that the CMB quadrupole\ninduced Stoke parameter Q is always positive with a maximum amplitude at 216\nGHz which increases slightly with increasing cluster temperature. The CMB\noctupole induced Q spectrum shows, instead, a cross-over frequency which\ndepends on the cluster electron temperature, or on the minimum momentum p_1 as\nwell as on the power-law spectral index of a non-thermal electron population.\nWe discuss some possibilities to disentangle the quadrupole-induced Q spectrum\nfrom the octupole-induced one which allow to measure these quantities through\nthe SZ effect polarization.

We use controlled simulations of\nthe previrialization stage of galaxy groups to show that multiple collisionless\nmerging is capable of creating realistic first-ranked galaxies. Our mock\nremnants define a thin FP that perfectly fits data from all kinds of giant ETGs\nin the local volume, showing the existence of a unified relationship for these\nsystems. High-ranked galaxies occupy in the FP different areas than standard\nobjects, a segregation which is viewed essentially as zero-point offsets in the\n2D correlations arising from standard projections of this plane. Our findings\nmake a strong case for considering hierarchical dissipationless merging a\nviable route for the formation of the largest galaxies in the universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 May 2016 15:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}
