In\nmany empirical situations, however, modeling simultaneously two or more\nresponses conditional on some covariates can be of considerable relevance. In\nthis article, we extend the scope of GAMLSS by introducing a bivariate copula\nadditive model with continuous margins for location, scale and shape. The\nframework permits the copula dependence and marginal distribution parameters to\nbe estimated simultaneously and, like in GAMLSS, each parameter to be modeled\nusing an additive predictor. Parameter estimation is achieved within a\npenalized likelihood framework using a trust region algorithm with integrated\nautomatic multiple smoothing parameter selection. The proposed approach allows\nfor straightforward inclusion of potentially any parametric continuous marginal\ndistribution and copula function. The models can be easily used via the\ncopulaReg() function in the R package SemiParBIVProbit.

While many attack vectors have already been uncovered,\none important vector has been left out though: attacking the currency via the\nInternet routing infrastructure itself. Indeed, by manipulating routing\nadvertisements (BGP hijacks) or by naturally intercepting traffic, Autonomous\nSystems (ASes) can intercept and manipulate a large fraction of Bitcoin\ntraffic.\n  This paper presents the first taxonomy of routing attacks and their impact on\nBitcoin, considering both small-scale attacks, targeting individual nodes, and\nlarge-scale attacks, targeting the network as a whole. While challenging, we\nshow that two key properties make routing attacks practical: (i) the efficiency\nof routing manipulation; and (ii) the significant centralization of Bitcoin in\nterms of mining and routing. Specifically, we find that any network attacker\ncan hijack few (<100) BGP prefixes to isolate ~50% of the mining power---even\nwhen considering that mining pools are heavily multi-homed. We also show that\non-path network attackers can considerably slow down block propagation by\ninterfering with few key Bitcoin messages.\n  We demonstrate the feasibility of each attack against the deployed Bitcoin\nsoftware. We also quantify their effectiveness on the current Bitcoin topology\nusing data collected from a Bitcoin supernode combined with BGP routing data.\n  The potential damage to Bitcoin is worrying. By isolating parts of the\nnetwork or delaying block propagation, attackers can cause a significant amount\nof mining power to be wasted, leading to revenue losses and enabling a wide\nrange of exploits such as double spending. To prevent such effects in practice,\nwe provide both short and long-term countermeasures, some of which can be\ndeployed immediately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 16:08:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2017 19:25:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-28"}

These\nequilibrated data however do not contain much useful information about the\ndynamics which lead to equilibration. To illuminate the dynamics, special\nHamiltonians can be chosen which contain large energy barriers. In this paper\nwe generalize this approach by considering a class of Hamiltonians which map\nclusters of spin-like qubits into 'superspins', thereby creating an energy\nlandscape where local minima are separated by large energy barriers. These\nlarge energy barriers allow us to observe signatures of the transverse field\nfrozen. To study these systems, we assume that the these frozen spins are\ndescribes by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism which was originally developed to\ndescribe formation of topological defects in the early universe. It was soon\nrealized that it also has applications in analogous superconductor systems and\nlater realized to also be important for the transverse field Ising model . We\ndemonstrate that these barriers block equilibration and yield a non-trivial\ndistribution of qubit states in a regime where quantum effects are expected to\nbe strong, suggesting that these data should contain signatures of whether the\ndynamics are fundamentally classical or quantum. We exhaustively study a class\nof 3x3 square lattice superspin Hamiltonians and compare the experimental\nresults with those obtained by exact diagonalisation. We find that the best fit\nto the data occurs at finite transverse field. We further demonstrate that\nunder the right conditions, the superspins can be relaxed to equilibrium,\nerasing the signature of the transverse field.

Most\ndemonstrations of this concept have directly limited the microscopic particle\nvalence via anisotropic (patchy) attractions; however, an alternative\nmacroscopic valence limitation would be desirable for greater experimental\ntunability and responsiveness. One possibility, explored in this paper, is to\nemploy primary particles with attractions mediated via a secondary species of\nlinking particles. In such a system, the linker-to-primary particle ratio\nserves as a macroscopic control parameter for the average microscopic valence.\nWe show that the phase behavior of such a system predicted by Wertheim's first\norder perturbation theory is consistent with equilibrium gel formation: the\nprimary particle concentrations corresponding to the two-phase demixing\ntransition are significantly suppressed at both low and high linker-to-primary\nparticle ratios. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations validate these\ntheoretical predictions but also reveal the presence of loops of bonded\nparticles, which are neglected in the theory.

A plausible\nexplanation is that methane could have been produced either by hydrothermal\nalteration of basaltic crust or by serpentinization of ultramafic rocks\nproducing hydrogen and reducing crustal carbon into methane. Once formed,\nmethane storage on Mars is commonly associated with the presence of hidden\nclathrate reservoirs. Here, we alternatively suggest that chabazite and\nclinoptilolite, which belong to the family of zeolites, may form a plausible\nstorage reservoir of methane in the martian subsurface. Because of the\nexistence of many volcanic terrains, zeolites are expected to be widespread on\nMars and their Global Equivalent Layer may range up to more than $\\sim$1 km,\naccording to the most optimistic estimates. If the martian methane present in\nchabazite and clinoptilolite is directly sourced from an abiotic source in the\nsubsurface, the destabilization of a localized layer of a few millimeters per\nyear may be sufficient to explain the current observations. The sporadic\nrelease of methane from these zeolites requires that they also remained\nisolated from the atmosphere during its evolution. The methane release over the\nages could be due to several mechanisms such as impacts, seismic activity or\nerosion. If the methane outgassing from excavated chabazite and/or\nclinoptilolite prevails on Mars, then the presence of these zeolites around\nGale Crater could explain the variation of methane level observed by Mars\nScience Laboratory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 18:36:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

However, its detection requires a thorough\nunderstanding and control of the systematic errors. We study two systematic\nbiases observed in the LOFAR EoR residual data after calibration and\nsubtraction of bright discrete foreground sources. The first effect is a\nsuppression in the diffuse foregrounds, which could potentially mean a\nsuppression of the 21 cm signal. The second effect is an excess of noise beyond\nthe thermal noise. The excess noise shows fluctuations on small frequency\nscales, and hence it can not be easily removed by foreground removal or\navoidance methods. Our analysis suggests that sidelobes of residual sources due\nto the chromatic point spread function and ionospheric scintillation can not be\nthe dominant causes of the excess noise. Rather, both the suppression of\ndiffuse foregrounds and the excess noise can occur due to calibration with an\nincomplete sky model containing predominantly bright discrete sources.

In this context,\nthe impact of channel aging, which severely affects the performance, is\ninvestigated herein by considering a generalized model. Specifically, we show\nthat both Doppler shift because of the users' relative movement as well as\nphase noise due to noisy local oscillators (LOs) contribute to channel aging.\nTo this end, we first propose a joint model, encompassing both effects, in\norder to investigate the performance of a massive MIMO system based on the\ninevitable time-varying nature of realistic mobile communications.

The most characteristic symptom of malaria is fever. The\nfraction of fevers that are attributable to malaria, the malaria attributable\nfever fraction (MAFF), is an important public health measure for assessing the\neffect of malaria control programs and other purposes. Estimating the MAFF is\nnot straightforward because there is no gold standard diagnosis of a malaria\nattributable fever; an individual can have malaria parasites in her blood and a\nfever, but the individual may have developed partial immunity that allows her\nto tolerate the parasites and the fever is being caused by another infection.\nWe define the MAFF using the potential outcome framework for causal inference\nand show what assumptions underlie current estimation methods. Current\nestimation methods rely on an assumption that the parasite density is correctly\nmeasured. However, this assumption does not generally hold because (i) fever\nkills some parasites and (ii) the measurement of parasite density has\nmeasurement error. In the presence of these problems, we show current\nestimation methods do not perform well. We propose a novel maximum likelihood\nestimation method based on exponential family g-modeling. Under the assumption\nthat the measurement error mechanism and the magnitude of the fever killing\neffect are known, we show that our proposed method provides approximately\nunbiased estimates of the MAFF in simulation studies. A sensitivity analysis\ncan be used to assess the impact of different magnitudes of fever killing and\ndifferent measurement error mechanisms.

We provide an overview of key metasurface concepts such as anomalous\nreflection and refraction, and introduce metasurfaces based on the\nPancharatnam-Berry phase and Huygens' metasurfaces, as well as their use in\nwavefront shaping and beam forming applications, followed by a discussion of\npolarization conversion in few-layer metasurfaces and their related properties.\nAn overview of dielectric metasurfaces reveals their ability to realize unique\nfunctionalities coupled with Mie resonances and their low ohmic losses. We also\ndescribe metasurfaces for wave guidance and radiation control, as well as\nactive and nonlinear metasurfaces. Finally, we conclude by providing our\nopinions of opportunities and challenges in this rapidly developing research\nfield.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 22:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-29"}

However, their use of large receptive fields and many pooling\nlayers cause low spatial resolution inside the deep layers. This leads to\npredictions with poor localization around the boundaries. Prior work has\nattempted to address this issue by post-processing predictions with CRFs or\nMRFs. But such models often fail to capture semantic relationships between\nobjects, which causes spatially disjoint predictions. To overcome these\nproblems, recent methods integrated CRFs or MRFs into an FCN framework. The\ndownside of these new models is that they have much higher complexity than\ntraditional FCNs, which renders training and testing more challenging.\n  In this work we introduce a simple, yet effective Convolutional Random Walk\nNetwork (RWN) that addresses the issues of poor boundary localization and\nspatially fragmented predictions with very little increase in model complexity.\nOur proposed RWN jointly optimizes the objectives of pixelwise affinity and\nsemantic segmentation. It combines these two objectives via a novel random walk\nlayer that enforces consistent spatial grouping in the deep layers of the\nnetwork. Our RWN is implemented using standard convolution and matrix\nmultiplication. This allows an easy integration into existing FCN frameworks\nand it enables end-to-end training of the whole network via standard\nback-propagation. Our implementation of RWN requires just $131$ additional\nparameters compared to the traditional FCNs, and yet it consistently produces\nan improvement over the FCNs on semantic segmentation and scene labeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 23:00:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 16:10:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 17:49:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-09"}

Comprehensive climate models\nhave struggled to reproduce this, typically simulating a slower rate of sea ice\nretreat than has been observed. However, this bias has been widely noted to\nhave decreased in models participating in the most recent phase of the Coupled\nModel Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) compared with the previous generation of\nmodels (CMIP3). Here we examine simulations from both CMIP3 and CMIP5. We find\nthat simulated historical sea ice trends are influenced by volcanic forcing,\nwhich was included in all of the CMIP5 models but in only about half of the\nCMIP3 models. The volcanic forcing causes temporary simulated cooling in the\n1980s and 1990s, which contributes to raising the simulated 1979-2013\nglobal-mean surface temperature trends to values substantially larger than\nobserved. We show that this warming bias is accompanied by an enhanced rate of\nArctic sea ice retreat and hence a simulated sea ice trend that is closer to\nthe observed value, which is consistent with previous findings of an\napproximately linear relationship between sea ice extent and global-mean\nsurface temperature. We find that both generations of climate models simulate\nArctic sea ice that is substantially less sensitive to global warming than has\nbeen observed.

To remedy these problems, we develop a deep\narchitecture to learn aesthetically-relevant visual attributes from Flickr1,\nwhich are localized by multiple textual attributes in a weakly-supervised\nsetting.

Several test calculations for elastic dynamics are\nperformed, and the accuracy and versatility of the present method are shown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 01:52:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 May 2016 02:52:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 09:17:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

Most hot stars rapidly rotate\naround their stellar axes. The stellar rotation makes ellipticity and\ngravity-darkening effects which break the spherical symmetry of the source\nshape and the circular symmetry of the source surface brightness respectively.\nHence, it causes a net polarization signal for the source star. This\npolarization signal should be considered in polarimetry microlensing of fast\nrotating stars. For moderate rotating stars, lensing can magnify or even\ncharacterize small polarization signals due to the stellar rotation through\npolarimetry observations. The gravity-darkening effect due to a rotating source\nstar makes asymmetric perturbations in polarimetry and photometry microlensing\ncurves whose maximum happens when the lens trajectory crosses the projected\nposition of the rotation pole on the sky plane. The stellar ellipticity makes a\ntime shift (i) in the position of the second peak of the polarimetry curves in\ntransit microlensing events and (ii) in the peak position of the polarimetry\ncurves with respect to the photometry peak position in bypass microlensing\nevents. By measuring this time shift via polarimetry observations of\nmicrolensing events, we can evaluate the ellipticity of the projected source\nsurface on the sky plane. Given the characterizations of the FOcal Reducer and\nlow dispersion Spectrograph (FORS2) polarimeter at Very Large Telescope (VLT)\ntelescope, the probability of observing this time shift is so small. The more\naccurate polarimeters of the next generation may likely measure these time\nshifts and evaluate the ellipticity of microlensing source stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 06:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

Although research focus is normally upon the\nscaling of energies, insights can also be gained from energy densities. We\nvisualize the scaling of the positive-definite kinetic energy density (KED) in\nclosed-shell atoms, in comparison to invariant quantities based upon the\ngradient and Laplacian of the density. We notice a striking fit of the KED\nwithin the core of any atom to a gradient expansion using both the gradient and\nthe Laplacian, appearing as an asymptotic limit around which the KED\noscillates. The gradient expansion is qualitatively different from that derived\nfrom first principles for a slowly-varying electron gas and is correlated with\na nonzero Pauli contribution to the KED near the nucleus.

Energetic processing\nof the a-C:H particles leads to the dissociation of the C-H bonds and the\nformation of hydrogen molecules and small hydrocarbons. Photo-produced H2\nmolecules in the bulk of the dust particles can diffuse out to the gas phase\nand contribute to the total H2 abundance. We have simulated this process in the\nlaboratory with plasma-produced a-C:H and a-C:D analogs under astrophysically\nrelevant conditions to investigate the dependence of the diffusion as a\nfunction of temperature. Plasma-produced a-C:H analogs were UV-irradiated using\na microwave-discharged hydrogen flow lamp. Molecules diffusing to the gas-phase\nwere detected by a quadrupole mass spectrometer, providing a measurement of the\noutgoing H2 or D2 flux. By comparing the experimental measurements with the\nexpected flux from a one-dimensional diffusion model, a diffusion coefficient D\ncould be derived for experiments carried out at different temperatures.\nDependance on the diffusion coefficient D with the temperature followed an\nArrhenius-type equation. The activation energy for the diffusion process was\nestimated (ED(H2)=1660+-110 K, ED(D2)=2090+-90 K), as well as the\npre-exponential factor (D0(H2)=0.0007+0.0013-0.0004 cm2 s-1,\nD0(D2)=0.0045+0.005-0.0023 cm2 s-1) The strong decrease of the diffusion\ncoefficient at low dust particle temperatures exponentially increases the\ndiffusion times in astrophysical environments. Therefore, transient dust\nheating by cosmic rays needs to be invoked for the release of the photo-\nproduced H2 molecules in cold PDR regions, where destruction of the aliphatic\ncomponent in hydrogenated amorphous carbons most probably takes place.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 07:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

The goal of this work is to use less\nabundant CO isotopologues, whose detection is routine for ALMA, to infer the\ngas mass of disks. Isotope-selective effects need to be taken into account in\nthe analysis, because they can significantly modify CO isotopologues line\nintensities. CO isotope-selective photodissociation has been implemented in the\nphysical-chemical code DALI and 800 disk models have been run for a range of\ndisk and stellar parameters.

Both disk structure and stellar parameters have been investigated.\nTotal fluxes have been ray-traced for different CO isotopologues and for\nvarious transitions for different inclinations. A combination of 13CO and C18O\ntotal intensities allows inference of the total disk mass, although with\nnon-negligible uncertainties. These can be overcome by employing spatially\nresolved observations, i.e. the disk's radial extent and inclination.\nComparison with parametric models shows differences at the factor of a few\nlevel, especially for extremely low and high disk masses.

Precession also causes change in\nalignment between the rotational axis of the disc and the spin axis of the\nprimary star. This type of alignment is of great important for explaining the\norigin of spin-orbit misaligned planetary systems. However, we find that the\nrigid-disc approximation fails to describe changes in alignment between the\ndisc and the binary orbit. This is because the alignment process is a\nconsequence of interactions that involve the fluidity of the disc, such as the\ntidal interaction and the encounter interaction. Furthermore, simulation\nresults show that there are not only alignment processes, which bring the\ncomponents towards alignment, but also anti-alignment processes, which tend to\nmisalign the components. The alignment process dominates in systems with\nmisalignment angle near 90 degrees, while the anti-alignment process dominates\nin systems with the misalignment angle near 0 or 180 degrees. This means that\nhighly misaligned systems will become more aligned but slightly misaligned\nsystems will become more misaligned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 09:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-26"}

A key question in such applications is how much to shrink, or,\nequivalently, how much to smooth. Empirical Bayes shrinkage methods provide an\nattractive solution to this problem; they use the data to estimate a\ndistribution of underlying \"effects\", hence automatically select an appropriate\namount of shrinkage. However, most existing implementations of Empirical Bayes\nshrinkage are less flexible than they could be--both in their assumptions on\nthe underlying distribution of effects, and in their ability to handle\nheterskedasticity---which limits their signal denoising applications. Here we\naddress this by taking a particularly flexible, stable and computationally\nconvenient Empirical Bayes shrinkage method, and we apply it to several signal\ndenoising problems.

Proof terms for\nfinitary, first-order, left-linear term rewriting are described in the Terese\nbook, chapter 8. In a previous work, we defined an extension of the finitary\nproof-term formalism, that allows to describe contractions in infinitary\nfirst-order term rewriting, and gave a characterisation of permutation\nequivalence.\n  In this work, we discuss how projections of possibly infinite rewrite\nsequences can be modeled using proof terms. Again, the foundation is a\ncharacterisation of projections for finitary rewriting described in Terese,\nSection 8.7. We extend this characterisation to infinitary rewriting and also\nrefine it, by describing precisely the role that structural equivalence plays\nin the development of the notion of projection. The characterisation we propose\nyields a definite expression, i.e. a proof term, that describes the projection\nof an infinitary reduction over another.\n  To illustrate the working of projections, we show how a common reduct of a\n(possibly infinite) reduction and a single step that makes part of it can be\nobtained via their respective projections. We show, by means of several\nexamples, that the proposed definition yields the expected behavior also in\ncases beyond those covered by this result.

Under the resource theory of coherence, it is interesting to\ninvestigate interpretations of coherence measures and the interplay with other\nquantum properties, such as quantum correlations and intrinsic randomness.\nCoherence can be viewed as the resource for the intrinsic randomness in the\nmeasurement outcomes of a state in the computational basis. We observed in our\nprevious work that the coherence of formation, which measures the asymptotic\ncoherence dilution rate, indeed quantifies the uncertainty of a (classical)\ncorrelated party about the system measurement outcome. In this work, we\nre-derive the result from a quantum point of view and then connect the\nintrinsic randomness to the relative entropy of coherence, another important\ncoherence measure that quantifies the asymptotic distillable coherence. Even\nthough there does not exist bound coherent states, these two intrinsic\nrandomness quantified by coherence of formation and the relative entropy of\ncoherence are different. Interestingly, we show that this gap is equal to the\nquantum discord, a general form of quantum correlations, in the state of the\nsystem of interest and the correlated party, after a local measurement on the\nformer system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 10:41:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2016 11:02:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 2019 18:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-25"}

In other\nwords, the formation of long-range order is immediately followed by the\ndeconfinement transition and the two critical points coincide. The confined\nphase has a scale -- the confinement scale (energy gap) which vanishes in the\ndeconfined case. Therefore, the breaking of the symmetry of the scalar\n($\\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $U(1)$) in turn restores the scaling symmetry in the system\nand neither phase has a higher overall symmetry than the other.

While fermion pairing characterises the ground state, our\nexperiments provide signatures suggestive of a metastable Stoner-like\nferromagnetic phase supported by strong repulsion in excited scattering states.\nWe probe the collective spin response of a two-spin mixture engineered in a\nmagnetic domain-wall-like configuration, and reveal a substantial increase of\nspin susceptibility while approaching a critical repulsion strength. Beyond\nthis value, we observe the emergence of a time-window of domain immiscibility,\nindicating the metastability of the initial ferromagnetic state. Our findings\nestablish an important connection between dynamical and equilibrium properties\nof strongly-correlated Fermi gases, pointing to the existence of a\nferromagnetic instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 12:24:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 23:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-07"}

The entropy power of $X$ is defined as the mean of a geometric\nrandom variable with entropy $H(X)$.

This problem\nhas relevance in signal and data fusion network applications and in studying\nopinion and consensus dynamics in social networks. Due to its capability of\nhandling a wider variety of uncertainties and ambiguities associated with\nevidence, we use the framework of Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory to capture the\nopinion of an agent. We then examine the consensus among agents in dynamic\nnetworks in which an agent can utilize either a cautious or receptive updating\nstrategy. In particular, we examine the case of bounded confidence updating\nwhere an agent exchanges its opinion only with neighboring nodes possessing\n'similar' evidence. In a fusion network, this captures the case in which nodes\nonly update their state based on evidence consistent with the node's own\nevidence. In opinion dynamics, this captures the notions of Social Judgment\nTheory (SJT) in which agents update their opinions only with other agents\npossessing opinions closer to their own. Focusing on the two special DS\ntheoretic cases where an agent state is modeled as a Dirichlet body of evidence\nand a probability mass function (p.m.f.), we utilize results from matrix\ntheory, graph theory, and networks to prove the existence of consensus agent\nstates in several time-varying network cases of interest. For example, we show\nthe existence of a consensus in which a subset of network nodes achieves a\nconsensus that is adopted by follower network nodes. Of particular interest is\nthe case of multiple opinion leaders, where we show that the agents do not\nreach a consensus in general, but rather converge to 'opinion clusters'.\nSimulation results are provided to illustrate the main results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 12:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-26"}

In order to\nperform efficient posterior inference and large-scale training, we build a\nneural posterior approximator conditioned on both the source and the target\nsides, and equip it with a reparameterization technique to estimate the\nvariational lower bound. Experiments on both Chinese-English and English-\nGerman translation tasks show that the proposed variational neural machine\ntranslation achieves significant improvements over the vanilla neural machine\ntranslation baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 13:18:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 25 Sep 2016 23:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-27"}

The\nidea is to conduct a linear decomposition of a signal using a few atoms of a\nlearned and usually over-completed dictionary instead of a pre-defined basis.\nDetermining a proper size of the to-be-learned dictionary is crucial for both\nprecision and efficiency of the process, while most of the existing dictionary\nlearning algorithms choose the size quite arbitrarily. In this paper, a novel\nregularization method called the Grouped Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation\n(GSCAD) is employed for learning the dictionary. The proposed method can\nsimultaneously learn a sparse dictionary and select the appropriate dictionary\nsize. Efficient algorithm is designed based on the alternative direction method\nof multipliers (ADMM) which decomposes the joint non-convex problem with the\nnon-convex penalty into two convex optimization problems. Several examples are\npresented for image denoising and the experimental results are compared with\nother state-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 13:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-26"}

Indeed, these perturbations can become very important\nas soon as the altitude of the satellite becomes high, which is the case around\nthe apocentre of this type of orbit. For several reasons, the traditional tools\nof celestial mechanics are not well adapted to the particular dynamic of highly\nelliptical orbits. On the one hand, analytical solutions are quite generally\nexpanded into power series of the eccentricity and therefore limited to\nquasi-circular orbits [17, 25].

A\ncommon approach to tackle this issue is to use multiple starting points\nrandomly selected from a specific prior distribution. As a result the choice of\nprior distribution may play a vital role in the predictability of this\napproach. However, there exists little research in the literature to study the\nimpact of the prior distributions on the hyperparameter estimation and the\nperformance of GPR. In this paper, we provide the first empirical study on this\nproblem using simulated and real data experiments. We consider different types\nof priors for the initial values of hyperparameters for some commonly used\nkernels and investigate the influence of the priors on the predictability of\nGPR models. The results reveal that, once a kernel is chosen, different priors\nfor the initial hyperparameters have no significant impact on the performance\nof GPR prediction, despite that the estimates of the hyperparameters are very\ndifferent to the true values in some cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 14:45:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 14:36:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-15"}

Sizable\ncirculating power flows have been recorded around such loops, which take up\ntransmission line capacity and dissipate but do not deliver electric power.\nPower flows in high voltage AC transmission grids are dominantly governed by\nvoltage angle differences between connected buses, much in the same way as\nJosephson currents depend on phase differences between tunnel-coupled\nsuperconductors. From this previously overlooked similarity we argue here that\ncirculating power flows in AC power grids are analogous to supercurrents\nflowing in superconducting rings and in rings of Josephson junctions. We\ninvestigate how circulating power flows can be created and how they behave in\nthe presence of ohmic dissipation. We show how changing operating conditions\nmay generate them, how significantly more power is ohmically dissipated in\ntheir presence and how they are topologically protected, even in the presence\nof dissipation, so that they persist when operating conditions are returned to\ntheir original values. We identify three mechanisms for creating circulating\npower flows, (i) by loss of stability of the equilibrium state carrying no\ncirculating loop flow, (ii) by tripping of a line traversing a large loop in\nthe network and (iii) by reclosing a loop that tripped or was open earlier.\nBecause voltage angles are uniquely defined, circulating power flows can take\non only discrete values, much in the same way as circulation around vortices is\nquantized in superfluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 15:11:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Sep 2016 16:38:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-26"}

The nature of the spatial distribution of local magnetic\nfield and shielding currents across the array reveals the presence of a\nnon-uniform vortex configuration partially matched with the blind holes at\nsub-matching fields. We observe that the filling fraction is different in two\ndifferent regions of the array. The mean vortex configuration within the array\nis described as a patchy vortex configuration with the patches having different\nmean filling fraction. The patchy nature of the vortex configuration is more\npronounced at partial filling of the array at low fields while the\nconfiguration becomes more uniform with a unique filling fraction at higher\nfields. The metastable nature of this patchy vortex configuration is revealed\nby the application of magnetic field pulses of fixed height or individual\npulses of varying height to the array. The metastability of the vortex\nconfiguration allows for a relatively easy way of producing flux reorganization\nand flux focusing effects within the blind hole array. Effect of the magnetic\nfield pulses modifies the vortex configuration within the array and produces a\nuniform enhancement in the shielding current around the patterned array edges.\nThe enhanced shielding current concentrates magnetic flux within the array by\ndriving vortices away from the edges and towards the center of the array. The\nenhanced shielding current also prevents the uninhibited entry of vortices into\nthe array. We propose that the metastable patchy vortex configuration within\nthe blind hole array is due to a non-uniform pinning landscape leading to\nnon-uniform filling of individual blind holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 15:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-26"}

When placed at the focus of a telescope element provides a\ncontinuous helical phase ramp for an on axis sources, which creates the orbital\nangular momentum. Thanks to that phase, the intensity of the central source is\ncanceled by a down-stream pupil stop, while the off axis sources are not\naffected. However due to experimental conditions the nulling is hardly perfect.\nTo improve the null, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer containing Dove prisms\ndifferently oriented can be proposed to sort out light based on its orbital\nangular momentum (OAM). Thanks to the differential rotation of the beam, a\n{\\pi} phase shift is achieved for the on axis light affected by a non zero OAM.\nTherefore the contrast between the star and its faint companion is enhanced.\nNevertheless, due the Dove prisms birefringence, the performance of the\ninterferometer is relatively poor. To solve this problem, we propose to add a\nbirefringent wave-plate in each arm to compensate this birefringence.

Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted\nto validate the theoretical analysis, where the results show a very close\nmatch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 23:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-27"}

The content of this article is a sub-proposal to the IEEE\n802.15.7r1 Task Group (TG7r1) aimed at Optical Wireless Communication (OWC)\nusing an image sensor as the receiver. The compatibility support is\nindispensable for Image Sensor Communications (ISC) because the rolling shutter\nimage sensors currently available have different frame rates, shutter speeds,\nsampling rates, and resolutions. However, focusing on unidirectional\ncommunications (i.e., data broadcasting, beacons), an asynchronous\ncommunication prototype is also discussed in the paper. Due to the physical\nlimitations associated with typical image sensors (including low and varying\nframe rates, long exposures, and low shutter speeds), the link speed\nperformance is critically considered. Based on the practical measurement of\ncamera response to modulated light, an operating frequency range is suggested\nalong with the similar system architecture, decoding procedure, and algorithms.\nA significant feature of our novel data frame structure is that it can support\nboth typical frame rate cameras (in the oversampling mode) as well as very low\nframe rate cameras (in the error detection mode for a camera whose frame rate\nis lower than the transmission packet rate). A high frame rate camera, i.e., no\nless than 20 fps, is supported in an oversampling mode in which a majority\nvoting scheme for decoding data is applied. A low frame rate camera, i.e., when\nthe frame rate drops to less than 20 fps at some certain time, is supported by\nan error detection mode in which any missing data sub-packet is detected in\ndecoding and later corrected by external code. Numerical results and valuable\nanalysis are also included to indicate the capability of the proposed schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 12:02:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-21"}

In this\npaper we extend work on gender differences in social networks to patterns of\ninteraction, propinquity, and connectivity captured via a social sensing\nplatform comprised of an ensemble of individuals' phone calls, text messaging,\nface-to-face interactions, and traces of their mobility activities. We attempt\nto isolate dispositional from other factors by focusing on a relatively\nhomogeneous population on a relatively closed setting at the same stage in the\nlife course. Analysis across three different networks along with mobility data\nreveals systematic gender differences in terms of communicative,\ndistributional, mobility, and spatial proximity tendencies. Most importantly,\nsome patterns observed in the communication network (e.g. stronger same-gender\npreference for women) are found to be reversed in the spatial proximity\ncontext, with men displaying a greater tendency to spend time in a narrower\n(and thus more predictable) range of spaces with same-gender peers than women.\nThese findings provide robust and novel evidence for the powerful effect of\ngender in structuring behavior across a wide range of communication and\nmobility behaviors, validating and extending recent work pointing to\ndifferences of socio-cultural and evolutionary origin in the styles of\nsociability and interaction characteristic of men and women.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 20:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-25"}
