Among several theories, network reciprocity --\na model of inhomogeneous social interactions -- has been proposed as an\nenabling mechanism to explain the emergence of cooperation. Existing\nevolutionary models of this mechanism have tended to focus on highly\nheterogeneous (scale-free) networks, hence typically assume preferential\nattachment mechanisms, and consequently the prerequisite that individuals have\nglobal network knowledge. Within an evolutionary game theoretic context, using\nthe weak prisoner's dilemma as a metaphor for cooperation, we present a minimal\nmodel which describes network growth by chronological random addition of new\nnodes, combined with regular attrition of less fit members of the population.\nSpecifically our model does not require that agents have access to global\ninformation and does not assume scale-free network structure or a preferential\nattachment mechanism. Further our model supports the emergence of cooperation\nfrom initially non-cooperative populations. By reducing dependency on a number\nof assumptions, this model offers broad applicability and as such may support\nan explanation of the emergence of cooperation in early evolutionary\ntransitions, where few assumptions can be made.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 16:45:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-10"}

While traditional LSH\ndata structures have several parameters whose optimal values depend on the\ndistance distribution from $q$ to the points of $S$, our data structure is\nparameter-free, except for the space usage, which is configurable by the user.\nNevertheless, its expected query time basically matches that of an LSH data\nstructure whose parameters have been *optimally chosen for the data and query*\nin question under the given space constraints. In particular, our data\nstructure provides a smooth trade-off between hard queries (typically addressed\nby standard LSH) and easy queries such as those where the number of points to\nreport is a constant fraction of $S$, or where almost all points in $S$ are far\naway from the query point. In contrast, known data structures fix LSH\nparameters based on certain parameters of the input alone.\n  The algorithm has expected query time bounded by $O(t (n/t)^\\rho)$, where $t$\nis the number of points to report and $\\rho\\in (0,1)$ depends on the data\ndistribution and the strength of the LSH family used.

The medium of D-particles induces an effective mass for the\ngraviton, as a consequence of the formation of recoil-velocity field\ncondensates due to the underlying Born-Infeld dynamics. There is a competing\neffect, due to a super-luminal refractive index, as a result of the\ngravitational energy of D-particles acting as a dark matter component, with\nwhich propagating gravitons interact. We examine conditions for the condensate\nunder which the latter effect is sub-leading. We argue that if quantum\nfluctuations of the recoil velocity are relatively strong, which can happen in\nthe current era of the universe, then the condensate, and hence the induced\nmass of the graviton, can be several orders of magnitude larger than the\nmagnitude of the cosmological constant today. Hence, we constrain the graviton\nmass using aLIGO and pulsar timing observations (which give the most stringent\nbounds at present). In such a sub-luminal graviton case, there is also a\ngravitational Cherenkov effect for ordinary high energy cosmic matter, which is\nfurther constrained by means of ultra-high-energy cosmic ray observations.\nAssuming cosmic rays of extragalactic origin, the bounds on the quantum\ncondensate strength, based on the gravitational Cherenkov effect, are of the\nsame order as those from aLIGO measurements, in contrast to the case where a\ngalactic origin of the cosmic rays is assumed, in which case the corresponding\nbounds are much weaker.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 18:18:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

Planets in the close habitable zone of magnetically active M dwarfs may\nexperience more extreme space weather than at Earth, including frequent CME\nimpacts leading to atmospheric erosion and leaving the surface exposed to\nextreme flare activity. Similar erosion may occur for hot Jupiters with close\norbits around solar-like stars. We have developed a model, Forecasting a CME's\nAltered Trajectory (ForeCAT), which predicts a CME's deflection. We adapt\nForeCAT to simulate CME deflections for the mid-type M dwarf V374 Peg and hot\nJupiters with solar-type hosts. V374 Peg's strong magnetic fields can trap CMEs\nat the M dwarfs's Astrospheric Current Sheet, the location of the minimum in\nthe background magnetic field. Solar-type CMEs behave similarly, but have much\nsmaller deflections and do not get trapped at the Astrospheric Current Sheet.\nThe probability of planetary impact decreases with increasing inclination of\nthe planetary orbit with respect to the Astrospheric Current Sheet - 0.5 to 5\nCME impacts per day for M dwarf exoplanets, 0.05 to 0.5 CME impacts per day for\nsolar-type hot Jupiters. We determine the minimum planetary magnetic field\nnecessary to shield a planet's atmosphere from the CME impacts. M dwarf\nexoplanets require values between tens and hundreds of Gauss. Hot Jupiters\naround a solar-type star, however, require a more reasonable <30 G. These\nvalues exceed the magnitude required to shield a planet from the stellar wind,\nsuggesting CMEs may be the key driver of atmospheric losses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 18:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

Given a family of\nfilters, defined as a distribution over pairs of subsets of space with certain\nlocality-sensitivity properties, we can solve the approximate near neighbor\nproblem in $d$-dimensional space for an $n$-point data set with query time\n$dn^{\\rho_q+o(1)}$, update time $dn^{\\rho_u+o(1)}$, and space usage $dn + n^{1\n+ \\rho_u + o(1)}$. The space-time tradeoff is tied to the tradeoff between\nquery time and update time, controlled by the exponents $\\rho_q, \\rho_u$ that\nare determined by the filter family. Locality-sensitive filtering was\nintroduced by Becker et al. (SODA 2016) together with a framework yielding a\nsingle, balanced, tradeoff between query time and space, further relying on the\nassumption of an efficient oracle for the filter evaluation algorithm. We\nextend the LSF framework to support space-time tradeoffs and through a\ncombination of existing techniques we remove the oracle assumption.\n  Building on a filter family for the unit sphere by Laarhoven (arXiv 2015) we\nuse a kernel embedding technique by Rahimi & Recht (NIPS 2007) to show a\nsolution to the $(r,cr)$-near neighbor problem in $\\ell_s^d$-space for $0 < s\n\\leq 2$ with query and update exponents\n$\\rho_q=\\frac{c^s(1+\\lambda)^2}{(c^s+\\lambda)^2}$ and\n$\\rho_u=\\frac{c^s(1-\\lambda)^2}{(c^s+\\lambda)^2}$ where $\\lambda\\in[-1,1]$ is a\ntradeoff parameter. This result improves upon the space-time tradeoff of\nKapralov (PODS 2015) and is shown to be optimal in the case of a balanced\ntradeoff. Finally, we show a lower bound for the space-time tradeoff on the\nunit sphere that matches Laarhoven's and our own upper bound in the case of\nrandom data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 18:29:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2016 15:15:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 09:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

At the heart of this analysis is a\nsparsity-regularized maximum likelihood estimator. While\nsparsity-regularization is well-studied in the statistics and machine learning\ncommunities, those analysis methods cannot be applied to autoregressive\ngeneralized linear models because of the correlations and potential\nheteroscedasticity inherent in the observations.

To better utilize\nmultimodal data on social media, multimodal analysis methods including\nmultitask learning and decision-level fusion are employed in our framework.\nExperiment results on expertly labeled data have demonstrated the effectiveness\nof our approach, as well as its scalability and reproducibility over\nlabor-intensive conventional approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 19:43:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 03:42:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 May 2016 04:52:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 May 2016 01:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-26"}

However, in experiments performed to date, spin-orbit torques\nhave an important limitation -- the component of torque that can compensate\nmagnetic damping is required by symmetry to lie within the device plane. This\nmeans that spin-orbit torques can drive the most current-efficient type of\nmagnetic reversal (antidamping switching) only for magnetic devices with\nin-plane anisotropy, not the devices with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy\nthat are needed for high-density applications. Here we show experimentally that\nthis state of affairs is not fundamental, but rather one can change the allowed\nsymmetries of spin-orbit torques in spin-source/ferromagnet bilayer devices by\nusing a spin source material with low crystalline symmetry. We use WTe2, a\ntransition-metal dichalcogenide whose surface crystal structure has only one\nmirror plane and no two-fold rotational invariance. Consistent with these\nsymmetries, we generate an out-of-plane antidamping torque when current is\napplied along a low-symmetry axis of WTe2/Permalloy bilayers, but not when\ncurrent is applied along a high-symmetry axis. Controlling S-O torques by\ncrystal symmetries in multilayer samples provides a new strategy for optimizing\nfuture magnetic technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 19:46:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-08"}

Since velocities should be unbiased on large scales, the\nkSZ signal is an unbiased tracer of the large-scale electron distribution, and\nthus can be used to detect the \"missing baryon\" that evade most observational\ntechniques. While most current methods for kSZ extraction rely on the\navailability of very accurate redshifts, we revisit a method that allows\nmeasurements even in the absence of redshift information for individual\nobjects.

This review summarizes recent progress in\nhigh-contrast imaging with particular emphasis on observational results,\ndiscoveries near and below the deuterium-burning limit, and a practical\noverview of large-scale surveys and dedicated instruments. I conclude with a\nstatistical meta-analysis of deep imaging surveys in the literature.

A major bottleneck for current LLP\nsearches is the prediction of SM backgrounds, which are often impossible to\nsimulate accurately. In this paper, we propose a general strategy for obtaining\ndifferential, data-driven background estimates in LLP searches, thereby notably\nextending the range of LLP masses and lifetimes that can be discovered at the\nLHC. We focus on LLPs decaying in the ATLAS Muon System, where triggers\nproviding both signal and control samples are available at the LHC Run-2. While\nmany existing searches require two displaced decays, a detailed knowledge of\nbackgrounds will allow for very inclusive searches that require just one\ndetected LLP decay.

In theories of Neutral\nNaturalness, this extends reach to glueball masses far below the $\\bar b b$\nthreshold.

We investigate gas loss processes in the smallest satellites of\nthe Milky Way using three-dimensional, high resolution, idealized wind tunnel\nsimulations, accounting for gas loss through both ram pressure stripping and\nexpulsion by supernova feedback. Using initial conditions appropriate for a\ndwarf galaxy like Leo T, we investigate whether or not environmental gas\nstripping and internal feedback can quench these low mass galaxies on the\nexpected timescales, shorter than 2 Gyr. We find that supernova feedback\ncontributes negligibly to the stripping rate for these low star formation rate\ngalaxies. However, we also find that ram pressure stripping is less efficient\nthan expected in the stripping scenarios we consider. Our work suggests that,\nalthough ram pressure stripping can eventually completely strip these galaxies,\nother physics is likely at play to reconcile our computed stripping times with\nthe rapid quenching timescales deduced from observations of low mass Milky Way\ndwarf galaxies. We discuss the roles additional physics may play in this\nscenario, including host-satellite tidal interactions, cored vs. cuspy dark\nmatter profiles, reionization, and satellite pre-processing.

Indeed, if the event\nenergy distribution is steep enough, the smallest, unobservable events could be\nthe largest contributors to the total energy dissipation in the corona.\nPrevious observations have shown a wide distribution of energies but remain\ninconclusive about the precise slope. Furthermore, these results rely on a very\ncrude estimate of the energy.

We aim\nat getting a better estimate of the distributions of the energy dissipated in\ncoronal heating events using high-resolution, multi-channel Extreme\nUltra-Violet (EUV) data. To estimate the energies corresponding to heating\nevents and deduce their distribution, we detect brightenings in five EUV\nchannels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on-board the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO).

We obtain distributions of areas, durations, intensities,\nand energies (thermal, radiative, and conductive) of events. These\ndistributions are power-laws, and we find also power-law correlations between\nevent parameters. The energy distributions indicate that the energy from a\npopulation of events like the ones we detect represents a small contribution to\nthe total coronal heating, even when extrapolating to smaller scales.

Hundreds of thousands of people have already traveled across dangerous\nsea passages from Turkish shores to Greek islands, resulting in thousands of\ndead and missing, despite the best rescue efforts from both sides. One of the\nmain reasons is the total lack of any early warning-alerting system, which\ncould provide some preparation time for the prompt and effective deployment of\nresources at the hot zones. This work is such an attempt for a systemic\nanalysis of the refugee influx in Greece, aiming at (a) the statistical and\nsignal-level characterization of the smuggling networks and (b) the formulation\nand preliminary assessment of such models for predictive purposes, i.e., as the\nbasis of such an early warning-alerting protocol. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst-ever attempt to design such a system, since this refugee crisis itself\nand its geographical properties are unique (intense event handling, little or\nno warning). The analysis employs a wide range of statistical, signal-based and\nmatrix factorization (decomposition) techniques, including linear &\nlinear-cosine regression, spectral analysis, ARMA, SVD, Probabilistic PCA, ICA,\nK-SVD for Dictionary Learning, as well as fractal dimension analysis. It is\nestablished that the behavioral patterns of the smuggling networks closely\nmatch (as expected) the regular burst and pause periods of store-and-forward\nnetworks in digital communications. There are also major periodic trends in the\nrange of 6.2-6.5 days and strong correlations in lags of four or more days,\nwith distinct preference in the Sunday-Monday 48-hour time frame. These results\nshow that such models can be used successfully for short-term forecasting of\nthe influx intensity, producing an invaluable operational asset for planners,\ndecision-makers and first-responders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 21:08:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}

The former\npoint of view, in its quantum version, is particularly adapted to describe the\nelectron shot noise in a coherent conductor, like a tunnel junction at\nultra-low temperature. However, when the junction is appropriately biased by a\ndc and an ac voltage, the noise it generates is best analyzed using the latter\nrepresentation and the tools of quantum optics, as the radiation exhibits clear\nsigns of non-classicality. Herein, we report the measurement of the statistics\nof photons emitted by such a tunnel junction. We observe a photon shot noise\ncharacteristic of photon pair emission, as its Fano factor for small signal is\nabove unity. The theory of electron shot noise, dealing exclusively with the\ntunneling of charges through the junction, quantitatively fits the data from\nwhich photon shot noise is extracted.

Most of these\ncarbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars also show enhancement in elements\nproduced mainly by the s-process (CEMP-s stars) and evidence suggests that the\norigin of these non-standard abundances can be traced to mass transfer from a\nbinary asymptotic giant branch (AGB) companion. Thus, observations of CEMP-s\nstars are commonly used to infer the nucleosynthesis output of low-metallicity\nAGB stars. A crucial step in this exercise is understanding what happens to the\naccreted material after mass transfer ceases. Here we present models of the\npost-mass-transfer evolution of CEMP-s stars considering the physics of\nthermohaline mixing and atomic diffusion, including radiative levitation. We\nfind that stars with typical CEMP-s star masses (M ~ 0.85 Msun) have very\nshallow convective envelopes (Menv < 1e-7 Msun). Hence, the surface abundance\nvariations arising from the competition between gravitational settling and\nradiative levitation should be orders of magnitude larger than observed (e.g.\n[C/Fe]<-1 or [C/Fe]>+4). We are therefore unable to reproduce the spread in the\nobserved abundances with these models and conclude that some other physical\nprocess must largely suppress atomic diffusion in the outer layers of CEMP-s\nstars. We demonstrate that this could be achieved by some additional\n(turbulent) mixing process operating at the base of the convective envelope, as\nfound by other authors. Alternatively, mass-loss rates around 1e-13 Msun/yr\ncould also negate most of the abundance variations by eroding the surface\nlayers and forcing the base of the convective envelope to move inwards in mass.\nSince atomic diffusion cannot have a substantial effect on the surface\nabundances of CEMP-s stars, the dilution of the accreted material, while\nvariable in degree from one star to the next, is most likely the same for all\nelements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 21:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}

Such frequency combs allow counting of optical frequencies and have a\nwide range of applications. The required optical bandwidth to implement\nself-referencing is typically obtained via nonlinear broadening in optical\nfibers. Recent advances in the field of Kerr frequency combs have provided a\npath towards the development of compact frequency comb sources that provide\nbroadband frequency combs, exhibit microwave repetition rates and that are\ncompatible with on-chip photonic integration. These devices have the potential\nto significantly expand the use of frequency combs. Yet to date\nself-referencing of such Kerr frequency combs has only been attained by\napplying conventional, fiber based broadening techniques. Here we demonstrate\nexternal broadening-free self-referencing of a Kerr frequency comb. An optical\nspectrum that spans two-thirds of an octave is directly synthesized from a\ncontinuous wave laser-driven silicon nitride microresonator using temporal\ndissipative Kerr soliton formation and soliton Cherenkov radiation. Using this\ncoherent bandwidth and two continuous wave transfer lasers in a 2f-3f\nself-referencing scheme, we are able to detect the offset frequency of the\nsoliton Kerr frequency comb. By stabilizing the repetition rate to a radio\nfrequency reference the self-referenced frequency comb is used to count and\ntrack the continuous wave pump laser's frequency. This work demonstrates the\nprincipal ability of soliton Kerr frequency combs to provide\nmicrowave-to-optical clockworks on a chip.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 May 2016 22:23:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-09"}

The goal of this article is to study the\nconjecture in (Mulmuley, FOCS 2012) that $\\overline{\\textrm{VP}}$ is not\ncontained in VP.\n  Towards that end, we introduce three degenerations of VP (i.e., sets of\npoints in $\\overline{\\textrm{VP}}$), namely the stable degeneration Stable-VP,\nthe Newton degeneration Newton-VP, and the p-definable one-parameter\ndegeneration VP*. We also introduce analogous degenerations of VNP. We show\nthat Stable-VP $\\subseteq$ Newton-VP $\\subseteq$ VP* $\\subseteq$ VNP, and\nStable-VNP = Newton-VNP = VNP* = VNP.

We are interested in the role of depth (why do DNNs\nperform better than shallow models?) and the interpretation of DNNs (what do\nintermediate layers do?) Despite the rapid development in their application,\nDNNs remain analytically unexplained because the hidden layers are nested and\nthe parameters are not faithful. Inspired by the integral representation of\nshallow NNs, which is the continuum limit of the width, or the hidden unit\nnumber, we developed the flow representation and transport analysis of DNNs.\nThe flow representation is the continuum limit of the depth or the hidden layer\nnumber, and it is specified by an ordinary differential equation with a vector\nfield. We interpret an ordinary DNN as a transport map or a Euler broken line\napproximation of the flow. Technically speaking, a dynamical system is a\nnatural model for the nested feature maps. In addition, it opens a new way to\nthe coordinate-free treatment of DNNs by avoiding the redundant parametrization\nof DNNs. Following Wasserstein geometry, we analyze a flow in three aspects:\ndynamical system, continuity equation, and Wasserstein gradient flow.

Mixed generalized multiscale finite element method\n(GMsFEM) is one of the accurate and efficient approaches to solve multiscale\nproblem in a coarse grid with local mass conservation. When the inputs of the\nPDEs are parameterized by the random variables, the GMsFE basis functions\nusually depend on the random parameters. This leads to a large number degree of\nfreedoms for the mixed GMsFEM and substantially impacts on the computation\nefficiency. In order to overcome the difficulty, we develop reduced mixed GMsFE\nbasis methods such that the multiscale basis functions are independent of the\nrandom parameters and span a low-dimensional space. To this end, a greedy\nalgorithm is used to find a set of optimal samples from a training set\nscattered in the parameter space. Reduced mixed GMsFE basis functions are\nconstructed based on the optimal samples using two optimal sampling strategies:\nbasis-oriented cross-validation and proper orthogonal decomposition. Although\nthe dimension of the space spanned by the reduced mixed GMsFE basis functions\nis much smaller than the dimension of the original full order model, the online\ncomputation still depends on the number of coarse degree of freedoms. To\nsignificantly improve the online computation, we integrate the reduced mixed\nGMsFE basis methods with sparse tensor approximation and obtain a sparse\nrepresentation for the model's outputs. The sparse representation is very\nefficient for evaluating the model's outputs for many instances of parameters.\nTo illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods, we present a few numerical\nexamples for multsicale problems with random inputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 04:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

Since the total time needed to charge\nthe EV up to capacity is often less than the amount of time that the customer\nis away, there are opportunities to exploit electricity spot price variations\nwithin some reservation window. We formulate the problem as a finite horizon\nMarkov decision process (MDP) and consider a risk-averse objective function by\noptimizing under a dynamic risk measure constructed using a convex combination\nof expected value and conditional value at risk (CVaR). It has been recognized\nthat the objective function of a risk-averse MDP lacks a practical\ninterpretation. Therefore, in both academic and industry practice, the dynamic\nrisk measure objective is often not of primary interest; instead, the\nrisk-averse MDP is used as a computational tool for solving problems with\npredefined \"practical\" risk and reward objectives (termed the base model). In\nthis paper, we study the extent to which the two sides of this framework are\ncompatible with each other for the EV setting -- roughly speaking, does a \"more\nrisk-averse\" MDP provide lower risk in the practical sense as well? In order to\nanswer such a question, the effect of the degree of dynamic risk-aversion on\nthe optimal MDP policy is analyzed. Based on these results, we also propose a\nprincipled approximation approach to finding an instance of the risk-averse MDP\nwhose optimal policy behaves well under the practical objectives of the base\nmodel.

In our model angular momentum and mass are transported by a\ncombination of gravitational and bar-driven acoustic instabilities. In\ngravitationally-unstable regions the gas can form stars, and the resulting\nfeedback drives both turbulence and a wind that ejects mass from the CMZ. We\nshow that the CMZ is in a quasi-steady state where mass deposited at large\nradii by the bar is transported inward to a star-forming, ring-shaped region at\n$\\sim 100$ pc from the Galactic Centre, where the shear reaches a minimum. This\nring undergoes episodic starbursts, with bursts lasting $\\sim 5-10$ Myr\noccurring at $\\sim 20-40$ Myr intervals. During quiescence the gas in the ring\nis not fully cleared, but is driven out of a self-gravitating state by the\nmomentum injected by expanding supernova remnants.

Our scheme employs a pulsed laser\nto create Compton backscattered photons off a high energy electron beam, with\nthe FCC-ee as a particularly interesting example.

But the limited samples of spike\ncounts during recording usually result in model overfitting. Besides, current\nmodels assume spike counts to be Poisson-distributed, which ignores the fact\nthat many neurons demonstrate over-dispersed spiking behaviour. Although the\nNegative Binomial Generalized Linear Model (NB-GLM) provides a powerful tool\nfor modeling over-dispersed spike counts, the maximum likelihood-based standard\nNB-GLM leads to highly variable and inaccurate parameter estimates. Thus, we\npropose a hierarchical parametric empirical Bayes method to estimate the neural\nspike responses among neuronal population. Our method integrates both\nGeneralized Linear Models (GLMs) and empirical Bayes theory, which aims to (1)\nimprove the accuracy and reliability of parameter estimation, compared to the\nmaximum likelihood-based method for NB-GLM and Poisson-GLM; (2) effectively\ncapture the over-dispersion nature of spike counts from both simulated data and\nexperimental data; and (3) provide insight into both neural interactions and\nspiking behaviours of the neuronal populations.

The optimum choice for this\nparameter depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prevailing in the system.\nThus, it becomes difficult to fix a suitable value for this parameter,\nparticularly in a situation where SNR fluctuates over time.

At the same time, the mathematical\nfoundation of the method is simple and the logic of the method is very clear,\ntherefore, it is very easy in practice. As application, we obtain the uniform\nvalid asymptotic solutions to some problems including vector field, boundary\nlayer and boundary value problems of nonlinear wave equations. Moreover, we\ndiscuss the normal form theory and reduction equations of dynamical systems.\nFurthermore, by combining the topological deformation and the RG method, a\nmodified method namely the homotopy renormalization method (for simplicity,\nHTR) wasproposed to overcome the weaknesses of the standard RG method. In this\nHTR method, since there is a freedom to choose the first order approximate\nsolution in perturbation expansion, we can improve the global solution. In\nparticular, for those equations including no a small parameter, the HTR method\ncan also be applied. Some concrete applications including multi-solutions\nproblems, the forced Duffing equation and the Blasius equation are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 08:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}

This induces a functional coupling between\nmovement and sensation, since tumbling probability is controlled by the\ninternal state of the organism which, in turn, depends on previous signal\nlevels. Although a negative feedback tends to maintain this internal state\nclose to adapted levels, positive feedback can arise when motion up the\ngradient reduces tumbling probability, further boosting drift up the gradient.\nImportantly, such positive feedback can drive large fluctuations in the\ninternal state, complicating analytical approaches. Previous studies focused on\nwhat happens when the negative feedback dominates the dynamics. By contrast, we\nshow here that there is a large portion of physiologically-relevant parameter\nspace where the positive feedback can dominate, even when gradients are\nrelatively shallow. We demonstrate how large transients emerge because of\nnon-normal dynamics (non-orthogonal eigenvectors near a stable fixed point)\ninherent in the positive feedback, and further identify a fundamental\nnonlinearity that strongly amplifies their effect. Most importantly, this\namplification is asymmetric, elongating runs in favorable directions and\nabbreviating others. The result is a \"ratchet-like\" gradient climbing behavior\nwith drift speeds that can approach half the maximum run speed of the organism.\nOur results thus show that the classical drawback of run-and-tumble navigation\n--- wasteful runs in the wrong direction --- can be mitigated by exploiting the\nnon-normal dynamics implicit in the run-and-tumble strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 12:29:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2017 18:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

These maps, at\n100, 143, 217, and 353 GHz, are early versions of those that will be released\nin final form later in 2016.\n  The improvements allow us to determine the cosmic reionization optical depth\n$\\tau$ using, for the first time, the low-multipole $EE$ data from HFI,\nreducing significantly the central value and uncertainty, and hence the upper\nlimit. Two different likelihood procedures are used to constrain $\\tau$ from\ntwo estimators of the CMB $E$- and $B$-mode angular power spectra at 100 and\n143 GHz, after debiasing the spectra from a small remaining systematic\ncontamination. These all give fully consistent results.\n  A further consistency test is performed using cross-correlations derived from\nthe Low Frequency Instrument maps of the Planck 2015 data release and the new\nHFI data. For this purpose, end-to-end analyses of systematic effects from the\ntwo instruments are used to demonstrate the near independence of their dominant\nsystematic error residuals.\n  The tightest result comes from the HFI-based $\\tau$ posterior distribution\nusing the maximum likelihood power spectrum estimator from $EE$ data only,\ngiving a value $0.055\\pm 0.009$.

Methods The\nproposed method consists of two main steps: (i) simultaneously liver detection\nand probabilistic segmentation using 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs);\n(ii) accuracy refinement of initial segmentation with graph cut and the\npreviously learned probability map. Results The proposed approach was validated\non forty CT volumes taken from two public databases MICCAI-Sliver07 and\n3Dircadb.

The vibrational Stark shifts shown here for PCBM\njunctions are comparable to or larger than the charging effects that dominate\nin C60 junctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 14:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}

A\nfruitful proxy to investigate these aerosols is the use of laboratory\nexperiments that allow producing and studying analogs of Titan aerosol, the\nso35 called tholins. Even when produced in the laboratory, unveiling the exact\ncomposition of the aerosol remains problematic due to the high complexity of\nthe material. Numerous advances have been recently made using high-resolution\nmass spectrometry (HRMS) (Pernot et al. 2010, Somogyi et al. 2012, Gautier et\nal. 2014) that allowed the separation of isobaric compounds and a robust\nidentification of chemical species composing tholins regarding their molecular\nformulae. Nevertheless isomeric species cannot be resolved by a simple mass\nmeasurement. We propose here an analysis of tholins by high performance liquid\nchromatography (HPLC) coupled to HRMS to unveil this isomeric ambiguity for\nsome of the major tholins compounds. By comparing chromatograms obtained when\nanalyzing tholins and chemical standards, we strictly identified seven\nmolecules in our tholins samples: melamine, cyanoguanidine,\n6-methyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine, 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine, 3-amino-\n1,2,4-triazole, 3,5-Dimethyl-1,2,4-triazole and 2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazine.\nSeveral molecules, including hexamethylenetriamine (HMT) were not present at\ndetectable levels in our sample.

We then applied a modern Zeeman-Doppler\nimaging code in order to reconstruct the magnetic topology of all stars and the\nbrightness distribution of one of our studied stars.

In addition to double support, this\nmodel has different actuation possibilities in the swing hip and stance ankle\nwhich could be widely used to produce different walking gaits. Without the need\nfor numerical time-integration, closed-form solutions help finding periodic\ngaits which could be simply scaled in certain dimensions to modulate the motion\nonline. Thanks to linearity properties, the proposed model can provide a\ncomputationally fast platform for model predictive controllers to predict the\nfuture and consider meaningful inequality constraints to ensure feasibility of\nthe motion. Such property is coming from describing dynamics with joint torques\ndirectly and therefore, reflecting hardware limitations more precisely, even in\nthe very abstract high level template space. The proposed model produces\nhuman-like torque and ground reaction force profiles and thus, compared to\npoint-mass models, it is more promising for precise control of humanoid robots.\nDespite being linear and lacking many other features of human walking like CoM\nexcursion, knee flexion and ground clearance, we show that the proposed model\ncan predict one of the main optimality trends in human walking, i.e. nonlinear\nspeed-frequency relationship.

Taking\nadvantage of linear equations and closed-form solutions of 3LP, the proposed\ncontroller can project the state of the robot at any time during the phase back\nto a certain event for which, a discrete LQR controller is designed. After the\nprojection, a proper control policy is generated by the expert discrete\ncontroller and used online. This projecting architecture reacts to disturbances\nwith minimal delay and compared to discrete controllers, it provides superior\nperformance in recovering intermittent external pushes. Further analysis of\nclosed-loop eigenvalues and disturbance rejection shows that the proposed\ntime-projecting controller has strong stabilization properties. Controllable\nregions also show that the projecting architecture covers most of the maximal\ncontrollable set of states. It is computationally much faster than model\npredictive controllers, but still optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 14:55:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-11"}

The aim of this note is twofold: it\nis first an extended abstract of two recent articles of the authors of this\npaper, which propose such an approach; we further compare various aspects of\nthe discrete and continuous analytic approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 15:30:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 May 2016 10:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-07"}

This strong emission of coherent undulator\nradiation in the kicked direction cannot be explained in the framework of\nconventional synchrotron radiation theory.

Those filaments are normally identified as\nelongated fibres across the plane of the sky. But how would we detect filaments\nthat are inclined? Aims: We aim to learn more about whether, and how, total\ncolumn density or dust temperature change with respect to the line of sight.\nSuch variations would enable observers to use dust observations to identify and\nstudy filaments at any inclination and gain more insight on the distribution\nand orientations of filaments within the Galactic plane. Methods: As a first\nstep, we perform numerical calculations on simple cylindrical models to\nevaluate the influence of filament geometry on the average flux density. After\nthat, we apply our three-dimensional Monte Carlo dust radiative transfer code\non two models of star-forming regions and derive maps of effective total column\ndensity and dust temperature at different viewing angles. Results: We see only\nslight changes of average flux density for all cylinders we study. For our more\ncomplex models, we find that the effective dust temperature is not sensitive to\nviewing angle, while the total column density is strongly influenced, with\ndifferences exceeding an order of magnitude. The variations are not injective\nwith the viewing angle and depend on the structure of the object. Conclusions:\nWe conclude that there is no single quantity in our analysis that can uniquely\ntrace the inclination and three-dimensional structure of a filament based on\ndust observations alone. However, observing wide variations in total column\ndensity at a given effective dust temperature is indicative of inclined\nfilaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 15:37:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 May 2016 16:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-10"}

In quantum physics, first in\nnon-relativistic mechanics and later in quantum field theories, even familiar\nconcepts of position, momentum, wave or particle, are derived constructs from\nthe classical limit in which we live but not intrinsic to the underlying\nphysics. Most crucially, the very idea of the individual, whether an object or\nan event, distinguished only in a mere label of identity from others identical\nto it in all the physics, exists only as an approximation, not an element of\nunderlying reality. Failure to recognize this and seeking alternative\nexplanations in many worlds or multiverses leads only to incoherent logic and\nincorrect physics.\n  As an example, in a physical system such as an atom in a particular state,\nphysics deals with the universal system of all such atoms but makes no\nmeaningful prediction of the position of an electron or the time of decay of\nany specific atom. Those are incidental, entirely random among all possible\npositions and times, even while physics makes very precise predictions for the\ndistribution of the outcomes in measurements on atoms in that state.
