It is well known that a collinear magnetic structure which contains (111)\nferromagnetic planes arranged antiferromagnetically along one of the space\ndiagonals of the cube is stabilized in this model via order-by-disorder\nmechanism. On the mean-field level, the dipolar interaction forces spins to lie\nwithin (111) planes. By considering 1/S - corrections to the ground state\nenergy, we demonstrate that quantum fluctuations lead to an anisotropy within\n(111) planes favoring three equivalent directions for the staggered\nmagnetization (e.g., $[11\\overline{2}]$, $[1\\overline{2}1]$, and\n$[\\overline{2}11]$ directions for (111) plane). Such in-plane anisotropy was\nobtained experimentally in related materials MnO, $\\alpha$-MnS, $\\alpha$-MnSe,\nEuTe, and EuSe. We find that the order-by-disorder mechanism can contribute\nsignificantly to the value of the in-plane anisotropy in EuTe.

In this paper we propose the inference-based\nsemantics that solves many certain-answer anomalies existing in current\ndata-exchange semantics. To this we introduce a new mapping language between\nthe source and the target schema based on annotated bidirectional dependencies\n(abd) and, consequently define the semantics for this new language. It is shown\nthat the ABD-semantics can properly represent the inference-based semantics,\nfor any source-to-target mappings. We discovered three dichotomy results under\nthe new semantics for solution-existence, solution-check and UCQ evaluation\nproblems. These results rely on two factors describing the annotation used in\nthe mappings (density and cardinality). Finally we also investigate the\ncertain-answers evaluation problem under ABD-semantics and discover many\ntractable classes for non-UCQ queries even for a subclass of CQ with negation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2016 16:28:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-10"}

Although this situation can be mitigated by\nmanaging visitors' flow between spaces, a detailed analysis of the visitor's\nmovement is required to fully realize and apply a proper solution to the\nproblem. This paper analyzes the visitor's sequential movements, the spatial\nlayout, and the relationship between them in large-scale art museums - Louvre\nMuseum - using anonymized data collected through noninvasive Bluetooth sensors.\nThis enables us to unveil some features of visitor's behavior and spatial\nimpact that shed some light on the mechanism of the museum overcrowding. The\nanalysis reveals that the visiting style of short and long stay visitors are\nnot as significantly different as one could expect. Both types of visitors tend\nto visit a similar number of key locations in the museum while the longer stay\ntype visitors just tend to do so more extensively. In addition, we reveal that\nsome ways of exploring the museum appear frequently for both types of visitors,\nalthough long stay type visitors might be expected to diversify much more given\nthe greater time spent in the museum. We suggest that these\nsimilarities/dissimilarities make for an uneven distribution of the quantity of\nvisitors in the museum space. The findings increase the understanding of the\nunknown behaviors of visitors, which is key to improve the museum's environment\nand visiting experience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2016 18:16:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-10"}

Several methods have been proposed, such as parallel analysis\n(PA), Kaiser-Guttman's eigenvalue-greaterthan-one rule, multiple average\npartial procedure (MAP), the maximum-likelihood approaches that use fit indexes\nas BIC and EBIC and the less used and studied approach called very simple\nstructure (VSS). In the present paper a new approach to estimate the number of\ndimensions will be introduced and compared via simulation to the traditional\ntechniques pointed above. The approach proposed in the current paper is called\nexploratory graph analysis (EGA), since it is based on the graphical lasso with\nthe regularization parameter specified using EBIC. The number of dimensions is\nverified using the walktrap, a random walk algorithm used to identify\ncommunities in networks. In total, 32,000 data sets were simulated to fit known\nfactor structures, with the data sets varying across different criteria: number\nof factors (2 and 4), number of items (5 and 10), sample size (100, 500, 1000\nand 5000) and correlation between factors (orthogonal, .20, .50 and .70),\nresulting in 64 different conditions. For each condition, 500 data sets were\nsimulated using lavaan. The result shows that the EGA performs comparable to\nparallel analysis, EBIC, eBIC and to KaiserGuttman rule in a number of\nsituations, especially when the number of factors was two. However, EGA was the\nonly technique able to correctly estimate the number of dimensions in the\nfour-factor structure when the correlation between factors were .7, showing an\naccuracy of 100% for a sample size of 5,000 observations. Finally, the EGA was\nused to estimate the number of factors in a real dataset, in order to compare\nits performance with the other six techniques tested in the simulation study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2016 18:41:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 May 2016 16:02:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 19 Oct 2016 17:20:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

Wang et al. (Bioinformatics, 2012) have\ndeveloped an approach for the analysis of imaging genomic studies using\npenalized multi-task regression with regularization based on a novel group\n$l_{2,1}$-norm penalty which encourages structured sparsity at both the gene\nlevel and SNP level. While incorporating a number of useful features, the\nproposed method only furnishes a point estimate of the regression coefficients;\ntechniques for conducting statistical inference are not provided. A new\nBayesian method is proposed here to overcome this limitation.\n  Results: We develop a Bayesian hierarchical modeling formulation where the\nposterior mode corresponds to the estimator proposed by Wang et al.\n(Bioinformatics, 2012), and an approach that allows for full posterior\ninference including the construction of interval estimates for the regression\nparameters. We show that the proposed hierarchical model can be expressed as a\nthree-level Gaussian scale mixture and this representation facilitates the use\nof a Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior simulation. Simulation studies\ndemonstrate that the interval estimates obtained using our approach achieve\nadequate coverage probabilities that outperform those obtained from the\nnonparametric bootstrap. Our proposed methodology is applied to the analysis of\nneuroimaging and genetic data collected as part of the Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and this analysis of the ADNI cohort\ndemonstrates clearly the value added of incorporating interval estimation\nbeyond only point estimation when relating SNPs to brain imaging\nendophenotypes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2016 19:16:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Oct 2016 18:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-18"}

In the atomic configurations with hexagonal\nsymmetry, this approach makes it possible to tailor the valleytronic properties\nfor potential device applications. In this work, we present a multi-band theory\nto calculate the valley-dependent electron transport in graphene-based lateral\nquantum structures. As an example, we consider the structures with a single\ninterface that exhibits an energy gap or potential discontinuity. The\ntheoretical formalism proceeds within the tight-binding description, by first\nderiving the local bulk complex band structures in the regions of a constant\ngap or potential and, next, joining the local wave functions across the\ninterface via a cell-averaged current operator to ensure the current\ncontinuity. The theory is applied to the study of electron reflection off and\ntransmission through an interface. Both reflection and transmission are found\nto exhibit valley-contrast behavior that can be used to generate\nvalley-polarized electron sources. The results vary with the type of\ninterfaces, as well as between monolayer and bilayer graphene based structures.\nIn the monolayer case, the valley contrast originates from the band warping and\nonly becomes sizable for incident carriers of high energy; whereas in\nAB-stacked bilayer graphene, the vertical interlayer coupling emerges as an\nadditional important cause for valley contrast, and the favorable carrier\nenergy is also found to be drastically lower. Our numerical results clearly\ndemonstrate the propitious valleytronic properties of bilayer graphene\nstructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 May 2016 21:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-10"}

How coupling between stochastic expression and cell cycle\nimpacts cell-to-cell variability (noise) in the level of protein is not well\nunderstood. We analyze a model, where a stable protein is synthesized in random\nbursts, and the frequency with which bursts occur varies within the cell cycle.\nFormulas quantifying the extent of fluctuations in the protein copy number are\nderived and decomposed into components arising from the cell cycle and\nstochastic processes. The latter stochastic component represents contributions\nfrom bursty expression and errors incurred during partitioning of molecules\nbetween daughter cells. These formulas reveal an interesting trade-off:\ncell-cycle dependencies that amplify the noise contribution from bursty\nexpression also attenuate the contribution from partitioning errors. We\ninvestigate existence of optimum strategies for coupling expression to the cell\ncycle that minimize the stochastic component. Intriguingly, results show that a\nzero production rate throughout the cell cycle, with expression only occurring\njust before cell division minimizes noise from bursty expression for a fixed\nmean protein level. In contrast, the optimal strategy in the case of\npartitioning errors is to make the protein just after cell division.

The ionized region of Sh2-163 is detected by both the\noptical and radio continuum observations. Sh2-163 is partially bordered by an\narc-like photodissociation region (PDR), which is coincident with the strongest\noptical and radio emissions, indicating interactions between the HII region and\nthe surrounding interstellar medium. Two molecular clouds were discovered on\nthe border of the PDR. The morphology of these two clouds suggests they are\ncompressed by the expansion of Sh2-163. In cloud A, we found two molecular\nclumps. And it seems star formation in clump A2 is much more active than in\nclump A1. In cloud B, we found new outflow activities and massive star(s) are\nforming inside. Using 2MASS photometry, we tried to search for embedded young\nstellar object (YSO) candidates in this region. The very good agreement between\nCO emission, infrared shell and YSOs suggest that it is probably a star\nformation region triggered by the expansion of Sh2-163.We also found the most\nlikely massive protostar related to IRAS 23314+6033.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2016 02:19:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-14"}

The\nReynolds number $Re$ defined with the box size and the initial velocity is\n$100$ at which the flows are in a weakly nonlinear regime, i.e. not laminar but\nfar away from the fully turbulent state. The decay of isotropic flow has two\nstages, the first stage for the development of small scales and the second\nstage for the viscous dissipation. In the rapidly rotating flow, fast rotation\ninduces the inertial wave and causes the large-scale structure to inhibit the\ndevelopment of the first stage and retard the flow decay. In the MHD flow, the\nimposed field also causes the large-scale structure but facilitates the flow\ndecay in the first stage because of the energy conversion from flow to magnetic\nfield. Magnetic Reynolds number $Rm$ is important for the dynamics of the MHD\nflow, namely a high $Rm$ induces the Alfv\\'en wave but a low $Rm$ cannot. In\nthe rotating MHD flow, slower rotation tends to convert more kinetic energy to\nmagnetic energy. The orientation between the rotational and magnetic axes is\nimportant for the dynamics of the rotating MHD flow, namely the energy\nconversion is more efficient and the stronger wave is induced when the two axes\nare not parallel than when they are parallel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2016 03:44:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-10"}

However, the diversity of\nblazars is such that these classes seem insufficient to chart the specific\nproperties of each source. We propose to classify a wide sample of blazars\nfollowing the kinematic features of their radio jets seen in very long baseline\ninterferometry (VLBI). For this purpose we use public data from the MOJAVE\ncollaboration in which we select a sample of blazars with known redshift and\nsufficient monitoring to constrain apparent velocities. We selected 161 blazars\nfrom a sample of 200 sources. We identify three distinct classes of VLBI jets\ndepending on radio knot kinematics: class I with quasi-stationary knots, class\nII with knots in relativistic motion from the radio core, and class I/II,\nintermediate, showing quasi-stationary knots at the jet base and relativistic\nmotions downstream. A notable result is the good overlap of this kinematic\nclassification with the usual spectral classification; class I corresponds to\nHBLs, class II to FSRQs, and class I/II to IBLs/LBLs. We deepen this study by\ncharacterizing the physical parameters of jets from VLBI radio data. Hence we\nfocus on the singular case of the class I/II by the study of the blazar BL Lac\nitself. Finally we show how the interpretation that radio knots are\nrecollimation shocks is fully appropriate to describe the characteristics of\nthese three classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2016 04:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

In this\npaper, we present IncVoronoi: a novel system that can provide zero-calibration\naccurate RF-based indoor localization that works in realistic environments. The\nbasic idea is that the relative relation between the received signal strength\nfrom two APs at a certain location reflects the relative distance from this\nlocation to the respective APs. Building on this, IncVoronoi incrementally\nreduces the user ambiguity region based on refining the Voronoi tessellation of\nthe area of interest.

Compared to fingerprinting techniques, whose accuracy\ndegrades by at least 156%, this accuracy comes with no training overhead and is\nrobust to the different user devices, different transmit powers, and over\ntemporal changes in the environment.

However, lack of prior knowledge about the number of\ncommunities, and their overlapping nature have made community detection a\nchallenging problem. Moreover, many of the existing methods only consider\nstatic networks, while most of real world networks are dynamic and evolve over\ntime. Hence, finding consistent overlapping communities in dynamic networks\nwithout any prior knowledge about the number of communities is still an\ninteresting open research problem. In this paper, we present an overlapping\ncommunity detection method for dynamic networks called Dynamic Bayesian\nOverlapping Community Detector (DBOCD). DBOCD assumes that in every snapshot of\nnetwork, overlapping parts of communities are dense areas and utilizes link\ncommunities instead of common node communities. Using Recurrent Chinese\nRestaurant Process and community structure of the network in the last snapshot,\nDBOCD simultaneously extracts the number of communities and soft community\nmemberships of nodes while maintaining the consistency of communities over\ntime. We evaluated DBOCD on both synthetic and real dynamic data-sets to assess\nits ability to find overlapping communities in different types of network\nevolution. The results show that DBOCD outperforms the recent state of the art\ndynamic community detection methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2016 07:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-10"}

The\nfourth eruption although occurring 11 hrs later has an identical morphology,\nthe same angle of propagation with respect to the radial direction, as well as\nsimilar kinematic evolution as the previous three eruptions. We find an\nimportant feature of the homologous eruptive prominence sequence that is the\nmaximum height increase of each consecutive eruption. The present analysis\nestablishes that all four eruptions observed in H{\\alpha} are of confined type\nwith the third eruption undergoing a thermal disappearance during its eruptive\nphase. We suggest that the observation of the same direction of the magnetic\nflux rope (MFR) ejections can be consider as an additional observational\ncriterion for MFR homology. This observational indication for homologous\neruptions is important, especially in the case of events of typical or poorly\ndistinguishable morphology of eruptive solar phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2016 09:31:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 May 2016 17:08:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-01"}

Relying on a related result of Tang (2008) on the\nlong-tail of product convolution, we obtain a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for the subexponentiality of H, given that of F. We also study the\nreverse problem and obtain sufficient conditions for the subexponentiality of F\ngiven that of H. Finally, we apply the obtained results to the asymptotic study\nof the ruin probability in a discrete-time insurance risk model with stochastic\nreturns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2016 13:17:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2016 13:24:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Jul 2016 11:44:04 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 1 Oct 2017 15:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-03"}

The UCT\nalgorithm, which combines the UCB bandit algorithm with MCTS, is a good example\nof the success of this combination. The recent breakthrough made by AlphaGo,\nwhich incorporates convolutional neural networks with bandit algorithms in\nMCTS, also highlights the necessity of bandit algorithms in MCTS. However,\ndespite the various investigations carried out on MCTS, nearly all of them\nstill follow the paradigm of treating every node as an independent instance of\nthe MAB problem, and applying the same bandit algorithm and heuristics on every\nnode. As a result, this paradigm may leave some properties of the game tree\nunexploited. In this work, we propose that max nodes and min nodes have\ndifferent concerns regarding their value estimation, and different bandit\nalgorithms should be applied accordingly. We develop the Asymmetric-MCTS\nalgorithm, which is an MCTS variant that applies a simple regret algorithm on\nmax nodes, and the UCB algorithm on min nodes. We will demonstrate the\nperformance of the Asymmetric-MCTS algorithm on the game of $9\\times 9$ Go,\n$9\\times 9$ NoGo, and Othello.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 May 2016 13:52:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-10"}
