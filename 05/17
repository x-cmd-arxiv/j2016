This poses two\ncomplexities. Firstly, separating the influences of these parameters on\nphysical mechanisms such as energy dissipation. Secondly, correlating\nobservations of shock waves over a wide range of each parameter, enough to span\nacross different regimes. Investigating the latter has been restricted since\nthe majority of studies on shocks at exotic regimes (such as supernova\nremnants) have been achieved either remotely or via simulations, but rarely by\nmeans of in-situ observations. Here we present the parameter space of MA bow\nshock crossings from 2004-2014 as observed by the Cassini spacecraft.

In addition, high\naccuracy astrometric measurements are necessary to measure the inclination of\nthe planet's orbits. Here we investigate the principles of an artefact of the\nastrometric approach. Namely, the displacement of the photo-centre due to\ninhomogeneities in a dust disc around the parent star. Indeed, theory and\nobservations show that circumstellar discs can present strong asymmetries. We\nmodel the pseudo-astrometric signal caused by these inhomogeneities, asking\nwhether a dust clump in a disc can mimic the astrometric signal of an\nEarth-like planet. We show that these inhomogeneities cannot be neglected when\nusing astrometry to find terrestrial planets. We provide the parameter space\nfor which these inhomogeneities can affect the astrometric signals but still\nnot be detected by mid-IR observations. We find that a small cross section of\ndust corresponding to a cometary mass object is enough to mimic the astrometric\nsignal of an Earth-like planet. Astrometric observations of protoplanetary\ndiscs to search for planets can also be affected by the presence of\ninhomogeneities. Some further tests are given to confirm whether an observation\nis a real planet astrometric signal or an impostor. Eventually, we also study\nthe case where the cross section of dust is high enough to provide a detectable\nIR-excess and to have a measurable photometric displacement by actual\ninstruments such as Gaia, IRAC or GRAVITY.

At this\ntime scale, the shot noise of the synchrotron emission process is measurable as\nspeckles, leading to speckle correlation between the two beams. The integrated\ntransmitted intensity from a sample located in the first beam was correlated\nwith the spatially resolved intensity measured on the second, empty, beam to\nretrieve the shadow of the sample.

A key to this interaction is the presence of critical-level\nsingularities or, when planetary rotation is taken into account, inertial-level\nsingularities, where the Doppler-shifted wave frequency matches the local\nCoriolis frequency. We examine the role of the latter singularities by studying\nthe steady wavepacket generated by a multiscale mountain in a rotating linear\nshear flow at low Rossby number. Using a combination of WKB and saddle-point\napproximations, we provide an explicit description of the form of the\nwavepacket, of the mean forcing it induces, and of the mean-flow response.\n  We identify two distinguished regimes of wave propagation: Regime I applies\nfar enough from a dominant inertial level for the standard ray-tracing\napproximation to be valid; Regime II applies to a thin region where the\nwavepacket structure is controlled by the inertial-level singularities. The\nwave--mean-flow interaction is governed by the change in Eliassen--Palm (or\npseudomomentum) flux. This change is localised in a thin inertial layer where\nthe wavepacket takes a limiting form of that found in Regime II. We solve a\nquasi-geostrophic potential-vorticity equation forced by the divergence of the\nEliassen--Palm flux to compute the wave-induced mean flow.

A widely-used evaluation approach is the Naturalistic-Field\nOperational Test (N-FOT), which tests prototype vehicles directly on the public\nroads. Due to the low exposure to safety-critical scenarios, N-FOTs are\ntime-consuming and expensive to conduct. In this paper, we propose an\naccelerated evaluation approach for AVs. The results can be used to generate\nmotions of the primary other vehicles to accelerate the verification of AVs in\nsimulations and controlled experiments. Frontal collision due to unsafe cut-ins\nis the target crash type of this paper. Human-controlled vehicles making unsafe\nlane changes are modeled as the primary disturbance to AVs based on data\ncollected by the University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment Program.\nThe cut-in scenarios are generated based on skewed statistics of collected\nhuman driver behaviors, which generate risky testing scenarios while preserving\nthe statistical information so that the safety benefits of AVs in\nnon-accelerated cases can be accurately estimated. The Cross Entropy method is\nused to recursively search for the optimal skewing parameters. The frequencies\nof occurrence of conflicts, crashes and injuries are estimated for a modeled\nautomated vehicle, and the achieved accelerated rate is around 2,000 to 20,000.\nIn other words, in the accelerated simulations, driving for 1,000 miles will\nexpose the AV with challenging scenarios that will take about 2 to 20 million\nmiles of real-world driving to encounter.

In stars with accretion disks, the\nstellar magnetic field can truncate the inner disk and determine the paths that\nmatter can take to flow onto the star. These paths are different in stars with\ndifferent magnetospheres and periods of rotation. External field lines of the\nmagnetosphere may inflate and produce favorable conditions for outflows from\nthe disk-magnetosphere boundary. Outflows can be particularly strong in the\npropeller regime, wherein a star rotates more rapidly than the inner disk.\nOutflows may also form at the disk-magnetosphere boundary of slowly rotating\nstars, if the magnetosphere is compressed by the accreting matter. In isolated,\nstrongly magnetized stars, the magnetic field can influence formation and/or\npropagation of stellar wind outflows.

The first one is on\ndecomposing polytopes and polynomials in ways that allow us to perform\nnonlinear optimization. We start off by explaining important results on\ndecomposing a polytope into special polyhedra. We use these decompositions and\ndevelop methods for computing a special class of integrals exactly. Namely, we\nare interested in computing the exact value of integrals of polynomial\nfunctions over convex polyhedra. We present prior work and new extensions of\nthe integration algorithms. Every integration method we present requires that\nthe polynomial has a special form. We explore two special polynomial\ndecomposition algorithms that are useful for integrating polynomial functions.\nBoth polynomial decompositions have strengths and weaknesses, and we experiment\nwith how to practically use them.\n  After developing practical algorithms and efficient software tools for\nintegrating a polynomial over a polytope, we focus on the problem of maximizing\na polynomial function over the continuous domain of a polytope. This\nmaximization problem is NP-hard, but we develop approximation methods that run\nin polynomial time when the dimension is fixed. Moreover, our algorithm for\napproximating the maximum of a polynomial over a polytope is related to\nintegrating the polynomial over the polytope. We show how the integration\nmethods can be used for optimization.\n  The second central topic in this dissertation is on problems in data science.\nWe first consider a heuristic for mixed-integer linear optimization. We show\nhow many practical mixed-integer linear have a special substructure containing\nset partition constraints.

To address this, in this\npaper, we propose a novel ensemble clustering approach based on ensemble-driven\ncluster uncertainty estimation and local weighting strategy. In particular, the\nuncertainty of each cluster is estimated by considering the cluster labels in\nthe entire ensemble via an entropic criterion. A novel ensemble-driven cluster\nvalidity measure is introduced, and a locally weighted co-association matrix is\npresented to serve as a summary for the ensemble of diverse clusters. With the\nlocal diversity in ensembles exploited, two novel consensus functions are\nfurther proposed. Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 03:52:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 May 2017 16:35:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 28 Dec 2019 10:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

As $\\lambda$ is of the order nm even for dilute electrolyte\nsolution, even for sub-mm spheres and low volume fraction $f=0.05$ the huge\ngeometric factor $a/\\lambda$ implies an over $10^4$-fold enhancement.\nFurthermore, we show that this enhancement produces a significant low frequency\n($\\omega\\tau_D\\ll1$) phase shift $\\tan\\theta = \\mathrm{Re}~ \\epsilon(\\omega) /\n\\mathrm{Im} ~\\epsilon(\\omega)$ in a simple impedance measurement of the\nmixture, which is usually negligible in pure electrolyte solution.

If some of the parameters of the governing equations\nare unknowns, it is possible to organize the calculations so as to estimate\nthem while following the evolution of the system in time. The underlying\nassumption in the approach that we present is that all unknowns are modelled as\nrandom variables, where the randomness is an indication of the uncertainty of\ntheir values rather than an intrinsic property of the quantities. Consequently,\nthe states of the system and the parameters are described in probabilistic\nterms by their density, often in the form of representative samples. This\napproach is particularly attractive in the context of parameter estimation\ninverse problems, because the statistical formulation naturally provides a\nmeans of assessing the uncertainty in the solution via the spread of the\ndistribution.

The\ndifferences in the values of $L_{\\rm eff}$ are mainly due to the small\ndifferences in the nucleon density distributions of heavy nuclei in the surface\nregion and the behavior of the symmetry energy at subsaturation densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 07:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

Conventionally,\nopportunistic one-bit feedback has been used in fading broadcast channels to\nselect only one user for transmission. In contrast, the considered NOMA scheme\nadopts superposition coding to serve all users simultaneously in order to\nimprove user fairness. A closed-form expression for the common outage\nprobability (COP) is derived, along with the optimal diversity gains under two\ntypes of power constraints. Particularly, it is demonstrated that the diversity\ngain under a long-term power constraint is twice as large as that under a\nshort-term power constraint. Furthermore, we study dynamic power allocation\noptimization for minimizing the COP, based on one-bit CSI feedback. This\nproblem is challenging since the objective function is non-convex; however,\nunder the short-term power constraint, we demonstrate that the original problem\ncan be transformed into a set of convex problems.

All known exact localized solitons-type solutions\ndescribing propagation on the background of the modulationally unstable\ncondensate show the recurrence to the condensate state after its interaction\nwith solitons. The condensate state locally recovers its original form with the\nsame amplitude but a different phase after soliton leave its initial region.\nThis is the analog of the FPU recurrence for the NLSE. Based on the\nintegrability of the NLSE, we demonstrate that the FPU recurrence takes place\nnot only for condensate but for more general solution in the form of the\ncnoidal wave.

The lattice transforms into the\ncondensate in the opposite limit of dense soliton packing. The cnoidal wave is\nalso modulationally unstable due to soliton overlapping. This instability at\nthe linear stage does not provide the cnoidal wave recurrence. The recurrence\nhappens at the nonlinear stage of the modulation instability.

By applying this model to\na very high resolution cosmological $N$-body simulation, we predict a number of\ngalaxy properties that are a very good match to relevant observational data.\nNamely, for both centrals and satellites, the galaxy stellar mass function\n(SMF) up to redshift $z\\simeq4$ and the conditional stellar mass functions\n(CSMF) in the local universe are in good agreement with observations. In\naddition, the 2-point correlation is well predicted in the different stellar\nmass ranges explored by our model. Furthermore, after applying stellar\npopulation synthesis models to our stellar composition as a function of\nredshift, we find that the luminosity functions in $^{0.1}u$, $^{0.1}g$,\n$^{0.1}r$, $^{0.1}i$ and $^{0.1}z$ bands agree quite well with the SDSS\nobservational results down to an absolute magnitude at about -17.0. The SDSS\nconditional luminosity functions (CLF) itself is predicted well. Finally, the\ncold gas is derived from the star formation rate (SFR) to predict the HI gas\nmass within each mock galaxy. We find a remarkably good match to observed\nHI-to-stellar mass ratios. These features ensure that such galaxy/gas catalogs\ncan be used to generate reliable mock redshift surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 10:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

The main objective is to predict parameter regions in which\nstable stratified configuration in inclined channels exists.

The stability boundaries of each branch of steady state solutions are\npresented on the flow pattern map and are accompanied by critical wavenumbers\nand spatial profiles of the most unstable perturbations. Instabilities of\ndifferent nature are visualized by streamlines of the neutrally stable\nperturbed flows, consisting of the critical perturbation superimposed on the\nbase flow. The present analysis confirms the existence of two stable stratified\nflow configurations in a region of low flow rates in countercurrent\nliquid-liquid flows.

It is verified by the simulation results that increasing the\nedge-trials of the MM-PEGA/MM-QC-PEGA is expected to have a positive effect on\nthe cycle-structures and the error performances of the LDPC codes designed by\nthe MM-PEGA/MM-QC-PEGA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 12:01:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-16"}

Second, we classify the\nresampled eGFR time series using a K-NN/SVM classifier, and evaluate its\nperformance via 5-fold cross validation.

We use high-resolution N-body simulations to show that these regions\nare stable in time and hence are excellent tracers of the initial conditions.\nFurthermore, we show that the variance of the Hubble flow can be substantially\nminimized by restricting observations to the subsample of such regions of\nvanishing velocity instead of aiming at increasing the statistics by averaging\nindiscriminately using the full data sets, as is the common approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 13:28:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 07:03:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 May 2016 18:08:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-10"}

Magnetic field corresponds to a Z_3 field in the\neffective model, and under this field, we find that collinear and canted\nantiferro-quadrupole orders compete. Each phase is characterized by symmetry\nbreaking in the sector of (sublattice Z_2)x(reflection Z_2 for the order\nparameter). When Z_3 anisotropy and magnetic field vary, it turns out that this\nsystem is a good playground for various multicritical points; bicritical and\ntetracritical points emerge in a finite field. Another important finding is\nabout the scaling of parasitic ferro quadrupole order at the zero-field\ncritical point. This is the secondary order parameter induced by the primary\nantiferro order, and its critical exponent beta'=0.815 clearly differs from the\nexpected value that is twice the value for the primary order parameter. The\ncorresponding correlation length exponent is also different, nu'=0.597(12). We\nalso discuss relation of the present effective quadrupole models with the\n3-state Potts model as well as implication to undertanding of orbital orders in\nPr-based 1-2-20 compounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 14:11:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Aug 2016 04:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}

Given the lack of ongoing star formation\nor blue stellar populations in these galaxies' outer disks, the most likely\nmechanisms for their formation are dynamical processes such as disk heating or\nradial migration, rather than inside-out growth of the disks.

While this\nsuggests a common secular mechanism for outer disk formation, the large extent\nof these smooth, red stellar populations---which reach several disk\nscalelengths beyond the galaxies' spiral structure---may challenge models of\nradial migration given the lack of any non-axisymmetric forcing at such large\nradii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 14:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

On the other hand, what tweets lack in\nstructure they make up with sheer volume and rich metadata. This metadata\nincludes geolocation, temporal and author information. We hypothesize that\nsentiment is dependent on all these contextual factors. Different locations,\ntimes and authors have different emotional valences. In this paper, we explored\nthis hypothesis by utilizing distant supervision to collect millions of\nlabelled tweets from different locations, times and authors. We used this data\nto analyse the variation of tweet sentiments across different authors, times\nand locations. Once we explored and understood the relationship between these\nvariables and sentiment, we used a Bayesian approach to combine these variables\nwith more standard linguistic features such as n-grams to create a Twitter\nsentiment classifier. This combined classifier outperforms the purely\nlinguistic classifier, showing that integrating the rich contextual information\navailable on Twitter into sentiment classification is a promising direction of\nresearch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 14:51:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2021 03:59:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

Both ground states are\ngeneralized squeezed coherent states saturating a generalized Heisenberg\nuncertainty relation, and they acquire quantized Berry phases when the\ncorresponding systems are transported along a closed path in their parameter\nspaces. While the Berry phase of the BCS ground state depends on the total\nparticle number, the Berry phase of the BEC ground state depends only on the\nparticles outside the BEC. The Berry phases are associated with magnetic\nmonopoles in the parameter spaces and we found that the Dirac quantization\ncondition is satisfied.

While the local dynamical\ncorrelations make $Sr_{2}RuO_{4}$ a Hund's metal, they drive $Ca_{2}RuO_{4}$ to\na Mott insulating ground state. We study the dynamic and static single-particle\nand local irreducible vertex-corrected two-particle responses at three\ndifferent points ($x = 2.0, 0.5, 0.0$) to understand the anomalous cross-over\nfrom Hund's metal ($x = 2.0 $) to a Mott insulator ($x = 0 $) and find that a\nstructural distortion is likely to be responsible for the cross-over. Further,\ndynamical correlations reveal that the band-width ($W$) of the Hund's metal is\nlarger than its effective local Hubbard $U$, and a finite Hund's coupling\n$J_{H}$ helps it remain in a bad metallic and nearly spin-frozen state over a\nlarge temperature range. $Ca_{2}RuO_{4}$, on the other hand, is intrinsically\ndriven to the proximity of a Mott transition due to narrowing of band width\n($U/W > 1.5$), though its finite temperature excitations indicate bad\nmetallicity. We show that there is a critical end point of second-order\nstructural transition at $x = 0.5$, where spin fluctuations become critically\nsingular and follow the exact scaling of conformally invariant boundary field\ntheory. The critical end point of quasi-$3D$ nature is associated with an\neffective dimensional cross-over between the $x = 2.0$ and $x=0.0$ quasi-$2D$\nstructures.

We treat the cosmological perturbations\nin this setup with details to show that with phenomenological interaction,\nperturbations can grow faster than the minimal case.\\\\ {\\bf Keywords}:\nDynamical Systems; Dark Energy; Dark Matter; Non-Minimal Derivative Coupling,\nStatefinder Diagnostic, Cosmological Perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 10:07:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-20"}

The motivation is to explain the phenomenon in experiment [1] under\npolarized light in which a nematic film curls into an circular arc, like part\nof a cylindrical surface. Polarized light triggers photo-isomerization and\ntherefore makes liquid crystals (LCs) contract along their directors. We apply\nthe Sachs limit to homogenize the deformation of polydomain LC glass.\nPhoto-strain can be either contraction or expansion through the material.\nBending shapes can be anticlastic, bowl-shaped and cylindrical affected by\nPoisson ratio and illumination intensity. An explanation for the cylindrical\nbend and ways to observe other shapes are given in a parameter plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 May 2016 14:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

We confirm previously obtained results for\nfermions and show that the free energy for alpha particles is negative and very\nclose to the free energy for ideal Bose gases. Deuterons behave more similarly\nto fermions (positive free energy) rather than bosons. This is due to their low\nbinding energy, which makes them very 'fragile', i.e., easily formed and\ndestroyed. We show that the {\\alpha}-particle fraction is dominant at all\ntemperatures and densities explored in this work. This is consistent with their\nnegative free energy, which favors clusterization of nuclear matter into\n{\\alpha}-particles at subsaturation densities and finite temperatures.
