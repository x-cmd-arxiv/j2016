Here, we try\nto develop a suitable framework to model this varying cosmological constant\n$\\Lambda\\propto\\alpha^{-6}$, in which we view it from an interacting vacuum\nenergy perspective. Then, we consider the observational constraints on these\nmodels by using the 293 $\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha$ data from the absorption systems\nin the spectra of distant quasars. We find that the model parameters can be\ntightly constrained to the very narrow ranges of ${\\cal O}(10^{-5})$ typically.\nOn the other hand, we can also view the varying cosmological constant model\n$\\Lambda\\propto\\alpha^{-6}$ from another perspective, namely it can be\nequivalent to a model containing \"dark energy\" and \"warm dark matter\", but\nthere is no interaction between them.

For iterative solvers, two major reliable\nstrategies of recovery exist: checkpoint-restart for backward recovery, or some\ntype of redundancy technique for forward recovery. Important redundancy\ntechniques like ABFT techniques for sparse matrix-vector products (SpMxV) have\nrecently been proposed, which increase the resilience of CG methods. These\ntechniques offer limited recovery options, and introduce a tolerable overhead.\nIn this work, we study a more powerful resilience concept, which is redundant\nmultithreading. It offers more generic and stronger recovery guarantees,\nincluding any soft faults in CG iterations (among others covering ABFT SpMxV),\nbut also requires more resources. We carefully study this redundancy/efficiency\nconflict. We propose a fault tolerant CG method, called TwinCG, which\nintroduces minimal wallclock time overhead, and significant advantages in\ndetection and correction strategies. Our method uses Dual Modular Redundancy\ninstead of the more expensive Triple Modular Redundancy; still, it retains the\nTMR advantages of fault correction. We describe, implement, and benchmark our\niterative solver, and compare it in terms of efficiency and fault tolerance\ncapabilities to state-of-the-art techniques. We find that before\nparallelization, TwinCG introduces around 5-6% runtime overhead compared to\nstandard CG, and after parallelization efficiently uses BLAS. In the presence\nof faults, it reliably performs forward recovery for a range of problems,\noutperforming SpMxV ABFT solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 2016 17:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-17"}

The main idea is to solve not one, but an entire\nfamily of MDPs, parameterized by a weighting factor $\\zeta$ that appears in the\none-step reward function. For an MDP with $d$ states, the family of value\nfunctions $\\{ h^*_\\zeta : \\zeta\\in\\Re\\}$ is the solution to an ODE, $$\n\\frac{d}{d\\zeta} h^*_\\zeta = {\\cal V}(h^*_\\zeta) $$ where the vector field\n${\\cal V}\\colon\\Re^d\\to\\Re^d$ has a simple form, based on a matrix inverse.\n  This general methodology is applied to a family of average-cost optimal\ncontrol models in which the one-step reward function is defined by\nKullback-Leibler divergence. The motivation for this reward function in prior\nwork is computation: The solution to the MDP can be expressed in terms of the\nPerron-Frobenius eigenvector for an associated positive matrix. The drawback\nwith this approach is that no hard constraints on the control are permitted. It\nis shown here that it is possible to extend this framework to model randomness\nfrom nature that cannot be modified by the controller. Perron-Frobenius theory\nis no longer applicable -- the resulting dynamic programming equations appear\nas complex as a completely unstructured MDP model. Despite this apparent\ncomplexity, it is shown that this class of MDPs admits a solution via this new\nODE technique. This approach is new and practical even for the simpler problem\nin which randomness from nature is absent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 2016 18:48:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Oct 2016 15:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-09-18"}

The orthogonality is understood in a broad sense, and is\ngiven in terms of a nondegenerate continuous sesquilinear form, which in turn\nis determined by a quasidefinite matrix of bivariate generalized functions with\na well defined support. The discussion of the orthogonality for such a\nsesquilinear form includes, among others, matrix Hankel cases with linear\nfunctionals, general matrix Sobolev orthogonality and discrete orthogonal\npolynomials with an infinite support. The first transformation considered is\nthat of Geronimus type, two different methods are developed. A spectral one,\nbased on the spectral properties of the perturbing polynomial, and constructed\nin terms of the second kind functions. Then, using spectral techniques and\nspectral jets, Christoffel-Geronimus formulas for the transformed polynomials\nand norms are presented. For this type of transformations, the paper also\nproposes an alternative method, which does not require of spectral techniques.\nA discussion on matrix spectral linear transformations is presented, as well.\nThese transformations can be understood as rational perturbations of the matrix\nof bivariate generalized functions together with an addition of appropriate\nmasses, determined these last ones by the spectral properties of the polynomial\ndenominator.

Such embeddings have\nproved highly useful in designing fast approximation algorithms, as many hard\nproblems on graphs are easy to solve on tree instances. For a graph with $n$\nvertices and $m$ edges, our algorithm runs in $O(m\\log n)$ time with high\nprobability, which improves the previous upper bound of $O(m\\log^3 n)$ shown by\nMendel et al.\\,in 2009.\n  The key component of our algorithm is a new approximate single-source\nshortest-path algorithm, which implements the priority queue with a new data\nstructure, the \"bucket-tree structure\". The algorithm has three properties: it\nonly requires linear time in the number of edges in the input graph; the\ncomputed distances have a distance preserving property; and when computing the\nshortest-paths to the $k$-nearest vertices from the source, it only requires to\nvisit these vertices and their edge lists.

Investigation of Forman\ncurvature in diverse model and real-world undirected networks revealed that\nthis measure captures several aspects of the organization of complex undirected\nnetworks. However, many important real-world networks are inherently directed\nin nature, and the Forman curvature for undirected networks is unsuitable for\nanalysis of such directed networks. Hence, we here extend the Forman curvature\nfor undirected networks to the case of directed networks. The simple\nmathematical formula for the Forman curvature in directed networks elegantly\nincorporates node weights, edge weights and edge direction. By applying the\nForman curvature for directed networks to a variety of model and real-world\ndirected networks, we show that the measure can be used to characterize the\nstructure of complex directed networks.

Due to the very different sub-channel signal-to-noise\nratios (SNRs) after SVD, complicated bit allocations is usually required to\nmatch the sub-channel SNRs. To solve this problem, we propose a geometric mean\ndecomposition (GMD)-based hybrid precoding scheme to avoid the complicated bit\nallocation. Its basic idea is to seek a pair of analog and digital precoding\nmatrices that are sufficiently close to the optimal unconstrained GMD precoding\nmatrix. Specifically, we design the analog (digital) precoding matrix while\nkeeping the digital (analog) precoding matrix fixed. Further, the principle of\nbasis pursuit is utilized in the design of analog precoding matrix, while we\nobtain the digital precoding matrix by projecting the GMD operation on the\ndigital precoding matrix. Simulation results verify that the proposed GMD-based\nhybird precoding scheme outperforms conventional SVD-based hybrid precoding\nschemes and achieves much better bit error rate (BER) performance with low\ncomplexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2016 09:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-17"}

We have previously\ndiscovered linear polarization signatures associated with individual lines in\nthe spectra of cool and evolved stars. Here, we investigate whether a similar\nlinearly polarized spectrum exists for Betelgeuse. We used the\nspectropolarimeter Narval, combining multiple polarimetric sequences to obtain\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio spectra of individual lines, as well as the\nleast-squares deconvolution (LSD) approach. We have discovered the existence of\na linearly polarized spectrum for Betelgeuse, detecting a rather strong signal\n(at a few times 10$^{-4}$ of the continuum intensity level), both in individual\nlines and in the LSD profiles. Studying its properties and the signal observed\nfor the resonant \\ion{Na}{i}\\,D lines, we conclude that we are mainly observing\ndepolarization of the continuum by the absorption lines. The linear\npolarization of the Betelgeuse continuum is due to the anisotropy of the\nradiation field induced by brightness spots at the surface and Rayleigh\nscattering in the atmosphere. We have developed a geometrical model to\ninterpret the observed polarization, from which we infer the presence of two\nbrightness spots and their positions on the surface of Betelgeuse.

The Bayesian\nframework provides a rigorous mathematical framework for incorporating prior\nknowledge on uncertainty in the observations and the parameters themselves,\nresulting in an approximation of the full probability distribution for the\nparameters, given the data. Although the numerical approximation of the full\nprobability distribution is computationally expensive, parallelised algorithms\ncan make many practically relevant problems computationally feasible. The\nprobability distribution not only provides estimates for the values of the\nparameters, but also provides information about the inferability of parameters\nand the sensitivity of the model. This information is crucial when a\nmathematical model is used to study the outcome of real-world experiments.\nKeeping in mind the applicability of our approach to tackle real-world\npractical problems with data from experiments, in this initial proof of concept\nwork, we apply this theoretical and computational framework to parameter\nidentification for a well studied semilinear reaction-diffusion system with\nactivator-depleted reaction kinetics, posed on evolving and stationary domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2016 10:29:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-17"}

These allow for efficient organization and categorization of items, as\nwell as facilitate relevant search queries. As such, the selected set of tags\nfor an item can have a considerable effect on the volume of traffic that\neventually reaches an item. In settings where tags are chosen by an item's\ncreator, who in turn is interested in maximizing traffic, a principled approach\nfor choosing tags can prove valuable. In this paper we introduce the problem of\noptimal tagging, where the task is to choose a subset of tags for a new item\nsuch that the probability of a browsing user reaching that item is maximized.\nWe formulate the problem by modeling traffic using a Markov chain, and asking\nhow transitions in this chain should be modified to maximize traffic into a\ncertain state of interest. The resulting optimization problem involves\nmaximizing a certain function over subsets, under a cardinality constraint. We\nshow that the optimization problem is NP-hard, but nonetheless has a simple\n(1-1/e)-approximation via a simple greedy algorithm. Furthermore, the structure\nof the problem allows for an efficient implementation of the greedy step.To\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we perform experiments on three\ntagging datasets, and show that the greedy algorithm outperforms other\nbaselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2016 10:30:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 07:16:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 May 2016 15:11:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-20"}

Our aim was to determine the cosmic ray\nionization rate and the depletion factors in this extremely young star forming\nregion. We carried out a spectral survey towards Barnard 1b as part of the IRAM\nLarge program ASAI using the IRAM 30-m telescope at Pico Veleta (Spain).

In fact, it is similar to the values found in\nsome bipolar outflows, hot cores and photon-dominated regions. Several\nscenarios are discussed to account for these peculiar abundances. We propose\nthat it is the consequence of the initial conditions (important outflows and\nenhanced UV fields in the surroundings) and a rapid collapse (~0.1 Myr) that\npermits to maintain most S- and N-bearing species in gas phase to great optical\ndepths. The interaction of the compact outflow associated with B1b-S with the\nsurrounding material could enhance the abundances of S-bearing molecules, as\nwell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2016 10:42:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 May 2016 16:25:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-05"}

However,\na non-perturbative, intrinsic heavy quark PDFs have been predicted in the\nliterature. We demonstrate that to a very good approximation the\nscale-evolution of the intrinsic heavy quark content of the nucleon is governed\nby non-singlet evolution equations, and use this approximation to model the\nintrinsic bottom distribution and its impact on parton-parton luminosities at\nthe LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2016 11:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

This paper provides\nevidence that the pairwise model, applied to experimental recordings, predicts\na bimodal distribution for the population-averaged activity, and for some\npopulation sizes the second mode peaks at high activities, with 90% of the\nneuron population active within time-windows of few milliseconds. This\nbimodality has several undesirable consequences: 1. The presence of two modes\nis unrealistic in view of observed neuronal activity. 2. The prediction of a\nhigh-activity mode is unrealistic on neurobiological grounds. 3. Boltzmann\nlearning becomes non-ergodic, hence the pairwise model found by this method is\nnot the maximum entropy distribution; similarly, solving the inverse problem by\ncommon variants of mean-field approximations has the same problem. 4. The\nGlauber dynamics associated with the model is either unrealistically bistable,\nor does not reflect the distribution of the pairwise model. This bimodality is\nfirst demonstrated for an experimental dataset comprising 159 neuron activities\nrecorded from the motor cortex of macaque monkey. Using a reduced\nmaximum-entropy model, evidence is then provided that this bimodality affects\ntypical neural recordings of population sizes of a couple of hundreds or more\nneurons. As a way to eliminate the bimodality and its ensuing problems, a\nmodified pairwise model is presented, which -- most important -- has an\nassociated pairwise Glauber dynamics. This model avoids bimodality thanks to a\nminimal asymmetric inhibition. It can be interpreted as a\nminimum-relative-entropy model with a particular prior, or as a maximum-entropy\nmodel with an additional constraint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2016 11:58:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-24"}

In\nthis paper we present a formal model of HSA which can be used in the\ndevelopment and verification of both concurrent software applications as well\nas in the development and verification of the HSA-compliant platform itself.

We notice that QC is generally not conserved and that even incoherent\ninitial states can lead to transitory system-environment QC. We show that for\nthe amplitude damping channel the evolved total QC can be written as the sum of\nlocal and non-local parts, with the last one being equal to entanglement. On\nthe other hand, for the phase damping channel (PDC) entanglement does not\naccount for all non-local QC, with the gap between them depending on time and\nalso on the qubit's initial state. Besides these issues, the possibility and\nconditions for time invariance of QC are regarded in the case of bit, phase,\nand bit-phase flip channels. Here we reveal the qualitative dynamical\ninequivalence between these channels and the PDC and show that the creation of\nsystem-environment entanglement does not necessarily imply in the destruction\nof the qubit's QC. We also investigate the resources needed for non-local QC\ncreation, showing that while the PDC requires initial coherence of the qubit,\nfor some other channels non-zero population of the excited state (i.e., energy)\nis sufficient. Related to that, considering the depolarizing channel we notice\nthe qubit's ability to act as a catalyst for the creation of joint QC and\nentanglement, without need for nonzero initial QC or excited state population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2016 12:32:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Aug 2016 13:38:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2017 12:53:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-10"}

This can be described by a general parameterisation of the\ninitial conditions that takes into account the possible direction-dependence of\nboth the amplitude and the phase of particle creation during inflation. The\nleading effect in the CMBR two-point function is typically a quadrupole\nmodulation, whose coefficient is analytically constrained here to be $|B|\n\\lesssim 0.06$. The CMBR three-point function then acquires enhanced\nnon-gaussianity, especially for the local configurations. In the large\noccupation number limit, a distinctive prediction is a modulation of the\nnon-gaussianity around a mean value depending on the angle that short and long\nwavelength modes make with the preferred direction. The maximal variations with\nrespect to the mean value occur for the configurations which are coplanar with\nthe preferred direction and the amplitude of the non-gaussianity increases\n(decreases) for the short wavelength modes aligned with (perpendicular to) the\npreferred direction. For a high scale model of inflation with maximally pumped\nup isotropic occupation and $\\epsilon\\simeq 0.01$ the difference between these\ntwo configurations is about $0.27$, which could be detectable in the future.\nFor purely anisotropic particle creation, the non-Gaussianity can be larger and\nits anisotropic feature very sharp.

A novel method of detecting\nchanges in delays is used to identify congested links, and a packet forwarding\nmodel is employed to predict traffic paths and to identify faulty routers in\ncase of packet loss. In addition, aggregating results from each method allows\nus to easily monitor a network and identify coordinated reports manifesting\nsignificant network disruptions, reducing uninteresting alarms.

The comparison shows that the spatial correlation of maps of\nradiative losses and acoustic flux is 72 %. In quiet chromosphere, the\ncontribution of acoustic energy flux to radiative losses is small, only of\nabout 15 %. In active areas with photospheric magnetic field strength between\n300 G and 1300 G and inclination of 20-60 degrees, the contribution increases\nfrom 23 % (chromospheric network) to 54 % (a plage). However, these values have\nto be considered as lower limits and it might be possible that the acoustic\nenergy flux is the main contributor to the heating of bright chromospheric\nnetwork and plages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2016 15:04:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

We derive conditions under which our estimator is unbiased---these\nconditions are weaker than prior heuristics for slate evaluation---and\nexperimentally demonstrate a smaller bias than parametric approaches, even when\nthese conditions are violated. Finally, our theory and experiments also show\nexponential savings in the amount of required data compared with general\nunbiased estimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2016 15:47:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 10:34:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2017 22:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-08"}

Using numerical simulations we show, how light concentration is\ninduced by high optical cross sections of the individual SiNWs but cannot be\noptimized independently of the SiNW array absorption. While an ideal spatial\ndensity exists, for which the SiNW array absorption for VIS and NIR wavelengths\nreaches a maximum, the spatial correlation of SiNWs in an array suppresses the\nformation of optical Mie modes responsible for light concentration. We show\nthat different from SiNWs with straight sidewalls, arrays of inverted silicon\nnanocones (SiNCs) permit to avoid the mode suppression. In fact they give rise\nto an altered set of photonic modes which is induced by the spatial correlation\nof SiNCs in the array, and therefore show a higher degree of freedom to\nindependently optimize light absorption and light concentration. Apart from\nexplaining the good light absorbing and concentrating properties of SiNC\narrays, the work justifies a revaluation of SiNW arrays as optical absorbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2016 15:51:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-17"}

Such a theory, based on a metric-affine $U_4$ manifold, is\nconstructed with the torsion pseudo-vector $\\Gamma_\\mu$ linking gravity and\nelectromagnetism. This conceptually simple extension results in (i) Einstein's\nequations being modified by a vacuum energy $\\Gamma_\\mu\\Gamma_\\nu$ and a scalar\nfield $\\Gamma = \\Gamma^\\mu\\Gamma_\\mu$ whose zero-mode is a cosmological\nconstant $\\Lambda$ representing `dark energy', (ii) most of the salient\nfeatures of `dark matter'-like phenomena, (iii) a modified electrodynamics\nsatisfying Heaviside duality, (iv) a finite and small Casimir Effect, and at\nthe same time, (v) the empirical Schuster-Blackett-Wilson relation for the\namazingly universal gyromagnetic ratio of slowly rotating, neutral\nastrophysical bodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 May 2016 06:15:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 May 2016 02:56:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2018 09:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-30"}

In this paper we design a scalable system in which an\nindefinite number of passively receiving wireless units can synchronize to a\nsingle master clock at the level of discrete clock ticks. Accurate\nsynchronization requires an estimate of the node positions. If such information\nis available the framework developed here takes position uncertainties into\naccount. In the absence of such information we propose a mechanism which\nenables simultaneous synchronization and positioning. Furthermore we derive the\nCramer-Rao bounds for the system which show that it enables synchronization\naccuracy at sub-nanosecond levels. Finally, we develop and evaluate an online\nestimation method which is statistically efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 May 2016 18:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-04"}
