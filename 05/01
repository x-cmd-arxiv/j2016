A particular example is the planar Fabry-Perot (FP)\nscanner, which yields high-resolution images but takes several minutes to\nsequentially map the photoacoustic field on the sensor plane, point-by-point.\nHowever, as the spatio-temporal complexity of many absorbing tissue structures\nis rather low, the data recorded in such a conventional, regularly sampled\nfashion is often highly redundant. We demonstrate that combining variational\nimage reconstruction methods using spatial sparsity constraints with the\ndevelopment of novel PAT acquisition systems capable of sub-sampling the\nacoustic wave field can dramatically increase the acquisition speed while\nmaintaining a good spatial resolution: First, we describe and model two general\nspatial sub-sampling schemes. Then, we discuss how to implement them using the\nFP scanner and demonstrate the potential of these novel compressed sensing PAT\ndevices through simulated data from a realistic numerical phantom and through\nmeasured data from a dynamic experimental phantom as well as from in-vivo\nexperiments. Our results show that images with good spatial resolution and\ncontrast can be obtained from highly sub-sampled PAT data if variational image\nreconstruction methods that describe the tissues structures with suitable\nsparsity-constraints are used. In particular, we examine the use of total\nvariation regularization enhanced by Bregman iterations. These novel\nreconstruction strategies offer new opportunities to dramatically increase the\nacquisition speed of PAT scanners that employ point-by-point sequential\nscanning as well as reducing the channel count of parallelized schemes that use\ndetector arrays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2016 16:20:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2016 12:11:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2016 14:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

The directors of the nematic elastomer are assumed to lie in a plane\nparallel to the plane of the undeformed film. For uniaxial compression of the\nfilm along the direction perpendicular to the elastomer directors, the system\nbehaves as a compressed film on an isotropic substrate. When the uniaxial\ncompression is along the direction of nematic order, we find that the soft\nelasticity characteristic of liquid crystal elastomers leads to a critical\nstress for wrinkling which is very small compared to the case of an isotropic\nsubstrate. We also determine the wavelength of the wrinkles at the critical\nstress, and show how the critical stress and wavelength depend on substrate\ndepth and the anisotropy of the polymer chains in the nematic elastomer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2016 16:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-06"}

Recent experimental realizations of Dirac\nsemimetal phases pave the way to look for other exotic phases of matter in real\nmaterials. Here we present a systematic angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) study of NdSb, a potential candidate for hosting a Dirac\nsemi-metal phase. Our studies reveal two hole-like Fermi surface pockets\npresent at the zone center ($\\Gamma$) point as well as two elliptical\nelectron-pockets present in the zone corner (X) point of the Brillouin zone\n(BZ). Interestingly, Dirac-like linearly dispersive states are observed about\nthe zone corner (X) point in NdSb. Our first principles calculations agree with\nthe experimentally observed bands at the $\\Gamma$ point. Moreover, the\nDirac-like state observed in NdSb may be a novel correlated state, not yet\npredicted in calculations. Our study opens a new direction to look for Dirac\nsemi-metal states in other members of the rare earth monopnictide family.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2016 18:38:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-13"}

In this work, we study idle time distributions in\nwireless local area networks (WLAN) using large amount of the channel idle time\ndata collected in real-world WLAN networks. We demonstrate with experimental\ndata that the channel idle time distribution can be closely modeled by\nhyper-exponential distribution. Furthermore, one can treat the primary packet\narrival process as a semi-Markov modulated Poisson process. Several secondary\ntransmission strategies are discussed under this model. It is shown that using\nonly one hyper-exponential distribution, the secondary user can achieve a\ndesirable performance when the primary packet arrival process is stationary.\nHowever, experimental data suggests that in practice, this process is not\nstationary and the secondary user can experience a large performance loss with\nstationary transmission strategy.

Unfortunately, these methods do not necessarily\nachieve their goal of making the multivariate distribution of covariates for\nthe control group identical to that of the treated, leaving some (potentially\nmultivariate) functions of the covariates with different means between the two\ngroups. When these \"imbalanced\" functions influence the non-treatment potential\noutcome, the conditioning on observed covariates fails, and ATT estimates may\nbe biased. Kernel balancing, introduced here, targets a weaker requirement for\nunbiased ATT estimation, specifically, that the expected non-treatment\npotential outcome for the treatment and control groups are equal. The\nconditional expectation of the non-treatment potential outcome is assumed to\nfall in the space of functions associated with a choice of kernel, implying a\nset of basis functions in which this regression surface is linear. Weights are\nthen chosen on the control units such that the treated and control group have\nequal means on these basis functions. As a result, the expectation of the\nnon-treatment potential outcome must also be equal for the treated and control\ngroups after weighting, allowing unbiased ATT estimation by subsequent\ndifference in means or an outcome model using these weights. Moreover, the\nweights produced are (1) precisely those that equalize a particular\nkernel-based approximation of the multivariate distribution of covariates for\nthe treated and control, and (2) equivalent to a form of stabilized inverse\npropensity score weighting, though it does not require assuming any model of\nthe treatment assignment mechanism.

On the other hand, inspired by this\nformalism, we state and prove a {\\it multilinear minimax theorem}, a\ngeneralization of von Neumann's bilinear minimax theorem. As in the bilinear\ncase, the proof is based on relating the underlying optimizations to a\nprimal-dual pair of linear programming problems, albeit more complicated LPs.\nThe theorem together with its proof is of independent interest. Next, we use\nthe theorem to associate to a multilinear form in NE a {\\it multilinear minimax\nrelaxation} (MMR), where the primal-dual pair of solutions induce an\napproximate equilibrium point that provides a nontrivial upper bound on a\nconvex combination of {\\it expected payoffs} in any NE solution.

Our\nmodels make use of modern ab initio equations of state at high pressures for\nthe icy components water, methane, and ammonia. Proceeding step by step, we\nconfirm that adiabatic models yield cooling times that are too long, even when\nuncertainties in the ice:rock ratio (I:R) are taken into account. We then argue\nthat the transition between the ice/rock-rich interior and the H/He-rich outer\nenvelope should be stably stratified. Therefore, we introduce a simple thermal\nboundary and adjust it to reproduce the low luminosity. Due to this thermal\nboundary, the deep interior of the Uranus models are up to 2--3 warmer than\nadiabatic models, necessitating the presence of rocks in the deep interior with\na possible I:R of $1\\times$ solar. Finally, we allow for an equilibrium\nevolution (Teff ~ Teq) that begun prior to the present day, which would\ntherefore no longer require the current era to be a \"special time\" in Uranus'\nevolution. In this scenario, the thermal boundary leads to more rapid cooling\nof the outer envelope. When Teff ~ Teq is reached, a shallow, subadiabatic zone\nin the atmosphere begins to develop.

We consider a stochastic formulation where\nthe context-reward tuples are independently drawn from an unknown distribution\nin each trial. Motivated by networking applications, we analyze a setting where\nthe reward is a known non-linear function of the context and the chosen arm's\ncurrent state. We first consider the case of discrete and finite context-spaces\nand propose DCB($\\epsilon$), an algorithm that we prove, through a careful\nanalysis, yields regret (cumulative reward gap compared to a distribution-aware\ngenie) scaling logarithmically in time and linearly in the number of arms that\nare not optimal for any context, improving over existing algorithms where the\nregret scales linearly in the total number of arms.

When a fusion rule is fixed,\nthis paper attempts to make progress on this problem for the large sensor\nnetworks by proposing a new Monte Carlo framework. Through the Monte Carlo\nimportance sampling, we derive a necessary condition for optimal sensor\ndecision rules in the sense of minimizing the approximated Bayesian cost\nfunction. Then, a Gauss-Seidel/person-by-person optimization algorithm can be\nobtained to search the optimal sensor decision rules. It is proved that the\ndiscretized algorithm is finitely convergent. The complexity of the new\nalgorithm is $O(LN)$ compared with $O(LN^L)$ of the previous algorithm where\n$L$ is the number of sensors and $N$ is a constant. Thus, the proposed methods\nallows us to design the large sensor networks with general high-dimension\ndependent observations. Furthermore, an interesting result is that, for the\nfixed AND or OR fusion rules, we can analytically derive the optimal solution\nin the sense of minimizing the approximated Bayesian cost function. In general,\nthe solution of the Gauss-Seidel algorithm is only local optimal. However, in\nthe new framework, we can prove that the solution of Gauss-Seidel algorithm is\nsame as the analytically optimal solution in the case of the AND or OR fusion\nrule. The typical examples with dependent observations and large number of\nsensors are examined under this new framework.

The tradeoff is characterized by an information-theoretic\nmetric, \\emph{normalized delivery time} (NDT), which is the worst-case delivery\ntime of the actual traffic load at a transmission rate specified by degrees of\nfreedom (DoF) of a given channel. We obtain both an achievable upper bound and\na theoretical lower bound of the minimum NDT for any number of transmitters,\nany number of receivers, and any feasible cache size tuple. We show that the\nachievable NDT is exactly optimal in certain cache size regions, and is within\na bounded multiplicative gap to the theoretical lower bound in other regions.\nIn the achievability analysis, we first propose a novel cooperative\ntransmitter/receiver coded caching strategy. It offers the freedom to adjust\nfile splitting ratios for NDT minimization. We then propose a delivery strategy\nwhich transforms the considered interference network into a new class of\ncooperative X-multicast channels. It leverages local caching gain, coded\nmulticasting gain, and transmitter cooperation gain (via interference alignment\nand interference neutralization) opportunistically. Finally, the achievable NDT\nis obtained by solving a linear programming problem.

This secondary network has a restriction on the maximum\ninterference it can cause to the original network.

For the 2512 AGN\nwhich have reliable spectroscopy, we present the X-ray spectral fitting which\nhas been computed with a Bayesian approach. We have also applied an X-ray\nspectral stacking method to different sub-samples. We confirm the well-known\nIwasawa-Taniguchi effect in our luminosity-redshift sub-samples, and argue that\nsuch an effect is due to a decrease in the covering factor of a distant\nobscuring torus with increasing X-ray luminosity. By comparing the distribution\nof the reflection fraction, the ratio of the normalization of the reflected\ncomponent to the direct radiation, we find that the low-luminosity,\nlow-redshift sub-sample had systematically higher reflection fraction values\nthan the high-redshift, high-luminosity one. On the other hand, no significant\ndifference is found between samples having similar luminosity but different\nredshift, suggesting that the structure of the torus does not evolve strongly\nwith redshift. Contrary to previous works, we do not find evidence for an\nincreasing photon index at high Eddington ratio. This may be an indication that\nthe structure of the accretion disc changes as the Eddington ratio approaches\nunity. Comparing our X-ray spectral analysis results with the optical spectral\nclassification, we find that $\\sim20$ per cent of optical type-1 AGN show an\nX-ray absorbing column density higher than $10^{21.5}\\,\\rm{cm^{-2}}$, and about\n50 per cent of type-2 AGN have an X-ray absorbing column density less than\n$10^{21.5}\\,\\rm{cm^{-2}}$. We suggest that the excess X-ray absorption shown in\nthe high-luminosity optical type-1 AGN can be due to small-scale dust-free gas\nwithin (or close to) the broad line region, while in the low-luminosity ones it\ncan be due to a clumpy torus with a large covering factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2016 07:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-03"}

For natural parity states the results are very close to the\npredictions of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) for the nearest-neighbor spacing\ndistribution. A quantitative estimate of the agreement is given by the Brody\nparameter $\\omega$, which takes the value $\\omega=0$ for regular systems and\n$\\omega \\simeq 1$ for chaotic systems. We obtain $\\omega=0.85 \\pm 0.02$ which\nis, to our knowledge, the closest value to chaos ever observed in experimental\nbound states of nuclei. By contrast, the results for unnatural parity states\nare far from RMT behavior. We interpret these results as a consequence of the\nstrength of the residual interaction in $^{208}$Pb, which, according to\nexperimental data, is much stronger for natural than for unnatural parity\nstates. In addition our results show that chaotic and non-chaotic nuclear\nstates coexist in the same energy region of the spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2016 07:17:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

The molecule is modelled by an\nasymmetric double-well potential. Each well is semi-locally connected to a heat\nbath composed of spins. The dynamics is driven by a combined system-bath\nHamiltonian. The temperature of the baths is regulated by a secondary spin bath\ncomposed of identical spins in thermal equilibrium.

The bounds hold for general estimators, but they are optimized\nwhen applied to $\\eta$-generalized Bayesian, MDL, and empirical risk\nminimization estimators. In the case of log loss, the bounds imply convergence\nrates for generalized Bayesian inference under misspecification in terms of a\ngeneralization of the Hellinger metric as long as the learning rate $\\eta$ is\nset correctly. For general loss functions, our bounds rely on two separate\nconditions: the $v$-GRIP (generalized reversed information projection)\nconditions, which control the lower tail of the excess loss; and the newly\nintroduced witness condition, which controls the upper tail. The parameter $v$\nin the $v$-GRIP conditions determines the achievable rate and is akin to the\nexponent in the Tsybakov margin condition and the Bernstein condition for\nbounded losses, which the $v$-GRIP conditions generalize; favorable $v$ in\ncombination with small model complexity leads to $\\tilde{O}(1/n)$ rates. The\nwitness condition allows us to connect the excess risk to an \"annealed\" version\nthereof, by which we generalize several previous results connecting Hellinger\nand R\\'enyi divergence to KL divergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2016 13:35:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2017 07:39:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2018 16:26:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 2019 18:36:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-06"}

The\n3rd and 5th harmonic signals from SPIONs mixed with blood induced by AMF were\ndetected using a gradiometer coil. Blood coagulation was induced artificially\nby adding CaCl2 solution to whole blood of sheep at various temperatures and\nhematocrits. We calculated the coagulation rate (k) and normalized signal\nintensity at infinite time (Sinf) by fitting the time course of the normalized\n3rd harmonic signal to S(t)=(1-Sinf)exp(-kt)+Sinf. The k values increased\nsignificantly with increasing temperature and decreased significantly with\nincreasing hematocrit. The Sinf values decreased significantly with increasing\ntemperature and tended to increase with increasing hematocrit. Blood\nanticoagulation was induced by adding heparin to the whole blood sampled from\nmice. There were significant differences in both the 3rd and 5th harmonic\nsignals between groups with and without heparin at 25 min or more after adding\nheparin. We also calculated the 3rd and 5th harmonic signals for viscosities\nranging from 0.001 to 1 kg/m/s, with an assumption that the magnetization and\nparticle size distribution of SPIONs obey the Langevin theory of paramagnetism\nand log-normal distribution, respectively. The 3rd and 5th harmonic signals\nincreased slowly with increasing viscosity and had peaks at approximately 0.015\nand 0.025 kg/m/s, respectively. After these peaks, they decreased monotonically\nwith increasing viscosity. These results confirm the rationale of our method.\nIn conclusion, our method will be useful for measuring blood coagulation and\nanticoagulation and for studying their processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 May 2016 14:11:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2019 06:05:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-08"}

As such, IST is non-classical. The geometry of $I_U$ is\nbased on Cantor sets of space-time trajectories in state space, homeomorphic to\nthe algebraic set of $p$-adic integers, for large but finite $p$. In IST, the\nnon-commutativity of position and momentum observables arises from number\ntheory - in particular the non-commensurateness of $\\phi$ and $\\cos \\phi$. The\ncomplex Hilbert Space and the relativistic Dirac Equation respectively are\nshown to describe $I_U$, and evolution on $I_U$, in the singular limit of IST\nat $p=\\infty$; particle properties such as de Broglie relationships arise from\nthe helical geometry of trajectories on $I_U$ in the neighbourhood of $\\mathcal\nM_U$. With the p-adic metric as a fundamental measure of distance on $I_U$,\ncertain key perturbations which seem conspiratorially small relative to the\nmore traditional Euclidean metric, take points away from $I_U$ and are\ntherefore unphysically large. This allows (the $\\psi$-epistemic) IST to evade\nthe Bell and Pusey et al theorems without fine tuning or other objections. In\nIST, the problem of quantum gravity becomes one of combining the\npseudo-Riemannian metric of $\\mathcal M_U$ with the p-adic metric of $I_U$. A\ngeneralisation of the field equations of general relativity which can achieve\nthis is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2016 16:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-04"}
