The x=0 compound goes paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase at a\ntemperature 64K followed by a broad peak at a temperature 100K . But in x=0.2\ncompound the antiferromagnetic transition temperature has been shifted towards\nthe lower temperature to 47.5K with a broad peak at temperature 79K. On the\ndoping of Ru at Ti site a sharp anomaly is observed 47.5K in the case of x=0.2\ncompound. This sharp anomaly attributes to the improved 3D character of\nmagnetism in this compound which is weak in x=0 compound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 16:02:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-19"}

However, the role of\nlarge-scale environment versus one-on-one interactions in triggering different\ntypes of AGN is still uncertain. We present a statistical study of the\nprevalence of the nuclear activity in isolated galaxies and physically bound\nisolated pairs. For the purpose of this study we considered optically and radio\nselected nuclear activity types. We aim to assess the effect of one-on-one\ninteraction on the fraction of AGN and the role of their large-scale\nenvironment. To study the effect of one-on-one interaction on the fraction of\nAGN in isolated galaxy pairs, we compare with a sample of isolated galaxies\nhomogeneously selected under the same isolation criterion. We examine the\neffect of the large-scale environment by comparing with control samples of\nsingle galaxies and galaxy pairs. In general we found no difference in the\nprevalence of optical AGN for the considered samples. For massive galaxies, the\nfraction of optical AGN in isolated galaxies is slightly higher than that in\ncontrol samples. Also the fraction of passives in high mass isolated galaxies\nis smaller than in any other sample. Generally, there is no dependence on\noptical nuclear activity with local environment. On the other hand, we found\nevidence that radio AGN are strongly affected by the local environment. Optical\nAGN phenomenon is related to cold gas accretion, while radio AGN is related to\nhot gas accretion. In this context, there is more cold gas, fueling the central\noptical AGN, in isolated systems. Our results are in agreement with a scenario\nwhere cold gas accretion by secular evolution is the main driver of optical\nAGN, while hot gas accretion and one-on-one interactions are the main drivers\nof radio AGN activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 16:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-13"}

The\nresponse is assumed to be related to the predictor via a regression model of\nunknown parameters. Often, in such models the parameters to be estimated are\nassumed to be constant. Here we consider the more general scenario where the\nparameters are allowed to evolve over time, a more natural assumption for many\napplications. We model these dynamics via a linear update equation with\nadditive noise that is often used in a wide range of engineering applications,\nparticularly in the well-known and widely used Kalman filter (where the system\nstate it seeks to estimate maps to the parameter values here). We derive an\napproximate algorithm to estimate both the mean and the variance of the\nparameter estimates in an online fashion for a generic regression model. This\nalgorithm turns out to be equivalent to the extended Kalman filter. We\nspecialize our algorithm to the multivariate exponential family distribution to\nobtain a generalization of the generalized linear model (GLM). Because the\ncommon regression models encountered in practice such as logistic, exponential\nand multinomial all have observations modeled through an exponential family\ndistribution, our results are used to easily obtain algorithms for online mean\nand variance parameter estimation for all these regression models in the\ncontext of time-dependent parameters. Lastly, we propose to use these\nalgorithms in the contextual multi-armed bandit scenario, where so far model\nparameters are assumed static and observations univariate and Gaussian or\nBernoulli. Both of these restrictions can be relaxed using the algorithms\ndescribed here, which we combine with Thompson sampling to show the resulting\nperformance on a simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 19:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-19"}

These prompt neutrons have been used for active\ninterrogation to detect nuclear materials, the first such demonstration of a\nlaser-driven neutron source. During the experiments, delayed neutrons from\n$^9$Li decay was observed. It was identified by its characteristic half-life of\n178.3 ms. Production is attributed to the nuclear reactions $^9$Be(d,2p)$^9$Li\nand $^9$Be(n,p)$^9$Li inside the beryllium converter itself. These reactions\nhave energy thresholds of 18.42 and 14.26 MeV respectively, and we estimate the\n(d,2p) reaction to be the dominant source of $^9$Li production. Therefore, only\nthe higher-energy portion of the deuteron spectrum contributes to the\nproduction of the delayed neutrons. It was observed that the delayed-neutron\nyield decreases with increasing distance between the converter and the deuteron\nsource. This behavior is consistent with deuteron production with energy\ngreater than $\\sim$20 MeV within a cone with a half-angle greater than\n40$^{\\circ}$. Prompt-neutron time-of-flight measurements at varying separation\nbetween the converter and the laser target indicate that the fast deuteron\npopulation above threshold is severely depleted on axis out to\n$\\sim$20$^{\\circ}$. These measurements are consistent with emission of the fast\ndeuterons (i.e., above 10 MeV/nucleon) in a ring-like fashion around the\ncentral axis. Such an inferred ring-like structure is qualitatively consistent\nwith a documented signature of the breakout afterburner (BOA) laser-plasma ion\nacceleration mechanism. The measurement of $\\beta$-delayed neutrons from $^9$Li\ndecay could provide an important new diagnostic tool for the study of the\nfeatures of the deuteron production mechanism in a non-intrusive way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 19:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-19"}

These null points and their associated\nseparatrix and spine field lines represent discontinuities of the field line\nmapping, making them preferential locations for reconnection. This field line\nmapping also exhibits strong gradients adjacent to the separatrix (fan) and\nspine field lines, that can be analysed using the `squashing factor', $Q$. In\nthis paper we make a detailed analysis of the distribution of $Q$ in the\npresence of magnetic nulls. While $Q$ is formally infinite on both the spine\nand fan of the null, the decay of $Q$ away from these structures is shown in\ngeneral to depend strongly on the null-point structure. For the generic case of\na non-radially-symmetric null, $Q$ decays most slowly away from the spine/fan\nin the direction in which $|{\\bf B}|$ increases most slowly. In particular,\nthis demonstrates that the extended, elliptical high-$Q$ halo around the spine\nfootpoints observed by Masson et al. (Astrophys. J., 700, 559, 2009) is a\ngeneric feature. This extension of the $Q$ halos around the spine/fan\nfootpoints is important for diagnosing the regions of the photosphere that are\nmagnetically connected to any current layer that forms at the null. In light of\nthis, we discuss how our results can be used to interpret the geometry of\nobserved flare ribbons in `circular ribbon flares', in which typically a\ncoronal null is implicated. We conclude that both the physics in the vicinity\nof the null and how this is related to the extension of $Q$ away from the\nspine/fan can be used in tandem to understand observational signatures of\nreconnection at coronal null points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 19:09:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-29"}

The\ngeneralization improves the sampling performance using the information gained\nfrom the available graph weights. An analysis of the number of samples required\nby the proposed algorithm is provided, and the gain over the unweighted method\nis further demonstrated in simulations.

We name the improved\nscheme as the \"normalized RFF (NRFF)\".\n  We also propose the \"generalized min-max (GMM)\" kernel as a measure of data\nsimilarity. GMM is positive definite as there is an associated hashing method\nnamed \"generalized consistent weighted sampling (GCWS)\" which linearizes this\nnonlinear kernel. We provide an extensive empirical evaluation of the RBF\nkernel and the GMM kernel on more than 50 publicly available datasets.

However, video transcoding is computing\nintensive, which requires the transcoding service providers to deploy a large\nnumber of servers for transcoding the video contents published by the content\nproducers. As such, a natural question for the transcoding service provider is\nhow to provision the computing resource for transcoding the video contents\nwhile maximizing service profit. To address this problem, we design a cloud\nvideo transcoding system by taking the advantage of cloud computing technology\nto elastically allocate computing resource. We propose a method for jointly\nconsidering the task scheduling and resource provisioning problem in two\ntimescales, and formulate the service profit maximization as a two-timescale\nstochastic optimization problem. We derive some approximate policies for the\ntask scheduling and resource provisioning. Based on our proposed methods, we\nimplement our open source cloud video transcoding system Morph and evaluate its\nperformance in a real environment. The experiment results demonstrate that our\nproposed method can reduce the resource consumption and achieve a higher profit\ncompared with the baseline schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 21:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-20"}

In many of these applications it is imperative to understand the\nphysics of interaction of electrons in a SN with external electromagnetic\nfields on the quantitative level. In particular, the strength of\nelectron-photon coupling determines such important SN parameters as the\nradiative lifetime and absorption cross section. This strength is often assumed\nto be fully encoded by the so called Kane momentum matrix element. This\nparameter, however, pertains to a bulk semiconductor material and, as such, is\nnot sensitive to the quantum confinement effects in SNs. In this work we\ndemonstrate that the quantum confinement, via the so called band mixing, can\nresult in a significant suppression of the strength of electron interaction\nwith electromagnetic field. Within the envelope function formalism we show how\nthis suppression can be described by introducing an effective energy-dependent\nKane momentum. Then, the effect of band mixing on the efficiencies of various\nphotoinduced processes can be fully captured by the conventional formulae\n(e.g., spontaneous emission rate), once the conventional Kane momentum is\nsubstituted with the renormalized energy-dependent Kane momentum introduced in\nhere. As an example, we evaluate the energy-dependent Kane momentum for\nspherical $\\rm{PbSe}$ and $\\rm{PbS}$ SNs (i.e., quantum dots) and show that\nneglecting band mixing in these systems can result in the overestimation of\nabsorption cross sections and emission rates by a factor of $\\sim$2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 21:27:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 May 2016 00:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

We discuss this by formulating the problem as a\ndetection problem. Model selection problems usually minimize a distance between\nthe original distribution and the model distribution. For the special case of\nGaussian distributions, the model selection problem simplifies to the\ncovariance selection problem which is widely discussed in literature by\nDempster [2] where the likelihood criterion is maximized or equivalently the\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is minimized to compute the model covariance\nmatrix. While this solution is optimal for Gaussian distributions in the sense\nof the KL divergence, it is not optimal when compared with other information\ndivergences and criteria such as Area Under the Curve (AUC).\n  In this paper, we analytically compute upper and lower bounds for the AUC and\ndiscuss the quality of model selection problem using the AUC and its bounds as\nan accuracy measure in detection problem. We define the correlation\napproximation matrix (CAM) and show that analytical computation of the KL\ndivergence, the AUC and its bounds only depend on the eigenvalues of CAM. We\nalso show the relationship between the AUC, the KL divergence and the ROC curve\nby optimizing with respect to the ROC curve. In the examples provided, we pick\ntree structures as the simplest graphical models. We perform simulations on\nfully-connected graphs and compute the tree structured models by applying the\nwidely used Chow-Liu algorithm [3]. Examples show that the quality of tree\napproximation models are not good in general based on information divergences,\nthe AUC and its bounds when the number of nodes in the graphical model is\nlarge. We show both analytically and by simulations that the 1-AUC for the tree\napproximation model decays exponentially as the dimension of graphical model\nincreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 22:22:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jul 2016 05:13:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Aug 2016 03:31:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 11:21:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-19"}

In\nthis work we test the idea that the lunar swirls have a higher albedo relative\nto surrounding regions because they deflect incoming solar wind particles that\nwould otherwise darken the surface. 3D particle tracking is used to estimate\nthe influence of five lunar magnetic anomalies on incoming solar wind. The\nregions investigated include Mare Ingenii, Gerasimovich, Renier Gamma,\nNorthwest of Apollo and Marginis. Both protons and electrons are tracked as\nthey interact with the anomalous magnetic field and impact maps are calculated.\nThe impact maps are then compared to optical observations and comparisons are\nmade between the maxima and minima in surface fluxes and the albedo and optical\nmaturity of the regions. Results show deflection of slow to typical solar wind\nparticles on a larger scale than the fine scale optical, swirl, features. It is\nfound that efficiency of a particular anomaly for deflection of incoming\nparticles does not only scale directly with surface magnetic field strength,\nbut also is a function of the coherence of the magnetic field. All anomalous\nregions can also produce moderate deflection of fast solar wind particles. The\nanomalies' influence on ~ 1 GeV SEP particles is only apparent as a slight\nmodification of the incident velocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 May 2016 22:30:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-20"}

While studies\nsurrounding network clustering are increasingly common, a precise understanding\nof the realtionship between different cluster quality metrics is unknown. In\nthis paper, we examine the relationship between stand-alone cluster quality\nmetrics and information recovery metrics through a rigorous analysis of four\nwidely-used network clustering algorithms -- Louvain, Infomap, label\npropagation, and smart local moving. We consider the stand-alone quality\nmetrics of modularity, conductance, and coverage, and we consider the\ninformation recovery metrics of adjusted Rand score, normalized mutual\ninformation, and a variant of normalized mutual information used in previous\nwork. Our study includes both synthetic graphs and empirical data sets of sizes\nvarying from 1,000 to 1,000,000 nodes.\n  We find significant differences among the results of the different cluster\nquality metrics. For example, clustering algorithms can return a value of 0.4\nout of 1 on modularity but score 0 out of 1 on information recovery. We find\nconductance, though imperfect, to be the stand-alone quality metric that best\nindicates performance on information recovery metrics. Our study shows that the\nvariant of normalized mutual information used in previous work cannot be\nassumed to differ only slightly from traditional normalized mutual information.\n  Smart local moving is the best performing algorithm in our study, but\ndiscrepancies between cluster evaluation metrics prevent us from declaring it\nabsolutely superior. Louvain performed better than Infomap in nearly all the\ntests in our study, contradicting the results of previous work in which Infomap\nwas superior to Louvain.

To understand what is going\non in the dimensional regularization, we illustrate how to reproduce the\nresults of the dimensional regularization for the $\\lambda\\phi^{4}$ theory in\nthe more conventional regularization such as the higher derivative\nregularization; the basic postulate involved is that the quadratically\ndivergent induced mass, which is independent of the scale change of the\nphysical mass, is kinematical and unphysical. This is consistent with the\nderivation of the Callan-Symanzik equation, which is a comparison of two\ntheories with slightly different masses, for the $\\lambda\\phi^{4}$ theory\nwithout encountering the quadratic divergence. We thus suggest that the\ndimensional regularization is generic in a bottom-up approach starting with a\nsuccessful low-energy theory. We also define a modified version of the mass\nindependent renormalization for a scalar field which leads to the homogeneous\nrenormalization group equation. Implications of the present analysis on the\nStandard Model at high energies and the presence or absence of SUSY at LHC\nenergies are briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2016 05:34:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-03"}

The model is formulated as\na bi-level program in which the upper-level unit commitment problem minimizes\nthe total generation cost, and the lower-level problem maximizes prosumers'\naggregate self-consumption. Unlike in the existing bi-level optimization\nframeworks that focus on the interaction between the wholesale market and an\naggregator, the coupling is through the prosumers' demand, not through the\nelectricity price.

As a case study, we perform steady-state voltage stability\nanalysis of a simplified model of the Australian National Electricity Market\nwith significant penetration of renewable generation.

Powering this massive number of embedded devices is a key\nchallenge of designing IoT since batteries increase the devices' form factors\nand battery recharging/replacement is difficult. To tackle this challenge, we\npropose a novel network architecture that enables D2D communication between\npassive nodes by integrating wireless power transfer and backscatter\ncommunication, which is called a wirelessly powered backscatter communication\n(WP-BackCom) network. In the network, standalone power beacons (PBs) are\ndeployed for wirelessly powering nodes by beaming unmodulated carrier signals\nto targeted nodes. Provisioned with a backscatter antenna, a node transmits\ndata to an intended receiver by modulating and reflecting a fraction of a\ncarrier signal. Such transmission by backscatter consumes orders-of-magnitude\nless power than a traditional radio. Thereby, the dense deployment of\nlow-complexity PBs with high transmission power can power a large-scale IoT. In\nthis paper, a WP-BackCom network is modeled as a random Poisson cluster process\nin the horizontal plane where PBs are Poisson distributed and active ad-hoc\npairs of backscatter communication nodes with fixed separation distances form\nrandom clusters centered at PBs. The backscatter nodes can harvest energy from\nand backscatter carrier signals transmitted by PBs.

Aims: We study the\ndynamo and differential rotation regimes at varying levels of viscous, thermal,\nand magnetic diffusion. Methods: We perform three-dimensional simulations of\nstratified fully compressible magnetohydrodynamic convection in rotating\nspherical wedges at various thermal and magnetic Prandtl numbers (from 0.25 to\n2 and 5, respectively). Results: We find that the rotation profiles for high\nthermal diffusivity show a monotonically increasing angular velocity from the\nbottom of the convection zone to the top and from the poles toward the equator.\nFor sufficiently rapid rotation, a region of negative radial shear develops at\nmid-latitudes as the thermal diffusivity is decreased. This coincides with a\nchange in the dynamo mode from poleward propagating activity belts to\nequatorward propagating ones. Furthermore, the cyclic solutions disappear at\nthe highest magnetic Reynolds numbers. The total magnetic energy increases with\nthe magnetic Reynolds number in the range studied here ($5-151$), but the\nenergies of the mean magnetic fields level off at high magnetic Reynolds\nnumbers. The differential rotation is strongly affected by the magnetic fields\nand almost vanishes at the highest magnetic Reynolds numbers. In some of our\nmost turbulent cases we find that two regimes are possible where either\ndifferential rotation is strong and mean magnetic fields relatively weak or\nvice versa. Conclusions: Our simulations indicate a strong non-linear feedback\nof magnetic fields on differential rotation, leading to qualitative changes in\nthe behaviors of large-scale dynamos at high magnetic Reynolds numbers.\nFurthermore, we do not find indications of the simulations approaching an\nasymptotic regime where the results would be independent of diffusion\ncoefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2016 10:59:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Sep 2016 08:35:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

When only a small subset M of monomials appear in the equations\n(fewnomial systems), the number of solutions may decrease dramatically. We\nfocus in this work on subsets of quadratic monomials M such that generic\nsystems with support M do not admit any solution at all. For these systems,\nHilbert's Nullstellensatz ensures the existence of algebraic certificates of\ninconsistency. However, up to our knowledge all known bounds on the sizes of\nsuch certificates -including those which take into account the Newton polytopes\nof the polynomials- are exponential in n. Our main results show that if the\ninequality 2|M| -- 2n $\\le$ $\\sqrt$ 1 + 8{\\nu} -- 1 holds for a quadratic\nfewnomial system -- where {\\nu} is the matching number of a graph associated\nwith M, and |M| is the cardinality of M -- then there exists generically a\ncertificate of inconsistency of linear size (measured as the number of\ncoefficients in the ground field K). Moreover this certificate can be computed\nwithin a polynomial number of arithmetic operations. Next, we evaluate how\noften this inequality holds, and we give evidence that the probability that the\ninequality is satisfied depends strongly on the number of squares. More\nprecisely, we show that if M is picked uniformly at random among the subsets of\nn + k + 1 quadratic monomials containing at least $\\Omega$(n 1/2+$\\epsilon$)\nsquares, then the probability that the inequality holds tends to 1 as n grows.\nInterestingly, this phenomenon is related with the matching number of random\ngraphs in the Erd{\\\"o}s-Renyi model.

Here, we report the\nrobustness of the interfacial superconductivity and 2D vortex dynamics in four\nas-grown and aged Bi2Te3/FeTe heterostructure with different Bi2Te3 epilayer\nthickness (3, 5, 7, 14 nm). After two years' air exposure, superconductivity\nremains robust even when the thickness of Bi2Te3 epilayer is down to 3 nm.\nMeanwhile, a new feature at ~13 K is induced in the aged samples, and the high\nfield studies reveal its relevance to superconductivity. The resistance of all\nas-grown and aged heterostructures, just below the superconducting transition\ntemperature follows the Arrhenius relation, indicating the thermally activated\nflux flow behavior at the interface of Bi2Te3 and FeTe. Moreover, the\nactivation energy exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the magnetic field,\nproviding a compelling evidence for the 2D vortex dynamics in this novel\nsystem.

To overcome this drawback, we propose a Bayesian\nprocedure called globally sparse probabilistic PCA (GSPPCA) that allows to\nobtain several sparse components with the same sparsity pattern. This allows\nthe practitioner to identify the original variables which are relevant to\ndescribe the data. To this end, using Roweis' probabilistic interpretation of\nPCA and a Gaussian prior on the loading matrix, we provide the first exact\ncomputation of the marginal likelihood of a Bayesian PCA model. To avoid the\ndrawbacks of discrete model selection, a simple relaxation of this framework is\npresented. It allows to find a path of models using a variational\nexpectation-maximization algorithm. The exact marginal likelihood is then\nmaximized over this path. This approach is illustrated on real and synthetic\ndata sets. In particular, using unlabeled microarray data, GSPPCA infers much\nmore relevant gene subsets than traditional sparse PCA algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2016 12:34:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 16:15:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-22"}

It has been reported that for CuInS2, the\npresence of the CuAu-like phase improves the short circuit current of the\nchalcopyrite-based photovoltaic cell. We investigate the thermodynamic\nstability of both phases for a selected list of I-III-VI2 materials using a\nfirst-principles density functional theory approach.

We\nidentify several candidates with a high efficiency, such as CuAu-like CuInS2,\nfor which we obtain an SLME of 29% at a thickness of 500 nm.

The corner flow near the trailing edge is challenging\nfor the linear eddy viscosity Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models,\ndue to the interaction of two perpendicular boundary layers which leads to\nhighly anisotropic Reynolds stress at the near wall region. Recently, Xiao et\nal. proposed a physics-informed Bayesian framework to quantify and reduce the\nmodel-form uncertainties in RANS simulations by utilizing sparse observation\ndata. In this work, we extend this framework to incorporate the use of wall\nfunction in RANS simulations, and apply the extended framework to the RANS\nsimulation of wing-body junction flow. Standard RANS simulations are performed\non a 3:2 elliptic nose and NACA0020 tail cylinder joined at their maximum\nthickness location. Current results show that both the posterior mean velocity\nand the Reynolds stress anisotropy show better agreement with the experimental\ndata at the corner region near the trailing edge. On the other hand, the prior\nvelocity profiles at the leading edge indicate the restriction of uncertainty\nspace and the performance of the framework at this region is less effective. By\nperturbing the orientation of Reynolds stress, the uncertainty range of prior\nvelocity profiles at the leading edge covers the experimental data. It\nindicates that the uncertainty of RANS predicted velocity field is more related\nto the uncertainty in the orientation of Reynolds stress at the region with\nrapid change of mean strain rate. The present work not only demonstrates the\ncapability of Bayesian framework in improving the RANS simulation of wing-body\njunction flow, but also reveals the major source of model-form uncertainty for\nthis flow, which can be useful in assisting RANS modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2016 14:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-20"}

The non-ideality of this mixture may give rise, at very low\ntemperatures, to a liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT) and a liquid-liquid\ncritical point (LLCP), at which thermodynamic response functions diverge.\nVarious versions of the \"two-structure equation of state\" (TSEOS) based on this\nconcept have shown remarkable agreement with both experimental data in real\nwater and simulation results. However, recent experiments probing supercooled\nwater at negative pressures reveal the inadequacy of extrapolations of\nequations of state developed for positive pressures, and have begun to shed\nadditional light on the source of the anomalies of supercooled water. We have\nanalyzed simulation results for the TIP4P/2005 model over a broad range of\npositive and negative pressures from ambient temperature to deep supercooling.\nWe find that by explicitly incorporating a liquid-vapor spinodal into a\ntwo-structure equation of state, we are able to match the simulation data in\nTIP4P/2005 with striking accuracy. In particular, our equation of state\nreproduces the observed lines of minima and maxima in the density, isothermal\ncompressibility, and isobaric heat capacity. Contrary to scenarios in which a\nretracing spinodal accounts for the thermodynamic anomalies of water, we find\nthat the liquid-vapor spinodal in this model continues monotonically to lower\npressures as temperature is decreased, influencing but not giving rise to the\nlocus of density maxima and other thermodynamic anomalies. We explain the\nbehavior of TIP4P/2005 in terms of two phenomena: the competition between two\nlocal structures and a monotonic liquid-vapor spinodal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 May 2016 15:22:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 22:57:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}
