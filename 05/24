It is assumed\nthat the transmitters have access to synergistic alternating channel state\ninformation (CSI). Specifically, the CSIT alternates between three states,\nnamely, perfect, delayed and no-CSIT, in a certain manner to enable these\nstates to work together cooperatively. These states are associated with\nfractions of time denoted by $\\lambda_P$, $\\lambda_D$ \\text{and} $\\lambda_N$,\nrespectively. For the two-user $X$-channel, simple upper bound is developed to\nprove the tightness of the achievability result of $4/3$ DoF under a certain\ndistribution of the availability of three CSIT states for\n$\\Lambda(\\lambda_P=1/3, \\lambda_D= 1/3, \\lambda_N=1/3)$. For the $K$-user\n$X$-network, it is shown that the sum Degrees of freedom (DoF) is at least\n$2K/(K + 1)$, using two-phase transmission schemes over finite symbols channel\nextension and under the same distribution of the availability of\n$\\Lambda(\\lambda_P=1/3, \\lambda_D= 1/3, \\lambda_N=1/3)$.This achievability\nresult, can be considered as a tight lower bound, coincides with the best lower\nbound known for the same network but with partial output feedback in stead of\nalternating CSIT. Hence, we show that the role of synergistic alternating CSIT\nwith distribution $\\Lambda(1/3,1/3,1/3)$ is equivalent to the partial output\nfeedback. Also, this lower bound is strictly better than the best lower bound\nknown for the case of delayed CSI assumption for all values of $K$. All the\nproposed transmission schemes are based on two phases transmission strategy,\nnamely, interference creation and interference resurrection, which exploit the\nsynergy of instantaneous CSI and delay CSIT to retrospectively align\ninterference in the subsequent channel uses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 16:04:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}

We carry out our calculations using lattice methods\ndevised recently by us. Our results show the effect of strong pairing\ncorrelations on the entanglement entropy, which modify the sub-leading behavior\nfor large subsystem sizes (as characterized by the dimensionless parameter x=kF\nL_A, where kF is the Fermi momentum and L_A the linear subsystem size), but\nleave the leading order unchanged relative to the non-interacting case.\nMoreover, we find that the onset of the sub-leading asymptotic regime is at\nsurprisingly small x=2-4. We provide further insight into the entanglement\nproperties of this system by analyzing the spectrum of the entanglement\nHamiltonian of the two-body problem from weak to strong coupling. The low-lying\nentanglement spectrum displays clear features as the strength of the coupling\nis varied, such as eigenvalue crossing, a sharp change in the Schmidt gap, and\nscale invariance at unitarity. Beyond the low-lying component, the spectrum\nappears as a quasi-continuum distribution, for which we present a statistical\ncharacterization; we find, in particular, that the mean shifts to infinity as\nthe coupling is turned off, which indicates that that part of the spectrum\nrepresents non-perturbative contributions to the entanglement Hamiltonian. In\ncontrast, the low-lying entanglement spectrum evolves to finite values in the\nnoninteracting limit. The scale invariance of the unitary regime guarantees\nthat our results are universal features intrinsic to 3D quantum mechanics and\nrepresent a well-defined prediction for ultracold atom experiments, which were\nrecently shown to have direct access to the entanglement entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 16:39:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-10-12"}

We assume that the customers\ndiffer in their cost for unit delay and this is modeled as a continuous random\nvariable with a distribution $F.$ We also assume that each server charges an\nadmission price to each customer that decide to join its queue. We first\nconsider the monopoly problem where both the servers belong to a single\noperator. The heterogeneity of the customer makes the analysis of the problem\ndifficult. The difficulty lies in the inability to characterize the equilibrium\nqueue arrival rates as a function of the admission prices. We provide an\nequivalent formulation with the queue arrival rates as the optimization\nvariable simplifying the analysis for revenue rate maximization for the\nmonopoly. We then consider the duopoly problem where each server competes with\nthe other server to maximize its revenue rate. For the duopoly problem, the\ninterest is to obtain the set of admission prices satisfying the Nash\nequilibrium conditions. While the problem is in general difficult to analyze,\nwe consider the special case when the two servers are identical. For such a\nduopoly system, we obtain the necessary condition for existence of symmetric\nNash equilibrium of the admission prices. The knowledge of the distribution $F$\ncharacterizing the heterogeneity of the customers is necessary to solve the\nmonopoly and the duopoly problem. However, for most practical scenarios, the\nfunctional form of $F$ may not be known to the system operator and in such\ncases, the revenue maximizing prices cannot be determined. In the last part of\nthe paper, we provide a simple method to estimate the distribution $F$ by\nsuitably varying the admission prices.

In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm that,\ndespite using the same amount of communication per iteration as DGD, can\neffectively harnesses the function smoothness and converge to the optimum with\na rate of $O(\\frac{1}{t})$. If the objective function is further strongly\nconvex, our algorithm has a linear convergence rate. Both rates match the\nconvergence rate of CGD. The key step in our algorithm is a novel gradient\nestimation scheme that uses history information to achieve fast and accurate\nestimation of the average gradient.

Despite the\ncomplexity of the processes involved, a traditional model, where the removal of\nangular momentum loss by magnetic fields is prescribed, has provided a useful\nframework to understand observational relations between stellar rotation and\nage and magnetic field strength. Here, a spindown model is proposed where loss\nof angular momentum by magnetic fields is evolved dynamically, instead of being\nkinematically prescribed. To this end, we evolve the stellar rotation and\nmagnetic field simultaneously over stellar evolution time by extending our\nprevious work on a dynamo model which incorporates the nonlinear feedback\nmechanisms on rotation and magnetic fields. Our extended model reproduces key\nobservations and explains the presence of the two branches of (fast and slow\nrotating) stars which have different relations between rotation rate $\\Omega$\nvs. time (age), magnetic field strength $|B|$ vs. rotation rate, and frequency\nof magnetic field $\\omega_{cyc}$ vs. rotation rate. For fast rotating stars we\nfind: (i) an exponential spindown $\\Omega \\propto e^{-1.35t}$, with $t$\nmeasured in Gyrs, (ii) $|B|$ saturates for higher rotation rate, (iii)\n$\\omega_{cyc} \\propto \\Omega^{0.85}$. For slow rotating stars we obtain: (i) a\npower law spindown $\\Omega \\propto t^{-0.52}$, (ii) $|B|$ scales almost\nlinearly with rotation rate, (iii) $\\omega_{cyc} \\propto \\Omega^{1.16}$. The\nresults obtained are in good agreement with observations. The Vaughan-Preston\ngap is consistently explained in our model by the shortest spindown timescale\nin this transition from fast to slow rotators. Our results highlight the\nimportance of self-regulation of magnetic fields and rotation by direct and\nindirect interactions involving nonlinear feedback in stellar evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 18:23:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Sep 2016 10:39:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

Recent calculations have suggested that\nplanets in the outer regions of the habitable zone cannot maintain stable, warm\nclimates, but rather should oscillate between long, globally glaciated states\nand shorter periods of climatic warmth. Such conditions, similar to 'Snowball\nEarth' episodes experienced on Earth, would be inimical to the development of\ncomplex land life, including intelligent life. Here, we build upon previous\nstudies with an updated an energy balance climate model to calculate this\n'limit cycle' region of the habitable zone where such cycling would occur.

In\norder to test the atmospheric models that are used to describe these systems,\nit is necessary to obtain accurate observational estimates of their physical\nproperties (masses, radii, temperatures, albedos). Interacting compact binary\nsystems provide a natural laboratory for studying strongly irradiated\nsub-stellar objects. As the mass-losing secondary in these systems makes a\ncritical, but poorly understood transition from the stellar to the sub-stellar\nregime, it is also strongly irradiated by the compact accretor. In fact, the\ninternal and external energy fluxes are both expected to be comparable in these\nobjects, providing access to an unexplored irradiation regime. However, the\natmospheric properties of such donors have so far remained largely unknown.\nHere, we report the direct spectroscopic detection and characterisation of an\nirradiated sub-stellar donor in an accreting white dwarf binary system.

The useful representations\nlearned are often found to be sparse and distributed. On the other hand,\ncompressed sensing and sparse coding assume a data generating process, where\nthe observed data is generated from some true latent signal source, and try to\nrecover the corresponding signal from measurements. Looking at auto-encoders\nfrom this \\textit{signal recovery perspective} enables us to have a more\ncoherent view of these techniques. In this paper, in particular, we show that\nthe \\textit{true} hidden representation can be approximately recovered if the\nweight matrices are highly incoherent with unit $ \\ell^{2} $ row length and the\nbias vectors takes the value (approximately) equal to the negative of the data\nmean. The recovery also becomes more and more accurate as the sparsity in\nhidden signals increases. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that\nauto-encoders are capable of recovering the data generating dictionary when\nonly data samples are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 19:21:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2017 16:25:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-14"}

The on-shell mass and\nthe damping rate of quantum critical spin excitations as functions of\ntemperature are calculated based on the renormalized coupling strength, which\nare in excellent agreements with experiment observations. Their $T\\ln T$\ndependence is predicted to be dominant at very low temperatures, which is to be\ntested in future experiments. Our work provides confidence that quantum\ncriticality as a theoretical framework, being considered in so many different\ncontexts of condensed matter physics and beyond, is indeed grounded in\nmaterials and experiments accurately. It is also expected to motivate further\nexperimental investigations on the applicability of the field theory to related\nquantum critical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 19:55:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2017 17:25:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2018 19:43:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 16 Jun 2018 13:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-19"}

In this context, graph signals are\nwidely encountered as descriptors of vertex attributes or features in\ngraph-structured data. Estimating such signals in all vertices given noisy\nobservations of their values on a subset of vertices has been extensively\nanalyzed in the literature of signal processing on graphs (SPoG). This paper\nadvocates kernel regression as a framework generalizing popular SPoG modeling\nand reconstruction and expanding their capabilities. Formulating signal\nreconstruction as a regression task on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of\ngraph signals permeates benefits from statistical learning, offers fresh\ninsights, and allows for estimators to leverage richer forms of prior\ninformation than existing alternatives. A number of SPoG notions such as\nbandlimitedness, graph filters, and the graph Fourier transform are naturally\naccommodated in the kernel framework. Additionally, this paper capitalizes on\nthe so-called representer theorem to devise simpler versions of existing\nThikhonov regularized estimators, and offers a novel probabilistic\ninterpretation of kernel methods on graphs based on graphical models. Motivated\nby the challenges of selecting the bandwidth parameter in SPoG estimators or\nthe kernel map in kernel-based methods, the present paper further proposes two\nmulti-kernel approaches with complementary strengths. Whereas the first enables\nestimation of the unknown bandwidth of bandlimited signals, the second allows\nfor efficient graph filter selection.

It is\naccompanied by a related, albeit weaker process -- Raman scattering. We analyze\nthe signatures of Raman scattering imprinted in the reflected light and the\ngeometric albedo of exoplanets, which could provide information about\natmospheric properties. Raman scattering affects the geometric albedo spectra\nof planets in following ways. Firstly, it causes filling-in of strong\nabsorption lines in the incident radiation, thus producing sharp peaks in the\nalbedo. Secondly, it shifts the wavelengths of spectral features in the\nreflected light causing the so-called Raman ghost lines. Raman scattering can\nalso cause a broadband reduction of the albedo due to wavelength shifting of a\nstellar spectrum with red spectral index. Observing the Raman peaks in the\nalbedo could be used to measure the column density of gas, thus providing\nconstrains on the presence of clouds in the atmosphere. Observing the Raman\nghost lines could be used to spectroscopically identify the main scatterer in\nthe atmosphere, even molecules like H$_2$ or N$_2$ that do not have prominent\nspectral signatures in the optical wavelength range. If detected, ghost lines\ncould also provide information about the temperature of the atmosphere.

Subsequently, we prove a more complete existence result by using\na dynamical analysis together with a blow-up argument. In this way we establish\nthat, any positive energy level is attained by a 1-parameter family of vortex\nsolutions which also correspond to (constraint) energy minimizers. In other\nwords, we register the exceptional fact in a BPS-setting that, neither a\n\"quantization\" effect nor an energy gap is induced upon the system by the rigid\n\"critical\" coupling of the self-dual regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 May 2016 22:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

The output probe\nand conjugate modes have different coefficients of this $1/\\sqrt{N}$ scaling,\nindicating the coefficient can serve as an efficient parameter to characterize\nthe specified micro-macro transitions. The demonstrated results are generally\napplicable for quantum detection and optical signal processing in light-atom\ninterfaces. Furthermore, the present system is suitable for the study of\nrelevant time-resolved dynamics of the quantum-to-classical transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 01:54:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2017 14:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-06"}

Adversarial examples that affect one model often affect\nanother model, even if the two models have different architectures or were\ntrained on different training sets, so long as both models were trained to\nperform the same task. An attacker may therefore train their own substitute\nmodel, craft adversarial examples against the substitute, and transfer them to\na victim model, with very little information about the victim. Recent work has\nfurther developed a technique that uses the victim model as an oracle to label\na synthetic training set for the substitute, so the attacker need not even\ncollect a training set to mount the attack. We extend these recent techniques\nusing reservoir sampling to greatly enhance the efficiency of the training\nprocedure for the substitute model.

Contrary to previous work, a generalized attack model is\nemployed which manipulates the data using transformations with arbitrary\nfunctional forms determined by some attack parameters whose values are unknown\nto the attacked system. For the first time, necessary and sufficient conditions\nare provided under which the transformations provide a guaranteed attack\nperformance in terms of Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) regardless of the processing the\nestimation system employs, thus defining a highly desirable attack.\nInterestingly, these conditions imply that, for any such attack when the\nattacked sensors can be perfectly identified by the estimation system, either\nthe Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for jointly estimating the desired and\nattack parameters is singular or that the attacked system is unable to improve\nthe CRB for the desired vector parameter through this joint estimation even\nthough the joint FIM is nonsingular. It is shown that it is always possible to\nconstruct such a highly desirable attack by properly employing a sufficiently\nlarge dimension attack vector parameter relative to the number of quantization\nlevels employed, which was not observed previously.

The structural differences between these conformations may be\nsubtle, but each distinct state can be remarkably long-lived, with random\ninterconversions between states occurring only at macroscopic timescales,\nfractions of a second or longer. Though we now have proof of functional\nheterogeneity in a handful of systems---enzymes, motors, adhesion\ncomplexes---identifying and measuring it remains a formidable challenge. Here\nwe show that evidence of this phenomenon is more widespread than previously\nknown, encoded in data collected from some of the most well-established single\nmolecule techniques: AFM or optical tweezer pulling experiments. We present a\ntheoretical procedure for analyzing distributions of rupture/unfolding forces\nrecorded at different pulling speeds. This results in a single parameter,\nquantifying the degree of heterogeneity, and also leads to bounds on the\nequilibration and conformational interconversion timescales. Surveying ten\npublished datasets, we find heterogeneity in five of them, all with\ninterconversion rates slower than 10 s$^{-1}$. Moreover, we identify two\nsystems where additional data at realizable pulling velocities is likely to\nfind a theoretically predicted, but so far unobserved cross-over regime between\nheterogeneous and non-heterogeneous behavior. The significance of this regime\nis that it will allow far more precise estimates of the slow conformational\nswitching times, one of the least understood aspects of functional\nheterogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 05:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

Since these primordial\nperturbations lead to the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and\neventually to the inhomogeneities in the Large Scale Structure (LSS), they\nprovide a unique opportunity to probe issues which are fundamental to our\nunderstanding of quantum physics and gravitation. One such fundamental issue\nthat remains to be satisfactorily addressed is the transition of the primordial\nperturbations from their quantum origins to the LSS which can be characterized\ncompletely in terms of classical quantities. Classical bouncing universes\nprovide an alternative to the more conventional inflationary paradigm as they\ncan help overcome the horizon problem in a fashion very similar to inflation.\nWhile the problem of the quantum-to-classical transition of the primordial\nperturbations has been investigated extensively in the context of inflation, we\nfind that there has been a rather limited effort towards studying the issue in\nclassical bouncing universes. In this work, we analyze certain aspects of this\nproblem with the example of tensor perturbations produced in classical matter\nand near-matter bouncing universes. We investigate the issue mainly from two\nperspectives. Firstly, we approach the problem by examining the extent of\nsqueezing of a quantum state associated with the tensor perturbations with the\nhelp of the Wigner function. Secondly, we analyze the issue from the\nperspective of the quantum measurement problem.

Respective reuse activities involve\ngood number of people, tools and processes along different stages of the\ndevelopment lifecycle which involve large numbers of tools. Some development is\ndirectly planned for reuse. Planned reuse implies excellent knowledge\nmanagement and firm governance of reusable items. According to the current\nstate of the art, there are still practical problems in the two fields, mainly\nbecause the governance and knowledge management is fragmented over the tools of\nthe toolchain. In our experience, the practical effect of this fragmentation is\nthat involved ancestor and derivation relationships are often undocumented or\nnot exploitable.

It is attributed to\nsuperposition of E2h phonon (wurtzite : WZ) and TO phonon (zinc blende : ZB) of\nInAs. Polarized and wavelength dependent SRRS establishes the presence of WZ\nand ZB phases in these MNWs. However, formation of WZ phase for larger diameter\nInAs MNWs is not commensurate with existing growth mapping studies, which needs\nto be understood further. Study of several of these MNWs suggest that the\nfraction of WZ to ZB in a MNW is decided not only by diameter, but also by\nlocal growth seeding/conditions leading to either tapered or uniform MNWs\nformation, although, external growth conditions are same. Variation of these\nfrequencies that from bulk value are correlated to residual stress generated in\nZB and WZ phases due to presence of WZ and ZB phases, respectively.\nConsistently, temperature dependent Raman data shows that there is a measurable\ncontribution of stress to dw/dT, a positive for ZB and negative for WZ phonons,\ndue to difference in their thermal expansions. Further, effective thermal\nexpansion coefficient of WZ InAs in presence of ZB phase is calculated to vary\nin the range 10 - 19 x 10-6/K from base to tip of a MNW at 80 K, which is not\npossible to determine otherwise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 09:18:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

Indeed, the search for lower bounds\nand impossibility results for this problem spawned the topological approach to\ndistributed computing, which has given rise to new techniques in the design and\nanalysis of protocols. The design of efficient solutions to set consensus has\nalso proven to be challenging. In the synchronous crash failure model, the\nliterature contains a sequence of solutions to set consensus, each improving\nupon the previous ones.\n  This paper presents an unbeatable protocol for nonuniform k-set consensus in\nthe synchronous crash failure model. This is an efficient protocol whose\ndecision times cannot be improved upon. Moreover, the description of our\nprotocol is extremely succinct.

In particular, our topological proof\nreasons in a novel way about subcomplexes of the protocol complex, and sheds\nlight on an open question posed by Guerraoui and Pochon (2009).

We consider a simple model of a stratified domain with a\nsub-photospheric interior layer and three overlying atmospheric layers. A\ntwisted arched flux tube is inserted in the interior and is allowed to rise\ninto the atmosphere. To achieve this, the MHD equations are solved using the\nLagrangian-remap code, Lare3d.

Altering the initial field strength and twist significantly affects\nthe tube's evolution and the rotational motions that develop at the\nphotosphere. The rotation angle, vorticity, and current show a direct\ndependence on the initial field strength. We find that an increase in field\nstrength increases the angle through which the fieldlines rotate, the length of\nfieldlines extending into the atmosphere, and the magnetic energy transported\nto the atmosphere. This also affects the amount of residual twist in the\ninterior. The length of the fieldlines is crucial as we predict the twist per\nunit length equilibrates to a lower value on longer fieldlines. No such direct\ndependence is found when we modify the twist owing to the complex effect this\nhas on the tension force acting on the tube.

Due to mathematical complexity, a theory that could explain how the\nparameters of mesoscopic networks composed of a few tens of neurons affect the\nfunctional connectivity is still to be formulated. Yet, many interesting\nproblems in neuroscience involve the study of networks composed of a small\nnumber of neurons. Based on a recent study of the dynamics of small neural\ncircuits, we combine the analysis of local bifurcations of multi-population\nneural networks of arbitrary size with the analytical calculation of the\nfunctional connectivity. We study the functional connectivity in different\nregimes, showing that external stimuli cause the network to switch from\nasynchronous states characterized by weak correlation and low variability\n(local chaos), to synchronous states characterized by strong correlations and\nwide temporal fluctuations (critical slowing down). Local chaos typically\noccurs in large networks, but here we show that it can also be generated by\nstrong stimuli in small neural circuits. On the other side, critical slowing\ndown is expected to occur when the stimulus moves the network close to a local\nbifurcation. In particular, strongly positive correlations occur at the\nsaddle-node and Andronov-Hopf bifurcations of the network, while strongly\nnegative correlations occur when the network undergoes a spontaneous\nsymmetry-breaking at the branching-point bifurcations. These results prove that\nthe functional connectivity of firing-rate network models is strongly affected\nby the external stimuli even if the anatomical connections are fixed, and\nsuggest an effective mechanism through which biological networks can\ndynamically modulate the encoding and integration of sensory information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 11:22:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 May 2016 15:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-27"}

Further,\nthe effect of different noise models (e.g., amplitude damping (AD), phase\ndamping (PD), collective noise and Pauli noise models) on the HJRSP protocol\nproposed here is investigated. It is found that in AD and PD noise models a\nhigher power agent can reconstruct the quantum state to be remotely prepared\nwith higher fidelity than that done by the lower power agent(s). In contrast,\nthe opposite may happen in the presence of collective noise models. We have\nalso proposed a scheme for probabilistic HJRSP using a non-maximally entangled\n5-qubit cluster state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 12:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-10"}

The observations support a picture of low-mass star\nformation according to which ~ 0.1 pc-wide filaments form first in the cold\ninterstellar medium, probably as a result of large-scale compression of\ninterstellar matter by supersonic turbulent flows, and then prestellar cores\narise from gravitational fragmentation of the densest filaments. Whether this\nscenario also applies to regions of high-mass star formation is an open\nquestion, in part because Herschel data cannot resolve the inner width of\nfilaments in the nearest regions of massive star formation.\n  We used the bolometer camera ArTeMiS on the APEX telescope to map the central\npart of the NGC6334 complex at a factor of > 3 higher resolution than Herschel\nat 350 microns. Combining ArTeMiS data with Herschel data allowed us to study\nthe structure of the main filament of the complex with a resolution of 8\" or <\n0.07 pc at d ~ 1.7 kpc.\n  Our study confirms that this filament is a very dense, massive linear\nstructure with a line mass ranging from ~ 500 Msun/pc to ~ 2000 Msun/pc over\nnearly 10 pc. It also demonstrates that its inner width remains as narrow as W\n~ 0.15 +- 0.05 pc all along the filament length, within a factor of < 2 of the\ncharacteristic 0.1 pc value found with Herschel for lower-mass filaments in the\nGould Belt. While it is not completely clear whether the NGC 6334 filament will\nform massive stars or not in the future, it is two to three orders of magnitude\ndenser than the majority of filaments observed in Gould Belt clouds, and yet\nhas a very similar inner width. This points to a common physical mechanism for\nsetting the filament width and suggests that some important structural\nproperties of nearby clouds also hold in high-mass star forming regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 13:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-27"}

To overcome these modelling\nchallenges, we present a general model calibration procedure for remotely\nsensed data and apply it to airborne laser scanning data for forest inventory.\nWe use a linear regression model that accounts for multicollinearity in the\npredictors by principal components and Bayesian regularization. It has a\nspatial random effect component for the spatial correlations that are not\nexplained by a simple linear model. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo\nsampling scheme is used to account for the uncertainty in all the model\nparameters. We tested the proposed model against several alternatives and it\noutperformed the other linear calibration models, especially when there were\nspatial effects, multicollinearity and the training set size was small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 13:18:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Sep 2016 06:21:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2017 15:05:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-14"}

Geometrical approaches to tackle the first challenge are\ndiscussed . To solve the second challenge, for the first time in the\nliterature, a closed form relation is proposed to approximate Fekete points (a\nNondeterministic Polynomial (NP) problem) on a general convex/concave\npolyhedral. The approximate points are used to generate basis functions using\nthe SVD of the Vandermonde matrix.

The mainstream response to this\nconundrum is to invoke large quantities of `dark matter' -- which purportedly\nsupplies the needed extra gravity -- and also of `dark energy', to account for\nfurther anomalies in cosmology, such as the observed, accelerated expansion.\nThe MOND paradigm offers a different solution: a breakdown of standard dynamics\n(gravity and/or inertia) in the limit of low accelerations -- below some\nacceleration $a_0$. In this limit, dynamics become space-time scale invariant,\nand is controlled by a gravitational constant $\\mathcal{A}_0\\equiv Ga_0$, which\nreplaces Newton's $G$. With the new dynamics, the various detailed\nmanifestations of the anomalies in galaxies are predicted with no need for dark\nmatter. The cosmological anomalies could, but need not have to do with small\naccelerations. For example, the need for dark matter in accounting for the\nexpansion history of the Universe is eliminated if the relevant gravitational\nconstant is $\\approx 2\\pi G$. Such a `renormalization' of $G$ could be a\ndimensionless parameter of a MOND theory. The constant $a_0$ turns out to carry\ncosmological connotations, in that $2\\pi a_0\\approx cH_0\\approx\nc^2(\\Lambda/3)^{1/2}$, where $H_0$ is the present expansion rate of the\nUniverse, and $\\Lambda$ the measured `cosmological constant'. There are MOND\ntheories in which this `coincidence' is natural. I draw on enlightening\nhistorical and conceptual analogies from quantum theory to limelight aspects of\nMOND. I also explain how MOND may have strong connections with effects of the\nquantum vacuum on local dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 13:48:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jun 2016 14:45:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-25"}

High-resolution time-series of blue continuum\nand G-band images acquired in the blue imaging channel (BIC) of the GREGOR\nFabry-P\\'erot Interferometer (GFPI) were complemented by LOS magnetograms and\ncontinuum images obtained with the HMI onboard the SDO.

We hypothesize\nthat by living together as couples, there can be commonly co-regulated genes\nthat may reflect the shared living environment (e.g., diet, indoor air\npollutants, behavioral lifestyle). The lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived\nfrom unrelated couples of African ancestry (YRI, Yoruba people from Ibadan,\nNigeria) from the International HapMap Project provided a unique model for us\nto characterize gene expression pattern in couples by comparing gene expression\nlevels between husbands and wives.

Since genetic variation between unrelated family\nmembers in a general population is expected to be the same assuming a\nrandom-mating society, non-genetic factors (e.g., epigenetic systems) are more\nlikely to be the mediators for the observed transcriptional similarity in\ncouples. We thus evaluated the contribution of modified cytosines to those\ngenes showing transcriptional similarity in couples as well as the\nrelationships these CpG sites with other gene regulatory elements, such as\ntranscription factor binding sites (TFBS).

In two typical working\nmodes of MSRS, we formulate the optimization problem by introducing two\nobjective functions according to the two mentioned goals, respectively.\nAddressing on two main challenges of applying multi-objective particle swarm\noptimization (MOPSO) in solving the proposed optimization problem, we propose a\ndeployment algorithm based on multiobjective particle swarm optimization with\nnon-dominated relative crowding distance (MOPSO-NRCD). For the challenge of\nvalue difference, we propose a novel selection method with a non-dominated\nrelative crowding distance. For the challenge of particle allocation, a\nmulti-swarm structure of MOPSO is also introduced. Finally, simulation results\nare given out to prove the advantages and validity of the proposed deployment\nalgorithm.

The non-invasive\nprosthetic hand works with several electrodes, placed on the stump of an\namputee, that record this signal. In order to favour the control of prosthesis,\nthe EMG signal is analyzed with algorithms based on machine learning theory to\ndecide the movement that the subject is going to do. In order to obtain a\nsignificant control of the prosthesis and avoid mismatch between desired and\nperformed movements, a long training period is needed when we use the\ntraditional algorithm of machine learning (i.e. Support Vector Machines). An\nactual challenge in this field concerns the reduction of the time necessary for\nan amputee to learn how to use the prosthesis. Recently, several algorithms\nthat exploit a form of prior knowledge have been proposed. In general, we refer\nto prior knowledge as a past experience available in the form of models. In our\ncase an amputee, that attempts to perform some movements with the prosthesis,\ncould use experience from different subjects that are already able to perform\nthose movements. The aim of this work is to verify, with a computational\ninvestigation, if for an amputee this kind of previous experience is useful in\norder to reduce the training time and boost the prosthetic control.\nFurthermore, we want to understand if and how the final results change when the\nprevious knowledge of intact or amputated subjects is used for a new amputee.\nOur experiments indicate that: (1) the use of experience, from other subjects\nalready trained to perform a task, makes us able to reduce the training time of\nabout an order of magnitude; (2) it seems that an amputee that tries to learn\nto use the prosthesis doesn't reach different results when he/she exploits\nprevious experience of amputees or intact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 15:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

The abundance of 92Nb in the early solar system can be derived from\nmeteoritic data. It has to be compared to theoretical estimates for the\nproduction of 92Nb to determine the time between the last nucleosynthesis event\nbefore the formation of the early solar system.\n  Purpose: The influence of a low-lying short-lived isomer on the\nnucleosynthesis of 92Nb is analyzed. The thermal coupling between the ground\nstate and the isomer via so-called intermediate states affects the production\nand survival of 92Nb.\n  Method: The properties of the lowest intermediate state in 92Nb are known\nfrom experiment. From the lifetime of the intermediate state and from its decay\nbranchings, the transition rate from the ground state to the isomer and the\neffective half-life of 92Nb are calculated as a function of the temperature.\n  Results: The coupling between the ground state and the isomer is strong. This\nleads to thermalization of ground state and isomer in the nucleosynthesis of\n92Nb in any explosive production scenario and almost 100% survival of 92Nb in\nits ground state. However, the strong coupling leads to a temperature-dependent\neffective half-life of 92Nb which makes the 92Nb survival very sensitive to\ntemperatures as low as about 8 keV, thus turning 92Nb at least partly into a\nthermometer.\n  Conclusions: The low-lying isomer in 92Nb does not affect the production of\n92Nb in explosive scenarios. In retrospect this validates all previous studies\nwhere the isomer was not taken into account. However, the dramatic reduction of\nthe effective half-life at temperatures below 10 keV may affect the survival of\n92Nb after its synthesis in supernovae which are the most likely astrophysical\nsite for the nucleosynthesis of 92Nb.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 15:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-22"}

By exciting the QDisks with a nanometric electron beam at\ncurrents spanning over 3 orders of magnitude, strong non-linearities (energy\nshifts) in the light emission are observed. In particular, we find that the\namount of energy shift depends on the emission rate and on the QDisk morphology\n(size, position along the NW and shell thickness). For thick QDisks (>4nm), the\nQDisk emission energy is observed to blue-shift with the increase of the\nemission intensity. This is interpreted as a consequence of the increase of\ncarriers density excited by the incident electron beam inside the QDisks, which\nscreens the internal electric field and thus reduces the quantum confined Stark\neffect (QCSE) present in these QDisks. For thinner QDisks (<3 nm), the\nblue-shift is almost absent in agreement with the negligible QCSE at such\nsizes. For QDisks of intermediate sizes there exists a current threshold above\nwhich the energy shifts, marking the transition from unscreened to partially\nscreened QCSE. From the threshold value we estimate the lifetime in the\nunscreened regime. These observations suggest that, counterintuitively,\nelectrons of high energy can behave ultimately as single electron-hole pair\ngenerators. In addition, when we increase the current from 1 pA to 10 pA the\nlight emission efficiency drops by more than one order of magnitude. This\nreduction of the emission efficiency is a manifestation of the efficiency droop\nas observed in nitride-based 2D light emitting diodes, a phenomenon tentatively\nattributed to the Auger effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 15:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-25"}

As a result, the high-frequency excess continuing at even\nhigher radio frequencies up to 43 GHz has been confirmed. The non-detection at\n100 GHz was not so strong constraint, and therefore the spectral behavior above\n43 GHz remains unclear. The astrometric position of the high-frequency excess\ncomponent coincides with the optical position of the Seyfert nucleus and the\nlow-frequency radio position to an accuracy of 0.1 arcsec, corresponding to ~80\npc; the radio source size is constrained to be <0.02 arcsec, corresponding to\n<16 pc.

Restricting to low dimensions and neglecting\nfluctuation effects we gain analytical insight into the mechanisms of the\ninstability leading to clustering which turn out to be the interplay between\ndiffusion, the intracluster forces and the forces between neighboring clusters.\nWe show that the deterministic part of the Dean-Kawasaki equation provides a\ngood description of the particle dynamics, including width and shape of the\nclusters, in a wide range of parameters, and analyze with weakly nonlinear\ntechniques the nature of the pattern-forming bifurcation in one and two\ndimensions.

These codes are analyzed\nwith statistical models, often called emulators. In many situations, the\nphysical system (computer model output) may be known to satisfy inequality\nconstraints with respect to some or all input variables. Our aim is to build a\nmodel capable of incorporating both data interpolation and inequality\nconstraints into a Gaussian process emulator. By using a functional\ndecomposition, we propose to approximate the original Gaussian process by a\nfinite-dimensional Gaussian process such that all conditional simulations\nsatisfy the inequality constraints in the whole domain. The mean, mode (maximum\na posteriori) and prediction intervals (uncertainty quantification) of the\nconditional Gaussian process are calculated. To investigate the performance of\nthe proposed model, some conditional simulations with inequality constraints\nsuch as boundary, monotonicity or convexity conditions are given. 1.\nIntroduction. In the engineering activity, runs of a computer code can be\nexpensive and time-consuming. One solution is to use a statistical surrogate\nfor conditioning computer model outputs at some input locations (design\npoints). Gaussian process (GP) emulator is one of the most popular choices\n[23]. The reason comes from the property of the GP that uncertainty\nquantification can be calculated. Furthermore, it has several nice properties.\nFor example, the conditional GP at observation data (linear equality\nconstraints) is still a GP [5]. Additionally, some inequality constraints (such\nas monotonicity and convexity) of output computer responses are related to\npartial derivatives. In such cases, the partial derivatives of the GP are also\nGPs. Incorporating an infinite number of linear inequality constraints into a\nGP emulator, the problem becomes more difficult. The reason is that the\nresulting conditional process is not a GP. In the literature of interpolation\nwith inequality constraints, we find two types of meth-ods. The first one is\ndeterministic and based on splines, which have the advantage that the\ninequality constraints are satisfied in the whole input domain (see e.g. [16],\n[24] and [25]). The second one is based on the simulation of the conditional GP\nby using the subdivision of the input set (see e.g. [1], [6] and [11]). In that\ncase, the inequality constraints are satisfied in a finite number of input\nlocations. Notice that the advantage of such method is that un-certainty\nquantification can be calculated. In previous work, some methodologies have\nbeen based on the knowledge of the derivatives of the GP at some input\nlocations ([11], [21] and [26]). For monotonicity constraints with noisy data,\na Bayesian approach was developed in [21]. In [11] the problem is to build a GP\nemulator by using the prior monotonicity\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 May 2016 12:48:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-07"}
