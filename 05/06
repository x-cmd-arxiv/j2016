A number of recent NS mass measurements in binary millisecond pulsar\n(MSP) systems increase the fraction of massive NSs (with $M > 1.8$ M$_{\\odot}$)\nto $\\sim 20\\% $ of the observed population. In light of these results, we\nemploy a Bayesian framework to revisit the MSP mass distribution. We find that\na single Gaussian model does not sufficiently describe the observed population.\nWe test alternative empirical models and infer that the MSP mass distribution\nis strongly asymmetric. The diversity in spin and orbital properties of\nhigh-mass NSs suggests that this is most likely not a result of the recycling\nprocess, but rather reflects differences in the NS birth masses. The asymmetry\nis best accounted for by a bimodal distribution with a low mass component\ncentred at $1.393_{-0.029}^{+0.031}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and dispersed by\n$0.064_{-0.025}^{+0.064}$ M$_{\\odot}$, and a high-mass component with a mean of\n$1.807_{-0.132}^{+0.081}$ and a dispersion of $0.177_{-0.072}^{+0.115}$\nM$_{\\odot}$.

To\nmaximize power output, the turbine blade kinematics may be controlled during\nthe course of the blade revolution, thus optimizing the unsteady fluid dynamic\nforces. Dynamically pitching the blades, similar to blade control in a\nhelicopter, is an established method. However, this technique adds undesirable\nmechanical complexity to the turbine, increasing cost and reducing durability.\nHere we introduce a novel alternative requiring no additional moving parts: we\noptimize the turbine rotation rate as a function of blade position resulting in\nmotion (including changes in the effective angle of attack) that is precisely\ntimed to exploit unsteady fluid effects. We demonstrate experimentally that\nthis approach results in a 79% increase in power output over industry standard\ncontrol methods. Analysis of the fluid forcing and blade kinematics show that\nmaximal power is achieved through alignment of fluid force and rotation rate\nextrema. In addition, the optimized controller excites a well-timed dynamic\nstall vortex, as is found in many examples of biological propulsion. This\ncontrol strategy allows a structurally robust turbine operating at relatively\nlow angular velocity to achieve high efficiency and could enable a new\ngeneration of environmentally-benign turbines for wind and water current power\ngeneration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 17:58:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-06"}

By introducing\nan additional transformation step, concerning only a fraction of the\nvibrational degrees of freedom, we can achieve linear scaling of the\naccumulated cost of the single point calculations required in the PES\ngeneration. Numerical examples of these double incremental approaches for\noligo-phenyl examples show fast convergence with respect to the maximum number\nof simultaneously treated fragments and only a modest error introduced by the\nadditional transformation step. The approach, presented here, represents a\nmajor step towards the applicability of vibrational wave function methods to\nsizable, covalently bound systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 18:03:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Aug 2016 12:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-15"}

[STOC'15]: given an $n \\times n$ Boolean matrix\n$M$, we receive $n$ Boolean vectors $v_1,\\ldots,v_n$ one at a time, and are\nrequired to output $M v_i$ (over the Boolean semiring) before seeing the vector\n$v_{i+1}$, for all $i$. Previous known algorithms for this problem are\ncombinatorial, running in $O(n^3/\\log^2 n)$ time. Henzinger et al. conjecture\nthere is no $O(n^{3-\\varepsilon})$ time algorithm for OMV, for all $\\varepsilon\n> 0$; their OMV conjecture is shown to imply strong hardness results for many\nbasic dynamic problems.\n  We give a substantially faster method for computing OMV, running in\n$n^3/2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log n})}$ randomized time. In fact, after seeing\n$2^{\\omega(\\sqrt{\\log n})}$ vectors, we already achieve\n$n^2/2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log n})}$ amortized time for matrix-vector\nmultiplication. Our approach gives a way to reduce matrix-vector multiplication\nto solving a version of the Orthogonal Vectors problem, which in turn reduces\nto \"small\" algebraic matrix-matrix multiplication. Applications include faster\nindependent set detection, partial match retrieval, and 2-CNF evaluation.\n  We also show how a modification of our method gives a cell probe data\nstructure for OMV with worst case $O(n^{7/4}/\\sqrt{w})$ time per query vector,\nwhere $w$ is the word size.

Indeed, we\nsuccessfully measured the lowest water production rates of an intact comet in\nover 35 years and a corresponding smallest active area, ~0.007 km^2. When\ncombined with the nucleus size found from radar (Howell et al. 2014), this also\nyields the smallest active fraction for any comet, ~0.024%.

In a linear regime and for\nlow-multipolarity modes these mechanisms are confined to either\ngravitational-wave or electromagnetic losses. We here consider the latter and\ncompute the energy losses in the form of Poynting fluxes, Joule heating and\nOhmic dissipation in a relativistic oscillating spherical star with a dipolar\nmagnetic field in vacuum. While this approach is not particularly realistic for\nrapidly rotating stars, it has the advantage that it is fully analytic and that\nit provides expressions for the electric and magnetic fields produced by the\nmost common modes of oscillation both in the vicinity of the star and far away\nfrom it. In this way we revisit and extend to a relativistic context the\nclassical estimates of McDermott et al. Overall, we find that\ngeneral-relativistic corrections lead to electromagnetic damping time-scales\nthat are at least one order of magnitude smaller than in Newtonian gravity.\nFurthermore, with the only exception of $g$ (gravity) modes, we find that $f$\n(fundamental), $p$ (pressure), $i$ (interface) and $s$ (shear) modes are\nsuppressed more efficiently by gravitational losses than by electromagnetic\nones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 19:49:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-03"}

Among many\nuseful features, one critical feature of the ADMM algorithm is its modular\nstructure which allows one to plug in any off-the-shelf image denoising\nalgorithm for a subproblem in the ADMM algorithm. Because of the plug-in\nnature, this type of ADMM algorithms is coined the name \"Plug-and-Play ADMM\".\nPlug-and-Play ADMM has demonstrated promising empirical results in a number of\nrecent papers. However, it is unclear under what conditions and by using what\ndenoising algorithms would it guarantee convergence. Also, since Plug-and-Play\nADMM uses a specific way to split the variables, it is unclear if fast\nimplementation can be made for common Gaussian and Poissonian image restoration\nproblems.\n  In this paper, we propose a Plug-and-Play ADMM algorithm with provable fixed\npoint convergence.

Continuum or mesoscale descriptions of\nsuch systems can be cast in terms of integral equations, whose direct\ncomputational evaluation requires O(N^2) operations, where N is the number of\nunknowns. Such a scaling, which arises from the many-body nature of the\nrelevant Green's function, has precluded wide-spread adoption of integral\nmethods for solution of large-scale scientific and engineering problems. In\nthis work, a parallel computational approach is presented that relies on using\nscalable open source libraries and utilizes a kernel-independent Fast Multipole\nMethod to evaluate the integrals in O(N) operations, with O(N) memory cost,\nthereby substantially improving the scalability and efficiency of computational\nintegral methods. We demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of\nour approach in the contest of two examples.

In this work, we gain insights into the\nrelative importance of different heating mechanisms using three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations including cold gas accretion and momentum-driven jet\nfeedback, which are the most successful models to date in terms reproducing the\nproperties of cool cores. We find that there is net heating within two `jet\ncones' (within ~30 degrees from the axis of jet precession) where the ICM gains\nentropy by shock heating and mixing with the hot thermal gas within bubbles.\nOutside the jet cones, the ambient gas is heated by weak shocks, but not enough\nto overcome radiative cooling, therefore forming a `reduced' cooling flow.\nConsequently, the cluster core is in a process of `gentle circulation' over\nbillions of years. Within the jet cones, there is significant adiabatic cooling\nas the gas is uplifted by buoyantly rising bubbles; outside the cones, energy\nis supplied by inflow of already-heated gas from the jet cones as well as\nadiabatic compression as the gas moves toward the center. In other words, the\nfluid dynamics self-adjusts such that it compensates and transports the heat\nprovided by the AGN, and hence no fine-tuning of the heating profile of any\nprocess is necessary.

Time\nseries which resolve the profiles of absorption lines such as Na I D or Ca II\nH&K are expected to reveal variations due to photoionisation and subsequent\nrecombination of the gases. The presence, composition, and geometry of\ncircumstellar matter may hint at the elusive progenitor system of SNe Ia and\ncould also affect the observed reddening law. To date, there are few known\ncases of time-varying Na I D absorption in SNe Ia, all of which occurred during\nrelatively late phases of the supernova evolution. Photoionisation, however, is\npredicted to occur during the early phases of SNe Ia, when the supernova peaks\nin the ultraviolet.

The communication cost of a write and a read operation are\nrespectively given by $O(f^2)$ and $\\frac{n}{n-f}(\\delta_w+1)$, where\n$\\delta_w$ denotes the number of writes that are concurrent with the particular\nread. In comparison with the recent CASGC algorithm, which also uses MDS codes,\nSODA offers lower storage cost while pays more on the communication cost.\n  We also present a modification of SODA, called SODA$_{\\text{err}}$, to handle\nthe case where some of the servers can return erroneous coded elements during a\nread operation. Specifically, in order to tolerate $f$ server failures and $e$\nerror-prone coded elements, the SODA$_{\\text{err}}$ algorithm uses an $[n, k]$\nMDS code such that $k=n-2e-f$. SODA$_{\\text{err}}$ also guarantees liveness and\natomicity, while maintaining an optimized total storage cost of\n$\\frac{n}{n-f-2e}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 20:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Using\nseveral different spectral models which parameterise the blackbody and\npower-law components seen in the time-averaged spectrum, we find that both\ncomponents are required to vary, although the fractional rms amplitude of\nblackbody emission is small, ~1.4 per cent compared to ~25 per cent for the\npower-law emission. However the blackbody variation leads the power-law\nvariation by ~0.3 in relative phase (~110 degrees), giving a significant break\nin the Fourier lag-energy spectrum that our phase-resolved spectral models are\nable to reproduce.

The model\nconsists of a set of non-interacting overdamped particles moving on a\ndisordered potential. The disordered potential can be thought as a substrate\nhaving some \"defects\" scattered along a one-dimensional line. The distance\nbetween two contiguous defects is assumed to have a heavy-tailed distribution\nwith a given exponent $\\alpha$, which means that the defects along the\nsubstrate are scarce if $\\alpha$ is small. We prove that this system exhibits a\ntransition from normal to anomalous diffusion when the distribution exponent\n$\\alpha$ decreases, i.e., when the defects become scarcer. Thus we identify\nthree distinct scenarios: a normal diffusive phase for $\\alpha>2$, a\nsuperdiffusive phase for $1/2<\\alpha\\leq 2$, and a subdiffusive phase for\n$\\alpha \\leq 1/2$. We also prove that the particle current is finite for all\nthe values of $\\alpha$, which means that the transport is normal independently\nof the diffusion regime (normal, subdiffusive, or superdiffusive). We give\nanalytical expressions for the effective diffusion coefficient for the normal\ndiffusive phase and analytical expressions for the diffusion exponent in the\ncase of anomalous diffusion. We test all these predictions by means of\nnumerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 21:47:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

OB stars have\nan important feedback on the evolution of protoplanetary disks around nearby\nyoung stars and likely on the process of planet formation occurring in them.\nThe nearby massive association Cygnus OB2 is an outstanding laboratory to study\nthis feedback. It is the closest massive association to our Sun, and hosts\nhundreds of massive stars and thousands of low mass members. In this paper, we\nanalyze the spatial variation of the disk fraction in Cygnus OB2 and we study\nits correlation with the local values of Far and Extreme ultraviolet radiation\nfields and the local stellar surface density. We present definitive evidence\nthat disks are more rapidly dissipated in the regions of the association\ncharacterized by intense local UV field and large stellar density. In\nparticular, the FUV radiation dominates disks dissipation timescales in the\nproximity (i.e. within 0.5 pc) of the O stars. In the rest of the association,\nEUV photons potentially induce a significant mass loss from the irradiated\ndisks across the entire association, but the efficiency of this process is\nreduced at increasing distances from the massive stars due to absorption by the\nintervening intracluster material. We find that disk dissipation due to close\nstellar encounters is negligible in Cygnus OB2, and likely to have affected 1%\nor fewer of the stellar population. Disk dissipation is instead dominated by\nphotoevaporation. We also compare our results to what has been found in other\nyoung clusters with different massive populations, concluding that massive\nassociations like Cygnus OB2 are potentially hostile to protoplanetary disks,\nbut that the environments where disks can safely evolve in planetary systems\nare likely quite common in our Galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 22:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-09"}

In a static environment with non-convex state constraints, the\noptimization is modified by defining barrier functions to obtain collision-free\npaths while maintaining the previous goals. By initializing the optimization\nwith trajectories in different homotopy classes and comparing the resultant\ncosts, we improve the quality of the solution in the presence of action and\nmeasurement uncertainties.

We investigated the neural correlates of workload buildup in a\nfine visuomotor task called the boundary avoidance task (BAT). The BAT has been\nknown to induce naturally occurring failures of human-machine coupling in high\nperformance aircraft that can potentially lead to a crash; these failures are\ntermed pilot induced oscillations (PIOs). Approach. We recorded EEG and\npupillometry data from human subjects engaged in a flight BAT simulated within\na virtual 3D environment. Main results. We find that workload buildup in a BAT\ncan be successfully decoded from oscillatory features in the\nelectroencephalogram (EEG). Information in delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma\nspectral bands of the EEG all contribute to successful decoding, however gamma\nband activity with a lateralized somatosensory topography has the highest\ncontribution, while theta band activity with a frontocentral topography has the\nmost robust contribution in terms of real world usability. We show that the\noutput of the spectral decoder can be used to predict PIO susceptibility. We\nalso find that workload buildup in the task induces pupil dilation, the\nmagnitude of which is significantly correlated with the magnitude of the\ndecoded EEG signals. These results suggest that PIOs may result from the\ndysregulation of cortical networks such as the locus coeruleus (LC) anterior\ncingulate cortex (ACC) circuit. Significance. Our findings may generalize to\nsimilar control failures in other cases of tight man machine coupling where\ngains and latencies in the control system must be inferred and compensated for\nby the human operators. A closed-loop intervention using neurophysiological\ndecoding of workload buildup that targets the LC ACC circuit may positively\nimpact operator performance in such situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 22:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-09"}

As a high resolution radar imaging\nmodality, SAR detects and localizes non-moving targets accurately, giving it an\nadvantage over lower resolution GMTI radars. Moving target detection is more\nchallenging due to target smearing and masking by clutter. Space-time adaptive\nprocessing (STAP) is often used to remove the stationary clutter and enhance\nthe moving targets. In this work, it is shown that the performance of STAP can\nbe improved by modeling the clutter covariance as a space vs. time Kronecker\nproduct with low rank factors. Based on this model, a low-rank Kronecker\nproduct covariance estimation algorithm is proposed, and a novel separable\nclutter cancelation filter based on the Kronecker covariance estimate is\nintroduced. The proposed method provides orders of magnitude reduction in the\nrequired number of training samples, as well as improved robustness to\ncorruption of the training data. Simulation results and experiments using the\nGotcha SAR GMTI challenge dataset are presented that confirm the advantages of\nour approach relative to existing techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 23:53:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-09"}

Existing algorithms that\ntake into account such a support structure mostly rely on non-convex methods\nand---as a consequence---do not scale well to high-dimensional problems and/or\ndo not converge to global optima. In this paper, we explore the use of new\nblock $l_1$-norm regularizers, which enforce image sparsity while\nsimultaneously promoting smooth support structure. By exploiting the convexity\nof our regularizers, we develop new computationally-efficient recovery\nalgorithms that guarantee global optimality. We demonstrate the efficacy of our\nregularizers on a variety of imaging tasks including compressive image\nrecovery, image restoration, and robust PCA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2016 03:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-09"}

This paper proposes a novel\nframework which formulates CGRL as a convex optimization problem, enables\ntransductive learning using both labeled and unlabeled tuples, and offers a\nscalable algorithm that guarantees the optimal solution and enjoys a linear\ntime complexity with respect to the sizes of input graphs. In our experiments\nwith a subset of DBLP publication records and an Enzyme multi-source dataset,\nthe proposed method successfully scaled to the large cross-graph inference\nproblem, and outperformed other representative approaches significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2016 06:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-09"}

When radio emission is bright, a hard power-law tail without\nevidence for an exponential cutoff is observed in most systems. We have\ndeveloped a jet model that explains many spectral and timing properties of\nblack-hole binaries in the states where a jet is present. Our goal is to\ninvestigate whether our jet model can reproduce the hard tail, with the correct\nrange of photon index and the absence of a high-energy cutoff, in neutron-star\nX-ray binaries. We have performed Monte Carlo simulations of the Compton\nupscattering of soft, accretion-disk or boundary layer photons, in the jet and\ncomputed the emergent energy spectra, as well as the time lag of hard photons\nwith respect to softer ones as a function of Fourier frequency. We demonstrate\nthat our jet model explains the observed power-law distribution with photon\nindex in the range 1.8-3. With an appropriate choice of the parameters, the\ncutoff expected from Comptonization is shifted to energies above ~300 keV,\nproducing a pure power law without any evidence for a rollover, in agreement\nwith the observations. Our results reinforce the idea that the link between the\noutflow (jet) and inflow (disk) in X-ray binaries does not depend on the nature\nof the compact object, but on the process of accretion. Furthermore, we address\nthe differences of jets in black-hole and neutron-star X-ray binaries and\npredict that the break frequency in the spectral energy distribution of\nneutron-star X-ray binaries, as a class, will be lower than that of black-hole\nbinaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2016 07:20:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

Unlike the conventional sequential LZ transitions,\nwhich are symmetric to the zero detuning, the LZ transitions of Bose condensed\natoms in a cavity field are asymmetric and sensitively depend on the photon\nnumber distribution of the cavity. In LZ processes involving single excitation\nnumbers, both the variance of the relative atom number and the step slope of\nthe sequential population ladder are asymmetric, and the asymmetry become more\nsignificant for smaller excitation numbers. Furthermore, in LZ processes\ninvolving multiple excitation numbers, there may appear asymmetric population\nladders with decreasing step heights. During a dynamical LZ process, due to the\natom-cavity coupling, the cavity field shows dynamical collapse and revivals.\nIn comparison with the symmetric LZ transitions in a classical field, the\nasymmetric LZ transitions in a cavity field originate from the\nphoton-number-dependent Rabi frequency. The asymmetric sequential LZ dynamics\nof Bose condensed atoms in a cavity field may open up a new way to explore the\nfundamental many-body physics in coupled atom-photon systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2016 07:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-17"}

In this\npaper we present a new algorithm, dubbed CAESAR (Compact And Extended Source\nAutomated Recognition), to detect and parametrize extended sources in radio\ninterferometric maps. It is based on a pre-filtering stage, allowing image\ndenoising, compact source suppression and enhancement of diffuse emission,\nfollowed by an adaptive superpixel clustering stage for final source\nsegmentation. A parameterization stage provides source flux information and a\nwide range of morphology estimators for post-processing analysis. We developed\nCAESAR in a modular software library, including also different methods for\nlocal background estimation and image filtering, along with alternative\nalgorithms for both compact and diffuse source extraction. The method was\napplied to real radio continuum data collected at the Australian Telescope\nCompact Array (ATCA) within the SCORPIO project, a pathfinder of the ASKAP-EMU\nsurvey. The source reconstruction capabilities were studied over different test\nfields in the presence of compact sources, imaging artefacts and diffuse\nemission from the Galactic plane and compared with existing algorithms. When\ncompared to a human-driven analysis, the designed algorithm was found capable\nof detecting known target sources and regions of diffuse emission,\noutperforming alternative approaches over the considered fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2016 08:04:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-09"}

Self-consistent coupling between the mean-field potential\nand the single-particle motion is a key ingredient in the unified model of Bohr\nand Mottelson, which could lead to a deformed nucleus as a consequence of\nspontaneous breaking of the rotational symmetry. Some remarks on the\nfinite-size quantum effects are given. In finite nuclei, the deformation\ninevitably introduces the rotation as a symmetry-restoring collective motion\n(Anderson-Nambu-Goldstone mode), and the rotation affects the intrinsic motion.\nIn order to investigate the interplay between the rotational and intrinsic\nmotions in a variety of collective phenomena, we use the cranking prescription\ntogether with the quasiparticle random phase approximation. At low spin, the\ncoupling effect can be seen in the generalized intensity relation. A feasible\nquantization of the cranking model is presented, which provides a microscopic\napproach to the higher-order intensity relation. At high spin, the\nsemiclassical cranking prescription works well.

We use tested methods for modelling\n$\\alpha-\\Omega$ galactic dynamos, taking into account the available\nobservational information concerning ionized interstellar matter in ring\ngalaxies. Our main result is that dynamo drivers in ring galaxies are strong\nenough to excite large-scale magnetic fields in the ring galaxies studied. The\nvariety of dynamo driven magnetic configurations in ring galaxies obtained in\nour modelling is much richer than that found in classical spiral galaxies. In\nparticular, various long-lived transients are possible. An especially\ninteresting case is that of NGC 4513 where the ring counter-rotates with\nrespect to the disc. Strong shear in the region between the disc and the ring\nis associated with unusually strong dynamo drivers for the counter-rotators.\nThe effect of the strong drivers is found to be unexpectedly moderate. With\ncounter-rotation in the disc, a generic model shows that a steady mixed parity\nmagnetic configuration, unknown for classical spiral galaxies, may be excited,\nalthough we do not specifically model NGC 4513. We deduce that ring galaxies\nconstitute a morphological class of galaxies in which identification of\nlarge-scale magnetic fields from observations of polarized radio emission, as\nwell as dynamo modelling, may be possible.

We used very high-quality spectra of the two stars\nretrieved from the HARPS archive to derive very precise stellar parameters and\nchemical abundances. We derived the stellar parameters with the classical\n(nondifferential) method, while we applied a differential line-by-line analysis\nto achieve the highest possible precision in abundances, which are fundamental\nto explore for very tiny differences in the abundances between the stars. We\nconfirm that the abundance difference between $\\zeta^2$ Ret and $\\zeta^1$ Ret\nshows a significant ($\\sim$ 2 $\\sigma$) correlation with Tc. However, we also\nfind that the Tc trends depend on the individual spectrum used (even if always\nof very high quality).

Our results for the $\\zeta$ Reticuli system show, for\nexample, that nonphysical factors, such as the quality of spectra employed and\nerrors that are not accounted for, can be at the root of the Tc trends for the\ncase of individual spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2016 12:47:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

Motility of M. xanthus depends on two\nmotility machineries: the S-engine and A-engine. Moving M. xanthus cells can\norganize into spreading colonies or spore-filled fruiting bodies depending on\ntheir nutritional status. To understand these two pattern formation processes\nand the contributions by the two motility machineries, as well as cell\nreversal, we analyze spatial self-organization in 3 strains: i) a mutant that\nmoves unidirectionally without reversing by the A-motility system only, ii) a\nunidirectional mutant that is also equipped with the S-motility system, and\niii) the wild-type that, in addition to the two motility systems, reverses its\ndirection of movement. The mutant moving by the A-engine illustrates that\ncollective motion in the form of large moving clusters can arise in gliding\nbacteria due to steric interactions of the rod-shaped cells, without the need\nof invoking any biochemical signal regulation. The two-engine strain mutant\nreveals that the same phenomenon emerges when both motility systems are\npresent, and as long as cells exhibit unidirectional motion only. From the\nstudy of these two strains, we conclude that unidirectional cell motion induces\nthe formation of large moving clusters at low and intermediate densities, while\nit results into vortex formation at very high densities. These findings are\nconsistent with what is known from self-propelled rods which strongly suggests\nthat the combined effect of self-propulsion and volume exclusion interactions\nis the pattern formation mechanism leading to the observed phenomena. In\naddition, we learn that when cells reverse, as observed in the wild-type, cells\nform small but strongly elongated clusters and self-organize into a mesh-like\nstructure at high enough densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2016 14:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-09"}

Iron is\nprimarily synthesized in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and in core collapse\nsupernovae (CCSN), and is present in the outflows from AGB stars. Only the\nlatter two are observed to be sources of interstellar dust, since searches for\ndust in SN~Ia have provided strong evidence for the absence of any significant\nmass of dust in their ejecta. Consequently, more than 65% of the iron is\ninjected into the ISM in gaseous form. Yet, ultraviolet and X-ray observations\nalong many lines of sight in the ISM show that iron is severely depleted in the\ngas phase compared to expected solar abundances. The missing iron, comprising\nabout 90% of the total, is believed to be locked up in interstellar dust. This\nsuggests that most of the missing iron must have precipitated from the ISM gas\nby cold accretion onto preexisting silicate, carbon, or composite grains. Iron\nis thus the only element that requires most of its growth to occur outside the\ntraditional stellar condensation sources. This is a robust statement that does\nnot depend on our evolving understanding of the dust destruction efficiency in\nthe ISM. Reconciling the physical, optical, and chemical properties of such\ncomposite grains with their many observational manifestations is a major\nchallenge for understanding the nature and origin of interstellar dust.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 May 2016 14:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-20"}

However, if the shunt parameters of the lines, composing the power\ngrid, are considered the proposed methods do not provide sufficient conditions\nthat can be verified ex ante for the exactness of the optimal solutions.\nAdditionally, the same formulations have not correctly accounted for the\nampacity constraint of the lines. Similar to the inclusion of upper\nvoltage-magnitude limit, the SOCP relaxation faces difficulties when the\nampacity constraints of the lines are binding. In order to overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a convex formulation of the OPF problem applied to\nradial power grids for which the AC-OPF equations, including the transverse\nparameters, are considered.

Following this methodological perspective we introduce here\nthe Accounting Network, i.e. the network we can extract through vector\nsimilarities techniques from companies' financial statements. We build the\nAccounting Network on a large database of worldwide banks in the period\n2001-2013, covering the onset of the global financial crisis of mid-2007. After\na careful data cleaning, we apply a quality check in the construction of the\nnetwork, introducing a parameter (the Quality Ratio) capable of trading off the\nsize of the sample (coverage) and the representativeness of the financial\nstatements (accuracy). We compute several basic network statistics and check,\nwith the Louvain community detection algorithm, for emerging communities of\nbanks. Remarkably enough sensible regional aggregations show up with the\nJapanese and the US clusters dominating the community structure, although the\npresence of a geographically mixed community points to a gradual convergence of\nbanks into similar supranational practices. Finally, a Principal Component\nAnalysis procedure reveals the main economic components that influence\ncommunities' heterogeneity. Even using the most basic vector similarity\nhypotheses on the composition of the financial statements, the signature of the\nfinancial crisis clearly arises across the years around 2008.

The main reason is electron-phonon renormalization. The\nphysics behind the T^4-power law is more complex than has been realized.\nRenormalization by intraband scattering requires a careful non-adiabatic\ntreatment in order to correctly include acoustic phonons and avoid divergences\nfrom piezoacoustic phonon interactions. The result is an unexpected low T term\nE_g(0)+A' T^p with positive coefficient A', and power p=4 for non-piezoelectric\nmaterials, and power p=2 for piezoelectric materials. The acoustic phonons in\npiezoelectric semiconductors generate a piezoelectric field, modifying the\nelectron-phonon coupling. However, at higher T, when thermal acoustic phonons\nof energy hbar v_s q acquire energies comparable to the electronic intermediate\nstate (higher than the band-edge state by hbar^2 q^2 /2m*), the low q and\nhigher q intraband contributions to T^p rapidly cancel, giving little thermal\neffect. But there is an additional T-dependence from interband effects of\nacoustic phonons. This turns out to have power law T^4 for both\nnon-piezoelectric and piezoelectric semiconductors. This term can have either\nsign, but usually reduces the size of gaps as T increases. It arises after\ncancellation of the T^2 terms that appear separately in Debye-Waller and Fan\nparts of the acoustic phonon interband renormalization.

The axial and\ntransverse radiation spin torque components are evaluated in the dipole\napproximation using the radiative correction of the electric field. Particular\nemphasis is given on the polarization as well as changing the topological\ncharge and the beam's half-cone angle. When the beam order is zero, the axial\nspin torque component vanishes. However, when the beam order becomes a real\npositive number, the vortex beam induces left-handed (negative) axial spin\ntorque as the sphere shifts off-axially from the center of the beam. The\nresults show that a non-diffracting non-paraxial fractional Bessel vortex beam\nis capable to induce a spin reversal of an absorptive Rayleigh sphere placed\narbitrarily in its path.

We show that the topological invariants, the Chern\nnumbers of corresponding Bloch band is equivalent to the winding number in the\nauxiliary plane, which can be utilized to characterize the phase diagram. We\nintroduce the concept of Majorana charge, the magnitude of which is defined by\nthe distribution of Majorana fermion probability in zero-mode states, and the\nsign is defined by the type of Majorana fermion.

The toolkit uses existing sound measures, but\nuniquely applies these to capture the early time period (actual pulse) and late\ntime period (reverberation and multiple arrivals). In total, 183 features are\nproduced for each air-gun sound. This toolkit was utilized on data retrieved\nfrom a field deployment encompassing five marine autonomous recording units\nduring a 46-day seismic air-gun survey in Baffin Bay, Greenland. Using this\ntoolkit, a total of 147 million data points were identified from the Greenland\ndeployment recordings. The feasibility of extracting a large number of features\nwas then evaluated using two separate methods: a serial computer and a high\nperformance system. Results indicate that data extraction performance took an\nestimated 216 hours for the serial system, and 18 hours for the high\nperformance computer. This paper provides an analytical description of the new\ntoolkit along with details for using it to identify relevant data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 May 2016 18:03:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-07-29"}
