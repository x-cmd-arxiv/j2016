In this paper we discuss\nthe sensitivity of the T2HKK experiment, whose possibility is now seriously\ndiscussed as a future extension of the T2K experiment, to such NSI. On the\nassumption that $\\epsilon_{\\alpha\\mu}=0~(\\alpha=e, \\mu\\tau)$ and\n$\\epsilon_{\\tau\\tau}=|\\epsilon_{e\\tau}|/(1+\\epsilon_{ee})$, which are satisfied\nby other experiments to a good approximation, we find that, among the possible\noff-axis flux configurations of $1.3^\\circ$, $1.5^\\circ$, $2.0^\\circ$ and\n$2.5^\\circ$, the case of the off-axis angle $1.3^\\circ$ gives the highest\nsensitivity to $\\epsilon_{ee}$ and $|\\epsilon_{e\\tau}|$. Our results show that\nthe $1.3^\\circ$ off-axis configuration can exclude NSI for\n$|\\epsilon_{ee}|\\gtrsim 1$ or $|\\epsilon_{e\\tau}|\\gtrsim 0.2$ at 3$\\sigma$. We\nalso find that in the presence of NSI, T2HKK (for the off-axis angle\n$1.3^\\circ$) has better sensitivity to the two CP phases ($\\delta_{CP}$ and\narg($\\epsilon_{e \\tau}$)) than DUNE. This is because of the synergy between the\ntwo detectors i.e., one at Kamioka and one at Korea. T2HKK has better\nsensitivity to the CP phases than the atmospheric neutrino experiment at\nHyperkamiokande in inverted hierarchy, but in normal hierarchy the atmospheric\nneutrino experiment has the best sensitivity to the CP phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 16:16:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 08:17:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

The distribution of local sources of primary cosmic rays has been\nsuggested as a potential solution to this puzzling behavior. Some authors even\nclaim that a single source is responsible for the observed anomalies. But how\nprobable these explanations are? To answer that question, our current\ndescription of cosmic ray Galactic propagation needs to be replaced by the\nMyriad model. In the former approach, sources of protons and helium nuclei are\ntreated as a jelly continuously spread over space and time. A more accurate\ndescription is provided by the Myriad model where sources are considered as\npoint-like events. This leads to a probabilistic derivation of the fluxes of\nprimary species, and opens the possibility that larger-than-average values may\nbe observed at the Earth. For a long time though, a major obstacle has been the\ninfinite variance associated to the probability distribution function which the\nfluxes follow. Several suggestions have been made to cure this problem but none\nis entirely satisfactory. We go a step further here and solve the infinite\nvariance problem of the Myriad model by making use of the generalized central\nlimit theorem. We find that primary fluxes are distributed according to a\nstable law with heavy tail, well-known to financial analysts. The probability\nthat the proton and helium anomalies are sourced by local SNR can then be\ncalculated. The p-values associated to the CREAM measurements turn out to be\nsmall, unless somewhat unrealistic propagation parameters are assumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 16:55:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

Although metrics have been\nproposed in these contexts, no systematic study has been conducted on the\nselection of a robust metric for quality assessment. This article addresses the\nquestion: what is the best metric to assess the quality of a reconstructed\nimage? It starts by considering several metrics, and selecting a few based on\ngeneral properties. Then, a variety of image reconstruction cases is\nconsidered. The observational scenarios are phase closure and phase referencing\nat the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), for a combination of two,\nthree, four and six telescopes. End-to-end image reconstruction is accomplished\nwith the MiRA software, and several merit functions are put to test. It is\nfound that convolution by an effective point spread function is required for\nproper image quality assessment. The effective angular resolution of the images\nis superior to naive expectation based on the maximum frequency sampled by the\narray. This is due to the prior information used in the aperture synthesis\nalgorithm and to the nature of the objects considered. The l1 norm is the most\nrobust of all considered metrics, because being linear it is less sensitive to\nimage smoothing by high regularisation levels. For the cases considered, this\nmetric allows the implementation of automatic quality assessment of\nreconstructed images, with a performance similar to human selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 16:58:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2017 22:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

In this paper, we introduce a general technique called the\nlayerwise origin-target synthesis (LOTS) that can be efficiently used to form\nadversarial examples that mimic the deep features of the target. We analyze and\ncompare the adversarial robustness of the end-to-end VGG Face network with\nsystems that use Euclidean or cosine distance between gallery templates and\nextracted deep features. We demonstrate that iterative LOTS is very effective\nand show that systems utilizing deep features are easier to attack than the\nend-to-end network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 17:59:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 02:53:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2017 01:51:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 5 Aug 2017 02:49:05 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 31 May 2018 16:12:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-01"}

Finding the \"best\" set of vertices of a\ntournament is a well studied problem in social choice theory. A {\\em tournament\nsolution} takes a tournament as input and outputs a subset of vertices of the\ninput tournament. However, in many applications, for example, choosing the best\nset of drugs from a given set of drugs, the edges of the tournament are given\nonly implicitly and knowing the orientation of an edge is costly. In such\nscenarios, we would like to know the best set of vertices (according to some\ntournament solution) by \"querying\" as few edges as possible. We, in this paper,\nprecisely study this problem for commonly used tournament solutions: given an\noracle access to the edges of a tournament T, find $f(T)$ by querying as few\nedges as possible, for a tournament solution f. We first show that the set of\nCondorcet non-losers in a tournament can be found by querying $2n-\\lfloor \\log\nn \\rfloor -2$ edges only and this is tight in the sense that every algorithm\nfor finding the set of Condorcet non-losers needs to query at least $2n-\\lfloor\n\\log n \\rfloor -2$ edges in the worst case, where $n$ is the number of vertices\nin the input tournament.

On the positive\nside, we are able to circumvent our strong query complexity lower bound results\nby proving that, if the size of the top cycle of the input tournament is at\nmost $k$, then we can find all the tournament solutions mentioned above by\nquerying $O(nk + \\frac{n\\log n}{\\log(1-\\frac{1}{k})})$ edges only.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 18:19:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 13:26:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2017 05:45:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-26"}

We prove that with the possible exception of some families of rank 1\ngroups of Lie type, the number of generators of every second maximal subgroup\nof $G$ is bounded by an absolute constant. We also show that such a bound holds\nwithout any exceptions if and only if there are only finitely many primes $r$\nfor which there is a prime power $q$ such that $(q^r-1)/(q-1)$ is prime. The\nlatter statement is a formidable open problem in Number Theory. Applications to\nrandom generation and polynomial growth are also given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 18:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-21"}

In this paper, based on\nthe toolkit of algorithmic randomness we present an operational\ncharacterization of the notion of probability, called an ensemble. Algorithmic\nrandomness, also known as algorithmic information theory, is a field of\nmathematics which enables us to consider the randomness of an individual\ninfinite sequence.

Furthermore, we give equivalent characterizations of the\nnotion of independence of an arbitrary number of events/random variables in\nterms of ensembles.

By\nevaluating the NLC workloads, we show that only the conservative\nhyper-parameter setup (e.g., small mini-batch size and small learning rate) can\nguarantee acceptable model accuracy for a wide range of customers. We further\njustify theoretically why such a setup guarantees better model convergence in\ngeneral. Unfortunately, the small mini-batch size causes a high volume of\ncommunication traffic in a parameter-server based system. We characterize the\nhigh communication bandwidth requirement of TaaS using representative\nindustrial deep learning workloads and demonstrate that none of the\nstate-of-the-art scale-up or scale-out solutions can satisfy such a\nrequirement. We then present GaDei, an optimized shared-memory based scale-up\nparameter server design. We prove that the designed protocol is deadlock-free\nand it processes each gradient exactly once. Our implementation is evaluated on\nboth commercial benchmarks and public benchmarks to demonstrate that it\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-server based\nimplementation while maintaining the required accuracy and our implementation\nreaches near the best possible runtime performance, constrained only by the\nhardware limitation. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, GaDei is the\nonly scale-up DL system that provides fault-tolerance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 20:06:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2017 20:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-05"}

The degree of correlation is quantified by a complex-valued order\nparameter, whose amplitude is proportional to the strength of the pairing\npotential in the condensate. Supercurrent-carrying states are associated with\nnon-zero values of the spatial gradient of the phase. The pairing potential and\nseveral physical observables of the Cooper condensate can be manipulated by\nmeans of temperature, current bias, dishomogeneities in the chemical\ncomposition or application of a magnetic field.

The Mori-Zwanzig (M-Z) procedure\nallows one to write down formally closed evolution equations for the resolved\nphysics. In these equations, the unclosed terms are recast as a memory integral\ninvolving the past history of the resolved variables, and a \"noise\" term. While\nthe M-Z procedure does not directly reduce the complexity of the original\nsystem, these equations can serve as a mathematically consistent starting point\nto develop closures based on approximations of the memory. In this scenario, a\npriori knowledge of the memory kernel, which is not explicitly known for\nnonlinear systems, is of paramount importance to assess the validity of a\nmemory approximation. Unraveling the memory kernel requires the determination\nof the orthogonal dynamics which is a projected high-dimensional partial\ndifferential equation that is not tractable in general. A method to estimate\nthe memory kernel a priori, using full-order solution snapshots, is proposed.\nThe main idea is to solve a pseudo orthogonal dynamics equation, that has a\nconvenient Liouville form, instead of the original one. This ersatz arises from\nthe assumption that the semi-group of the orthogonal dynamics operator is a\ncomposition operator, akin to semi-groups of Liouville operators, for one\nobservable. The method is exact in the linear case where the kernel is known\nexplicitly. Results for under-resolved simulations of the Burgers and\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equations demonstrate that the proposed technique can\naccurately reconstruct the transfer of information between the resolved and\nunresolved dynamics through memory, and provide valuable information about the\nkernel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 23:51:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 21:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-26"}

The aim is to obtain optimal discrete-time\nperturbations in nonlinear dynamical systems to transport a specified initial\nmeasure on the phase space to a final measure in finite time. The measure is\npropagated under system dynamics in between the perturbations via the\nassociated transfer operator. Each perturbation is described by a deterministic\nmap in the measure space that implements a version of Monge-Kantorovich optimal\ntransport with quadratic cost. Hence, the optimal solution minimizes a sum of\nquadratic costs on phase space transport due to the perturbations applied at\nspecified times. The action of the transport map is approximated by a\ncontinuous pseudo-time flow on a graph, resulting in a tractable convex\noptimization problem. This problem is solved via state-of-the-art solvers to\nglobal optimality. We apply this algorithm to a problem of transport between\nmeasures supported on two disjoint almost-invariant sets in a chaotic fluid\nsystem, and to a finite-time optimal mixing problem by choosing the final\nmeasure to be uniform. In both cases, the optimal perturbations are found to\nexploit the phase space structures, such as lobe dynamics, leading to efficient\nglobal transport. As the time-horizon of the problem is increased, the optimal\nperturbations become increasingly localized. Hence, by combining the transfer\noperator approach with ideas from the theory of optimal mass transportation, we\nobtain a discrete-time graph-based algorithm for optimal transport and mixing\nin nonlinear systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 23:55:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2017 22:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-22"}

In linear electronics, it has been critical for allowing\ninvariance to device properties. Negative feedback is also known to enhance\nlinearity in amplification, which is one of the most important foundations of\nlinear electronics. At the same time, thousands of transistors types have been\nmade available, suggesting that these devices, in addition to their known\nvariability of parameters, have distinguishing properties. The current work\nreports a systematic approach to quantifying the potential of negative\nfeedback, with respect to bipolar transistors, as a means to providing device\ninvariance and linearity. Several methods, including concepts from multivariate\nstatistics and complex systems, are applied at the theoretical as well as\nexperimental levels, and a number of interesting results are obtained and\ndiscussed. For instance, it has been verified that the transistors types indeed\nhave well-defined characteristics which clearly segregate them into groups. The\naddition of feedback at moderate and intense levels promoted uniformization of\nthe properties of these transistors when used in a class A common emitter\nconfiguration. However, such effect occurred with different efficiency\nregarding the considered device features, and even intense feedback was unable\nto completely eliminate device dependence. This indicates that it would be\ninteresting to consider the device properties in linear design even when\nnegative feedback is applied. We also verified that the linearization induced\nin the considered experiments is relatively modest, with effects that depend on\ntype of transfer function of the original devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2016 12:35:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-22"}

In this\npaper, we introduce and analyze a new numerical method to simulate scattering\nfrom locally perturbed periodic structures based on the Bloch transform. As\nthis transform is applied only in periodic domains, we firstly rewrite the\nscattering problem artificially in a periodic domain. With the help of the\nBloch transform, we secondly transform this problem into a coupled family of\nquasiperiodic problems posed in the periodicity cell. A numerical scheme then\napproximates the family of quasiperiodic solutions (we rely on the finite\nelement method) and backtransformation provides the solution to the original\nscattering problem.

It has been seen that\nhigh-dimensional data points can be quantized into binary codes to give an\nefficient similarity approximation via Hamming distance. Among existing\nschemes, ranking-based hashing is recent promising that targets at preserving\nordinal relations of ranking in the Hamming space to minimize retrieval loss.\nHowever, the size of the ranking tuples, which shows the ordinal relations, is\nquadratic or cubic to the size of training samples. By given a large-scale\ntraining data set, it is very expensive to embed such ranking tuples in binary\ncode learning. Besides, it remains a dificulty to build ranking tuples\nefficiently for most ranking-preserving hashing, which are deployed over an\nordinal graph-based setting. To handle these problems, we propose a novel\nranking-preserving hashing method, dubbed Ordinal Constraint Hashing (OCH),\nwhich efficiently learns the optimal hashing functions with a graph-based\napproximation to embed the ordinal relations. The core idea is to reduce the\nsize of ordinal graph with ordinal constraint projection, which preserves the\nordinal relations through a small data set (such as clusters or random\nsamples). In particular, to learn such hash functions effectively, we further\nrelax the discrete constraints and design a specific stochastic gradient decent\nalgorithm for optimization. Experimental results on three large-scale visual\nsearch benchmark datasets, i.e. LabelMe, Tiny100K and GIST1M, show that the\nproposed OCH method can achieve superior performance over the state-of-the-arts\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2016 13:24:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-22"}

These have distinct transport properties at zero field: the S1\ndisplays a metallic behavior with a pronounced resistance peak and a sudden\nsign reversal in thermopower at approximately 130 K, consistent with previous\nobservations of the electronic transition; in strikingly contrast, the S2\nexhibits a semiconducting-like behavior at low temperatures and a positive\nthermopower over the whole temperature range. Refinements on the single-crystal\nX-ray diffraction and the energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis revealed the\npresence of noticeable Te-vacancies in the sample S1, confirming that the\nwidely observed anomalous transport behaviors in pentatellurides actually take\nplace in the Te-deficient samples. Electronic structure calculations show\nnarrow gap semiconducting behavior, with different transport anisotropies for\nholes and electrons. For the degenerately doped n-type samples, our transport\ncalculations can result in a resistivity peak and crossover in thermopower from\nnegative to positive at temperatures close to that observed experimentally. Our\npresent work resolves the longstanding puzzle regarding the anomalous transport\nbehaviors of pentatellurides, and also resolves the electronic structure in\nfavor of a semiconducting state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2016 14:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-06"}

Very low-mass (VLM) stars and brown dwarfs (BDs) present a different\nrotational behaviour from their solar mass counter-parts. Aims. We investigate\nthe rotational evolution of young VLM stars and BDs using Monte Carlo\nsimulations under the hypothesis of disk locking and stellar angular momentum\nconservation. Methods. We built a set of objects with masses ranging from 0.01\nMo to 0.4 Mo and considered models with single- and double- peaked initial\nperiod distributions with and without disk locking. An object is considered to\nbe diskless when its mass accretion rate is below a given threshold. Results.\nModels with initial single-peaked period distributions reproduce the\nobservations well given that BDs rotate faster than VLM stars. We observe a\ncorrelation between rotational period and mass when we relax the disk locking\nhypothesis, but with a shallower slope compared to some observational results.\nThe angular momentum evolution of diskless stars is flatter than it is for\nstars with a disk which occurs because the moment of inertia of objects less\nmassive than 0.2 Mo remains pratically constant for a time scale that increases\nwith decreasing stellar mass.

Comparing our results with the\navailable observational data we see that disk locking is not as important in\nthe low-mass regime and that the rotational behaviour of VLM stars and BDs is\ndifferent from what is seen in their solar mass counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2016 15:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

Surprisingly, to the\nbest of our knowledge, nobody ever proved confluence or termination for this\nelimination procedure. Even myths on non-confluence and the openness of the\ntermination problem are circulating. We show confluence and termination of this\nelimination procedure by means of a direct, straightforward, and easily\nverifiable proof, based on a new theorem on how to obtain termination from weak\nnormalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2016 15:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-21"}

For neutrino-driven\nexplosions the NS acceleration was shown to be mainly caused by the\ngravitational attraction of the anisotropically expelled inner ejecta, while\nhydrodynamic forces contribute on a subdominant level, and asymmetric neutrino\nemission plays only a secondary role. Two- and three-dimensional hydrodynamic\nsimulations demonstrated that this gravitational tug-boat mechanism can explain\nthe observed space velocities of young NSs up to more than 1000 km/s. Here, we\ndiscuss how the NS kick depends on the energy, ejecta mass, and asymmetry of\nthe SN explosion, and which role the compactness of the pre-collapse stellar\ncore plays for the momentum transfer to the NS. We also provide simple analytic\nexpressions for the NS velocity in terms of these quantities. Referring to\nresults of hydrodynamic simulations in the literature, we argue why within the\ndiscussed scenario of NS acceleration, electron-capture SNe, low-mass Fe-core\nSNe and ultra-stripped SNe can be expected to have considerably lower intrinsic\nNS kicks than core-collapse SNe of massive stellar cores. Our basic arguments\nremain valid also if progenitor stars possess large-scale asymmetries in their\nconvective silicon and oxygen burning layers. Possible scenarios for spin-kick\nalignment are sketched. Much of our discussion remains on a conceptual and\nqualitative level and more work is needed on the numerical modeling side to\ndetermine the dependences of involved parameters, whose prescriptions will be\nneeded for recipes that can be used to better describe NS kicks in binary\nevolution and population synthesis studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2016 00:39:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2017 20:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

The SAC delays mitotic progression by preventing activation of\nthe ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) or cyclosome; whose\nactivation by Cdc20 is required for sister-chromatid separation marking the\ntransition into anaphase. The mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which contains\nCdc20 as a subunit, binds stably to the APC/C. Compelling evidence by Izawa and\nPines (Nature 2014; 10.1038/nature13911) indicates that the MCC can inhibit a\nsecond Cdc20 that has already bound and activated the APC/C. Whether or not MCC\nper se is sufficient to fully sequester Cdc20 and inhibit APC/C remains\nunclear. Here, a dynamic model for SAC regulation in which the MCC binds a\nsecond Cdc20 was constructed. This model is compared to the MCC, and the\nMCC-and-BubR1 (dual inhibition of APC) core model variants and subsequently\nvalidated with experimental data from the literature. By using ordinary\nnonlinear differential equations and spatial simulations, it is shown that the\nSAC works sufficiently to fully sequester Cdc20 and completely inhibit APC/C\nactivity. This study highlights the principle that a systems biology approach\nis vital for molecular biology and could also be used for creating hypotheses\nto design future experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2016 09:26:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}
