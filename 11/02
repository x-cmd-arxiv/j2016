To this end, we first fit a 3DMM to the 2D face images of a\ndictionary to reconstruct the 3D shape and texture of each image. The 3D faces\nare used to render a number of virtual 2D face images with arbitrary pose\nvariations to augment the training data, by merging the original and rendered\nvirtual samples to create an extended dictionary. Second, to reduce the\ninformation redundancy of the extended dictionary and improve the sparsity of\nreconstruction coefficient vectors using collaborative-representation-based\nclassification (CRC), we exploit an on-line elimination scheme to optimise the\nextended dictionary by identifying the most representative training samples for\na given query. The final goal is to perform pose-invariant face classification\nusing the proposed dictionary integration method and the on-line pruning\nstrategy under the CRC framework. Experimental results obtained for a set of\nwell-known face datasets demonstrate the merits of the proposed method,\nespecially its robustness to pose variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 16:06:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 18:22:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2016 16:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-28"}

In contrast\nto traditional cable television, revenue in online services is generated solely\nthrough advertisements, and depends on the number of clicks generated. Channel\nowners aim to opportunistically schedule advertisements so as to generate\nmaximum revenue. This paper considers the problem of optimal scheduling of\nadvertisements in live online social media. The problem is formulated as a\nmultiple stopping problem and is addressed in a partially observed Markov\ndecision process (POMDP) framework. Structural results are provided on the\noptimal advertisement scheduling policy. By exploiting the structure of the\noptimal policy, best linear thresholds are computed using stochastic\napproximation. The proposed model and framework are validated on real datasets,\nand the following observations are made: (i) The policy obtained by the\nmultiple stopping problem can be used to detect changes in ground truth from\nonline search data (ii) Numerical results show a significant improvement in the\nexpected revenue by opportunistically scheduling the advertisements.

We investigate resonant interaction of\nenergetic electrons with dispersive, right-handed waves. For the interaction of\nparticles and a single wave a variable transformation into the rest frame of\nthe wave can be performed. Here, wellestablished analytic models derived in the\nframework of magnetostatic quasi-linear theory (QLT) can be used as a reference\nto validate simulation results. However, this approach fails as soon as several\ndispersive waves are involved. Based on analytic solutions modeling the\nscattering amplitude in the magnetostatic limit, we present an approach to\nmodify these equations for the use in the plasma frame. Thereby we aim at a\ndescription of particle scattering in the presence of several waves. A\nParticle-in-Cell (PiC) code is employed to study wave-particle scattering on a\nmicro-physically correct level and to test the modified model equations.

In the present approach the wave functions of Ho and Dy* are\ndetermined selfconsistently with the antisymmetrized relativistic\nDirac-Hartree-Fock approach. The relativistic continuum electron wave functions\nfor the ionized Dy* are obtained in the corresponding selfconsistent\nDirac-Hartree-Fock-Potential. In this improved approach shake-off can hardly be\nseen after electron capture in 163Ho and thus can probably not affect the\ndetermination of the electron neutrino mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 18:36:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2016 16:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

The seismic properties of the KIC 10553698A\nprovide a test of stellar evolution models, and offer a unique opportunity to\ndetermine mixing processes. We consider mixing due to convective overshooting\nbeyond the boundary of the helium burning core. Very small overshooting ( f =\n10^{-6} ) results in a progressive increase in the size of convective core.\nHowever, moderate ( f = 10^{-2} ) and small ( f = 10^{-5} ) overshooting both\nlead to the occurrence of inert outer convective shells in the near-core\nregion. We illustrate that the chemical stratifications induced by convective\nshells are able to change the g-mode period spacing pattern of a sdB star\nappreciably.

We observe that we can straightforwardly privatise VB's approximate\nposterior distributions for models in the CE family, by perturbing the expected\nsufficient statistics of the complete-data likelihood. For a broadly-used class\nof non-CE models, those with binomial likelihoods, we show how to bring such\nmodels into the CE family, such that inferences in the modified model resemble\nthe private variational Bayes algorithm as closely as possible, using the\nPolya-Gamma data augmentation scheme. The iterative nature of variational Bayes\npresents a further challenge since iterations increase the amount of noise\nneeded. We overcome this by combining: (1) an improved composition method for\ndifferential privacy, called the moments accountant, which provides a tight\nbound on the privacy cost of multiple VB iterations and thus significantly\ndecreases the amount of additive noise; and (2) the privacy amplification\neffect of subsampling mini-batches from large-scale data in stochastic\nlearning.

Most of these problems boil\ndown to the problem of minimizing an average of a finite set of smooth and\nstrongly convex functions where the number of functions $n$ is large. Gradient\ndescent method (GD) is successful in minimizing convex problems at a fast\nlinear rate; however, it is not applicable to the considered large-scale\noptimization setting because of the high computational complexity. Incremental\nmethods resolve this drawback of gradient methods by replacing the required\ngradient for the descent direction with an incremental gradient approximation.\nThey operate by evaluating one gradient per iteration and executing the average\nof the $n$ available gradients as a gradient approximate. Although, incremental\nmethods reduce the computational cost of GD, their convergence rates do not\njustify their advantage relative to GD in terms of the total number of gradient\nevaluations until convergence. In this paper, we introduce a Double Incremental\nAggregated Gradient method (DIAG) that computes the gradient of only one\nfunction at each iteration, which is chosen based on a cyclic scheme, and uses\nthe aggregated average gradient of all the functions to approximate the full\ngradient. The iterates of the proposed DIAG method uses averages of both\niterates and gradients in oppose to classic incremental methods that utilize\ngradient averages but do not utilize iterate averages. We prove that not only\nthe proposed DIAG method converges linearly to the optimal solution, but also\nits linear convergence factor justifies the advantage of incremental methods on\nGD. In particular, we prove that the worst case performance of DIAG is better\nthan the worst case performance of GD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 19:40:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2018 21:25:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-09"}

We find that there is a sharp transition into a state where the disks\nare only partially coupled to the substrate and form a phase separated cluster\nstate. This transition is associated with a drop in the net disk flux and can\noccur as a function of the substrate speed, maximum substrate force, disk run\ntime, and disk density. Since variation of the disk activity parameters\nproduces different disk drift rates for a fixed traveling wave speed on the\nsubstrate, the system we consider could be used as an efficient method for\nactive matter species separation. Within the cluster phase, we find that in\nsome regimes the motion of the cluster center of mass is in the opposite\ndirection to that of the traveling wave, while when the maximum substrate force\nis increased, the cluster drifts in the direction of the traveling wave.

The level of this discrepancy significantly exceeds the\nmaximum halo assembly bias signal predicted by LCDM. In this study, we explore\nwhether some of the clustering bias differences could be caused by biases in\n$R_{\\mathrm{mem}}$ due to projection effects from other systems along the\nline-of-sight. We thoroughly investigate the halo assembly bias of the\nphotometrically-detected redMaPPer clusters in SDSS, by defining a new variant\nof the average membership distance estimator $\\tilde{R}_{\\mathrm{mem}}$ that is\nmore robust against projection effects in the cluster membership\nidentification. Using the angular mark correlation functions of clusters, we\nshow that the large-scale bias differences when splitting by $R_{\\mathrm{mem}}$\ncan be largely attributed to such projection effects. After splitting by\n$\\tilde{R}_{\\mathrm{mem}}$, the anomalously large signal is reduced, giving a\nratio of $1.02\\pm0.14$ between the two clustering biases as measured from weak\nlensing. Using a realistic mock cluster catalog, we predict that the bias ratio\nbetween two $\\tilde{R}_{\\mathrm{mem}}$-split subsamples should be $<1.10$,\nwhich is at least 60% weaker than the maximum halo assembly bias signal (1.24)\nwhen split by halo concentration. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the\nlevel of halo assembly bias exhibited by redMaPPer clusters in SDSS is\nconsistent with the LCDM prediction.

We found that the existing research on collaboration networks is\ncorroborated by the particular collaboration network in the music industry.\nFurthermore, it has been found that the most important professions of the music\nindustry in terms of connectivity were main artists and engineers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 20:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

Hyperbolic routing (HR) presents a potential\nsolution to address the routing scalability problem, because it does not use\ntraditional forwarding tables or exchange routing updates upon changes in\nnetwork topologies. Although HR has the drawbacks of producing sub-optimal\nroutes or local minima for some destinations, these issues can be mitigated by\nNDN's intelligent data forwarding plane. However, HR's viability still depends\non both the quality of the routes HR provides and the overhead incurred at the\nforwarding plane due to HR's sub-optimal behavior. We designed a new forwarding\nstrategy called Adaptive Smoothed RTT-based Forwarding (ASF) to mitigate HR's\nsub-optimal path selection. This paper describes our experimental investigation\ninto the packet delivery delay and overhead under HR as compared with\nNamed-Data Link State Routing (NLSR), which calculates shortest paths. We run\nemulation experiments using various topologies with different failure\nscenarios, probing intervals, and maximum number of next hops for a name\nprefix.

The ions responsible for\nforming the observed X-ray absorption lines may only exist in relatively cold\nclumps that can be identified with the so-called 'warm absorbers'. Here we\ncalculate synthetic absorption lines for such warm absorbers from first\nprinciples by combining 2D hydrodynamic solutions of a two-phase medium with a\ndense grid of photoionization models to determine the detailed ionization\nstructure of the gas. Our calculations reveal that cloud disruption, which\nleads to a highly complicated velocity field (i.e. a clumpy flow), will only\nmildly affect line shapes and strengths when the cold gas becomes highly mixed\nbut not depleted. Prior to complete disruption, clouds which are optically thin\nto the driving UV resonance lines will cause absorption at an increasingly\nblueshifted line of sight velocity as they are accelerated. This behavior will\nimprint an identifiable signature on the line profile if warm absorbers are\nenshrouded in an even broader absorption line produced by a high column of\nintercloud gas. Interestingly, we show that it is possible to develop a\nspectral diagnostic for cloud acceleration by differencing the absorption\ncomponents of a doublet line, a result which can be qualitatively understood\nusing a simple partial covering model.

Various versions of the \"two-structure equation of state\" (TSEOS)\nbased on this concept have shown remarkable agreement with both experimental\ndata for metastable, deeply supercooled water and simulations of molecular\nwater models.

The method is based on the transformation of signals into the\nfrequency domain using the sine and cosine Fourier transforms in combination\nwith the discrete Fourier transform. The method is largely benefited from\nconsiderable differences that usually is available between the zero-frequency\ncomponents of sine and cosine and the norm of the amplitude of the DFT for\nneutrons and gamma-ray signals. Moreover, working in frequency domain naturally\nresults in considerable suppression of the unwanted effects of various noise\nsources that is expected to be effective in time domain methods.

For\nthis purpose, we employ a canonical ensemble of classical monoatomic ideal gas\ninside a box in a Rindler spacetime. The total energy decreases monotonically\nwith the increase of the external gravity representing its attractiveness. It\nis however bounded below, which is different from that of the Newtonian gravity\ncase. As for the entropy, it decreases with the external gravity in the\nNewtonian regime. However, in the presence of strong gravity or\nultra-relativistic high temperature, the entropy increases with the gravity.\nThis result can be a resolution of the negative entropy problem of the ideal\ngas in the Newtonian gravity. In the presence of strong gravity, the bottom of\nthe box is very close to the event horizon of the Rindler spacetime mimicking a\nblackhole and the gas behaves as if it is on an effective two dimensional\nsurface located at the bottom of the box. Investigating the equation of state\nin the strong gravity regime, the temperature of the system is found to be not\na free parameter but to approach a fixed value proportional to the external\ngravity, which is reminiscent of the Unruh temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2016 02:38:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2017 04:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

This also seems\nto work well in highly noisy text containing misspellings as shown in our\nexperiments which is demonstrated in morpheme-level feature maps learned by our\nmodel. Also, we hypothesize that encoding this linguistic prior in the\nSubword-LSTM architecture leads to the superior performance. Our system attains\naccuracy 4-5% greater than traditional approaches on our dataset, and also\noutperforms the available system for sentiment analysis in Hi-En code-mixed\ntext by 18%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2016 05:23:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

Multi-view clustering\nprovides a natural way to generate clusters from such data. Since different\nviews share some consistency and complementary information, previous works on\nmulti-view clustering mainly focus on how to combine various numbers of views\nto improve clustering performance. However, in reality, each view may be\nincomplete, i.e., instances missing in the view. Furthermore, the size of data\ncould be extremely huge. It is unrealistic to apply multi-view clustering in\nlarge real-world applications without considering the incompleteness of views\nand the memory requirement. None of previous works have addressed all these\nchallenges simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an online multi-view\nclustering algorithm, OMVC, which deals with large-scale incomplete views. We\nmodel the multi-view clustering problem as a joint weighted nonnegative matrix\nfactorization problem and process the multi-view data chunk by chunk to reduce\nthe memory requirement. OMVC learns the latent feature matrices for all the\nviews and pushes them towards a consensus. We further increase the robustness\nof the learned latent feature matrices in OMVC via lasso regularization. To\nminimize the influence of incompleteness, dynamic weight setting is introduced\nto give lower weights to the incoming missing instances in different views.\nMore importantly, to reduce the computational time, we incorporate a faster\nprojected gradient descent by utilizing the Hessian matrices in OMVC.

The\nmajority of these planets spend less than 50% of their time in a transiting\nconfiguration, some less than 20%. From this it is calculated that the known\nKepler eclipsing binaries likely host an additional ~ 17 - 30 circumbinary\nplanets that are similar to the ten published discoveries, and they will\nultimately transit some day, potentially during the TESS and PLATO surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2016 09:52:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

In our previous work, we proposed a new\nmechanism to explain the generation of traffic oscillations: traffic\ninstability caused by the competition between speed adaptation and the\ncumulative effect of stochastic factors. In this paper, by conducting a closer\nexamination of car following data obtained in a 25-car platoon experiment, we\ndiscovered that the speed difference plays a more important role on\ncar-following dynamics than the spacing, and when its amplitude is small, the\ngrowth of oscillations is mainly determined by the stochastic factors that\nfollow the mean reversion process; when its amplitude increases, the growth of\nthe oscillations is determined by the competition between the stochastic\nfactors and the speed difference. An explanation is then provided, based on the\nabove findings, to why the speed variance in the oscillatory traffic grows in a\nconcave way along the platoon. Finally, we proposed a mode-switching stochastic\ncar-following model that incorporates the speed adaptation and spacing\nindifference behaviors of drivers, which captures the observed characteristics\nof oscillation and discharge rate. Sensitivity analysis shows that reaction\ndelay only has slight effect but indifference region boundary has significant\non oscillation growth rate and discharge rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2016 09:55:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Dec 2018 05:33:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-01"}

The properties of\ndifferent types of kinematically misaligned galaxies are different in that the\nstar-forming ones have positive gradient in D4000 and higher gas-phase\nmetallicity, while the green valley/quiescent ones have negative D4000\ngradients and lower gas-phase metallicity on average. There is evidence that\nall types of the kinematically misaligned galaxies tend to live in more\nisolated environment. Based on all these observational results, we propose a\nscenario for the formation of star forming galaxies with kinematically\nmisaligned gas and stars - the progenitor accretes misaligned gas from a\ngas-rich dwarf or cosmic web, the cancellation of angular momentum from gas-gas\ncollisions between the pre-existing gas and the accreted gas largely\naccelerates gas inflow, leading to fast centrally-concentrated star-formation.\nThe higher metallicity is due to enrichment from this star formation. For the\nkinematically misaligned green valley and quiescent galaxies, they might be\nformed through gas-poor progenitors accreting kinematically misaligned gas from\nsatellites which are smaller in mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2016 10:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

Besides, the empirical estimates are easy to\ncompute in closed form just involving linear algebra operations. However, they\nare hampered by two important problems: the high computational cost involved,\nas two kernel matrices of the sample size have to be computed and stored, and\nthe interpretability of the measure, which remains hidden behind the implicit\nfeature map. We here address these two issues. We introduce the Sensitivity\nMaps (SMs) for the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). Sensitivity\nmaps allow us to explicitly analyze and visualize the relative relevance of\nboth examples and features on the dependence measure.

Network Slicing is one of the central\ntopics of the debate, and it is expected to become the key feature of next\ngeneration networks, providing the flexibility required to support the variety\nof 5G use cases and business. Network slices are seen as network operator\nbusiness, offering the possibility to provide flexible services and even\ninfrastructures to vertical industries and classical Telco customers alike.\nAnother key ingredient is the Architecture Modularisation concept, discussed in\nthis paper and regarded by the authors as the essential design principle to\nbuild a flexible network architecture natively supporting Network Slicing.\nAccording to this concept, conventional monolithic network functions, often\ncorresponding to physical network elements in the existing systems, are to\nsplit into basic building blocks defined with the proper granularity, allowing\nthe definition of different logical architectures (i.e. different Network\nSlices). In this paper, we further discuss a modularisation methodology as a\ncriteria to define the right set of basic building blocks.

Material processed by the CNO cycle in stellar interiors is enriched\nin 17O.

Such an occurrence explains the drop of the 16O/17O\nobserved in RGB stars with mass larger than 1.5 M_\\solar. As a consequence, the\ninterstellar medium is continuously polluted by the wind of evolved stars\nenriched in 17O . Aims.

Results. The post-first\ndredge up 16O/17O ratios are about 20% larger than previously obtained.\nNegligible variations are found in the case of the second and the third dredge\nup. In spite of the larger 17O(p,alpha)14N rate, we confirm previous claims\nthat an extra-mixing process on the red giant branch, commonly invoked to\nexplain the low carbon isotopic ratio observed in bright low-mass giant stars,\nmarginally affects the 16O/17O ratio.

The first\ncrossover time $t_s$, between the first and the second regime, depends on the\nparticle density. The other crossover time $t_l$, between the second and the\nthird regime, depends on the lattice length. We find analytic expressions for\nthese dependencies and show how the general behavior can be characterized by an\nuniversal form. We also show that the mean-square displacement of the center of\nmass presents two regimes; anomalous diffusion for times shorter than $t_l$,\nand normal diffusion for times longer than $t_l$.

At a surface of a topological insulator, Dirac point is\nprotected by the characteristic symmetry of the system. The breaking of the\nsymmetry opens a gap in the energy spectrum. Therefore, topological insulators\nare very sensitive to magnetic fields, which can open a gap in the electronic\nspectrum. Concerning \"internal\" magnetic effects, for example the situation\nwith doped magnetic impurities, is not trivial. A single magnetic impurity is\nnot enough to open the band gap, while in the case of a ferromagnetic chain of\ndeposited magnetic impurities the Dirac point is lifted. However, a much more\ninteresting case is when localized magnetic impurities form a chiral spin\norder. Our first principle density functional theory calculations have shown\nthat this is the case for Fe deposited on the surface of Bi2Se3 topological\ninsulator. But not only magnetic impurities can form a chiral helicoidal spin\ntexture. An alternative way is to use chiral multiferroics (prototype material\nis LiCu2O2) that induce a proximity effect. The theoretical approach we present\nhere is valid for both cases. We observed that opposite to a ferromagnetically\nordered case, a chiral spin order does not destroy the Dirac point. We also\nobserved that the energy gap appears at the edges of the new Brillouin zone.\nAnother interesting result concerns the spin dynamics. We derived an equation\nfor the spin density dynamics with a spin current and relaxation terms. We have\nshown that the motion of the conductance electron generates a magnetic torque\nand exerts a certain force on the helicoidal texture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2016 14:56:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

We specifically focus on\ndriving protocols with time-reversal invariant points, and demonstrate the\nexistence of an infinite number of distinct phases. These phases are separated\nby second-order quantum phase transitions, accompanied by continuous changes of\nlocal and string order parameters, as well as sudden changes of a topological\nwinding number and of the number of protected edge states. When one of these\nphase transitions is adiabatically crossed, the correlator associated to the\norder parameter is nonvanishing over a length scale which shows a Kibble-Zurek\nscaling. In some phases, the Floquet ground state spontaneously breaks the\ndiscrete time-translation symmetry of the Hamiltonian.
