In this letter, we show that the\nparadox arises from a misuse of the Archimedes principle in the relativistic\ncase. Considering first the special relativity, we show that any relativistic\nforce field can be written in the Lorentz form, so that it can always be\ndecomposed into a \\emph{static} (electric-like) and a \\emph{dynamic}\n(magnetic-like) part. These gravitomagnetic effects provide a relativistic\nformulation of Archimedes principle, from which the paradox is explained.\nBesides, if the curved spacetime on the vicinity of the Earth is taken into\naccount, we show that the gravitational force exerted by Earth on a moving body\nmust increase with the speed of the body. The submarine paradox is then\nanalyzed again with this speed-dependent gravitational force.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 18:17:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2016 23:07:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2017 18:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-30"}

To conformally coat many\ngrams of nanoparticles with ALD, long precursor soaking steps, fluidized beds,\nvibrating stages, or rotary feedthroughs are typically needed. While these\nimpressive advancements in ALD techniques dominate literature searches of\nparticle ALD coating, such methods may lead to a more time-intensive or\ncost-prohibitive process than what is required by many typical academic\nresearchers. Thus we have performed this study to explore the limits of static\nplanar ALD particle coating, the simplest method to coat nanoparticles with an\nALD film. Using an Arradiance GEMStar6 ALD system, we have explored a fast and\nsimple static ALD particle coating process. Our protocol produces relatively\nsmall, but still academically useful, quantities of uniformally ALD-coated\nnanospheres. This process can be scaled up to nanoparticle samples in the tens\nof milligram to gram range.

However, perfect alignment\nbetween transmitting and receiving antenna beams is rare in practice and\noverheard signals from concurrent transmissions may cause significant\ninterference. In this paper we analyze the impact of antenna beam misalignment\non the system performance of 60 GHz wireless access. We quantify the signal\npower loss caused by beam misalignment and the interference power accumulated\nfrom neighboring concurrent transmissions whose signals are leaked either via\nthe main-beam pointing in the similar direction or via side-lobe emission, and\nderive the probability distribution of the signal to interference plus noise\npower ratio (SINR). For scenarios where interfering transmitters are\ndistributed uniformly at random, we derive upper and lower bounds on the\ncumulative distribution function (abbreviated as CDF or c.d.f.) of SINR, which\ncan be easily applied to evaluate system performance. We validate our\nanalytical results by simulations where random nodes are uniformly distributed\nwithin a circular hall, and evaluate the sensitivity of average throughput and\noutage probability against two parameters: the half-power (3 dB) beamwidth to\nmain-lobe beamwidth ratio and the beam misalignment deviation to main-lobe\nbeamwidth ratio. Our results indicate that the derived lower bound performs\nwell when the half-power beamwidth to main-lobe beamwidth ratio or the number\nof concurrent transmission links is small. When the number of active links is\nhigh, it is desirable in antenna design to balance the degradation caused by\nbeam misalignment (wider beam is better) and the interference from concurrent\ntransmission (narrower beam is better).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 16:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-24"}

We extend Kenyon's result to a more general\nclass of discretizations.\n  Moreover, we introduce a new factorization of the coupling function of the\ndouble-dimer model into two discrete holomorphic functions, which are similar\nto discrete fermions defined in [Stas, Stas07].For Temperleyan discretizations\nwith appropriate boundary modifications, the results of Kenyon imply that the\nexpectation of the double-dimer height function converges to a harmonic\nfunction in the scaling limit. We use the above factorization to extend this\nresult to the class of all polygonal discretizations, that are not necessarily\nTemperleyan.

There are\ntwo fundamentally different concepts to generate valid global constraints from\ninfeasible subproblems. The first is to analyze the sequence of implications\nobtained by domain propagation that led to infeasibility. The result of the\nanalysis are one or more sets of contradicting variable bounds from which\nso-called conflict constraints can be generated. This concept has its origin in\nsolving satisfiability problems and is similarly used in constraint\nprogramming. The second is to analyze infeasible linear programming (LP)\nrelaxations. The dual LP solution provides a set of multipliers that can be\nused to generate a single new globally valid linear constraint.

Because\nof its physical importance many authors have calculated the r-mode frequency.\nFor the dominant mode, the associated gravitational wave frequency is 4/3 times\nthe angular velocity of the star $\\Omega$, subject to various corrections of\nwhich relativistic and rotational corrections are the most important. This has\nled several authors to investigate the dependence of the r-mode frequency on\nfactors such as the relativistic compactness parameter ($M/R$) and the angular\nvelocity of stars with different equations of state.

We evolve\nthe perturbation equations using the Cowling approximation by applying finite\ndifferencing methods to compute the r-mode frequency for a series of rotating\nneutron stars with polytropic equations of state. We find that rotational\neffects in the r-mode frequency can be larger than relativistic effects for\nrapidly spinning stars with low compactness, reducing the observed frequency.\nDifferential rotation also acts to decrease $\\sigma$, but its effect inscreases\nwith the compactness.

These crystals represent a broad, important class of quantum\nmaterials; their structural chirality has been found to allow for a wide range\nof phenomena in condensed matter physics, including skyrmions in chiral\nmagnets, unconventional pairing in chiral superconductors, nonlocal transport\nand unique magnetoelectric effects in chiral metals, as well as\nenantioselective photoresponse. Nevertheless, while these phenomena have been\nintensely investigated, the topological electronic properties of chiral\ncrystals have still remained largely uncharacterized. While recent theoretical\nadvances have shown that the presence of crystalline symmetries can protect\nnovel band crossings in 2D and 3D systems, we present a new class of Weyl\nfermions enforced by the absence of particular crystal symmetries. These\n\"Kramers-Weyl\" fermions are a universal topological electronic property of all\nnonmagnetic chiral crystals with spin-orbit coupling (SOC); they are guaranteed\nby lattice translation, structural chirality, and time-reversal symmetry, and\nunlike conventional Weyl fermions, appear at time-reversal-invariant momenta\n(TRIMs). We cement this finding by identifying representative chiral materials\nin the majority of the 65 chiral space groups in which Kramers-Weyl fermions\nare relevant to low-energy physics. By combining our analysis with the results\nof previous works, we determine that all point-like nodal degeneracies in\nnonmagnetic chiral crystals with relevant SOC carry nontrivial Chern numbers.\nWe further show that, beyond the previous phenomena allowed by structural\nchirality, Kramers-Weyl fermions enable unusual phenomena, such as a novel\nelectron spin texture, chiral bulk Fermi surfaces over large energy windows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 18:44:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 22:19:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2018 21:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-03"}

However, in many cases,\nthese surveys provide fluxes from fixed small apertures (e.g. fibre), which\ncover a scant fraction of the galaxy, compelling us to use aperture corrections\nto study the global properties of galaxies. In this work, we derive the current\ntotal star formation rate (SFR) of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) star-forming\ngalaxies, using an empirically based aperture correction of the measured $\\rm\nH\\alpha$ flux for the first time, thus minimising the uncertainties associated\nwith reduced apertures. All the $\\rm H\\alpha$ fluxes have been\nextinction-corrected using the $\\rm H\\alpha/H\\beta$ ratio free from aperture\neffects.

The schedule aims to minimize\ntotal travel distance and generation cost over both station assignments and\npower flow variables, subject to EV range constraints, grid operational\nconstraints and AC power flow equations. To deal with the nonconvexity of power\nflow equations and the binary nature of station assignments, we propose a\nsolution based on second-order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation of optimal\npower flow (OPF) and generalized Benders decomposition. When the SOCP\nrelaxation is exact, this approach computes a globally optimal solution. We\nevaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm through simulations. The\nalgorithm requires global information and is suitable for cases where the\ndistribution network, stations, and EVs are managed centrally by the same\noperator. In Part II of the paper, we develop distributed solutions for cases\nwhere they are operated by different organizations that do not share private\ninformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 19:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-24"}

The main idea of such primitives is to\nemploy instance-specific process-induced variations in electronic hardware as a\nsource of cryptographic data. Among the emergent technologies, memristive\ndevices provide unique opportunities for security applications due to the\nunderlying stochasticity in their operation. Herein, we report a prototype of a\nrobust, dense, and reconfigurable physical unclonable function primitives based\non the three-dimensional passive metal-oxide memristive crossbar circuits, by\nmaking positive use of process-induced variations in the devices' nonlinear\nI-Vs and their analog tuning. We first characterize security metrics for a\nbasic building block of the security primitives based on a two layer stack with\nmonolithically integrated 10x10 250-nm half-pitch memristive crossbar circuits.\nThe experimental results show that the average uniformity and diffusivity,\nmeasured on a random sample of 6,000 64-bit responses, out of ~697,000 total,\nis close to ideal 50% with 5% standard deviation for both metrics. The\nuniqueness, which was evaluated on a smaller sample by readjusting conductances\nof crosspoint devices within the same crossbar, is also close to the ideal 50%\n+/- 1%, while the smallest bit error rate, i.e. reciprocal of reliability,\nmeasured over 30-day window under +/-20% power supply variations, was ~ 1.5%\n+/- 1%. We then utilize multiple instances of the basic block to demonstrate\nphysically unclonable functional primitive with 10-bit hidden challenge\ngeneration that encodes more than 10^19 challenge response pairs and has\ncomparable uniformity, diffusiveness, and bit error rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 19:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-24"}

We allow for repulsive self-interaction.\nIn a Lambda-SFDM universe, SFDM starts relativistic, evolving from stiff (w=1)\nto radiation-like (w=1/3), becoming nonrelativistic (w=0) at late times. Thus,\na stiff-SFDM-dominated era precedes the familiar radiation-dominated era. SFDM\nparticle mass $m$ and quartic self-interaction strength \\lambda, are therefore\nconstrained by cosmological observables, N_{eff}, the effective number of\nneutrino species during BBN, and z_{eq}, the matter-radiation equality\nredshift. Since the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from\ninflation is amplified during the stiff-SFDM-dominated era, it can also\ncontribute a radiationlike component large enough to affect these observables.\nRemarkably, this amplification makes this SGWB detectable by current GW\nexperiments, e.g., aLIGO/Virgo and LISA, for Lambda-SFDM models satisfying\ncosmological constraints, for a range of reheat temperatures T_{re} and\ncurrently allowed values of tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$.

Traditionally, these maps\nhave been constructed by examining changes in the activity magnitude of regions\nrelated to task performance. Recently, network neuroscience has produced\nmethods to map connectivity patterns among many regions to certain cognitive\nfunctions by drawing on tools from network science and graph theory. However,\nthese two different views are rarely addressed simultaneously, largely because\nfew tools exist that account for patterns between nodes while simultaneously\nconsidering activation of nodes. We address this gap by solving the problem of\ncommunity detection on weighted networks with continuous (non-integer)\nannotations by deriving a generative probabilistic model. This model generates\ncommunities whose members connect densely to nodes within their own community,\nand whose members share similar annotation values. We demonstrate the utility\nof the model in the context of neuroimaging data gathered during a motor\nlearning paradigm, where edges are task-based functional connectivity and\nannotations to each node are beta weights from a general linear model that\nencoded a linear decrease in blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal with practice.\nInterestingly, we observe that individuals who learn at a faster rate exhibit\nthe greatest dissimilarity between functional connectivity and activation\nmagnitudes, suggesting that activation and functional connectivity are distinct\ndimensions of neurophysiology that track behavioral change. More generally, the\ntool that we develop offers an explicit, mathematically principled link between\nfunctional activation and functional connectivity, and can readily be applied\nto a other similar problems in which one set of imaging data offers network\ndata, and a second offers a regional attribute.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 20:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-24"}

Highly misaligned systems could be particularly conducive to these\nmesurements, which is why we reanalysed the HARPS transit spectra of WASP-8b\nusing the 'Rossiter-McLaughlin effect reloaded' (reloaded RM) technique. This\napproach allows us to isolate the local stellar CCF emitted by the\nplanet-occulted regions. As a result we identified a $\\sim$35% variation in the\nlocal CCF contrast along the transit chord, which might trace a deepening of\nthe stellar lines from the equator to the poles. Whatever its origin, such an\neffect cannot be detected when analyzing the RV centroids of the\ndisk-integrated CCFs through a traditional velocimetric analysis of the RM\neffect. Consequently it injected a significant bias into the results obtained\nby Queloz et al.

Measurements at higher accuracy\nduring ingress/egress will be required to confirm this result. In contrast to\nthe traditional analysis of the RM effect, the reloaded RM technique directly\nextracts the local stellar CCFs, allowing us to analyze their shape and to\nmeasure their RV centroids, unbiased by variations in their contrast or FWHM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 21:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

There have been several\nempirical studies on the effects of cloning, but there are contradictory\nresults regarding the connection of cloning and faults. Objective: Our aim is\nto clarify the relationship between code clones and faults. In particular, we\nfocus on inconsistent (or type-3) clones in this work. Method: We conducted a\ncase study with TWT GmbH where we detected the code clones in three Java\nsystems, set them into relation to information from issue tracking and version\ncontrol and interviewed three key developers. Results: Of the type-3 clones, 17\n% contain faults. Developers modified most of the type-3 clones simultaneously\nand thereby fixed half of the faults in type-3 clones consistently. Type-2\nclones with faults all evolved to fixed type-3 clones. Clone length is only\nweakly correlated with faultiness. Conclusion: There are indications that the\ndevelopers in two cases have been aware of clones. It might be a reason for the\nweak relationship between type-3 clones and faults. Hence, it seems important\nto keep developers aware of clones, potentially with new tool support. Future\nstudies need to investigate if the rate of faults in type-3 clones justifies\nusing them as cues in defect detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 21:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-28"}

The intermittent nature of production by renewable energy\nproducers implies that they rely on non-renewable producers so that the\naggregate power delivered meets the promised quality of service. This implicit\ninsurance provided by the non-renewable power sector to consumers is not\ncurrently priced and leads to an often ignored, hidden monetary transfer from\nnon-renewable producers to renewable producers. As the fraction of energy\nsupplied by renewable resources increases, these externalities also increase.\nIn this paper, we quantify these externalities by developing the market\nclearing price of energy in the presence of renewable energy. We consider a\nday-ahead electricity market where renewable and non-renewable generators bid\nby proposing their asking price per unit of energy to an independent system\noperator (ISO). The ISO's problem is a multi-stage stochastic optimization\nproblem to dispatch energy from each generator to minimize the cost of\npurchased energy on behalf of the consumers. We incorporate the notion of load\nvariance using the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVAR) measure in the day-ahead\nelectricity market to ensure that the generators are able to meet the load\nwithin a desired confidence level. We analytically derive the market clearing\nprice of energy as a function of CVAR. It is shown that a higher penetration\nlevel of the renewable energies may increase the market clearing price of\nenergy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 21:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-28"}

In this variant, the walks are built from the\ncircuit directions of the polyhedron, which are the minimal non-trivial\nsolutions to the system defining the polyhedron.\n  We are able to prove that circuit variants of the so-called non-revisiting\nconjecture and $d$-step conjecture both imply the circuit analogue of the\nHirsch conjecture. For the equivalences in [KW67], the wedge construction was a\nfundamental proof technique. We exhibit why it is not available in the circuit\nsetting, and what are the implications of losing it as a tool.\n  Further, we show the circuit analogue of the non-revisiting conjecture\nimplies a linear bound on the circuit diameter of all unbounded polyhedra - in\ncontrast to what is known for the combinatorial diameter. Finally, we give two\nproofs of a circuit version of the $4$-step conjecture. These results offer\nsome hope that the circuit version of the Hirsch conjecture may hold in\ngeneral.\n  A challenge in the circuit setting is that different realizations of\npolyhedra of the same combinatorial structure may have different diameters. We\nadapt the notion of simplicity to work with circuits in the form of C-simple\nand wedge-simple polyhedra. We show that it suffices to consider such\npolyhedra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 00:11:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Apr 2018 21:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-19"}

Models based on inverse Compton scattering off CMB\nphotons by relativistically beamed jets have recently been ruled out, since\nFermi LAT observations for 3C 273 and PKS 0637-752 give the upper limit far\nbelow the model prediction. Synchrotron emission from a separate electron\npopulation with multi-hundred TeV energies remains a possibility although its\norigin is not well known. We examine a photo-hadronic origin of such high\nenergy electrons/positrons, assuming that protons are accelerated up to\n$10^{19}$ eV and produce electrons/positrons through Bethe-Heitler process and\nphoto-pion production. These secondary electrons/positrons are injected at\nsufficiently high energies and produce X-rays and $\\gamma$-rays by synchrotron\nradiation without conflicting with the Fermi LAT upper limits. We find that the\nresultant spectrum well reproduces the X-ray observations from PKS 0637-752, if\nthe proton power is at least $10^{49} \\text{erg} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$, which is\nhighly super-Eddington. It is noted that the X-ray emission originates\nprimarily from leptons through Bethe-Heitler process, while leptons from\nphoto-pion origin lose energy directly through synchrotron emission of\nmulti-TeV photons rather than cascading. To avoid the overproduction of the\noptical flux, optical emission is primarily due to synchrotron emission of\nsecondary leptons rather than primary electrons, or a mild degree of beaming of\nthe jet is needed, if it is owing to the primary electrons. Proton synchrotron\nluminosity is a few orders of magnitude smaller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 01:24:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

During training, we feed LR facial images into the\nnetwork and optimize the parameters by minimizing two loss items, i.e. 1) face\nhallucination loss measured by the pixel wise difference between the ground\ntruth HR images and network-generated images; and 2) verification loss which is\nmeasured by the classification error and intra-class distance. We extensively\nevaluate our method on LFW and YTF datasets. The experimental results show that\nour method can achieve recognition accuracy 97.95% on 4x down-sampled LFW\ntesting set, outperforming the accuracy 96.35% of conventional face recognition\nmodel.

The magnetization increases with decreasing temperature\nin all the compounds, a paramagnetic behavior, unlike Li-deficient compounds\nwhich show a Pauli paramagnetic susceptibility. Also, the magnetization\nexhibits thermal irreversibility which vanishes at large magnetic fields in all\nthe compounds. The unsubstituted compound has discontinuities at 200 K and 50 K\ncorresponding to magnetic transitions which disappear on substitution with 2 %\nNi for Co. The effective magnetic moment is found to increase from 0.32 Bohr\nmagnetons to 0.66 Bohr magnetons on increasing the substitution to 0.15. The\nunique feature however is that all the compounds exhibit a clear magnetic\nhysteresis at room temperature with a finite coercivity. The coercivity\nincreases from 31 Oe to 168 Oe for x = 0.04 and then decreases on further\nincreasing of x. A deconvolution of the hysteresis loops clearly shows an\nincreasing paramagnetic component with substitution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 11:35:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-28"}

Indeed water molecules motion\nreflects the interactions with other molecules, membranes, cells, and in\ngeneral the interactions with the environment. Microstructural changes as e.g.\ncellular organization and/or integrity then affect the motion of water\nmolecules, and consequently alter the water diffusion properties measured by\nDWI. Then DWI technique can be used to extract information about tissue\norganization at the cellular level indirectly from water motion. In general the\nsignal intensity in DWI can be quantified by using a parameter known as ADC\n(Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) emphasizing that it is not the real diffusion\ncoefficient, which is a measure of the average water molecular motion. In the\nsimplest models, the distribu- tion of a water molecule diffusing in a certain\nperiod of time is considered to have a Gaussian form with its width\nproportional to the ADC. However, water in biological structures often displays\nnon-Gaussian diffusion behavior, consequently the DWI signal shows a more\ncomplex behavior that need to be modeled following different approaches.

Our study targets six SPEs\nfrom 2003 to 2012. By using measurements from the Medium Energy Proton and\nElectron Detector on all available Polar Orbit Environment Satellites (POES),\nwe show that in the main phase of geomagnetic storms the dayside cutoff\nlatitudes are pushed poleward, while the nightside cutoff latitudes have the\nopposite response, resulting in strong day-night asymmetries in the energy\ndeposition. These features cannot bemeasured by the frequently used\nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES).

Specifically, the low friction regime is linked to the\nformation of ultra-nanocrystalline surface films (10 to 20 nm), driving toward\nshear accommodation by grain boundary sliding.

This is a challenge because many formulations of rational agents create\nstrong incentives for self-preservation. This is not caused by a built-in\ninstinct, but because a rational agent will maximize expected utility and\ncannot achieve whatever objective it has been given if it is dead. Our goal is\nto study the incentives an agent has to allow itself to be switched off. We\nanalyze a simple game between a human H and a robot R, where H can press R's\noff switch but R can disable the off switch. A traditional agent takes its\nreward function for granted: we show that such agents have an incentive to\ndisable the off switch, except in the special case where H is perfectly\nrational. Our key insight is that for R to want to preserve its off switch, it\nneeds to be uncertain about the utility associated with the outcome, and to\ntreat H's actions as important observations about that utility. (R also has no\nincentive to switch itself off in this setting.)

The dictionary\nlearning problem is non-convex, and usually solved via computationally complex\niterative algorithms. Furthermore, the resulting transforms obtained generally\nlack structure that permits their fast application to data. To address this\nissue, this paper develops a framework for learning orthonormal dictionaries\nwhich are built from products of a few Householder reflectors. Two algorithms\nare proposed to learn the reflector coefficients: one that considers a\nsequential update of the reflectors and one with a simultaneous update of all\nreflectors that imposes an additional internal orthogonal constraint. The\nproposed methods have low computational complexity and are shown to converge to\nlocal minimum points which can be described in terms of the spectral properties\nof the matrices involved. The resulting dictionaries balance between the\ncomputational complexity and the quality of the sparse representations by\ncontrolling the number of Householder reflectors in their product. Simulations\nof the proposed algorithms are shown in the image processing setting where\nwell-known fast transforms are available for comparisons. The proposed\nalgorithms have favorable reconstruction error and the advantage of a fast\nimplementation relative to the classical, unstructured, dictionaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 15:53:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-30"}

Second, the series of streamflows shows an\nantipersistent behaviour.

The test case considered\nstarts with a steady (time independent) two-fluid flow in one dimension, where\nthe two fluid components represent gas and dust. It is then assumed that a\nshock wave travels through the gas at a constant speed and without radiative\nenergy losses and diffusion. Then, adopting a constant stopping time for the\ndust particles in the dust fluid (mono-dispersed grain sizes), the equation of\nmotion for the dust fluid can be transformed into a simple ordinary\ndifferential equation, which is satisfied by the Wright omega function.\nImplications for the formation of detached shells around carbon stars are\nbriefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 19:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-01"}

The\nposition of this actuator, however, can affect the mechanical advantage and\nvelocity ratio of the system. Hence, there needs to be a concrete way to\nanalytically compare different actuator positions. However, all current\nresearch into the analysis of scissor lifts either focusses only on the screw\njack configuration, or derives separate force expressions for different\nactuator positions. This, once again, leaves the decision between different\nactuator positions to trial and error, since the expression to test the potency\nof the position can only be derived once the position is chosen. This paper\nproposes a derivation for a general force expression, in terms of a few\ncarefully chosen position variables, which can be used to generate the force\nexpression for any actuator position. Hence, this expression illustrates\nexactly how each of the position variables (called a, b and i in this paper, as\ndefined later) affect the force output, and hence can be used to pick an\nappropriate actuator position, by choosing values for the position variables\nthat give the desired result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 14:59:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Dec 2016 18:33:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

The system can be built as a chain of local traps sliced into\ntwo parallel lattices by a repelling laser sheet. It is modelled by a pair of\ncoupled discrete Gross-Pitaevskii equations, with dipole-dipole self- and\ncross-interactions. When the dipoles are not polarized perpendicular or\nparallel to the lattice, the cross-interaction is asymmetric, replacing the\nfamiliar symmetric two-component discrete solitons by two new species of\ncross-symmetric ones, on-site- and off-site-centered, which are strongly\naffected by the orientation of the dipoles and separation between the parallel\nlattices. A very narrow region of intermediate asymmetric discrete solitons is\nfound at the boundary between the on- and off-site families. Two different\ntypes of solitons in the $\\mathcal{PT}$%-symmetric version of the system are\nconstructed too, and stability areas are identified for them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 07:36:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Mar 2017 14:42:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}
