However, in\ncontrast to 802.11, 1901 stations can change their state after sensing the\nmedium busy, which is regulated by the so-called deferral counter. This\nmechanism introduces strong coupling between the stations and, as a result,\nmakes existing analyses inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a performance\nmodel for 1901, which does not rely on the decoupling assumption. We prove that\nour model admits a unique solution for a wide range of configurations and\nconfirm the accuracy of the model using simulations. Our results show that we\noutperform current models based on the decoupling assumption. In addition to\nevaluating the performance in steady state, we further study the transient\ndynamics of 1901, which is also affected by the deferral counter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 16:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-01"}

These two rules governing investment ratios\nand price impact are combined and lead through updating at fixed time intervals\nto a deterministic price dynamic. For different choices of the model parameters\none gets qualitatively different dynamics. The result can be expressed as a\nphase diagram. Meta-CTA strategies can be devised to exploit the predictability\ninherent in the model dynamics by avoiding critical areas of the phase diagram\nor by taking a contrarian position at an opportune time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 17:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-01"}

We present here a\ncomprehensive review - written with a historical perspective - about total\ncross-sections from medium to the highest energies explored experimentally and\nstudied through a variety of methods and theoretical models for over sixty\nyears. We begin by recalling the analytic properties of the elastic amplitude\nand the theorems about the asymptotic behavior of the total cross-section. A\ndiscussion of how proton-proton cross-sections are extracted from cosmic rays\nat higher than accelerator energies and help the study of these asymptotic\nlimits, is presented. This is followed by a description of the advent of\nparticle colliders, through which high energies and unmatched experimental\nprecisions have been attained. Thus the measured hadronic elastic and total\ncross-sections have become crucial instruments to probe the so called soft part\nof QCD physics, where quarks and gluons are confined, and have led to test and\nrefine Regge behavior and a number of diffractive models. As the c.m. energy\nincreases, the total cross-section also probes the transition into hard\nscattering describable with perturbative QCD, the so-called mini-jet region.\nFurther tests are provided by cross-section measurements of gamma p, gamma*p\nand gamma* gamma* for models based on vector meson dominance, scaling limits of\nvirtual photons at high Q^2 and the BFKL formalism.

The intrinsic model dependence makes it necessary to formulate\nspecific means that include the physics in a properly quantitative way. The\ncore of this physics lies in the radiative transfer equation (RTE), where the\nproperties of the atmosphere are assumed to be known while the unknowns are the\nfour Stokes profiles. The solution of the (differential) RTE is known as the\ndirect or forward problem. From an observational point of view, the problem is\nrather the opposite: the data are made up of the observed Stokes profiles and\nthe unknowns are the solar physical quantities. Inverting the RTE is therefore\nmandatory. Indeed, the formal solution of this equation can be considered an\nintegral equation. The solution of such an integral equation is called the\ninverse problem. Inversion techniques are automated codes aimed at solving the\ninverse problem.\n  The foundations of inversion techniques are critically revisited with an\nemphasis on making explicit the many assumptions underlying each of them. An\nincremental complexity procedure is advised for the implementation in practice.\nCoarse details of the profiles or coarsely sam- pled profiles should be\nreproduced first with simple model atmospheres (with, for example, a few\nphysical quantities that are constant with optical depth). If the Stokes\nprofiles are well sampled and differences between synthetic and observed ones\nare greater than the noise, then the inversion should proceed by using more\ncomplex models (that is, models where physical quantities vary with depth or,\neventually, with more than one component). Significant im- provements are\nexpected as well from the use of new inversion techniques that take the spatial\ndegradation by the instruments into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 18:01:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

MUSIC is an implicit large eddy simulation code that uses implicit\ntime integration, implemented as a Jacobian-free Newton Krylov method. A\nphysics based preconditioning technique which can be adjusted to target varying\nphysics is used to improve the performance of the solver. The problems used for\nthis benchmark study include the Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities, and the decay of the Taylor-Green vortex.

A series of\nmulti-dimensional tests are performed and analysed. Each of these test cases is\nanalysed with a simple, scalar diagnostic, with the aim of enabling direct code\ncomparisons. As the tests performed do not have analytic solutions we verify\nMUSIC by comparing to established codes including ATHENA and the PENCIL code.\nMUSIC is able to both reproduce behaviour from established and widely-used\ncodes as well as results expected from theoretical predictions.

Using a nonstiff, pseudo-spectral boundary integral method, we\ninvestigate dynamical patterns induced by inhomogeneous bending for a two phase\nsystem. Numerical results reveal that there exist novel phase-treading and\ntumbling mechanisms that cannot be observed for a homogeneous vesicle. In\nparticular, unlike the well-known steady tank-treading dynamics characterized\nby a fixed inclination angle, here the phase-treading mechanism leads to\nunsteady periodic dynamics with an oscillatory inclination angle. When the\naverage phase concentration is around 1/2, we observe tumbling dynamics even\nfor very low shear rate, and the excess length required for tumbling is\nsignificantly smaller than the value for the single phase case. We summarize\nour results in phase diagrams in terms of the excess length, shear rate, and\nconcentration of the soft phase. These findings go beyond the well known\ndynamical regimes of a homogeneous vesicle and highlight the level of\ncomplexity of vesicle dynamics in a fluid due to heterogeneous material\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 19:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-01"}

We detect polarized scattered light up to ~0.42\"\n(~48 au) and detect a cavity, a rim with azimuthal brightness variations at an\ninclination of 38 degrees, two shadows and two symmetric spiral arms. The\nspiral arms originate near the location of the shadows, close to the semi major\naxis. We detect a faint spiral-like feature in the SW that can be interpreted\nas the scattering surface of the bottom side of the disk, if the disk is\ntidally truncated by the M-dwarf companion currently seen at a projected\ndistance of ~119 au. We construct a radiative transfer model that accounts for\nthe main characteristics of the features with an inner and outer disk\nmisaligned by ~72 degrees.

While\nspirals can be triggered by the tidal interaction with the companion, the close\nproximity of the spirals to the shadows suggests that the shadows could also\nplay a role. The change in stellar illumination along the rim, induces an\nazimuthal variation of the scale height that can contribute to the brightness\nvariations. Dark regions in polarized images of transition disks are now\ndetected in a handful of disks and often interpreted as shadows due to a\nmisaligned inner disk. The origin of such a misalignment in HD 100453, and of\nthe spirals, is unclear, and might be due to a yet-undetected massive companion\ninside the cavity, and on an inclined orbit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 19:46:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2016 16:33:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

We test\nthese three possibilities using a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation to\ngenerate luminosity functions for Milky Way halo-analogue satellite\npopulations, the results of which are then coupled to the Jiang & van den Bosch\nmodel of subhalo stripping to predict the subhalo $V_\\mathrm{max}$ functions\nfor the 10 brightest satellites.

The linear programming (LP) outer bound of the entropy space\nserves as the starting point of this approach; however, our effort goes\nsignificantly beyond using it to prove information inequalities. We first\nidentify and formalize the symmetry structure in the problem, which enables us\nto show the existence of optimal symmetric solutions. A symmetry-reduced linear\nprogram is then used to identify the boundary of the memory-transmission-rate\ntradeoff for several small cases, for which we obtain a set of tight outer\nbounds. General hypotheses on the optimal tradeoff region are formed from these\ncomputed data, which are then analytically proven. This leads to a complete\ncharacterization of the optimal tradeoff for systems with only two users, and\ncertain partial characterization for systems with only two files. Next, we show\nthat by carefully analyzing the joint entropy structure of the outer bounds for\ncertain cases, a novel code construction can be reverse-engineered, which\neventually leads to a general class of codes. Finally, we show that outer\nbounds can be computed through strategically relaxing the LP in different ways,\nwhich can be used to explore the problem computationally. This allows us\nfirstly to deduce generic characteristic of the converse proof, and secondly to\ncompute outer bounds for larger problem cases, despite the seemingly impossible\ncomputation scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 20:11:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 04:12:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 25 Aug 2018 19:40:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-28"}

Three bodies dominate the\nobservational record and modeling efforts for distantly active comets: the\nlong-period comet C/1995 O1 Hale-Bopp and the short-period comets (with Centaur\norbits) 29P/Schwassmann Wachmann 1 and 2060 Chiron. We summarize what is known\nabout these three objects emphasizing their gaseous comae. We calculate their\nCN/CO and CO2/CO production rate ratios from the literature and discuss\nimplications. Using our own data we derive CO production rates for all three\nobjects, in order to examine a correlation between gas production and different\norbital histories and/or size. We find that orbital history does not appear to\nplay a significant role in explaining 29P's CO production rates. 29P\noutproduces Hale-Bopp at the same heliocentric distance, even though it has\nbeen subjected to much more solar heating. Previous modeling work on such\nobjects predicts that 29P should have been de-volatilized over a fresher comet\nlike Hale-Bopp. This may point to 29P having a different orbital history than\ncurrent models predict, with its current orbit acquired more recently. On the\nother hand, Chiron's CO measurements are consistent with it being significantly\ndepleted over its original state, perhaps due to increased radiogenic heating\nmade possible by its much larger size or its higher processing due to orbital\nhistory. Observed spectral line profiles are consistent with development and\nsublimation of icy grains at about 5-6 AU for 29P and Hale-Bopp, and this is\nprobably a common feature in distantly active comets, and an important source\nof volatiles for all comets within 5 AU. In contrast, the narrow CO line\nprofiles indicate a nuclear, and not extended, origin for CO beyond ~4 AU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Oct 2016 21:23:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 20:40:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-23"}

The global\nnature of the collapse implies that the SFR increases over time. The\nhierarchical nature of the collapse consists of small-scale collapses within\nlarger-scale ones. The large-scale collapses culminate a few Myr later than the\nsmall-scale ones and consist of filamentary flows that accrete onto massive\ncentral clumps. The small-scale collapses form clumps that are embedded in the\nfilaments and falling onto the large-scale collapse centers. The stars formed\nin the early, small-scale collapses share the infall motion of their parent\nclumps. Thus, the filaments feed both gaseous and stellar material to the\nmassive central clump. This leads to the presence of a few older stars in a\nregion where new protostars are forming, and also to a self-similar structure,\nin which each unit is composed of smaller-scale sub-units that approach each\nother and may merge. Because the older stars formed in the filaments share the\ninfall motion of the gas onto the central clump, they tend to have larger\nvelocities and to be distributed over larger areas than the younger stars\nformed in the central clump. Finally, interpreting the IMF at face-value as a\nprobability distribution implies that massive stars only form once the {\\it\nlocal} SFR is large enough to sample the IMF up to high masses. In combination\nwith the increase of the SFR, this implies that massive stars tend to appear\nlate in the evolution of the MC, and only in the central massive clumps. We\ndiscuss the correspondence of these features with observed properties of young\nstellar clusters, finding very good qualitative agreement, thus providing\nsupport to the scenario of global, hierarchical collapse of MCs, while\nexplaining the origin of the observed cluster structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 00:26:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

When the subspace is known,\nthese signals can be modeled as bandlimited graph signals. Most existing\nsampling methods are designed to minimize the error incurred when\nreconstructing the original signal from its samples. Oftentimes these\nparsimonious signals serve as inputs to computationally-intensive linear\noperators. Hence, interest shifts from reconstructing the signal itself towards\napproximating the output of the prescribed linear operator efficiently. In this\ncontext, we propose a novel sampling scheme that leverages graph signal\nprocessing, exploiting the low-dimensional (bandlimited) structure of the input\nas well as the transformation whose output we wish to approximate. We formulate\nproblems to jointly optimize sample selection and a sketch of the target linear\ntransformation, so when the latter is applied to the sampled input signal the\nresult is close to the desired output. Similar sketching as sampling ideas are\nalso shown effective in the context of linear inverse problems. Because these\ndesigns are carried out off line, the resulting sampling plus\nreduced-complexity processing pipeline is particularly useful for data that are\nacquired or processed in a sequential fashion, where the linear operator has to\nbe applied fast and repeatedly to successive inputs or response signals.\nNumerical tests showing the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms include\nclassification of handwritten digits from as few as 20 out of 784 pixels in the\ninput images and selection of sensors from a network deployed to carry out a\ndistributed parameter estimation task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 03:57:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Sep 2018 23:54:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 17:08:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-26"}

In this paper, we\npropose a pricing framework for interference management from the D2D users to\nthe cellular system, where the base station (BS) protects itself (or its\nserving cellular users) by pricing the crosstier interference caused from the\nD2D users. A Stackelberg game is formulated to model the interactions between\nthe BS and D2D users. Specifically, the BS sets prices to a maximize its\nrevenue (or any desired utility) subject to an interference temperature\nconstraint. For given prices, the D2D users competitively adapt their power\nallocation strategies for individual utility maximization. We first analyze the\ncompetition among the D2D users by noncooperative game theory and an iterative\nbased distributed power allocation algorithm is proposed. Then, depending on\nhow much network information the BS knows, we develop two optimal algorithms,\none for uniform pricing with limited network information and the other for\ndifferentiated pricing with global network information. The uniform pricing\nalgorithm can be implemented by a fully distributed manner and requires minimum\ninformation exchange between the BS and D2D users, and the differentiated\npricing algorithm is partially distributed and requires no iteration between\nthe BS and D2D users. Then a suboptimal differentiated pricing scheme is\nproposed to reduce complexity and it can be implemented in a fully distributed\nfashion.

However, video-based SOD is much less explored since there\nlack large-scale video datasets within which salient objects are unambiguously\ndefined and annotated. Toward this end, this paper proposes a video-based SOD\ndataset that consists of 200 videos (64 minutes). In constructing the dataset,\nwe manually annotate all objects and regions over 7,650 uniformly sampled\nkeyframes and collect the eye-tracking data of 23 subjects that free-view all\nvideos. From the user data, we find salient objects in video can be defined as\nobjects that consistently pop-out throughout the video, and objects with such\nattributes can be unambiguously annotated by combining manually annotated\nobject/region masks with eye-tracking data of multiple subjects. To the best of\nour knowledge, it is currently the largest dataset for video-based salient\nobject detection.\n  Based on this dataset, this paper proposes an unsupervised baseline approach\nfor video-based SOD by using saliency-guided stacked autoencoders. In the\nproposed approach, multiple spatiotemporal saliency cues are first extracted at\npixel, superpixel and object levels. With these saliency cues, stacked\nautoencoders are unsupervisedly constructed which automatically infer a\nsaliency score for each pixel by progressively encoding the high-dimensional\nsaliency cues gathered from the pixel and its spatiotemporal neighbors.\nExperimental results show that the proposed unsupervised approach outperforms\n30 state-of-the-art models on the proposed dataset, including 19 image-based &\nclassic (unsupervised or non-deep learning), 6 image-based & deep learning, and\n5 video-based & unsupervised.

Owing to these variations, the\npedestrian data is distributed as highly-curved manifolds in the feature space,\ndespite the current convolutional neural networks (CNN)'s capability of feature\nextraction. However, the distribution is unknown, so it is difficult to use the\ngeodesic distance when comparing two samples. In practice, the current deep\nembedding methods use the Euclidean distance for the training and test. On the\nother hand, the manifold learning methods suggest to use the Euclidean distance\nin the local range, combining with the graphical relationship between samples,\nfor approximating the geodesic distance. From this point of view, selecting\nsuitable positive i.e. intra-class) training samples within a local range is\ncritical for training the CNN embedding, especially when the data has large\nintra-class variations. In this paper, we propose a novel moderate positive\nsample mining method to train robust CNN for person re-identification, dealing\nwith the problem of large variation. In addition, we improve the learning by a\nmetric weight constraint, so that the learned metric has a better\ngeneralization ability. Experiments show that these two strategies are\neffective in learning robust deep metrics for person re-identification, and\naccordingly our deep model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods on several benchmarks of person re-identification. Therefore, the study\npresented in this paper may be useful in inspiring new designs of deep models\nfor person re-identification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 06:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

In most\nrealistic Dirac semimetals, including suspended graphene, Coulomb interaction\nis too weak to open an excitonic gap. The Coulomb interaction plays a more\nimportant role at low energies in a two-dimensional semi-Dirac semimetal, in\nwhich the fermion spectrum is linear in one component of momenta and quadratic\nin the other, than a Dirac semimetal, and indeed leads to breakdown of Fermi\nliquid theory.

To understand the origin of this contrasting\nbehavior, in this work we model brushes made of these two types of linear chain\nmolecules using quantum mechanical numerical simulations under the Density\nFunctional Theory at the B97D/6-31G(d,p)level of theory. Four chains of\nerucamide and behenamide were linked to a 2X10 zigzag graphene sheet and\noptimized both in vacuum and in continuous solvent using the SMD implicit\nsolvation model. We find that erucamide chains tend to remain closer together\nthrough {\\pi}{\\pi} stacking interactions arising from the double bonds located\nat C13 C14, a feature behenamide lacks and thus a more spread configuration is\nobtained with the latter. It is argued that this arrangement of the erucamide\nchains is responsible for the lower friction coefficient of erucamide brushes,\ncompared with behenamide brushes, which is a macroscopic consequence of\ncooperative quantum mechanical interactions. While only quantum level\ninteractions are modeled here, we show that behenamide chains are more spread\nout in the brush than erucamide chains as a consequence of those interactions.\nThe spread out configuration allows more solvent particles to penetrate the\nbrush, leading in turn to more friction, in agreement with macroscopic\nmeasurements and mesoscale simulations of the friction coefficient reported in\nthe literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 08:39:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

Therefore, in such environments,\nhierarchical growth should be seen as the norm. Consequently, we predict that\nthe aggregates in such environments are not fractals with extremely low\ndensities as they would result from extrapolation fractal laws to large sizes.\nThe compactification of aggregates does not only result from collisions with\nenough energy to restructure aggregates - it starts already earlier by filling\nvoids in particles with smaller grains that contribute to the growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 09:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

Each user is equipped with one transmit\nantenna with multiple radio frequency (RF) mirrors (parasitic elements) placed\nnear it. The base station (BS) is equipped with tens to hundreds of receive\nantennas. MBM with $m_{rf}$ RF mirrors and $n_r$ receive antennas over a\nmultipath channel has been shown to asymptotically (as $m_{rf}\\rightarrow\n\\infty$) achieve the capacity of $n_r$ parallel AWGN channels. This suggests\nthat MBM can be attractive for use in massive MIMO systems which typically\nemploy a large number of receive antennas at the BS. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the potential performance advantage of multiuser MBM (MU-MBM) in a\nmassive MIMO setting. Our results show that multiuser MBM (MU-MBM) can\nsignificantly outperform other modulation schemes. For example, a bit error\nperformance achieved using 500 receive antennas at the BS in a massive MIMO\nsystem using conventional modulation can be achieved using just 128 antennas\nusing MU-MBM. Even multiuser spatial modulation, and generalized spatial\nmodulation in the same massive MIMO settings require more than 200 antennas to\nachieve the same bit error performance. Also, recognizing that the MU-MBM\nsignal vectors are inherently sparse, we propose an efficient MU-MBM signal\ndetection scheme that uses compressive sensing based reconstruction algorithms\nlike orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), compressive sampling matching pursuit\n(CoSaMP), and subspace pursuit (SP).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 09:38:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

In the limit\nof a small introduction rate of new species, the model exhibits a discontinuous\ntransition from a high-diversity state to a low-diversity state as the\ninteraction probability between species, $\\gamma$, is increased from zero. Here\nwe explore the effects of finite introduction rates and system-size on the\nphase transition by utilizing efficient parallel computing. We find that the\nlow state appears for $\\gamma>\\gamma_c$. As $\\gamma$ is increased further, the\nhigh state approaches to the low state, suggesting the possibility that the two\nstates merge at a high $\\gamma$. We find that the fraction of time spent in the\nhigh state becomes longer with higher introduction rates, but the availability\nof the two states is rather insensitive to the value of the introduction rate.\nFurthermore we establish a relation between the introduction rate and the\nsystem size, which preserves the probability for the system to remain in the\nhigh-diversity state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 09:55:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 18:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-22"}

When such issues emerge on social media, we\noften observe the creation of 'echo chambers', i.e., situations where\nlike-minded people reinforce each other's opinion, but do not get exposed to\nthe views of the opposing side. In this paper we study algorithmic techniques\nfor bridging these chambers, and thus, reducing controversy. Specifically, we\nrepresent the discussion on a controversial issue with an endorsement graph,\nand cast our problem as an edge-recommendation problem on this graph. The goal\nof the recommendation is to reduce the controversy score of the graph, which is\nmeasured by a recently-developed metric based on random walks. At the same\ntime, we take into account the acceptance probability of the recommended edge,\nwhich represents how likely the edge is to materialize in the endorsement\ngraph. We propose a simple model based on a recently-developed user-level\ncontroversy score, that is competitive with state-of- the-art link-prediction\nalgorithms. We thus aim at finding the edges that produce the largest reduction\nin the controversy score, in expectation. To solve this problem, we propose an\nefficient algorithm, which considers only a fraction of all the combinations of\npossible edges. Experimental results show that our algorithm is more efficient\nthan a simple greedy heuristic, while producing comparable score reduction.\nFinally, a comparison with other state-of-the-art edge-addition algorithms\nshows that this problem is fundamentally different from what has been studied\nin the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 09:57:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 14:53:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 May 2018 16:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-25"}

However, human labeling is very costly. To tackle this training data\nbottleneck, we develop a dual-learning mechanism, which can enable an NMT\nsystem to automatically learn from unlabeled data through a dual-learning game.\nThis mechanism is inspired by the following observation: any machine\ntranslation task has a dual task, e.g., English-to-French translation (primal)\nversus French-to-English translation (dual); the primal and dual tasks can form\na closed loop, and generate informative feedback signals to train the\ntranslation models, even if without the involvement of a human labeler. In the\ndual-learning mechanism, we use one agent to represent the model for the primal\ntask and the other agent to represent the model for the dual task, then ask\nthem to teach each other through a reinforcement learning process. Based on the\nfeedback signals generated during this process (e.g., the language-model\nlikelihood of the output of a model, and the reconstruction error of the\noriginal sentence after the primal and dual translations), we can iteratively\nupdate the two models until convergence (e.g., using the policy gradient\nmethods). We call the corresponding approach to neural machine translation\n\\emph{dual-NMT}. Experiments show that dual-NMT works very well on\nEnglish$\\leftrightarrow$French translation; especially, by learning from\nmonolingual data (with 10% bilingual data for warm start), it achieves a\ncomparable accuracy to NMT trained from the full bilingual data for the\nFrench-to-English translation task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 10:38:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-02"}

This paper proposes a novel distributed\nvector representation of a document: a simple recurrent-neural-network language\nmodel (RNN-LM) or a long short-term memory RNN language model (LSTM-LM) is\nfirst created from all documents in a task; some of the LM parameters are then\nadapted by each document, and the adapted parameters are vectorized to\nrepresent the document.

The\nthree considered methods exploit different properties of the scattering matrix\n$S(\\mathscr{E};E)$ as a function of energy $E$: its poles, real values, and\nzeros of the second derivative of its phase. The essential feature of the\nmethod of zeroing the resolvent, which produces complex energies, is the\nunlimited growth of the wave function at infinity, which is, however,\neliminated by the time-dependent interpretation. The real energies at which the\nunitary scattering matrix becomes real correspond to the largest possible\ndistortion, $S=+1$, or its absence at $S=-1$ which in either case leads to the\nformation of quasibound states. Depending on their response to increasing\nelectric intensity, two types of field-induced positive energy quasibound\nlevels are identified: electron- and hole-like states. Their evolution and\ninteraction in enlarging field lead ultimately to the coalescence of pairs of\nopposite states, with concomitant divergence of the associated dipole moments\nin what is construed as an electric breakdown of the structure.

In the case of non-Killing horizons different definitions\nof surface gravity are truly different quantities. This also has application to\nmodified theories of gravity, where there is no reason to expect all horizons\nto be Killing horizons. In Lorentz violating theories, the situation becomes\neven stranger, as Killing horizons are at best low energy barriers, but for\nsuperluminal dispersion relations a true causal barrier, the universal horizon,\nmay be present. We investigate the nature of these universal horizons via a ray\ntracing study, and delve into what happens near both the universal and Killing\nhorizons. From this study we determine the surface gravity of universal\nhorizons by the peeling properties of rays near the horizon and discuss\nwhether, and at what temperature these horizons radiate.

The robot's task is to detect the right\naffordance (\"pass-through-able\" or \"non-pass-through-able\"). The required\ninternal models are acquired in a hierarchical training process. Afterwards,\nthe robotic agent is able to distinguish reliably between corridors and dead\nends. This real-world result enhances the validity of the proposed mental\nsimulation approach.

Hence, we generalize\nFixman's boundary conditions, originally derived for spherical particles, to\nthe case of the charged oblate spheroid. Given two different counter-ion\ndistributions in the thin electric double layer limit, we obtain analytic\nexpressions for the polarization coefficients to the first non-trivial order in\nfrequency. We find that the polarization response normal to the symmetry axis\ndepends on the total amount of charge carried by the oblate spheroid while that\nparallel to the symmetry axis is suppressed when there is less charge on the\nedge of the spheroid.

In addition, spheroids with\nhigher aspect ratios will also lead to a stronger dielectric enhancement due to\nthe combination of the electric double layer and textural effects.

They are knocked off of the surface\nsoil, rise above the surface, and then fall back. Therefore, on average, on any\nunit of surface area there is a positive charge, equal in magnitude to the\ncharge of photoelectrons flying over this area. However, the charge of any\nsmall dust particle can strongly fluctuate discretely: a photoelectron can be\neither knocked off of the or be reacquired by the particle. The result is a\n\"random walk\" in sign and magnitude of the charge of grains. In a few minutes\nafter sunrise, almost every dust particle on the surface has at least one extra\nor missing electron, and the average modulus of the charge accumulated on a\nparticle is proportional to the square root of the number of \"steps\" (knocking\noff /returns of photoelectrons). Therefore, the average value of the modulus of\nthe charge of a fine dust particle exceeds by several orders of magnitude the\nproportion of the average surface charge attributable to the particle. So dust\nparticles that have ejected a sufficient number of photoelectrons can take off\nfrom the surface because of the electric field of the near surface charge\ndouble layer. It is shown that: (i) almost half of all dust particles on the\nilluminated lunar surface are missing at least one electron; (ii) a significant\nportion of particles up to 100 nm in size emits several photoelectrons and\nacquire a positive charge, sufficient to take off from the surface; (iii) above\nthe surface there is a \"boiling layer\" of dust with a maximum thickness of\nseveral hundred meters where the average size of the particles and their\ndensity non-monotonically depend on the altitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 13:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-04"}

However, the performance is still limited due\nto the extreme sparsity of the rating data. With the popularity of Web 2.0, the\nsocial tagging system provides more external information to improve\nrecommendation accuracy. Although some existing approaches combine the matrix\nfactorization models with co-occurrence properties and context of tags, they\nneglect the issue of tag sparsity without the commonly associated tags problem\nthat would also result in inaccurate recommendations. Consequently, in this\npaper, we propose a novel hybrid collaborative filtering model named\nWUDiff_RMF, which improves Regularized Matrix Factorization (RMF) model by\nintegrating Weighted User-Diffusion-based CF algorithm(WUDiff) that obtains the\ninformation of similar users from the weighted tripartite user-item-tag graph.\nThis model aims to capture the degree correlation of the user-item-tag\ntripartite network to enhance the performance of recommendation. Experiments\nconducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly performs better than already widely used methods in the accuracy\nof recommendation. Moreover, results show that WUDiff_RMF can alleviate the\ndata sparsity, especially in the circumstance that users have made few ratings\nand few tags.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Nov 2016 02:59:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-24"}
