In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the\nidea that bed load transport is significant for proppant transport during\nhydraulic fracturing. However, scaling arguments suggest that bed load\ntransport is only dominant in the laboratory and is negligible at the field\nscale. I review laboratory experiments that have been used to develop concepts\nof bed load transport in hydraulic fracturing. I also review the scaling\narguments and laboratory results that have been used to argue that viscous\ndrag, not bed load transport, is dominant at the field scale. I compare\nliterature correlations for fluvial sediment transport and for pipeline slurry\ntransport with published laboratory data on proppant transport in slot flow.\nThe comparisons indicate that fluvial transport correlations are suitable for\npredicting the rate of sediment erosion due to flow of proppant-free fluid over\na bed. The pipeline slurry correlations are suitable for predicting the ability\nof proppant that is already in suspension to flow in bed transport without\nsettling, but only if the aspect ratio of the flowing region in the slot is\nclose to unity. This can occur at the laboratory scale, but not in the field.\nThe comparison indicates that at low rates of proppant flow, the equilibrium\nbed height in a laboratory proppant transport experiment can be predicted from\npipeline slurry correlations. However, as the volumetric flow rate and the\naspect ratio of the flowing region in the slot increase, the applicability of\nthe pipeline slurry correlations breaks down. Laboratory experiments using\nhigher volumetric flow rate indicate that bed load transport rates are too low\nto be significant at the field scale, even if the flow velocity is very high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2016 17:11:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

However, most earlier models use\nlocalist representations (codes) in each representational field, which we\nequate with the cortical macrocolumn (mac), at each level. In localism, each\nrepresented feature/event (item) is coded by a single unit. Our model, Sparsey,\nis also hierarchical but crucially, uses sparse distributed coding (SDC) in\nevery mac in all levels. In SDC, each represented item is coded by a small\nsubset of the mac's units. SDCs of different items can overlap and the size of\noverlap between items can represent their similarity. The difference between\nlocalism and SDC is crucial because SDC allows the two essential operations of\nassociative memory, storing a new item and retrieving the best-matching stored\nitem, to be done in fixed time for the life of the model. Since the model's\ncore algorithm, which does both storage and retrieval (inference), makes a\nsingle pass over all macs on each time step, the overall model's\nstorage/retrieval operation is also fixed-time, a criterion we consider\nessential for scalability to huge datasets.

The edge-based and message\npassing models are conjectured to also be equivalent for arbitrary transmission\nprocesses; we show the first step of a full proof of this.

The observations cover almost 1 square degree at 26\" resolution\nwith a bandwidth of 32 GHz from 84 to 116 GHz in only two tunings. Among the\nmapped spectral lines are the 12CO, 13CO, C18O, C17O, HCN, HNC, 12CN, CCH,\nHCO+, N2H+ (1-0), and 12CS, 32SO, SiO, c-C3H2, CH3OH (2-1) transitions.

We also obtain a\ndust-traced gas mass that is less than about one third the CO-traced mass,\nusing the standard Xco conversion factor. The presence of overluminous CO can\nbe traced back to the dependence of the CO intensity on UV illumination. In\nfact, while most lines show some dependence on the UV radiation field, CN and\nCCH are the most sensitive. Moreover dense cloud cores are almost exclusively\ntraced by N2H+.

Our initial findings demonstrate that the relations between line\n(ratio) intensities and environment in GMCs are more complicated than often\nassumed. Sensitivity (i.e., the molecular column density), excitation, and\nabove all chemistry contribute to the observed line intensity distributions.\nThey must be considered together when developing the next generation of\nextra-galactic molecular line diagnostics of mass, density, temperature and\nradiation field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2016 20:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

There have been emerging mobile health (mHealth) tools that can\nclosely monitor the patients and generate continuous measurements of many\nwound-related variables and other evolving clinical variables. Since existing\nprediction models of SSI have quite limited capacity to utilize the evolving\nclinical data, we develop the corresponding solution to equip these mHealth\ntools with decision-making capabilities for SSI prediction with a seamless\nassembly of several machine learning models to tackle the analytic challenges\narising from the spatial-temporal data. The basic idea is to exploit the\nlow-rank property of the spatial-temporal data via the bilinear formulation,\nand further enhance it with automatic missing data imputation by the matrix\ncompletion technique.

Although it is known that the network\nof physical contacts, for example, is distinct from the network arising from\ncommunication events via phone calls and instant messages, the extent to which\nthese networks differ is not clear. In fact, the network structure of these\nchannels shows large structural variations. Each network of interactions,\nhowever, contains both central and peripheral individuals: central members are\ncharacterized by higher connectivity and can reach a high fraction of the\nnetwork within a low number of connections, contrary to the nodes on the\nperiphery. Here we show that the various channels account for diverse\nrelationships between pairs of individuals and the corresponding interaction\npatterns across channels differ to an extent that hinders the simple reduction\nof social ties to a single layer. Furthemore, the origin and purpose of each\nnetwork also determine the role of their respective central members: highly\nconnected individuals in the person-to-person networks interact with their\nenvironment in a regular manner, while members central in the social\ncommunication networks display irregular behavior with respect to their\nphysical contacts and are more active through rare, social events.

Compressed sensing exploits the sparsity of images in a\ntransform domain or dictionary to improve image recovery from undersampled\nmeasurements. In the context of inverse problems in dynamic imaging, recent\nresearch has demonstrated the promise of sparsity and low-rank techniques. For\nexample, the patches of the underlying data are modeled as sparse in an\nadaptive dictionary domain, and the resulting image and dictionary estimation\nfrom undersampled measurements is called dictionary-blind compressed sensing,\nor the dynamic image sequence is modeled as a sum of low-rank and sparse (in\nsome transform domain) components (L+S model) that are estimated from limited\nmeasurements. In this work, we investigate a data-adaptive extension of the L+S\nmodel, dubbed LASSI, where the temporal image sequence is decomposed into a\nlow-rank component and a component whose spatiotemporal (3D) patches are sparse\nin some adaptive dictionary domain. We investigate various formulations and\nefficient methods for jointly estimating the underlying dynamic signal\ncomponents and the spatiotemporal dictionary from limited measurements. We also\nobtain efficient sparsity penalized dictionary-blind compressed sensing methods\nas special cases of our LASSI approaches. Our numerical experiments demonstrate\nthe promising performance of LASSI schemes for dynamic magnetic resonance image\nreconstruction from limited k-t space data compared to recent methods such as\nk-t SLR and L+S, and compared to the proposed dictionary-blind compressed\nsensing method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2016 02:21:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2017 10:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-06-14"}

It is conjectured that there is a fully\npolynomial-time (randomized) approximation scheme (FPTAS/FPRAS) for counting\nthe number of proper colorings as long as $q \\geq \\Delta + 1$, where $q$ is the\nnumber of colors and $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. The bound of\n$q = \\Delta + 1$ is the uniqueness threshold for Gibbs measure on\n$\\Delta$-regular infinite trees. However, the conjecture remained open even for\nany fixed $\\Delta\\geq 3$ (The cases of $\\Delta=1, 2$ are trivial). In this\npaper, we design an FPTAS for counting the number of proper $4$-colorings on\ngraphs with maximum degree $3$ and thus confirm the conjecture in the case of\n$\\Delta=3$.

The optical wideband regime may exceed\nanalog to digital converters (ADCs) front-end bandwidth. Multi-channel sampling\napproaches, such as multicoset or interleaved ADCs, have been proposed to\nsample the wideband signal using several channels. Each channel samples below\nthe Nyquist rate such that the overall sampling rate is preserved. However,\nthis scheme suffers from two practical limitations that make its implementation\ndifficult. First, the inherent anti-aliasing filter of the samplers distorts\nthe wideband signal. Second, it requires accurate time shifts on the order of\nthe signal's Nyquist rate, which are challenging to maintain. In this work, we\npropose an alternative multi-channel sampling scheme, the wideband demodulator\nfor optical waveforms (WINDOW), based on analog RF demodulation, where each\nchannel aliases the spectrum using a periodic mixing function before\nintegration and sampling. We show that intentionally using the inherent ADC\nfilter to perform integration increases the signal to noise ratio (SNR).

In particular, we apply this result to the $q$-deformations of\ncompact connected semisimple Lie groups and to the reduced group C*-algebras of\nfree groups on $n>1$ generators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2016 13:10:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 Dec 2017 15:43:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-03"}

The large databases of structures and properties that result from\ncomputational searches, as well as the agglomeration of data of heterogeneous\nprovenance leads to considerable challenges when it comes to navigating the\ndatabase, representing its structure at a glance, understanding\nstructure-property relations, eliminating duplicates and identifying\ninconsistencies. Here we present a case study, based on a data set of\nconformers of amino acids and dipeptides, of how machine-learning techniques\ncan help addressing these issues. We will exploit a recently developed strategy\nto define a metric between structures, and use it as the basis of both\nclustering and dimensionality reduction techniques showing how these can help\nreveal structure-property relations, identify outliers and inconsistent\nstructures, and rationalise how perturbations (e.g. binding of ions to the\nmolecule) affect the stability of different conformers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2016 10:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-22"}

The micro actuator is composed of a micro\nmirror and two torsional beams, which are excited with two electrodes. Unlike\nthe traditional micro actuators, the electrostatic force exerted to both side\nof micro mirror, so the model is exposed to a DC voltage applied from the\nground electrodes. The static governing equation of the torsional micro\nactuator is derived and the relation between rotation angle and the driving\nvoltage is determined. Local and global bifurcation analysis is performed,\nconsidering torsional characteristics of the micro-beams. By solving static\ndeflection equation, the fixed points of the actuator are obtained. Critical\nvalues of the applied voltage leading to qualitative changes in the micro\nactuator behavior through a saddle node or pitchfork bifurcations for different\nspatial condition are obtained. Furthermore the effects of different gap and\nelectrode sizes as well as beam lengths on the dynamic behavior are\ninvestigated. It is shown that increasing the applied voltage leads the\nstructure to an unstable condition by undergoing to saddle node and pitchfork\nbifurcations when the voltages ratio is zero and one, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2016 18:45:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 May 2018 20:20:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-03"}

In\nthe FOM system, an array of transmitters (TXs) is deployed and only one TX is\nactivated for data transmission at any signaling time instance. The TX index\ndistinguished by a very slight frequency offset among the entire occupied\nbandwidth is exploited to implicitly convey a bit unit without any power or\nsignal radiation, saving the power and spectral resources. Moreover, the FOM is\ncharacterized by removing the stringent requirements on distinguishable spatial\nchannels and perfect priori channel knowledge, while retaining the advantages\nof no inter-channel interference and no need of inter-antenna synchronization.\nIn addition, a hybrid solution integrating the FOM and the spatial modulation\nis discussed to further improve the energy efficiency and spectral efficiency.\nConsequently, the FOM will be an enabling and green solution to support\never-increasing high-capacity data traffic in a variety of interdisciplinary\nfields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2016 06:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-22"}
