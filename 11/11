At these scales, a few percent of the energy is also in compressive\nfluctuations, and their nature, anisotropy, and relation to the Alfvenic\ncomponent is described. In the small scale kinetic range, below the ion\ngyroscale, the turbulence becomes predominantly kinetic Alfven in nature, and\nmeasurements of the spectra, anisotropy, and intermittency of this turbulence\nare discussed with respect to recent cascade models.

DSA provides a nonlinear dynamical basis for spatiotemporal\ndatasets or dynamical models, eliminating redundancies and expressing the\nsystem in terms of the smallest number of fundamental processes and\ninteractions without loss of information. This optimises model design in\ndynamical systems, expressing complex coevolution in simple synergistic terms,\nyielding physically meaningful spatial and temporal structures. These are\nextracted by spatiotemporal decomposition of nonlinearly interacting subspaces\nvia the novel concept of a Spatiotemporal Coevolution Manifold. Physical\nconsistency is ensured and mathematical ambiguities are avoided with\nfundamental principles on energy minimisation and entropy production. The\nrelevance of DSA is illustrated by retrieving a non-redundant, synergistic set\nof nonlinear geophysical processes exerting control over precipitation in space\nand time over the Euro-Atlantic region. For that purpose, a nonlinear\nspatiotemporal basis is extracted from geopotential data fields, yielding two\nindependent dynamic sources dominated respectively by meridional and zonal\ncirculation gradients. These sources are decomposed into spatial and temporal\nstructures corresponding to multiscale climate dynamics. The added value of\nnonlinear predictability is brought out in the geospatial evaluation and\ndynamic simulation of evolving precipitation distributions from the geophysical\ncontrols, using DSA-driven model building and implementation. The simulated\nprecipitation is found to be in agreement with observational data, which they\nnot only describe but also dynamically link and attribute in synergistic terms\nof the retrieved dynamic sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 17:13:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-11"}

The calculations are done\nusing the D1S Gogny force. Various ground-state properties are analyzed.

The\ndescription of the first excited state is also examined and the corresponding\ntransition densities are used as input for the calculation of inelastic\nelectron and proton scattering. Special attention is paid to the effect of the\noptimization of the single-particle states consistently with the correlations\nof the system. Globally, the results are satisfying and encouraging.

Thus, BMP stars\nare ideal field blue straggler candidates for investigating internal stellar\nevolution processes and binary interaction. In particular, the presence or\ndepletion in lithium in their spectra is a powerful indicator as to their\norigin. They are either old, halo blue stragglers experiencing internal mixing\nprocesses or mass transfer (Li-depletion), or intermediate-age, single stars of\npossibly extragalactic origin (2.2dex halo plateau Li). However, we note that\ninternal mixing processes can lead to an increased level of Li. Hence, this\nstudy combines photometry and spectroscopy to unveil the origin of various BMP\nstars. We first show how to separate binaries from young blue stars using\nphotometry, metallicity, and lithium.

We test the technique developed by Cooper et al. (which we call\nSTINGS here) by comparing particle tags with stars in a smooth particle\nhydrodynamic (SPH) simulation. We focus on the spherically averaged density\nprofile of stars accreted from satellite galaxies in a Milky Way (MW)-like\nsystem. The stellar profile in the SPH simulation can be recovered accurately\nby tagging dark matter (DM) particles in the same simulation according to a\nprescription based on the rank order of particle binding energy. Applying the\nsame prescription to an N-body version of this simulation produces a density\nprofile differing from that of the SPH simulation by <10 per cent on average\nbetween 1 and 200 kpc. This confirms that particle tagging can provide a\nfaithful and robust approximation to a self-consistent hydrodynamical\nsimulation in this regime (in contradiction to previous claims in the\nliterature). We find only one systematic effect, likely due to the\ncollisionless approximation, namely that massive satellites in the SPH\nsimulation are disrupted somewhat earlier than their collisionless\ncounterparts.

In this\nwork, we employ the DFT+U formalism to address the effects of local\ncorrelations due to transition metal d electrons on compositional phase\nstability in the prototype phase stable and separating materials LixCoO2 and\nolivine LixFePO4, respectively. We exploit a new spectral decomposition of the\nDFT+U total energy, revealing the distinct roles of the filling and ordering of\nthe d orbital correlated subspace. The on-site interaction U drives both of\nthese very different materials systems towards phase separation, stemming from\nenhanced ordering of the d orbital occupancies in the x=0 and x=1 species,\nwhereas changes in the overall filling of the d shell contribute negligibly. We\nshow that DFT+U formation energies are qualitatively consistent with\nexperiments for phase stable LixCoO2, phase separating LixFePO4, and phase\nstable LixCoPO4. However, we find that charge ordering plays a critical role in\nthe energetics at intermediate x, strongly dampening the tendency for the\nHubbard U to drive phase separation. Most relevantly, the phase stability of\nLi1/2CoO2 within DFT+U is qualitatively incorrect without allowing charge\nordering, which is problematic given that neither charge ordering nor the band\ngap that it induces are observed in experiment. We demonstrate that charge\nordering arises from the correlated subspace interaction energy as opposed to\nthe double counting. Additionally, we predict the Li order-disorder transition\ntemperature for Li1/2CoO2, demonstrating that the unphysical charge ordering\nwithin DFT+U renders the method problematic, often producing unrealistically\nlarge results.

The observations of QE2 imply that carefully timed observations from\nmultiple viewing geometries can be used to constrain physical properties like\nretrograde versus prograde pole orientation and thermal inertia.

The basic idea is to lift the nonlinear dynamics into a\nhigher dimensional space where its evolution is approximately linear. In an\nuncontrolled setting, this procedure amounts to a numerical approximation of\nthe Koopman operator associated to the nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we\nextend the Koopman operator to controlled dynamical systems and compute a\nfinite-dimensional approximation of the operator in such a way that this\napproximation has the form a linear controlled dynamical system. In numerical\nexamples, the linear predictors obtained in this way exhibit a performance\nsuperior to existing linear predictors such as those based on local\nlinearization or the so-called Carleman linearization. Importantly, the\nprocedure to construct these linear predictors is completely data-driven and\nextremely simple -- it boils down to a nonlinear transformation of the data\n(the lifting) and a linear least squares problem in the lifted space that can\nbe readily solved for large data sets. These linear predictors can be readily\nused to design controllers for the nonlinear dynamical system using linear\ncontroller design methodologies. We focus in particular on model predictive\ncontrol (MPC) and show that MPC controllers designed in this way enjoy\ncomputational complexity of the underlying optimization problem comparable to\nthat of MPC for a linear dynamical system of the same size. Importantly, linear\ninequality constraints on the state and control inputs as well as nonlinear\nconstraints on the state can be imposed in a linear fashion in the proposed MPC\nscheme. Similarly, cost functions nonlinear in the state variable can be\nhandled in a linear fashion.

Sum-product\nnetworks are a class of deep models where, surprisingly, inference remains\ntractable even when an arbitrary number of hidden layers are present. In this\npaper, we generalize this result to a much broader set of learning problems:\nall those where inference consists of summing a function over a semiring. This\nincludes satisfiability, constraint satisfaction, optimization, integration,\nand others. In any semiring, for summation to be tractable it suffices that the\nfactors of every product have disjoint scopes. This unifies and extends many\nprevious results in the literature. Enforcing this condition at learning time\nthus ensures that the learned models are tractable. We illustrate the power and\ngenerality of this approach by applying it to a new type of structured\nprediction problem: learning a nonconvex function that can be globally\noptimized in polynomial time. We show empirically that this greatly outperforms\nthe standard approach of learning without regard to the cost of optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 00:46:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-14"}

Though\nthese nonlinearities were previously very weak in silicon photonic systems, the\nrecent emergence of new optomechanical waveguide structures have transformed\nBrillouin processes into one of the strongest and most tailorable on-chip\nnonlinear interactions. New technologies based on Brillouin couplings have\nformed a basis for amplification, filtering, and nonreciprocal signal\nprocessing techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate strong guided-wave\nBrillouin scattering between light fields guided in distinct spatial modes of a\nsilicon waveguide for the first time. This inter-modal coupling creates\ndispersive symmetry breaking between Stokes and anti-Stokes processes,\npermitting single-sideband amplification and wave dynamics that permit\nnear-unity power conversion. Combining these physics with integrated\nmode-multiplexers enables novel device topologies and eliminates the need for\noptical circulators or narrowband spectral filtering to separate pump and\nsignal waves as in traditional Brillouin processes. We demonstrate 3.5 dB of\noptical gain, over 2.3 dB of net amplification, and 50% single-sideband energy\ntransfer between two optical modes in a pure silicon waveguide, expanding the\ndesign space for flexible on-chip light sources, amplifiers, nonreciprocal\ndevices, and signal processing technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 00:58:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

Descent algebras of symmetric groups have\nproperties that are not shared by other Coxeter groups. For instance, the\nnatural map from the descent algebra of a symmetric group to its character ring\nis a surjection with kernel equal the Jacobson radical. Thus, the descent\nalgebra implicitly encodes information about the representations of the\nsymmetric group, and a complete set of primitive idempotents in the character\nring leads to a decomposition of the group algebra into a sum of right ideals\nindexed by partitions. Stanley asked whether this decomposition of the regular\nrepresentation of a symmetric group could be realized as a sum of\nrepresentations induced from linear characters of centralizers. This question\nwas answered positively by Bergeron, Bergeron, and Garsia, using a connection\nwith the free Lie algebra on n letters, and independently by Douglass,\nPfeiffer, and Roehrle, who connected the decomposition with the configuration\nspace of n-tuples of distinct complex numbers. The Mantaci-Reutenauer algebra\nof a hyperoctahedral group is a subalgebra of the group algebra that contains\nthe descent algebra. Bonnafe and Hohlweg showed that the natural map from the\nMantaci-Reutenauer algebra to the character ring is a surjection with kernel\nequal the Jacobson radical. In 2008, Bonnafe asked whether the analog to\nStanley's question about the decomposition of the group algebra into a sum of\ninduced linear characters holds. In this paper, we give a positive answer to\nBonnafe's question by explicitly constructing the required linear characters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 03:21:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-14"}

The\nmodel describes accurately the anisotropic Dirac cone-like dispersion and\nRashba-like spin polarization of the surface states, including the crucial\neffect of the relaxation of the surface atomic layer of the tungsten towards\nthe bulk. It is shown that the surface relaxation affects the tungsten surface\nstates because it results in increased overlaps between atomic orbitals of the\nsurface atomic layer and nearby layers whereas electric fields that are due to\ncharge transfer between the tungsten and the vacuum near the surface or between\nthe bulk and surface layers do not significantly affect the Rashba-Dirac\nsurface states.

Thus, intrinsically\nmotivated creativity begins with detection of high psychological entropy\nmaterial (e.g., a question or inconsistency), which provokes uncertainty and is\narousal-inducing.

In such models, the nonlocal bias\nfactors are closely related to the more familiar local nonlinear bias factors,\nwhich are much easier to measure.

Firstly, we introduce the relaxed notion\nof confluence modulo equivalence into the context of CHR: while confluence for\na terminating program means that all alternative derivations for a query lead\nto the exact same final state, confluence modulo equivalence only requires the\nfinal states to be equivalent with respect to an equivalence relation tailored\nfor the given program. Secondly, we allow non-logical built-in predicates such\nas var/1 and incomplete ones such as is/2, that are ignored in previous work on\nconfluence.\n  To this end, a new operational semantics for CHR is developed which includes\nsuch predicates. In addition, this semantics differs from earlier approaches by\nits simplicity without loss of generality, and it may also be recommended for\nfuture studies of CHR.\n  For the purely logical subset of CHR, proofs can be expressed in first-order\nlogic, that we show is not sufficient in the present case. We have introduced a\nformal meta-language that allows reasoning about abstract states and\nderivations with meta-level restrictions that reflect the non-logical and\nincomplete predicates. This language represents subproofs as diagrams, which\nfacilitates a systematic enumeration of proof cases, pointing forward to a\nmechanical support for such proofs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 09:11:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-22"}

The classical modelling paradigm is that\nlong term memories correspond to stable steady states of a Hopfield network\nwith Hebbian connectivity. Experiments show that short term synaptic depression\nplays an important role in the processing of memories. This leads naturally to\na computational model of priming, called latching dynamics; a stable state\n(prime) can become unstable and the system may converge to another transiently\nstable steady state (target).

More than half\n(37) of the 49 target stars show no evidence of binarity, and their atmospheric\nparameters ($T_{\\rm{eff}}$, $\\log g$, and [Fe/H]) are within the range of\nordinary solar-analog stars. We measured Ca II 8542 and H$\\alpha$ lines, which\nare good indicators of the chromospheric activity. The intensity of these lines\nindicates that all the target stars have large starspots. We also measured\n$v\\sin i$ (projected rotational velocity) and Lithium abundance for the target\nstars. Li abundance is a key to understanding the evolution of the stellar\nconvection zone, which reflects the stellar age, mass and rotational history.\nWe confirmed that many of the target stars rapidly rotate and have high Li\nabundance, compared with the Sun, as suggested by many previous studies. There\nare, however, also some target stars that rotate slowly ($v\\sin i$=2$\\sim$3 km\ns$^{-1}$) and have low Li abundance like the Sun. These results support that\nold and slowly rotating stars similar to the Sun could have high activity level\nand large starspots. This is consistent with the results of our previous\nstudies of solar-type superflare stars. In the future, it is important to\nconduct long-term monitoring observations of these active solar-analog stars in\norder to investigate detailed properties of large starspots from the viewpoint\nof stellar dynamo theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 11:21:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-26"}

The starting point of our work is the observation\nthat unrolled iterative methods have the form of a CNN (filtering followed by\npoint-wise non-linearity) when the normal operator (H*H, the adjoint of H times\nH) of the forward model is a convolution.

GRS 1758-258 is one of two prototypical microquasars towards the\nGalactic Center direction discovered almost a quarter of a century ago.

In particular, the main physical parameters of\nthe donor star, such as the mass or the spectral type, are not yet well\nconstrained. Methods. GRS 1758-258 has remained so far elusive to optical\nspectroscopy owing to its observational difficulties. Here, we use this\ntraditional tool of stellar astronomy at low spectral resolution with a 10 m\nclass telescope and a long slit spectrograph. Results. An improved spectrum is\nobtained as compared to previous work.

Once the thermodynamic state corresponding\nto $T_f = T_K$ is reached, no further decrease of enthalpy is observed. This is\ninterpreted as a signature of the ideal glass transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 13:22:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

Owing to advances in laser technology, electric\nfields comparable to those electrons experience in atoms are readily generated\nand open opportunities to dynamically investigate the process of electron\ntunneling through the potential barrier formed by the superposition of both\nlaser and atomic fields. Attosecond-time and angstrom-space resolution of the\nstrong laser-field technique allow to address fundamental questions related to\ntunneling, which are still open and debated: Which time is spent under the\nbarrier and what momentum is picked up by the particle in the meantime? In this\ncombined experimental and theoretical study we demonstrate that for\nstrong-field ionization the leading quantum mechanical Wigner treatment for the\ntime resolved description of tunneling is valid. We achieve a high sensitivity\non the tunneling barrier and unambiguously isolate its effects by performing a\ndifferential study of two systems with almost identical tunneling geometry.\nMoreover, working with a low frequency laser, we essentially limit the\nnon-adiabaticity of the process as a major source of uncertainty. The agreement\nbetween experiment and theory implies two substantial corrections with respect\nto the widely employed quasiclassical treatment: In addition to a non-vanishing\nlongitudinal momentum along the laser field-direction we provide clear evidence\nfor a non-zero tunneling time delay. This addresses also the fundamental\nquestion how the transition occurs from the tunnel barrier to free space\nclassical evolution of the ejected electron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 13:39:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}

It is known that a state known as the Floquet Weyl\nsemimetal can be realized when free Dirac fermions are placed in a rotating\nelectric field. What will happen if strong interaction is introduced to this\nsystem? Will the interaction wash out the characteristic features of Weyl\nsemimetals such as the Hall response? Is there a steady state and what is its\nthermodynamic behavior? We answer these questions using AdS/CFT correspondence\nin the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric massless QCD in a rotating electric field\nin the large $N_c$ limit realizing the first example of a \"holographic Floquet\nstate\". In this limit, gluons not only mediate interaction, but also act as an\nenergy reservoir and stabilize the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS). We\nobtain the electric current induced by a rotating electric field: In the high\nfrequency region, the Ohm's law is satisfied, while we recover the DC nonlinear\nconductivity at low frequency, which was obtained holographically in a previous\nwork. The thermodynamic properties of the NESS, e.g., fluctuation-dissipation\nrelation, is characterized by the effective Hawking temperature that is defined\nfrom the effective horizon giving a holographic meaning to the \"periodic\nthermodynamic\" concept. In addition to the strong (pump) rotating electric\nfield, we apply an additional weak (probe) electric field in the spirit of the\npump-probe experiments done in condensed matter experiments. Weak DC and AC\nprobe analysis in the background rotating electric field shows Hall currents as\na linear response, therefore the Hall response of Floquet Weyl semimetals\nsurvives at the strong coupling limit.

For two-valleys, we predict Wigner\ncrystallization at $r_s= 29.5$, indicating that valley degeneracy has little\neffect on the critical $r_s$, in contrast to an earlier claim.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 14:22:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

As the power-budget of classical receiver chains is dominated\nby the high-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), there is a growing\ninterest towards deploying receiver architectures with reduced-bit or even\n1-bit ADCs. In this paper, we study waveform design, optimization and detection\naspects of multi-user massive MIMO downlink where user terminals adopt very\nsimple 1-bit ADCs with oversampling. In order to achieve spectral efficiency\nhigher than 1 bit/s/Hz per real-dimension, we propose a two-stage precoding,\nnamely a novel quantization precoder followed by maximum-ratio transmission\n(MRT) or zero-forcing (ZF) type spatial channel precoder which jointly form the\nmulti-user-multiantenna transmit waveform. The quantization precoder outputs\nare optimized, under appropriate transmitter and receiver filter bandwidth\nconstraints, to provide controlled inter-symbol-interference (ISI) enabling the\ninput symbols to be uniquely detected from 1-bit quantized observations with a\nlow-complexity symbol detector in the absence of noise. An additional\noptimization constraint is also imposed in the quantization precoder design to\nincrease the robustness against noise and residual inter-user-interference\n(IUI). The purpose of the spatial channel precoder, in turn, is to suppress the\nIUI and provide high beamforming gains such that good symbol-error rates (SERs)\ncan be achieved in the presence of noise and interference.

However, due to the computation complexity of the MD algorithm,\nit takes weeks or even months to simulate a comparatively simple biology entity\non conventional multicore processors. The critical path in molecular dynamics\nsimulations is the force calculation between particles inside the simulated\nenvironment, which has abundant parallelism. Among various acceleration\nplatforms, FPGA is an attractive alternative because of its low power and high\nenergy efficiency. However, due to its high programming cost using RTL, none of\nthe mainstream MD software packages has yet adopted FPGA for acceleration.\n  In this paper we revisit the FPGA acceleration of MD in high-level synthesis\n(HLS) so as to provide affordable programming cost. Our experience with the MD\nacceleration demonstrates that HLS optimizations such as loop pipelining,\nmodule duplication and memory partitioning are essential to improve the\nperformance, achieving a speedup of 9.5X compared to a 12-core CPU. More\nimportantly, we observe that even the fully optimized HLS design can still be\n2X slower than the reference RTL architecture due to the common dynamic\n(conditional) data flow behavior that is not yet supported by current HLS\ntools. To support such behavior, we further customize an array of processing\nelements together with a data-driven streaming network through a common RTL\ntemplate, and fully automate the design flow. Our final experimental results\ndemonstrate a 19.4X performance speedup and 39X energy efficiency for the\nwidely used ApoA1 MD benchmark on the Convey HC1ex FPGA compared to a 12-core\nIntel Xeon server.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 01:38:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}
