As the attraction becomes strong, the spin-down fermion binds\nwith one spin-up fermion to form a tightly bound molecule. Throughout the whole\ninteraction regime, a crossover from the polaron to a molecule state is fully\ndemonstrated through exact results of the excitation spectrum, the effective\nmass, binding energy and kinetic energy. Furthermore, a clear distinction\nbetween the polaron and molecule is conceived by the probability distribution,\nsingle particle reduced density matrix and density-density correlations, which\nare calculated directly from the Bethe ansatz wave function. Such a\npolaron-molecule crossover presents a universal nature of an impurity immersed\ninto a fermionic medium with an attraction in one dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2016 16:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-04"}

Diverse activity patterns thus have to be taken into account when\nstudying the evolution of cooperation in social dilemmas. Here we study the\nweak prisoner's dilemma game, where the activity of each player is determined\nin a probabilistic manner either by its degree or by its payoff. While\ndegree-correlated activity introduces cascading failures of cooperation that\nare particularly severe on scale-free networks with frequently inactive hubs,\npayoff-correlated activity provides a more nuanced activity profile, which\nultimately hinders systemic breakdowns of cooperation. To determine optimal\nconditions for the evolution of cooperation, we introduce an exponential decay\nto payoff-correlated activity that determines how fast the activity of a player\nreturns to its default state. We show that there exists an intermediate decay\nrate, at which the resolution of the social dilemma is optimal. This can be\nexplained by the emerging activity patterns of players, where the inactivity of\nhubs is compensated effectively by the increased activity of average-degree\nplayers, who through their collective influence in the network sustain a higher\nlevel of cooperation. The sudden drops in the fraction of cooperators observed\nwith degree-correlated activity therefore vanish, and so does the need for the\nlengthy spatiotemporal reorganization of compact cooperative clusters. The\nabsence of such asymmetric dynamic instabilities thus leads to an optimal\nresolution of social dilemmas, especially when the conditions for the evolution\nof cooperation are strongly adverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2016 17:54:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Dec 2016 15:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

Traditional implementations of Strassen-like fast matrix\nmultiplication (FMM) algorithms often do not perform well except for very large\nmatrix sizes, due to the increased cost of memory movement, which is\nparticularly noticeable for non-square matrices. Such implementations also\nrequire considerable workspace and modifications to the standard BLAS\ninterface. We propose a code generator framework to automatically implement a\nlarge family of FMM algorithms suitable for multiplications of arbitrary matrix\nsizes and shapes. By representing FMM with a triple of matrices [U,V,W] that\ncapture the linear combinations of submatrices that are formed, we can use the\nKronecker product to define a multi-level representation of Strassen-like\nalgorithms. Incorporating the matrix additions that must be performed for\nStrassen-like algorithms into the inherent packing and micro-kernel operations\ninside GEMM avoids extra workspace and reduces the cost of memory movement.\nAdopting the same loop structures as high-performance GEMM implementations\nallows parallelization of all FMM algorithms with simple but efficient data\nparallelism without the overhead of task parallelism. We present a simple\nperformance model for general FMM algorithms and compare actual performance of\n20+ FMM algorithms to modeled predictions.

Current literature on tensor completion primarily\nfocuses on recovery from a set of uniformly randomly measured entries, and the\nrequired number of measurements to achieve recovery is not guaranteed to be\noptimal. In addition, the implementation of some previous methods is NP-hard.\nIn this article, we propose a framework for low-rank tensor completion via a\nnovel tensor measurement scheme we name Cross. The proposed procedure is\nefficient and easy to implement. In particular, we show that a third order\ntensor of Tucker rank-$(r_1, r_2, r_3)$ in $p_1$-by-$p_2$-by-$p_3$ dimensional\nspace can be recovered from as few as $r_1r_2r_3 + r_1(p_1-r_1) + r_2(p_2-r_2)\n+ r_3(p_3-r_3)$ noiseless measurements, which matches the sample complexity\nlower-bound. In the case of noisy measurements, we also develop a theoretical\nupper bound and the matching minimax lower bound for recovery error over\ncertain classes of low-rank tensors for the proposed procedure. The results can\nbe further extended to fourth or higher-order tensors. Simulation studies show\nthat the method performs well under a variety of settings. Finally, the\nprocedure is illustrated through a real dataset in neuroimaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2016 19:02:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Nov 2018 18:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-28"}

We show in this paper that the system performance can be\nimproved by appropriately assigning the pilot sequences to the users, in the\nso-called pilot allocation scheme. Depending on the optimization metric\nadopted, it is more advantageous to a user with certain long- term fading\ncoefficient be assigned to a specific pilot sequence, whose interference can be\ncompletely estimated in advance by the BS by only knowing the long term fading\ncoefficients of users in adjacent cells.

As GPUs are emerging as a\npromising platform to accelerate various operations, sorting on GPUs becomes a\nviable endeavour. Over the past few years, several improvements have been\nproposed for sorting on GPUs, leading to the first radix sort implementations\nthat achieve a sorting rate of over one billion 32-bit keys per second. Yet,\nstate-of-the-art approaches are heavily memory bandwidth-bound, as they require\nsubstantially more memory transfers than their CPU-based counterparts.\n  Our work proposes a novel approach that almost halves the amount of memory\ntransfers and, therefore, considerably lifts the memory bandwidth limitation.\nBeing able to sort two gigabytes of eight-byte records in as little as 50\nmilliseconds, our approach achieves a 2.32-fold improvement over the\nstate-of-the-art GPU-based radix sort for uniform distributions, sustaining a\nminimum speed-up of no less than a factor of 1.66 for skewed distributions.\n  To address inputs that either do not reside on the GPU or exceed the\navailable device memory, we build on our efficient GPU sorting approach with a\npipelined heterogeneous sorting algorithm that mitigates the overhead\nassociated with PCIe data transfers. Comparing the end-to-end sorting\nperformance to the state-of-the-art CPU-based radix sort running 16 threads,\nour heterogeneous approach achieves a 2.06-fold and a 1.53-fold improvement for\nsorting 64 GB key-value pairs with a skewed and a uniform distribution,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2016 19:33:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 12:22:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-22"}

The system is quenched far out of\nequilibrium by imprinting vortex defects into an otherwise phase-coherent\ncondensate. A strongly anomalous non-thermal fixed point is identified,\nassociated with a slowed decay of the defects in the case that the dissipative\ncoupling to the thermal background noise is suppressed.

The\narticle discusses these aspects of non-thermal fixed points in the context of\nphase-ordering kinetics and coarsening dynamics, thus relating phenomenological\nand analytical approaches to classifying far-from-equilibrium scaling dynamics\nwith each other.

Moreover, the relation to superfluid turbulence as well as to driven\nstationary systems is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2016 20:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 20:59:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 4 Mar 2018 23:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-06"}

An important long-standing\nproblem concerns the properties of the networks that optimize the dynamics with\nrespect to a given performance measure. Here we show that such optimization can\nlead to sensitive dependence of the dynamics on the structure of the network.\nSpecifically, using diffusively coupled systems as examples, we demonstrate\nthat the stability of a dynamical state can exhibit sensitivity to unweighted\nstructural perturbations (i.e., link removals and node additions) for\nundirected optimal networks and to weighted perturbations (i.e., small changes\nin link weights) for directed optimal networks. As mechanisms underlying this\nsensitivity, we identify discontinuous transitions occurring in the complement\nof undirected optimal networks and the prevalence of eigenvector degeneracy in\ndirected optimal networks. These findings establish a unified characterization\nof networks optimized for dynamical stability, which we illustrate using Turing\ninstability in activator-inhibitor systems, synchronization in power-grid\nnetworks, network diffusion, and several other network processes. Our results\nsuggest that the network structure of a complex system operating near an\noptimum can potentially be fine-tuned for a significantly enhanced stability\ncompared to what one might expect from simple extrapolation. On the other hand,\nthey also suggest constraints on how close to the optimum the system can be in\npractice. Finally, the results have potential implications for biophysical\nnetworks, which have evolved under the competing pressures of optimizing\nfitness while remaining robust against perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2016 20:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 18:00:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2017 06:33:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-07"}

A\nGaussian mixture model (GMM) is adopted, whose components correspond to all the\npossible candidate source locations defined on a grid. After optimizing the\nGMM-based objective function, given an observed set of binaural features, both\nthe number of sources and their locations are estimated by selecting the GMM\ncomponents with the largest priors. This is achieved by enforcing a sparse\nsolution, thus favoring a small number of speakers with respect to the large\nnumber of initial candidate source locations. An entropy-based penalty term is\nadded to the likelihood, thus imposing sparsity over the set of GMM priors. In\naddition, the direct-path relative transfer function (DP-RTF) is used to build\nrobust binaural features. The DP-RTF, recently proposed for single-source\nlocalization, was shown to be robust to reverberations, since it encodes\ninter-channel information corresponding to the direct-path of sound\npropagation.

We investigate the connection between the so-called principle\neigenfunctions of the Koopman operator and the existence of a topological\nconjugacy between the nonlinear dynamics and its linearization in the\nneighborhood of the fixed point. The principle eigenfunctions generate an\nalgebra of observables for the linear dynamics --- called the principle algebra\n--- which can be used to generate a sequence of approximate conjugacy maps in\nthe same manner as it is done in normal form theory. Each element of the\nprinciple algebra has an expansion into eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator\nand composing an eigenfunction with one of the approximate topological\nconjugacies gives an approximate eigenfunction of the Koopman operator\nassociated with the nonlinear dynamical system. When the limit of the\napproximate conjugacies exists and attention is restricted to real Banach\nspaces, a simple application of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem shows that both\nthe principle algebra and the pull-back algebra --- defined by composing the\nprinciple algebra with the topological conjugacy --- are uniformly dense in\neither the space of continuous functions or the maximal ideal of continuous\nfunctions vanishing at the fixed point.

In fact,\nconsistent position-dependent quantum models for the photon number in resonant\nstructures have only been formulated very recently and only for dielectric\nmedia. Here we present a general position-dependent quantized fluctuational\nelectrodynamics (QFED) formalism that extends the consistent field quantization\nto describe the photon number also in the presence of magnetic field-matter\ninteractions. It is shown that the magnetic fluctuations provide an additional\ndegree of freedom in media where the magnetic coupling to the field is\nprominent. Therefore, the field quantization requires an additional independent\nnoise operator that is commuting with the conventional bosonic noise operator\ndescribing the polarization current fluctuations in dielectric media. In\naddition to allowing the detailed description of field fluctuations, our\nmethods provide practical tools for modeling optical energy transfer and the\nformation of thermal balance in general dielectric and magnetic nanodevices.

We argue that the discontinuity can be bypassed by marginalizing\nout the variable of interest, which results in a new reparameterization trick\nfor discrete variables. This reparameterization greatly reduces the variance,\nwhich is understood by regarding the method as an application of common random\nnumbers to the estimation.

Research particularly broadens the horizon of\nchemical science. When atoms of a suitable element amalgamate under uniformly\nattained dynamics, they execute confined interstate dynamics of outer ring\nelectrons. Atoms execute electron dynamics by entertaining forces mainly\nrelated to the original zones of the growth. On attaining the neutral state for\nan instant, the outer ring electron of an atom executes dynamics by involving\nthe conservative forces. On disappearing from the pole forces, that electron\nregains the state in the next instant. In one cycle of interstate electron\ndynamics, a binding energy shape like the path of dynamics generates.

In standard topic models, a topic (such\nas sports, business, or politics) is viewed as a probability distribution $\\vec\na_i$ over words, and a document is generated by first selecting a mixture $\\vec\nw$ over topics, and then generating words i.i.d. from the associated mixture\n$A{\\vec w}$. Given a large collection of such documents, the goal is to recover\nthe topic vectors and then to correctly classify new documents according to\ntheir topic mixture.\n  In this work we consider a broad generalization of this framework in which\nwords are no longer assumed to be drawn i.i.d. and instead a topic is a complex\ndistribution over sequences of paragraphs. Since one could not hope to even\nrepresent such a distribution in general (even if paragraphs are given using\nsome natural feature representation), we aim instead to directly learn a\ndocument classifier. That is, we aim to learn a predictor that given a new\ndocument, accurately predicts its topic mixture, without learning the\ndistributions explicitly. We present several natural conditions under which one\ncan do this efficiently and discuss issues such as noise tolerance and sample\ncomplexity in this model. More generally, our model can be viewed as a\ngeneralization of the multi-view or co-training setting in machine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2016 03:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-07"}

In this\nwork, we propose a novel latent space modeling method to learn better latent\nrepresentation.

These events have significant impact on the intra-cluster medium,\ndepositing vast amounts of energy - often in the form of shocks - as well as\nheavily influencing the properties of the constituent galaxy population. Many\nclusters have been shown to host large-scale diffuse radio emission, known\nvariously as radio haloes and relics. These sources arise as a result of\nelectron (re-)acceleration in cluster-scale magnetic fields, although the\nprocesses by which this occurs are still poorly understood. We present new,\ndeep radio observations of the high-redshift galaxy cluster MACS\nJ0025.4$-$1222, taken with the GMRT at 325 MHz, as well as new analysis of all\narchival $Chandra$ X-ray observations. We aim to investigate the potential of\ndiffuse radio emission and categorise the radio population of this cluster,\nwhich has only been covered previously by shallow radio surveys. We produce\nlow-resolution maps of MACS J0025.4$-$1222 through a combination of uv-tapering\nand subtracting the compact source population. Radial surface brightness and\nmass profiles are derived from the $Chandra$ data. We also derive a 2D map of\nthe ICM temperature. For the first time, two sources of diffuse radio emission\nare detected in MACS J0025.4$-$1222, on linear scales of several hundred kpc.\nGiven the redshift of the cluster and the assumed cosmology, these sources\nappear to be consistent with established trends in power scaling relations for\nradio relics. The X-ray temperature map presents evidence of an asymmetric\ntemperature profile and tentative identification of a temperature jump\nassociated with one relic. We classify the pair of diffuse radio sources in\nthis cluster as a pair of radio relics, given their consistency with scaling\nrelations, location toward the cluster outskirts, and the available X-ray data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2016 06:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

With the emergence of big\ndata, there is an increasing need to parallelize the training process of\ndecision tree. However, most existing attempts along this line suffer from high\ncommunication costs. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called\n\\emph{Parallel Voting Decision Tree (PV-Tree)}, to tackle this challenge. After\npartitioning the training data onto a number of (e.g., $M$) machines, this\nalgorithm performs both local voting and global voting in each iteration. For\nlocal voting, the top-$k$ attributes are selected from each machine according\nto its local data. Then, globally top-$2k$ attributes are determined by a\nmajority voting among these local candidates. Finally, the full-grained\nhistograms of the globally top-$2k$ attributes are collected from local\nmachines in order to identify the best (most informative) attribute and its\nsplit point. PV-Tree can achieve a very low communication cost (independent of\nthe total number of attributes) and thus can scale out very well. Furthermore,\ntheoretical analysis shows that this algorithm can learn a near optimal\ndecision tree, since it can find the best attribute with a large probability.\nOur experiments on real-world datasets show that PV-Tree significantly\noutperforms the existing parallel decision tree algorithms in the trade-off\nbetween accuracy and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2016 07:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-07"}

The site\nshows a clear seasonal variation with the average opacity lower by a factor of\ntwo during winter. For the winter quartiles of 25% and 50%, the Greenland site\nis about 10%-30% worse than the ALMA or the South Pole sites. Estimated\natmospheric transmission spectra in winter season are similar to the ALMA site\nat lower frequencies (<450 GHz), which are transparent enough to perform\nastronomical observations almost all of the winter time with opacities <0.5,\nbut 10%-25% higher opacities at higher frequencies (>450 GHz) than those at the\nALMA site. This is due to the lower altitude of the Greenland site.\nNevertheless, half of the winter time at the Greenland site can be used for\nastronomical observations at frequencies between 450 GHz and 1000 GHz with\nopacities <1.2, and 10% of the time show >10% transmittance in the THz (1035\nGHz, 1350 GHz, and 1500 GHz) windows. One major advantage of the Greenland site\nin winter is that there is no diurnal variation due to the polar night\ncondition, and therefore the durations of low-opacity conditions are\nsignificantly longer than at the ALMA site.

Such long stable opacity conditions do\nnot occur as often even at the South Pole; it happens only for the opacity\nlower than 0.05. Since the opacity variation is directly related to the sky\ntemperature (background) variation, the Greenland site is suitable for\nastronomical observations that need unusually stable sky background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2016 07:23:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-12"}

The\npulsar was discovered in gamma-ray photon data from the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope (LAT) during a blind-search survey of unidentified LAT sources,\nrunning on the distributed volunteer computing system Einstein@Home. No radio\npulsations were detected in dedicated follow-up searches with the Parkes radio\ntelescope, with a flux density upper limit at 1369 MHz of 30 $\\mu$Jy. By timing\nthis pulsar's gamma-ray pulsations, we measure its braking index over five\nyears of LAT observations to be $n = 2.598 \\pm 0.001 \\pm 0.1$, where the first\nuncertainty is statistical and the second estimates the bias due to timing\nnoise. Assuming its braking index has been similar since birth, the pulsar has\nan estimated age of around 2,700 yr, making it the youngest pulsar to be found\nin a blind search of gamma-ray data and the youngest known radio-quiet\ngamma-ray pulsar. Despite its young age the pulsar is not associated with any\nknown supernova remnant or pulsar wind nebula. The pulsar's inferred dipolar\nsurface magnetic field strength is $3.8 \\times 10^{13}$ G, almost 90% of the\nquantum-critical level. We investigate some potential physical causes of the\nbraking index deviating from the simple dipole model but find that LAT data\ncovering a longer time interval will be necessary to distinguish between these.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2016 09:28:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 09:52:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-16"}

In general, the service demand is very\nheterogeneous, non-uniformly distributed, and dynamic. Consequently, radio\naccess networks create very irregular topologies with more access points where\nservice demand is concentrated. While this dynamism requires networks with the\nability to adapt to time-varying conditions, the non-uniformity of the service\ndemand makes the planning, analysis, and optimization difficult. In order to\nhelp with these tasks, a framework based on canonical domains and spatial\nmappings (e.g., conformal mapping) have recently been proposed. The idea is to\ncarry out part of the planning in a canonical (perfectly symmetric) domain that\nis connected to the physical one (real-scenario) by means of a spatial\ntransformation designed to map the access points consistently with the service\ndemand. This paper continues the research in that direction by introducing\nadditional tools and possibilities to that framework, namely the use of\ncentroidal Voronoi algorithms and non-conformal composite mappings. Moreover,\npower optimization is also introduced to the framework.

It has been, however, still difficult to decompose the unfolded band\nstructures into the modes based on the crystallographic symmetry of the\nunderlying structure, and therefore detailed analyses of the unfolded band\nstructures have been restricted. In this study, we develop a procedure to\ndecompose the unfolded band structures according to the small representations\n(SRs) of the little groups.

For a fully accreted crust one\nneeds additionally the value of the total deep crustal heating per one accreted\nnucleon.\n  For typical neutron star masses the approximate approach allows to determine\nthe neutron star radius with an error ~0.1% (~ 10 m, equivalent to a 1%\ninaccuracy in the crust thickness).\n  The formalism applies to neutron stars with a catalyzed or a fully accreted\ncrust. The difference in the neutron star radius between the two models is\nproportional to the total energy release due to deep crustal heating.\n  For a given model of dense matter describing the neutron star core, the\nradius of a neutron star can be accurately determined independently of the\ncrust model with a precision much better than the ~5% one expected from the\nnext generation of X-ray satellites.

For legacy\nsystems, OOB radiation is well understood and is commonly handled by digital\nprecompensation techniques. When using large arrays, however, new phenomena and\nhardware limitations have to be considered. First, signals can be radiated\ndirectionally, which might focus the OOB radiation. Second, low-complexity\nhardware is used for cost reasons, which increases the relative amount of OOB\nradiation. Given that massive MIMO and millimeter wave communication rely on\nbase stations with a large number of antennas, the spatial behavior of OOB\nradiation from large arrays will have significant implications for the hardware\nrequirements of future base stations. We show that, if the OOB radiation is\nbeamformed, its array gain is never larger than that of the in-band signal. In\nmany cases, the OOB radiation is close to isotropic even when the in-band\nsignal is highly directive. With the same total radiated power, the OOB\nradiation from large arrays is therefore never more severe than from a legacy\nsystem with the same adjacent-channel-leakage ratio. Further, the OOB radiation\nis less detrimental than from a legacy system since the high array gain of the\nin-band signal allows large arrays to radiate less total power than legacy\nsystems. We also show how OOB radiation from large arrays varies with location\nin static propagation environments and how these effects vanish when averaged\nover the small-scale fading. Since a higher relative amount of OOB radiation\ncan be tolerated for large arrays, the linearity requirement can be relaxed as\ncompared to legacy systems. Specifically, less stringent linearity requirements\non each transmitter makes it possible to build large arrays from low-complexity\nhardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2016 13:03:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 06:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-06"}

In this work, the\nstability of these phases is revisited by using density functional theory. At\nfinite temperatures, a novel transition of rhombohedral phases back to BCC\nphase induced by thermal electrons is discovered. This reentrant transition is\nfound not driven by phonons, instead it is the electronic entropy that\nstabilizes the latter phase, which is totally out of expectation. Parallel to\nthis transition, we find a peculiar and strong increase of the shear modulus\nC44 with increasing temperature. It is counter-intuitive in the sense that it\nsuggests an unusual harding mechanism of vanadium by temperature. With these\nstability analyses, the high-pressure and finite-temperature phase diagram of\nvanadium is proposed. Furthermore, the dependence of the stability of RH phases\non the Fermi energy and chemical environment is investigated. The results\ndemonstrate that the position of the Fermi level has a significant impact on\nthe phase stability, and follows the band-filling argument. Besides the Fermi\nsurface nesting, we find that the localization/delocalization of the d orbitals\nalso contributes to the instability of rhombohedral distortions in vanadium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2016 15:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-07"}

Here we extend the $CPT$ theorem to quantum\nfield theories with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Our derivation is a quite\nminimal one as it requires only the time independent evolution of scalar\nproducts and invariance under complex Lorentz transformations. The first of\nthese requirements does not force the Hamiltonian to be Hermitian. Rather, it\nforces its eigenvalues to either be real or to appear in complex conjugate\npairs, forces the eigenvectors of such conjugate pairs to be conjugates of each\nother, and forces the Hamiltonian to admit of an antilinear symmetry. The\nlatter requirement then forces this antilinear symmetry to be $CPT$, with\nHermiticity of a Hamiltonian thus only being a sufficient condition for $CPT$\nsymmetry and not a necessary one. $CPT$ symmetry thus has primacy over\nHermiticity, and it rather than Hermiticity should be taken as a guiding\nprinciple for constructing quantum theories. With conformal gravity being a\nnon-Hermitian theory, our approach allows us to construct a positive,\nghost-free norm for the theory, to thereby establish the unitarity of conformal\ngravity. Since our approach allows for complex energies and decays, our work\njustifies the use of the $CPT$ theorem in establishing the equality of the\nlifetimes of unstable particles that are charge conjugates of each other. In\nthe quantum-mechanical limit where charge conjugation is separately conserved,\nthe key results of the $PT$ symmetry program of Bender and collaborators are\nrecovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2016 18:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-08"}

A peculiar investigation has allowed to gather very accurate radial\nvelocities for pair members, from high quality HI and optical measurements\n(median uncertainty on velocity differences 10 km/s). Our final catalog\ncontains 1005 galaxy pairs. Then we give some global properties of the pair\ncatalog. We display the histograms of the radial velocity differences between\nthe pair members and of their projected interdistances (median 0.29 Mpc).\nFinally, we provide an estimate of the contamination by cosmological false\n\"pairs\", which is about 10 percent up to a velocity difference of 380 km/s,\nbeyond which all pairs are probably false.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2016 17:34:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}
