Both are based on combining the IMSRG with simple\nmany-body methods commonly used to target excited states, such as the\nTamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) and equations-of-motion (EOM) techniques. In\nthe first approach, a two-step sequential IMSRG transformation is used to drive\nthe Hamiltonian to a form where a simple TDA calculation (i.e., diagonalization\nin the space of $1$p$1$h excitations) becomes exact for a subset of\neigenvalues. In the second approach, equations-of-motion (EOM) techniques are\napplied to the ground-state-decoupled IMSRG Hamiltonian to access excited\nstates. We perform proof-of-principle calculations for parabolic quantum dots\nin two-dimensions and the closed shell nuclei $^{16}$O and $^{22}$O. We find\nthat the TDA-IMSRG approach gives better accuracy than the EOM-IMSRG when\ncalculations converge, but is otherwise lacking the versatility and numerical\nstability of the latter. Our calculated spectra are in reasonable agreement\nwith analogous EOM-coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) calculations, which paves the way\nfor more interesting applications of the EOM-IMSRG to calculations of\nconsistently evolved observables such as electromagnetic strength functions and\nnuclear matrix elements, and extensions to nuclei within 1-2 nucleons of a\nclosed shell by generalizing the EOM ladder operator to include particle-number\nnonconserving terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2016 16:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 14:18:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

We\ntheoretically address the presence of bimodal phenotypes in the context of\nmicroRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation. MiRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules\nthat downregulate the expression of their target mRNAs. The nature of this\ninteraction is titrative and induces a threshold effect: below a given target\ntranscription rate no mRNAs are free and available for translation. We\ninvestigate the effect of extrinsic noise on the system by introducing a\nfluctuating miRNA-transcription rate.

Through the Partner program, YouTube\nallows content creators to monetize their popular videos. Of significant\nimportance for content creators is which meta-level features (e.g. title, tag,\nthumbnail) are most sensitive for promoting video popularity. The popularity of\nvideos also depends on the social dynamics, i.e. the interaction of the content\ncreators (or channels) with YouTube users. Using real-world data consisting of\nabout 6 million videos spread over 25 thousand channels, we empirically examine\nthe sensitivity of YouTube meta-level features and social dynamics. The key\nmeta-level features that impact the view counts of a video include: first day\nview count , number of subscribers, contrast of the video thumbnail, Google\nhits, number of keywords, video category, title length, and number of\nupper-case letters in the title respectively and illustrate that these\nmeta-level features can be used to estimate the popularity of a video.

Given the popularity of LoRa it is likely\nthat multiple independent LoRa networks are deployed in close proximity.

In this paper we investigate the use of directional\nantennae and the use of multiple base stations as methods of dealing with\ninter-network interference. Directional antennae increase signal strength at\nreceivers without increasing transmission energy cost. Thus, the probability of\nsuccessfully decoding the message in an interference situation is improved.\nMultiple base stations can alternatively be used to improve the probability of\nreceiving a message in a noisy environment. We compare the effectiveness of\nthese two approaches via simulation. Our findings show that both methods are\nable to improve LoRa network performance in interference settings.

This\nsystem automatically derives worst-case resource bounds for higher-order\npolymorphic programs with user-defined inductive types. The technique is\nparametric in the resource and can derive bounds for time, memory allocations\nand energy usage. The derived bounds are multivariate resource polynomials\nwhich are functions of different size parameters that depend on the standard\nOCaml types. Bound inference is fully automatic and reduced to a linear\noptimization problem that is passed to an off-the-shelf LP solver. Technically,\nthe analysis system is based on a novel multivariate automatic amortized\nresource analysis (AARA). It builds on existing work on linear AARA for\nhigher-order programs with user-defined inductive types and on multivariate\nAARA for first-order programs with built-in lists and binary trees. For the\nfirst time, it is possible to automatically derive polynomial bounds for\nhigher-order functions and polynomial bounds that depend on user-defined\ninductive types. Moreover, the analysis handles programs with side effects and\neven outperforms the linear bound inference of previous systems. At the same\ntime, it preserves the expressivity and efficiency of existing AARA techniques.\nThe practicality of the analysis system is demonstrated with an implementation\nand integration with Inria's OCaml compiler. The implementation is used to\nautomatically derive resource bounds for 411 functions and 6018 lines of code\nderived from OCaml libraries, the CompCert compiler, and implementations of\ntextbook algorithms. In a case study, the system infers bounds on the number of\nqueries that are sent by OCaml programs to DynamoDB, a commercial NoSQL cloud\ndatabase service.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2016 17:36:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

We formulate the\nlearning problem as a nonsmooth convex optimization problem which we solve by\nappealing to Nesterovs optimal first-order method for nonsmooth optimization.\nWe also provide a message passing formulation of the learning method which\nallows for a highly scalable implementation in big data frameworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2016 18:27:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-03"}

The latter requires a memory\nefficient implementation, as a naive implementation of the Neural GPU is memory\nintensive. We find that these techniques increase the set of algorithmic\nproblems that can be solved by the Neural GPU: we have been able to learn to\nperform all the arithmetic operations (and generalize to arbitrarily long\nnumbers) when the arguments are given in the decimal representation (which,\nsurprisingly, has not been possible before).

Of\nparticular importance is its contribution to the B-mode polarization power\nspectrum. Indeed, vortical modes sourced by the PMF can dominate the B-mode\npower spectrum on small scales, as they survive damping up to a small fraction\nof the Silk length. Therefore, measurements of the B-mode polarization at\nhigh-$\\ell$ , such as the one recently performed by the South Pole Telescope\n(SPT), have the potential to provide stringent constraints on the PMF. We use\nthe publicly released SPT B-mode polarization spectrum, along with the\ntemperature and polarization data from the Planck satellite, to derive\nconstraints on the magnitude, the spectral index and the energy scale at which\nthe PMF was generated.

We expand upon these studies by\nanalyzing magnetohydrodynamic simulations of molecular clouds, including\nstellar winds, with a range of stellar mass-loss rates and magnetic field\nstrengths.

The domains are\nthen either preregistered or published in a DNS blacklist. This process is not\nonly tedious, but can be readily circumvented by malware authors using a large\nnumber of seeds in algorithms with multivariate recurrence properties (e.g.,\nbanjori) or by using a dynamic list of seeds (e.g., bedep). Another technique\nto stop malware from using DGAs is to intercept DNS queries on a network and\npredict whether domains are DGA generated. Such a technique will alert network\nadministrators to the presence of malware on their networks.

Mulmuley and Sohoni (Siam J Comput 2001, 2008)\nintroduced geometric complexity theory, an approach to study this and related\nproblems via algebraic geometry and representation theory. Their approach works\nby multiplying the permanent polynomial with a high power of a linear form (a\nprocess called padding) and then comparing the orbit closures of the\ndeterminant and the padded permanent. This padding was recently used heavily to\nshow no-go results for the method of shifted partial derivatives (Efremenko,\nLandsberg, Schenck, Weyman, 2016) and for geometric complexity theory\n(Ikenmeyer Panova, FOCS 2016 and B\\\"urgisser, Ikenmeyer Panova, FOCS 2016).\nFollowing a classical homogenization result of Nisan (STOC 1991) we replace the\ndeterminant in geometric complexity theory with the trace of a variable matrix\npower. This gives an equivalent but much cleaner homogeneous formulation of\ngeometric complexity theory in which the padding is removed. This radically\nchanges the representation theoretic questions involved to prove complexity\nlower bounds. We prove that in this homogeneous formulation there are no orbit\noccurrence obstructions that prove even superlinear lower bounds on the\ncomplexity of the permanent. This is the first no-go result in geometric\ncomplexity theory that rules out superlinear lower bounds in some model.\nInterestingly---in contrast to the determinant---the trace of a variable matrix\npower is not uniquely determined by its stabilizer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2016 22:06:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 14:12:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-27"}

Many models such\nas SVM, random forest, and deep neural nets have been proposed and achieved\ngreat success. However, what emerges as missing in many applications is\nactionability, i.e., the ability to turn prediction results into actions. For\nexample, in applications such as customer relationship management, clinical\nprediction, and advertisement, the users need not only accurate prediction, but\nalso actionable instructions which can transfer an input to a desirable goal\n(e.g., higher profit repays, lower morbidity rates, higher ads hit rates).\nExisting effort in deriving such actionable knowledge is few and limited to\nsimple action models which restricted to only change one attribute for each\naction. The dilemma is that in many real applications those action models are\noften more complex and harder to extract an optimal solution.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approach that achieves actionability by\ncombining learning with planning, two core areas of AI. In particular, we\npropose a framework to extract actionable knowledge from random forest, one of\nthe most widely used and best off-the-shelf classifiers.

Technically, the SOAP problem is formulated in the SAS+ planning\nformalism, and solved using a Max-SAT based approach.

The problem is important for two reasons.\nFirst, it is commonplace to perform data mining tasks such as clustering and\nclassification of network attributes (attributes of the nodes, including social\nmedia posts). Furthermore, the extraordinarily large size of real-world\nnetworks necessitates that we work with a smaller graph sample. Second, while\nrandom sampling will provide an unbiased estimate of content, random access is\noften unavailable for many networks. Hence, network samplers such as Snowball\nsampling, Forest Fire, Random Walk, Metropolis-Hastings Random Walk are widely\nused; however, these attribute-agnostic samplers were designed to capture\nsalient properties of network structure, not node content. The latter is\ncritical for clustering and classification tasks. There are three contributions\nof this paper.

Second, we prove that these samplers have a\nbias towards capturing new content, and are equivalent to uniform sampling in\nthe limit.

We consider the special case of two\ndifferent edge weights $1$ and $k$ and prove that the problem remains hard even\nin this case. We prove a lower bound of $11/9$ on the competitive ratio of any\ndeterministic strategy for exploring a ladder graph and complement this result\nby a $4$-competitive algorithm. All of these results hold for undirected\ngraphs. Exploring directed graphs, where the direction of the edges is not\nknown beforehand, seems to be much harder. Here, we prove that a natural greedy\nstrategy has a linear lower bound on the competitive ratio both in ladders and\nsquare grids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2016 09:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-04"}

The summation-by-parts (SBP) property, which\ncertain finite-difference and discontinuous Galerkin methods have, finds\nsuccess for the numerical approximation of hyperbolic conservation laws,\nbecause the proofs of energy stability and conservation can discretely mimic\nthe continuous analysis of partial differential equations. In addition, SBP\nmethods can be developed with high-order accuracy, which is useful for\nsimulations that contain multiple spatial and temporal scales.

A\ncharacterization of local commutative rings for which each ideal is quasi-flat\n(resp. quasi-projective) is given. It is also proven that each commutative ring\nR whose finitely generated ideals are quasi-flat is of $\\lambda$-dimension\n$\\le$ 3, and this dimension $\\le$ 2 if R is local. This extends a former result\nabout the class of arithmetical rings. Moreover, if R has a unique minimal\nprime ideal then its finitely generated ideals are quasi-projective if they are\nquasi-flat. In [1] Abuhlail, Jarrar and Kabbaj studied the class of commutative\nfqp-rings (finitely generated ideals are quasi-projective). They proved that\nthis class of rings strictly contains the one of arithmetical rings and is\nstrictly contained in the one of Gaussian rings. It is also shown that the\nproperty for a commutative ring to be fqp is preserved by localization. It is\nknown that a commutative ring R is arithmetical (resp. Gaussian) if and only if\nR M is arithmetical (resp. Gaussian) for each maximal ideal M of R. But an\nexample given in [6] shows that a commutative ring which is a locally fqp-ring\nis not necessarily a fqp-ring. So, in this cited paper the class of fqf-rings\nis introduced. Each local commutative fqf-ring is a fqp-ring, and a commutative\nring is fqf if and only if it is locally fqf. These fqf-rings are defined in\n[6] without a definition of quasi-flat modules. Here we propose a definition of\nthese modules and another definition of fqf-ring which is equivalent to the one\ngiven in [6]. We also introduce the module property of self-flatness. Each\nquasi-flat module is self-flat but we do not know if the converse holds. On the\nother hand, each flat module is quasi-flat and any finitely generated module is\nquasi-flat if and only if it is flat modulo its annihilator. In Section 2 we\ngive a complete characterization of local commutative rings for which each\nideal is self-flat. These rings R are fqp and their nilradical N is the subset\nof zerodivisors of R. In the case where R is not a chain ring for which N = N 2\nand R N is not coherent every ideal is flat modulo its annihilator. Then in\nSection 3 we deduce that any ideal of a chain ring (valuation ring) R is\nquasi-projective if and only if it is almost maximal and each zerodivisor is\nnilpotent. This complete the results obtained by Hermann in [11] on valuation\ndomains. In Section 4 we show that each commutative fqf-ring is of\n$\\lambda$-dimension $\\le$ 3. This extends the result about arithmetical rings\nobtained in [4]. Moreover it is shown that this $\\lambda$-dimension is $\\le$ 2\nin the local case.

We specialize this model to a group decision scenario where\nprivate observations are received at the beginning, and agents aim to take the\nbest action given the aggregate observations of all group members. We study the\nimplications of the information structure together with the properties of the\nprobability distributions which determine the structure of the so-called\n\"Bayesian heuristics\" that the agents follow in our model.

The DNA-marker method, applied to a metagenome, also\ngives its spectrum, which, obviously, represents the union of the spectra of\nall genomes belonging to the metagenome. Thus each primer provides a projection\nof the genomes and of the metagenome onto the corresponding spectra set. Here\nwe propose to apply the random projection (random primer) approach for\nanalyzing metagenome composition and present some estimates of the method\neffectiveness for the case of Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)\ntechnology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Nov 2016 18:43:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-04"}

The quantitative problem\n(probabilistic termination) asks for bounds on the termination probability. A\nfundamental and conceptual drawback of the existing approaches to address\nprobabilistic termination is that even though the supermartingales consider the\nprobabilistic behavior of the programs, the invariants are obtained completely\nignoring the probabilistic aspect.\n  In this work we address the probabilistic termination problem for\nlinear-arithmetic probabilistic programs with nondeterminism.

Moreover, some degenerate spaces appear naturally in the picture,\nnamely the co-Euclidean space (the space of hyperplanes of the Euclidean\nspace), and the co-Minkowski space (that we will restrict to the space of\nspace-like hyperplanes of Minkowski space), first because of duality reasons,\nand second because they appear as limits of degeneration of classical spaces.\nIn fact, co-Minkowski space recently regained interest under the name half-pipe\ngeometry.

We modeled a 2-dimensional disk with a steady accretion flow onto the\ncentral star and embed a Jupiter mass planet at 5.2 au. The disk is locally\nisothermal and viscosity is modeled using a constant $\\alpha$. The planet is\nheld on a fixed orbit for a few hundred orbits to allow the disk to adapt and\ncarve a gap. After this period, the planet is released and free to move\naccording to the gravitational interaction with the gas disk. The mass\naccretion onto the planet is modeled by removing a fraction of gas from the\ninner Hill sphere, and the removed mass and momentum can be added to the\nplanet. Our results show that a fast migrating planet is able to accrete more\ngas than a slower migrating planet. Utilizing a tracer fluid we analyzed the\norigin of the accreted gas which comes predominantly originating from the inner\ndisk for a fast migrating planet. In case of slower migration the fraction of\ngas from the outer disk increases. We also found that even for very high\naccretion rates in some cases gas crosses the planetary gap from the inner to\nthe outer disk. Our simulations show that the crossing of gas changes during\nthe migration process as the migration rate slows down. Therefore classical\ntype II migration where the planet migrates with the viscous drift rate and no\ngas crosses the gap is no general process but may only occur for special\nparameters and at a certain time during the orbital evolution of the planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2016 15:48:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

We used\nHerschel Space Observatory far-infrared and submillimeter observations of H2O\nand OH rotational lines in Arp 299A to create a multi-component model of the\ngalaxy. In doing this, we employed a spherically symmetric radiative transfer\ncode. Results. Nine H2O lines in absorption and eight in emission as well as\nfour OH doublets in absorption and one in emission, are detected in Arp 299A.\nNo lines of the 18O isotopologues, which have been seen in compact obscured\nnuclei of other galaxies, are detected. The absorption in the ground state OH\ndoublet at 119 {\\mu}m is found redshifted by ~175 km/s compared to other OH and\nH2O lines, suggesting a low excitation inflow. We find that at least two\ncomponents are required in order to account for the excited molecular line\nspectrum. The inner component has a radius of 20-25 pc, a very high infrared\nsurface brightness (> 3e13 Lsun/kpc^2), warm dust (Td > 90 K), and a large H2\ncolumn density (NH2 > 1e24 cm^-2).

Conclusions. The Compton-thick nature of the core makes it difficult to\ndetermine the nature of the buried power source, but the high surface\nbrightness indicates that it is either an active galactic nucleus and/or a\ndense nuclear starburst. The high OH/H2O ratio in the nucleus indicates that\nion-neutral chemistry induced by X-rays or cosmic-rays is important. Finally we\nfind a lower limit to the 16O/18O ratio of 400 in the nuclear region, possibly\nindicating that the nuclear starburst is in an early evolutionary stage, or\nthat it is fed through a molecular inflow of, at most, solar metallicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2016 15:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

We study\nthe properties of groups and their central galaxies in different large-scale\nenvironments defined by the luminosity density field and the cosmic web\nfilaments. We use the luminosity density field constructed using 8 Mpc/h\nsmoothing to characterize the large-scale environments and the Bisous model to\nextract the filamentary structures in different large-scale environments. We\nfind differences in the properties of central galaxies and their groups in and\noutside of filaments at fixed halo and large-scale environments. In\nhigh-density environments, the group mass function has higher number densities\nin filaments compared to that outside of filaments towards the massive end. The\nrelation is opposite in low-density environments. At fixed group mass and\nlarge-scale luminosity density, groups in filaments are slightly more luminous\nand their central galaxies have redder colors, higher stellar masses, and lower\nspecific star formation rates than those outside of filaments. However, the\ndifferences in central galaxy and group properties in and outside of filaments\nare not clear in some group mass bins. We show that the differences in central\ngalaxy properties are due to the higher abundances of elliptical galaxies in\nfilaments. Filamentary structures in the cosmic web are not simply visual\nassociations of galaxies, but rather play an important role in shaping the\nproperties of groups and their central galaxies. The differences in central\ngalaxy and group properties in and outside of cosmic web filaments are not\nsimple effects related to large-scale environmental density. The results point\ntowards an efficient mechanism in cosmic web filaments which quench star\nformation and transform central galaxy morphology from late to early types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Nov 2016 15:59:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

The present study details the complete\nformulation of such a generative model intended to probe visual motion\nperception with a dynamic texture model. It is first derived in a set of\naxiomatic steps constrained by biological plausibility. We extend previous\ncontributions by detailing three equivalent formulations of this texture model.\nFirst, the composite dynamic textures are constructed by the random aggregation\nof warped patterns, which can be viewed as 3D Gaussian fields. Secondly, these\ntextures are cast as solutions to a stochastic partial differential equation\n(sPDE). This essential step enables real time, on-the-fly texture synthesis\nusing time-discretized auto-regressive processes. It also allows for the\nderivation of a local motion-energy model, which corresponds to the\nlog-likelihood of the probability density. The log-likelihoods are essential\nfor the construction of a Bayesian inference framework. We use the dynamic\ntexture model to psychophysically probe speed perception in humans using\nzoom-like changes in the spatial frequency content of the stimulus. The human\ndata replicates previous findings showing perceived speed to be positively\nbiased by spatial frequency increments. A Bayesian observer who combines a\nGaussian likelihood centered at the true speed and a spatial frequency\ndependent width with a \"slow speed prior\" successfully accounts for the\nperceptual bias. More precisely, the bias arises from a decrease in the\nobserver's likelihood width estimated from the experiments as the spatial\nfrequency increases.
