Approximate\ncomputation returns an approximate output for a job instead of the exact\noutput.\n  Both paradigms rely on computing over a subset of data items instead of\ncomputing over the entire dataset, but they differ in their means for skipping\nparts of the computation.

Despite the importance of\nheterogeneous ice nucleation to a variety of fields, from cloud science to\nmicrobiology, major gaps in our understanding of this ubiquitous process still\nprevent us from answering this question. In this work, we have examined the\nability of generic crystalline substrates to promote ice nucleation as a\nfunction of the hydrophobicity and the morphology of the surface. Nucleation\nrates have been obtained by brute-force molecular dynamics simulations of\ncoarse-grained water on top of different surfaces of a model fcc crystal,\nvarying the water-surface interaction and the surface lattice parameter. It\nturns out that the lattice mismatch of the surface with respect to ice,\ncustomarily regarded as the most important requirement for a good ice\nnucleating agent, is at most desirable but not a requirement. On the other\nhand, the balance between the morphology of the surface and its hydrophobicity\ncan significantly alter the ice nucleation rate and can also lead to the\nformation of up to three different faces of ice on the same substrate. We have\npinpointed three circumstances where heterogeneous ice nucleation can be\npromoted by the crystalline surface: (i) the formation of a water overlayer\nthat acts as an in-plane template; (ii) the emergence of a contact layer\nbuckled in an ice-like manner; and (iii) nucleation on compact surfaces with\nvery high interaction strength.

Reusing the learned mapping to\nproject target videos into an embedding space thus allows novel-classes to be\nrecognised by nearest neighbour inference.

In this paper we\npropose a simple scheme to predict \\emph{band alignment }and \\emph{charge\ntransfer} in complex oxide interfaces. For semiconductor heterostructures band\nalignment rules like the well known Anderson or Schottky-Mott rule are based on\ncomparison of the work function or electron affinity of the bulk components.\nThis scheme breaks down for oxides due to the invalidity of a single\nworkfunction approximation as recently shown (Phys. Rev. B 93, 235116; Adv.\nFunct. Mater. 26, 5471). Here we propose a new scheme which is built on a\ncontinuity condition of valence states originating in the compounds' shared\nnetwork of oxygen. It allows for the prediction of sign and relative amplitude\nof the intrinsic charge transfer, taking as input only information about the\nbulk properties of the components. We support our claims by numerical density\nfunctional theory simulations as well as (where available) experimental\nevidence. Specific applications include i) controlled doping of SrTiO$_3$\nlayers with the use of 4$d$ and 5$d$ transition metal oxides and ii) the\ncontrol of magnetic ordering in manganites through tuned charge transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2016 09:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-07"}

Specifically, we\ncombine two sorts of service messages, and serve them simultaneously: one\nmulticast message intended for both receivers and one confidential message\nintended for only one receiver. The confidential message is kept perfectly\nsecure from the unauthorized receiver. Due to the coupling of service messages,\nit is intractable to seek capacity-achieving transmit covariance matrices.\nAccordingly, we propose a suboptimal precoding scheme based on the generalized\nsingular value decomposition (GSVD). The GSVD produces several virtual\northogonal subchannels between the transmitter and the receivers. Subchannel\nallocation and power allocation between multicast message and confidential\nmessage are jointly optimized to maximize the secrecy rate in this letter,\nsubject to the quality of multicast service (QoMS) constraints. Since this\nproblem is inherently complex, a difference-of-concave (DC) algorithm, together\nwith an exhaustive search, is exploited to handle the power allocation and\nsubchannel allocation, respectively. Numerical results are presented to\nillustrate the efficacy of our proposed strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2016 09:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-29"}

In this paper, we present\na simple mathematical formulation to describe the little penguins parade in\nPhillip Island. We observed that penguins have the tendency to waddle back and\nforth on the shore to create a sufficiently large group and then walk home\ncompactly together. The mathematical framework that we introduce describes this\nphenomenon, by taking into account \"natural parameters\" such as the eye-sight\nof the penguins, their cruising speed and the possible \"fear\" of animals. On\nthe one hand, this favors the formation of conglomerates of penguins that\ngather together, but, on the other hand, this may lead to the \"panic\" of\nisolated and exposed individuals. The model that we propose is based on a set\nof ordinary differential equations. Due to the discontinuous behavior of the\nspeed of the penguins, the mathematical treatment (to get existence and\nuniqueness of the solution) is based on a \"stop-and-go\" procedure. We use this\nsetting to provide rigorous examples in which at least some penguins manage to\nsafely return home (there are also cases in which some penguins freeze due to\npanic).

However, considering the wide\nvariety of mathematical properties of Markov chains, there has not been a full\ninvestigation of evolving world economic networks with Markov chain formalism.\nUsing the recently available world input-output database, we modeled the\nevolution of the world economic network from 1995 to 2011 through analysis of a\nseries of finite Markov chains. We assessed different aspects of this evolving\nsystem via different properties of the Markov chains such as mixing time,\nKemeny constant, steady state probabilities and perturbation analysis of the\ntransition matrices. First, we showed how the time series of mixing times and\nKemeny constants could be used as an aggregate index of globalization. Next, we\nfocused on the steady state probabilities as a measure of structural power of\nthe economies that are comparable to GDP shares of economies as the traditional\nindex of economies. Further, we introduced two measures of systemic risk,\ncalled systemic influence and systemic fragility, where the former is the ratio\nof number of influenced nodes to the total number of nodes, caused by a shock\nin the activity of a node and the latter is based on the number of times a\nspecific economic node is affected by a shock in the activity of any of the\nother nodes. Finally, focusing on Kemeny constant as a global indicator of\nmonetary flow across the network, we showed that there is a paradoxical effect\nof a change in activity levels of economic nodes on the overall flow of the\nnetwork. While the economic slowdown of the majority of nodes with high\nstructural power results to a slower average monetary flow over the network,\nthere are some nodes, where their slowdowns improve the overall quality of the\nnetwork in terms of connectivity and the average monetary flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Nov 2016 12:14:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 09:42:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Sep 2017 18:04:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-27"}
