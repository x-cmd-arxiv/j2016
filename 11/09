We present a\nmethod to simulate maps of polarized dust emission on the sphere, similarly to\nwhat is done for the CMB anisotropies. This method builds on the understanding\nof Galactic polarization stemming from the analysis of Planck data. It relates\nthe dust polarization sky to the structure of the Galactic magnetic field and\nits coupling with interstellar matter and turbulence. The Galactic magnetic\nfield is modelled as a superposition of a mean uniform field and a random\ncomponent with a power-law power spectrum of exponent $\\alpha_{\\rm M}$. The\nmodel parameters are constrained to fit the power spectra of dust polarization\nEE, BB and TE measured using Planck data. We find that the slopes of the E and\nB power spectra of dust polarization are matched for $\\alpha_{\\rm M} = -2.5$.\nThe model allows us to compute multiple realizations of the Stokes Q and U maps\nfor different realizations of the random component of the magnetic field, and\nto quantify the variance of dust polarization spectra for any given sky area\noutside of the Galactic plane. The simulations reproduce the scaling relation\nbetween the dust polarization power and the mean total dust intensity including\nthe observed dispersion around the mean relation. We also propose a method to\ncarry out multi-frequency simulations including the decorrelation measured\nrecently by Planck, using a given covariance matrix of the polarization maps.\nThese simulations are well suited to optimize component separation methods and\nto quantify the confidence with which the dust and CMB B-modes can be separated\nin present and future experiments. We also provide an astrophysical perspective\non our modeling of the dust polarization spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 16:00:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2017 17:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-17"}

We construct an ancestry-labeling\nscheme for $n$-node trees with label size $\\log_2 n + O(\\log \\log n)$ bits,\nthus matching the $\\log_2 n + O(\\log \\log n)$ bits lower bound given by Alstrup\net al.

In particular, for the\nset of n-node trees with depth at most d, the simplified ancestry scheme enjoys\nlabel size of $\\log_2 n + 2 \\log_2 d + O(1)$ bits. Since the depth of most XML\ntrees is at most some small constant, such an ancestry scheme may be of\npractical use. In addition, we also obtain an adjacency-labeling scheme that\nlabels n-node trees of depth d with labels of size $\\log_2 n + 3 \\log_2 d +\nO(1)$ bits. All our schemes assign the labels in linear time, and guarantee\nthat any query can be answered in constant time.

These are\nthen used in simulations of the combined dynamical and collisional evolution of\ncomets in order to study the survival probability of a primordially formed\nobject with a shape like 67P/C-G. The effects of impacts on comet 67P/C-G are\nstudied using a SPH shock physics code. The resulting critical specific impact\nenergy defines a minimal projectile size which is used to compute the number of\nshape-changing collisions in a set of dynamical simulations. These simulations\nfollow the dispersion of the trans-Neptunian disk during the giant planet\ninstability, the formation of a scattered disk, and produce 87 objects that\npenetrate into the inner solar system with orbits consistent with the observed\nJFC population.

This type of customer routing\nin queueing networks arises very naturally in many application areas (in\nproduction systems, computer- and communication networks, maintenance, etc.).\nIn these networks, the single most important characteristic of the system\nperformance is oftentimes the path time, i.e. the total time spent in the\nsystem by an arbitrary customer traversing a specific path. The current paper\npresents the first HT asymptotic for the path-time distribution in queueing\nnetworks with a roving server under general renewal arrivals.

Existing works consider that a user dynamically chooses the\nstations that cooperate for his/her service, but such assumption often has\npractical limitations. Instead, cooperation groups can be predefined and\nstatic, with nodes linked by fixed infrastructure. To analyze such a potential\nnetwork, we propose a grouping method based on node proximity.

When the node positions follow a Poisson Point Process\n(PPP) the processes of singles and pairs are not Poisson.

Nodes can be colored in such a way that colors\nencode the shared vulnerabilities. Using multiple paths to avoid these\nvulnerabilities can greatly improve network robustness. Color-avoiding\npercolation provides a theoretical framework for analyzing this scenario,\nfocusing on the maximal set of nodes which can be connected via multiple\ncolor-avoiding paths. In this paper we extend the basic theory of\ncolor-avoiding percolation that was published in [Krause et. al., Phys. Rev. X\n6 (2016) 041022]. We explicitly account for the fact that the same particular\nlink can be part of different paths avoiding different colors. This fact was\npreviously accounted for with a heuristic approximation. We compare this\napproximation with a new, more exact theory and show that the new theory is\nsubstantially more accurate for many avoided colors. Further, we formulate our\nnew theory with differentiated node functions, as senders/receivers or as\ntransmitters. In both functions, nodes can be explicitly trusted or avoided.\nWith only one avoided color we obtain standard percolation. With one by one\navoiding additional colors, we can understand the critical behavior of color\navoiding percolation. For heterogeneous color frequencies, we find that the\ncolors with the largest frequencies control the critical threshold and\nexponent. Colors of small frequencies have only a minor influence on color\navoiding connectivity, thus allowing for approximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 17:26:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-23"}

CXPs operate on slices of ISP networks and are built on\nbasic Software Defined Networking (SDN) principles, such as the clean\ndecoupling of the routing control plane from the data plane and the consequent\nlogical centralization of control. The main goal of the architectural model is\nto provide e2e services with QoS constraints across domains.

For this reason, going to a larger scale requires new arguments\nthat were not necessary in our previous eigensystem multiscale analysis for the\nAnderson model at high disorder, where in a given scale we have decay for all\neigenfunctions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 18:42:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

We show that instantaneous\nmasses and maximum circular velocities of individual subhaloes are extremely\nnoisy, despite the use of a sophisticated, phase-space-based halo finder. We\nalso show that subhaloes experience frequent penetrating encounters with other\nsubhaloes (on average about one per dynamical time), and that subhaloes whose\napo-center lies outside the virial radius of their host (the 'ejected' or\n'backsplash' haloes) experience tidal forces that modify their orbits.

In addition, we show that there are\nthree distinct disruption channels; one in which subhaloes drop below the mass\nresolution limit of the simulation, one in which subhaloes merge with their\nhost halo largely driven by dynamical friction, and one in which subhaloes\nabruptly disintegrate.

It is widely known that for many of the classic distributed graph\nproblems (including maximal independent set (MIS) and $(\\Delta+1)$-vertex\ncoloring), the randomized complexity is at most polylogarithmic in the size $n$\nof the network, while the best deterministic complexity is typically\n$2^{O(\\sqrt{\\log n})}$. Understanding and narrowing down this exponential gap\nis considered to be one of the central long-standing open questions in the area\nof distributed graph algorithms. We investigate the problem by introducing a\ncomplexity-theoretic framework that allows us to shed some light on the role of\nrandomness in the LOCAL model. We define the SLOCAL model as a sequential\nversion of the LOCAL model. Our framework allows us to prove completeness\nresults with respect to the class of problems which can be solved efficiently\nin the SLOCAL model, implying that if any of the complete problems can be\nsolved deterministically in $\\log^{O(1)} n$ rounds in the LOCAL model, we can\ndeterministically solve all efficient SLOCAL-problems (including MIS and\n$(\\Delta+1)$-coloring) in $\\log^{O(1)} n$ rounds in the LOCAL model.

The model is a\ngeneralization of the minimal gauged U(1)$_{B-L}$ (baryon number minus lepton\nnumber) extension of the SM, in which the extra U(1)$_X$ gauge symmetry is\nexpressed as a linear combination of the SM U(1)$_Y$ and U(1)$_{B-L}$ gauge\nsymmetries.

In the\neigenstate-marking problem (EMP), the goal is to implement a selective phase\ntransformation of the $|\\psi\\rangle$ state (known as \\emph{marking} the\n$|\\psi\\rangle$ state in the language of the quantum search algorithms). The EMP\nfinds important applications in the construction of several quantum algorithms.\nThe best known algorithm for the EMP combines the ideas of the phase estimation\nalgorithm and the majority-voting. It uses $\\Theta(\\frac{1}{\\Delta}\\ln\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$ applications of $U$ where $\\epsilon$ is the tolerable\nerror.

In the case of\nmajority-voting, these ancilla qubits were needed to do controlled\ntransformations which are harder to implement physically. Using fixed-point\nquantum search, we get rid off these $\\Theta\\left(\\ln\n\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right)$ ancilla qubits and same number of controlled\ntransformations. Thus we get a much simpler algorithm for marking the unknown\neigenstates. However, the required number of applications of $U$ increases by\nthe factor of $\\Theta \\left(\\ln \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right)$.

We find that\nmatching the observed scatter at z ~ 5.5 requires a short spatially averaged\nmean free path of < 15 comoving Mpc/h, a factor of > 3 shorter than direct\nmeasurements at z ~ 5.2. We argue that such rapid evolution in the mean free\npath is difficult to reconcile with our measurements of the global H I\nphotoionization rate, which stay approximately constant over the interval z ~\n4.8 - 5.5. However, we also show that measurements of the mean free path at z >\n5 are likely biased towards higher values by the quasar proximity effect. This\nbias can reconcile the short values of the mean free path that are required to\nexplain the large scatter in opacities. We discuss the implications of this\nscenario for cosmological reionization. Finally, we investigate whether other\nstatistics applied to the z > 5 Lyman-alpha forest can shed light on the origin\nof the scatter. Compared to a model with a uniform ionizing background, models\nthat successfully account for the scatter lead to enhanced power in the\nline-of-sight flux power spectrum on scales k < 0.1 h/Mpc. We find tentative\nevidence for this enhancement in observations of the high-redshift Lyman-alpha\nforest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 21:00:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2018 07:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-27"}

Our proposed VAE\nmodel allows us to have control over what the global latent code can learn and\n, by designing the architecture accordingly, we can force the global latent\ncode to discard irrelevant information such as texture in 2D images, and hence\nthe VAE only \"autoencodes\" data in a lossy fashion. In addition, by leveraging\nautoregressive models as both prior distribution $p(z)$ and decoding\ndistribution $p(x|z)$, we can greatly improve generative modeling performance\nof VAEs, achieving new state-of-the-art results on MNIST, OMNIGLOT and\nCaltech-101 Silhouettes density estimation tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 21:43:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Mar 2017 06:19:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-07"}

Data values that do not satisfy the given set of constraints are\nflagged as dirty, and data updates are made to re-align the data and the\nconstraints.

Equilibration and\nevection resonance have been put forth as a means of reconciling the models.\nHowever, both were rejected in a meeting at The Royal Society in London. The\nmain concern was that models were multi-staged and too complex. Here, we\npresent initial impact conditions that produce an Earth-Moon system whose\nangular momentum and isotopic properties are correct. The model is\nstraightforward and the results are a natural consequence of the impact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 23:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-10"}

In this work, we are the first to conduct an extensive study of the\ntransferability over large models and a large scale dataset, and we are also\nthe first to study the transferability of targeted adversarial examples with\ntheir target labels. We study both non-targeted and targeted adversarial\nexamples, and show that while transferable non-targeted adversarial examples\nare easy to find, targeted adversarial examples generated using existing\napproaches almost never transfer with their target labels. Therefore, we\npropose novel ensemble-based approaches to generating transferable adversarial\nexamples. Using such approaches, we observe a large proportion of targeted\nadversarial examples that are able to transfer with their target labels for the\nfirst time.

We present the first\nobservation of an occultation by the TNO 2007 UK126 on 15 November 2014,\nmeasured by three observers, one nearly on and two almost symmetrical to the\nshadow's centerline. This is the first multi-chord dataset obtained for a\nso-called detached object, a TNO subgroup with perihelion distances so large\nthat the giant planets have likely not perturbed their orbits. We revisit\nHerschel/PACS far-infrared data, applying a new reduction method to improve the\naccuracy of the measured fluxes. Combining both datasets allows us to\ncomprehensively characterize 2007 UK126. We use error-in-variable regression to\nsolve the non-linear problem of propagating timing errors into uncertainties of\nthe ellipse parameters. Based on the shadow's size and a previously reported\nrotation period, we expect a shape of a Maclaurin spheroid and derive a\ngeometrically plausible size range. To refine our size estimate of 2007 UK126,\nwe model its thermal emission using a thermophysical model code. We conduct a\nparametric study to predict far-infrared fluxes and compare them to the\nHerschel/PACS measurements.

The\ndependence of temperature on resistance (R-T) of a particular sample reveals a\nplethora of information about the electronic properties especially in a unique\nsample like TI where there are two components comprising of an insulating bulk\nand metallic surface states. Depending on the amount of intrinsic doping during\nthe sample formation, the bulk can either couple or remain decoupled with the\nsurface. The former leads to a metallic R-T profile whereas the latter is\ncaptured by an insulating R-T behavior. These two behaviors can be represented\nby series and parallel resistor models respectively.

While the\ncurrent mode-locked laser-based OFC has had great success in extending the\nscientific frontier, its use in real-world applications beyond the laboratory\nsetting remains an unsolved challenge. Microresonator-based OFCs, or Kerr\nfrequency comb, have recently emerged as a candidate solution to the challenge\nbecause of their preferable size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP). On the\nother hand, the current phase stabilization technology requires either external\noptical references or power-demanding nonlinear processes, overturning the SWaP\nbenefit of Kerr frequency combs. Introducing a new concept in phase control,\nhere we report an internally phase stabilized Kerr frequency comb without the\nneed of any optical references or nonlinear processes. We describe the comb\ngeneration analytically with the theory of cavity induced modulation\ninstability, and demonstrate for the first time that the optical frequency can\nbe stabilized by control of two internally accessible parameters: an intrinsic\ncomb offset and the comb spacing. Both parameters are phase locked to microwave\nreferences, with 55 mrad and 20 mrad residual phase noises, and the resulting\ncomb-to-comb frequency uncertainty is 0.08 Hz or less. Out-of-loop measurements\nconfirm good coherence and stability across the comb, with measured optical\nfrequency fractional instabilities of 5x10^-11/sqrt(t). The new phase\nstabilization method preserves the Kerr frequency comb's key advantages and\npotential for chip-scale electronic and photonic integration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2016 09:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-10"}

Indeed, the recent advent of sophisticated and highly effective\ndenoising algorithms lead some to believe that existing methods are touching\nthe ceiling in terms of noise removal performance. Can we leverage this\nimpressive achievement to treat other tasks in image processing? Recent work\nhas answered this question positively, in the form of the Plug-and-Play Prior\n($P^3$) method, showing that any inverse problem can be handled by sequentially\napplying image denoising steps. This relies heavily on the ADMM optimization\ntechnique in order to obtain this chained denoising interpretation.\n  Is this the only way in which tasks in image processing can exploit the image\ndenoising engine? In this paper we provide an alternative, more powerful and\nmore flexible framework for achieving the same goal. As opposed to the $P^3$\nmethod, we offer Regularization by Denoising (RED): using the denoising engine\nin defining the regularization of the inverse problem. We propose an explicit\nimage-adaptive Laplacian-based regularization functional, making the overall\nobjective functional clearer and better defined. With a complete flexibility to\nchoose the iterative optimization procedure for minimizing the above\nfunctional, RED is capable of incorporating any image denoising algorithm,\ntreat general inverse problems very effectively, and is guaranteed to converge\nto the globally optimal result.

Tractable alternatives based on resampling techniques have been\nproposed by the industry, but they lack mathematical foundations.

The purpose of this paper is\nto propose a new method consisting of an appealing compromise: we start from a\nstochastic intensity approach and end up with a pricing problem where WWR does\nnot enter the picture explicitly.

This model is\nanalogous with the theory of solar flares and coronal mass ejection in solar\nphysics. In the model, magnetic field loops emerge from the accretion flow onto\nSgr A$^\\star$ and are twisted to form flux ropes because of shear and\nturbulence. The magnetic energy is also accumulated in this process until a\nthreshold is reached. This then results in a catastrophic evolution of a flux\nrope with the help of magnetic reconnection in the current sheet. In this\ncatastrophic process, the magnetic energy is partially converted into the\nenergy of non-thermal electrons. We have quantitatively calculated the\ndynamical evolution of the height, size, and velocity of the flux rope, as well\nas the magnetic field in the flare regions, and the energy distribution of\nrelativistic electrons in this process. We further calculate the synchrotron\nradiation from these electrons and compare the obtained light curves with the\nobserved ones.

Conventionally, CF is characterized by fluorometers,\nwhich only allows ensemble measurement through wide-field detection. For\nimaging fluorometers, the typical spatial and temporal resolutions are on the\norder of millimeter and second, far from enough to study cellular/sub-cellular\nCF dynamics. In addition, due to the lack of optical sectioning capability,\nconventional imaging fluorometers cannot identify CF from a single cell or even\na single chloroplast. Here we demonstrated a novel fluorometer based on\nconfocal imaging, that not only provides high contrast images, but also allows\nCF measurement with spatiotemporal resolution as high as micrometer and\nmillisecond. CF transient (the Kautsky curve) from a single chloroplast is\nsuccessfully obtained, with both the temporal dynamics and the intensity\ndependences corresponding well to the ensemble measurement from conventional\nstudies. The significance of confocal imaging fluorometer is to identify the\nvariation among individual chloroplasts, e.g. the half-life period of the slow\ndecay in the Kautsky curve, that is not possible to analyze with wide-field\ntechniques. A linear relationship is found between excitation Intensity and the\ntemporal positions of peaks/valleys in the Kautsky curve. In addition, an\ninteresting 6-order increase in excitation intensity is found between\nwide-field and confocal fluorometers, whose pixel integration time and optical\nsectioning may account for this substantial difference.

The search algorithms use minimal\nassumptions on the signal morphology, so they are sensitive to a wide range of\nsources emitting gravitational waves. The analyses target transient signals\nwith duration ranging from milliseconds to seconds over the frequency band of\n32 to 4096 Hz. The first observed gravitational-wave event, GW150914, has been\ndetected with high confidence in this search; other known gravitational-wave\nevents fall below the search's sensitivity. Besides GW150914, all of the search\nresults are consistent with the expected rate of accidental noise coincidences.\nFinally, we estimate rate-density limits for a broad range of non-BBH transient\ngravitational-wave sources as a function of their gravitational radiation\nemission energy and their characteristic frequency. These rate-density\nupper-limits are stricter than those previously published by an\norder-of-magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2016 15:18:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

The advantage of the semi-linear system is that the\nnonlinearity in the convection term is pushed towards the source term on right\nhand side which can be handled with ease. Six symmetric discrete velocity\nmodels are introduced in two dimensions which symmetrically spread foot of the\ncharacteristics in all four quadrants thereby taking information symmetrically\nfrom all directions.

Multiscale\ncomputing patterns should lead to a separation of concerns, whereby application\ndevelopers can compose multiscale models and execute multiscale simulations,\nwhile pattern software realises optimized, fault tolerant and energy aware\nmultiscale computing. We introduce three multiscale computing patterns, present\nan example of the extreme scaling pattern, and discuss our vision of how this\nmay shape multiscale computing in the exascale era.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2016 12:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-09"}

On the one hand, oil and gas resources can be\nexploited much easier than before. Thus, one can already observe discussions on\ndisputed shelf zones where the deposits are located. On the other hand, oil and\ngas excavation leads to serious potential threats to fishing by changing\nnatural habitats which in turn can create serious damage to the economies of\nsome countries in the region. Another set of problems arises due to the\nextension of navigable season for Arctic Shipping Routes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2016 14:26:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-26"}
