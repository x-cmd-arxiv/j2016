This approach uses unlabeled documents\nalong with a word translation oracle to automatically induce task specific,\ncross-lingual correspondences.

For simplicity, however, it assumes\nthat the word translation oracle maps each pivot feature in source language to\nexactly only one word in target language.

On the other hand,\noptical sensors are very fast in detection of gases and more precise and can be\neasily employed in various environments like boreholes and soils. In this\nstudy, we report development of an optical sensor that is methane specific,\nfast for real time applications and has tremendous application potential in the\nexploration of coal bed methane and other hydrocarbon reserves with methane as\na major constituent.

Most of the contemporary\ntwo dimensional (2D) codes are unable to detect multipacting in the elliptical\ncavities because they use a simplistic secondary emission model, where a\nconstant value of emission kinetic energy of secondary electrons is assumed.\nSome three-dimensional (3D) codes, which use a more realistic and sophisticated\nsecondary emission model (Furman model) by following a probability distribution\nfor the emission kinetic energy of secondary electrons, are able to correctly\npredict the occurance of multipacting.

For gyros attached to\nstationary observers that move with non-zero angular velocity $\\Omega$, this\ndivergence at the ergosurface can be avoided. Specifically, for such gyros, the\nprecession frequencies diverge on the event horizon of a BH, but are finite and\nregular for NS everywhere except at the singularity itself. Therefore a genuine\ndetection of the event horizon becomes possible in this case. We also show that\nfor a near-extremal NS ($1<a_* < 1.1$), characteristic features appear in the\nradial profiles of the precession frequency, using which we can further\ndistinguish a near-extremal NS from a BH, or even from NS with larger angular\nmomentum. We then investigate the Lense-Thirring (LT) precession or nodal plane\nprecession frequency of the accretion disk around a BH and NS to show that\nclear distinctions exist for these configurations in terms of radial variation\nfeatures. The LT precession in equatorial circular orbits increases with\napproach to a BH, whereas for NS it increases, attains a peak and then\ndecreases. Interestingly, for $a_*=1.089$, it decreases until it vanishes at a\ncertain radius, and acquires negative values for $a_* > 1.089$ for a certain\nrange of $r$. For $1<a_*<1.089$, a peak appears, but the LT frequency remains\npositive definite. There are important differences in accretion disk LT\nfrequencies for BH and NS and since LT frequencies are intimately related to\nobserved QPOs, these features might allow us to determine whether a given\nrotating compact astrophysical object is BH or NS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2016 08:43:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 14:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-14"}

We theoretically analyze the following situation. Rigid spherical\ninclusions are enclosed by a homogeneous elastic medium under stick boundary\nconditions. Forces and torques are directly imposed from outside onto the\ninclusions, or are externally induced between them. The inclusions respond to\nthese forces and torques by translations and rotations against the surrounding\nelastic matrix. This leads to elastic matrix deformations, and in turn results\nin mutual long-ranged matrix-mediated interactions between the inclusions.\nAdapting a well-known approach from low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics, we\nexplicitly calculate the displacements and rotations of the inclusions from the\nexternally imposed or induced forces and torques. Analytical expressions are\npresented as a function of the inclusion configuration in terms of\ndisplaceability and rotateability matrices. The role of the elastic environment\nis implicitly included in these relations. That is, the resulting expressions\nallow a calculation of the induced displacements and rotations directly from\nthe inclusion configuration, without having to explicitly determine the\ndeformations of the elastic environment.

In this problem, the academic fields are\ndefined as social networks whose nodes are the active institutions within the\nfield, with the most influential nodes representing the highest contributors.\nThe solution is able to provide a ranking of active institutions within their\nspecific domains. The problem statement provided an annual scoring mechanism\nfor institutions based on their publications and encouraged the use of any\npublicly available dataset such as the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG).

This is key to\nenhancing the performance of cloud scheduling and narrowing the performance gap\nbetween cloud service providers and cloud resources consumers/users. The\ncurrent Max-Min algorithm selects tasks with maximum execution time on a faster\navailable machine or resource that is capable of giving minimum completion\ntime.

The drawback of this algorithm is that, the\nexecution of tasks with maximum execution time first may increase the makespan,\nand leads to a delay in executing tasks with minimum execution time if the\nnumber of tasks with maximum execution time exceeds that of tasks with minimum\nexecution time, hence the need to improve it to mitigate the delay in executing\ntasks with minimum execution time.

This distinction is not only prevalent in\nresearch, but also influences how requirements are handled in practice. NFRs\nare usually documented separately from functional requirements, without\nquantitative measures, and with relatively vague descriptions. As a result,\nthey remain difficult to analyze and test. Several authors argue, however, that\nmany so-called NFRs actually describe behavioral properties and may be treated\nthe same way as functional requirements. In this paper, we empirically\ninvestigate this point of view and aim to increase our understanding on the\nnature of NFRs addressing system properties. We report on the classification of\n530 NFRs extracted from 11 industrial requirements specifications and analyze\nto which extent these NFRs describe system behavior. Our results suggest that\nmost \"non-functional\" requirements are not non-functional as they describe\nbehavior of a system. Consequently, we argue that many so-called NFRs can be\nhandled similarly to functional requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2016 15:44:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-29"}

In\ncontrast to previous work that has focused on individual instances as a search\ntarget, we propose the first approach to predict categories and attributes of\nsearch targets based on gaze data. However, state of the art models for\ncategorical recognition, in general, require large amounts of training data,\nwhich is prohibitive for gaze data. To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel Gaze Pooling Layer that integrates gaze information into CNN-based\narchitectures as an attention mechanism - incorporating both spatial and\ntemporal aspects of human gaze behavior. We show that our approach is effective\neven when the gaze pooling layer is added to an already trained CNN, thus\neliminating the need for expensive joint data collection of visual and gaze\ndata. We propose an experimental setup and data set and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method for search target prediction based on gaze\nbehavior. We further study how to integrate temporal and spatial gaze\ninformation most effectively, and indicate directions for future research in\nthe gaze-based prediction of mental states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2016 07:44:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 11:52:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 11:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-04"}
