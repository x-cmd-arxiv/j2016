This study unveils the\ncomplexity of the pairing mechanism due to hydrodynamic interactions. We find\nboth for vesicles and for drops that two particles attract each other and form\na stable pair at weak confinement if their initial separation is below a\ncertain value. If the initial separation is beyond that distance, the particles\nrepel each other and adopt a longer stable interdistance. This means that for\nthe same confinement we have (at least) two stable branches. To which branch a\npair of particles relaxes with time depends only on the initial configuration.\nAn unstable branch is found between these two stable branches. At a critical\nconfinement the stable branch corresponding to the shortest interdistance\nmerges with the unstable branch in the form of a saddle-node bifurcation. At\nthis critical confinement we have a finite jump from a solution corresponding\nto the continuation of the unbounded case to a solution which is induced by the\npresence of walls. The results are summarized in a phase diagram, which proves\nto be of a complex nature. The fact that both vesicles and drops have the same\nqualitative phase diagram points to the existence of a universal behavior,\nhighlighting the fact that with regard to pairing the details of mechanical\nproperties of the deformable particles are unimportant. This offers an\ninteresting perspective for simple analytical modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 16:09:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 16:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

Experimentally synthesized CNTs are generally found\nin bundle geometry with a mixture of different chirality and present a unique\nchallenge to separate them. In this paper we have proposed the PAMAM dendrimer\nto be an ideal candidate for this separation. To estimate efficiency of the\ndendrimer in dispersion of CNTs from the bundle geometry, we have calculated\npotential of mean forces (PMF). Our PMF study of two dendrimer wrapped CNTs\nshows lesser binding affinity compared to the two bare CNTs. PMF study shows\nthat the binding affinity decreases for non-protonated dendrimer and for the\nprotonated case, the interaction is fully repulsive in nature. For both the\nnon-protonated as well as protonated cases, the PMF increases with increasing\ndendrimer generations from 2 to 4 gradually compare to the bare PMF. We have\nperformed PMF calculations with (6,5) and (6,6) chirality to study the\nchirality dependence of PMF. Calculated PMF for protonated dendrimer wrapped\nchiral CNTs is more compared to the protonated dendrimer wrapped armchair CNTs\nfor all the generations studied. However, for non-protonated dendrimer wrapped\nCNTs such chirality dependence is not very prominent. Our study suggests that\nthe dispersion efficiency of protonated dendrimer is more compared to the\nnon-protonated dendrimer and can be used as an effective dispersing agent in\ndispersion of CNT from the bundle geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 16:13:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-14"}

The uniformity and high emission levels suggested that the\nentire wake region had been cleared not only of the ammonia clouds that the\nstorm had generated and exposed, but also of any other aerosols that might\nprovide significant blocking of the thermal emission from Saturn's deeper and\nwarmer atmospheric layers. Our analysis of VIMS wake spectra from December 2012\nprovides no evidence of ammonia ice absorption, but shows that at least one\nsignificant cloud layer remained behind: a non-absorbing layer of 3 - 4 optical\ndepths (at 2 microns) extending from 150 to ~400 mbar. A second layer of\nabsorbing and scattering particles, with less than 1 optical depth and located\nnear 1 bar, is also suggested, but its existence as a model requirement depends\non what value of the He/H2 ratio is assumed. The observations can be fit well\nwith just a single (upper) cloud layer for a He/H2 ratio of 0.064 in\ncombination with a PH3 deep volume mixing ratio of 5 ppm. At lower He/H2\nratios, the observed spectra can be modeled without particles in this region.\nAt higher ratios, in order to fit the brightest wake spectrum, models must\ninclude either significant cloud opacity in this region, or significantly\nincreased absorption by PH3, NH3, and AsH3. As the exceptional horizontal\nuniformity in the late wake is most easily understood as a complete removal of\na deep cloud layer, and after considering independent constraints on trace gas\nmixing ratios, we conclude that the existence of this remarkable wake\nuniformity is most consistent with a He/H2 mixing ratio of 0.055 (+0.010,\n-0.015), which is on the low side of the 0.038 - 0.135 range of previous\nestimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 16:46:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-14"}

This network constitutes the ground for the propagation of\nfinancial distress: equity losses caused by an initial shock with both\nexogenous and endogenous components reverberate within the network and are\namplified through credit and liquidity contagion channels. At the end of the\ndynamics, we determine the vulnerability of each clearing member, which\nrepresents its potential equity loss. We apply the proposed framework to the\nFixed Income asset class of CC&G, the central counterparty operating in Italy\nwhose main cleared securities are Italian Government Bonds. We consider two\ndifferent scenarios: a distributed, plausible initial shock, as well as a shock\ncorresponding to the cover 2 regulatory requirement (the simultaneous default\nof the two most exposed clearing members). Although the two situations lead to\nsimilar results after an unlimited reverberation of shocks on the network, the\ndistress propagation is much more hasty in the latter case, with a large number\nof additional defaults triggered at early stages of the dynamics. Our results\nthus show that setting a default fund to cover insolvencies only on a cover 2\nbasis may not be adequate for taming systemic events, and only very\nconservative default funds, such as CC&G's one, can face total losses due to\nthe shock propagation. Overall, our network-based stress test represents a\nrefined tool for calibrating default fund amounts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 17:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-12-18"}

Several serial\nand parallel augmentation schemes are discussed. A coding gain of $0.3$ dB at a\nBER of $10^{-5}$ can be observed for the same total rate and length.

Previous solutions, such as Secure Sketch and Fuzzy Extractors,\nrely on assumptions that cannot be guaranteed in practice, and often affect the\nauthentication accuracy.\n  In this paper, we introduce HoneyFaces: the concept of adding a large set of\nsynthetic faces (indistinguishable from real) into the biometric \"password\nfile\". This password inflation protects the privacy of users and increases the\nsecurity of the system without affecting the accuracy of the authentication. In\nparticular, privacy for the real users is provided by \"hiding\" them among a\nlarge number of fake users (as the distributions of synthetic and real faces\nare equal). In addition to maintaining the authentication accuracy, and thus\nnot affecting the security of the authentication process, HoneyFaces offer\nseveral security improvements: increased exfiltration hardness, improved\nleakage detection, and the ability to use a Two-server setting like in\nHoneyWords. Finally, HoneyFaces can be combined with other security and privacy\nmechanisms for biometric data.\n  We implemented the HoneyFaces system and tested it with a password file\ncomposed of 270 real users. The \"password file\" was then inflated to\naccommodate up to $2^{36.5}$ users (resulting in a 56.6 TB \"password file\"). At\nthe same time, the inclusion of additional faces does not affect the true\nacceptance rate or false acceptance rate which were 93.33\\% and 0.01\\%,\nrespectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 18:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-14"}

It was introduced by Neuts\n\\cite{Neuts1975} in 1975. The model describes the lifetime distribution of a\nfinite-state absorbing Markov chains, and has found many applications in wide\nrange of areas. It was brought to survival analysis by Aalen \\cite{Aalen1995}\nin 1995. However, the model has lacks of ability in modeling heterogeneity and\ninclusion of past information which is due to the Markov property of the\nunderlying process that forms the model. We attempt to generalize the\ndistribution by replacing the underlying by Markov mixtures process. Markov\nmixtures process was used to model jobs mobility by Blumen \\cite{Blumen} et al.\nin 1955. It was known as the mover-stayer model describing low-productivity\nworkers tendency to move out of their jobs by a Markov chains, while those with\nhigh-productivity tend to stay in the job. Frydman \\cite{Frydman2005} later\nextended the model to a mixtures of finite-state Markov chains moving at\ndifferent speeds on the same state space. In general the mixtures process does\nnot have Markov property. We revisit the mixtures model \\cite{Frydman2005} for\nmixtures of multi absorbing states Markov chains, and propose generalization of\nthe phase-type distribution under competing risks. The new distribution has two\nmain appealing features: it has the ability to model heterogeneity and to\ninclude past information of the underlying process, and it comes in a closed\nform. Built upon the new distribution, we propose conditional forward intensity\nwhich can be used to determine rate of occurrence of future events (caused by\ncertain type) based on available information.

We also introduce an interaction\nterm between the dark matter and dark energy components. Considering that the\nbulk viscosity is proportional to the dark matter energy density and imposing a\ncomplete cosmological dynamics, we find bounds on the bulk viscosity in order\nto reproduce a matter-dominated era (MDE). This constraint is independent of\nthe interaction term. Some late time phantom solutions are mathematically\npossible. However, the constraint imposed by a MDE restricts the interaction\nparameter, in the phantom solutions, to a region consistent with a null value,\neliminating the possibility of late time stable solutions with $w<-1$. From the\ndifferent cases that we study, the only possible scenario, with bulk viscosity\nand interaction term, belongs to the quintessence region. In this latter case,\nwe find bounds on the interaction parameter compatible with latest\nobservational data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 19:52:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-07"}

The success of\nD2D offloading relies on user participation in collaborative service\nprovisioning, which incurs extra costs to users providing the service, thus\nmandating an incentive mechanism that can compensate for these costs. Although\nincentive mechanism design has been intensively studied in the literature, this\npaper considers a much more challenging yet less investigated problem in which\nselfish users are also facing interdependent security risks, such as infectious\nproximity-based attacks. Security cost is significantly different in nature\nfrom conventional service provisioning costs such as energy consumption, since\nsecurity risks often depend on the collective behavior of all users. To this\nend, we build a novel mathematical framework by leveraging the combined power\nof game theory and epidemic theory to investigate the interplay between user\nincentives and interdependent security risks in D2D offloading, thereby\nenabling the design of security-aware incentive mechanisms. Our analysis\ndiscovers an interesting \"less is more\" phenomenon: although giving users more\nincentives promotes more participation, it may harm the network operator's\nutility. This is because too much participation may foster persistent security\nrisks and as a result, the effective participation level does not improve. Our\nmodel and analysis shed new insights on the optimization of D2D offloading\nnetworks in the presence of interdependent security risks. Extensive\nsimulations are carried out to verify our analytical conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 20:22:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 02:40:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-25"}

While the idea of\nlearning cost functions is relatively new to the field of generative modeling,\nlearning costs has long been studied in control and reinforcement learning (RL)\ndomains, typically for imitation learning from demonstrations. In these fields,\nlearning cost function underlying observed behavior is known as inverse\nreinforcement learning (IRL) or inverse optimal control. While at first the\nconnection between cost learning in RL and cost learning in generative modeling\nmay appear to be a superficial one, we show in this paper that certain IRL\nmethods are in fact mathematically equivalent to GANs. In particular, we\ndemonstrate an equivalence between a sample-based algorithm for maximum entropy\nIRL and a GAN in which the generator's density can be evaluated and is provided\nas an additional input to the discriminator. Interestingly, maximum entropy IRL\nis a special case of an energy-based model. We discuss the interpretation of\nGANs as an algorithm for training energy-based models, and relate this\ninterpretation to other recent work that seeks to connect GANs and EBMs. By\nformally highlighting the connection between GANs, IRL, and EBMs, we hope that\nresearchers in all three communities can better identify and apply transferable\nideas from one domain to another, particularly for developing more stable and\nscalable algorithms: a major challenge in all three domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 20:53:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 18:11:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2016 08:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-28"}

The stellar evolution model in EAGLE includes the physics of\nenrichment by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, winds from massive stars,\nand type I and type II supernovae (SNe). In the simulation, star formation in\nyoung MW progenitors is bursty due to efficient stellar feedback, which causes\npoor metal mixing leading to the formation of CEMP stars with extreme abundance\npatterns. In this scenario, two classes of CEMP stars emerge: those mostly\nenriched by low-metallicity type II SNe with low Fe yields that drive galactic\noutflows, and those mostly enriched by AGB stars when a gas-poor progenitor\naccretes pristine gas. The first class resembles CEMP-no stars with high [C/Fe]\nand low [C/O], the second class resembles CEMP-s stars overabundant in\ns-process elements and high values of [C/O]. This scenario explains several\ntrends seen in data: (i) the increase in the scatter and median of [C/O] at low\nand decreasing [O/H], (ii) the trend of stars with very low [Fe/H] or [C/H] to\nbe of type CEMP-no, and (iii) the reduction in the scatter of [{\\alpha}/Fe]\nwith atomic number in metal poor stars. In this interpretation CEMP-no stars\nwere enriched by the stars that enabled galaxies to reionise the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 21:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 13:26:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2017 10:26:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2017 19:08:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-14"}

We study the environmental dependence of gas\naccretion onto galaxies using the cosmological, hydrodynamical EAGLE\nsimulation. We quantify the dependence of gas accretion on stellar mass,\nredshift, and environment, using halo mass and galaxy overdensity as\nenvironmental indicators. We find a strong suppression, by many orders of\nmagnitude, of the gas accretion rate in dense environments, primarily for\nsatellite galaxies. This suppression becomes stronger at lower redshift.\nHowever, the scatter in accretion rates is very large for satellites. This is\n(at least in part) due to the variation in halocentric radius, since gas\naccretion is more suppressed at smaller radii. Central galaxies are influenced\nless strongly by their environment and exhibit less scatter in their gas\naccretion rates. The star formation rates of both centrals and satellites show\nsimilar behaviour to their gas accretion rates. The relatively small\ndifferences between gas accretion and star formation rates demonstrate that\ngalaxies generally exhaust their gas reservoir somewhat faster at higher\nstellar mass, lower redshift, and in denser environments. We conclude that the\nenvironmental suppression of gas accretion could directly result in the\nquenching of star formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 21:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 18:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-31"}

In this paper the author models the approach to\nequilibrium function by a method that allows the physical quantities to be\ndefined beforehand, allows their influence to be studied, and can be used to\npredict how each physical quantity affects approach to equilibrium. Methods: An\nordinary differential equation (ODE) is used to model the approach to\nequilibrium function for the case where collimation is changed at fixed\ndetector size. A parallel model is used to study the approach to equilibrium as\na function of detector size for fixed collimation. Both models are validated by\nexperimental measurements in a 60cm body phantom. Influence of detector size is\nsimulated by using leaded sleeves of varying sizes wrapped around a 100mm\npencil chamber. This creates sleeve gaps of 10 - 60mm around the chamber. A\n100mm detector size is the pencil chamber without a leaded sleeve. Results:\nModel accurately describes the experimental data for the cases studied. Except\nfor the smallest collimation of 5mm, linear regression analysis shows good\ncorrelation between data and model according to the R^2 values at all\ncollimations. Further analysis of the model reveals minimum detector size that\nwill integrate 98% of the signal for a given collimation is, d=4.95L.\nAdditional analysis shows the minimum collimation at which a given detector\nwill collect 98% of the signal is, L=5.49d.

In reality, the\nprocess must be ubiquitous as astrophysical fluids are magnetized and motions\nof fluid elements necessarily entail crossing of magnetic frozen-in field lines\nand magnetic reconnection.

Force matching is a method aimed at constructing reliable and\ntransferable interatomic potentials by matching the forces computed by the\npotential as closely as possible, with those obtained from first principles\ncalculations. The potfit program is an implementation of the force-matching\nmethod that optimizes the potential parameters using a global minimization\nalgorithm followed by a local minimization polish. We extended potfit in two\nways. First, we adapted the code to be compliant with the KIM Application\nProgramming Interface (API) standard (part of the Knowledgebase of Interatomic\nModels Project). This makes it possible to use potfit to fit many KIM potential\nmodels, not just those prebuilt into the potfit code. Second, we incorporated\nthe geodesic Levenberg--Marquardt (LM) minimization algorithm into potfit as a\nnew local minimization algorithm. The extended potfit was tested by generating\na training set using the KIM Environment-Dependent Interatomic Potential (EDIP)\nmodel for silicon and using potfit to recover the potential parameters from\ndifferent initial guesses. The results show that EDIP is a \"sloppy model\" in\nthe sense that its predictions are insensitive to some of its parameters, which\nmakes fitting more difficult. We find that the geodesic LM algorithm is\nparticularly efficient for this case.

This ellipsoidal MPC scheme is based on solving an optimal\ncontrol problem under linear matrix inequality constraints. We illustrate these\nresults with the numerical case study of a spring-mass-damper system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2016 00:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

For the\nLaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_{2}$ sample under HP, as temperature is decreased, the\nupper critical field $H_{onset}$, estimated from the onset of the\nsuperconducting transitions, increases slowly between 4.9 and 5.8 T compared\nwith the slope of $H_{onset}$($T$) below 4.9 T and above 5.8 T. This anomalous\nbehavior reveals a remarkable similarity in superconductivity between\nLaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_{2}$ samples measured under HP and synthesized under\nHP, although the crystal structures of the two samples were reported to be\ndifferent. The experimental results support the idea that local atomic\nenvironment, which can be tuned by applying external pressure and can be\nquenched to ambient pressure via high temperature-pressure annealing, is\npossibly more essential to the enhancement of $T_c$ for BiS$_2$-based\nsuperconductors than the structural phase transition.

This explains why the pressure-induced enhancement of $T_c$ for\nNdO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_{2}$ is not as large as that for\nLaO$_{0.5}$F$_{0.5}$BiS$_{2}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2016 01:05:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

The probability of a successful transplant\ndepends in a very subtle fashion on compatibility between the donor and the\nrecipient but current medical practice is short of domain knowledge regarding\nthe complex nature of recipient-donor compatibility. Hence a data-driven\napproach for learning compatibility has the potential for significant\nimprovements in match quality. This paper proposes a novel system\n(ConfidentMatch) that is trained using data from electronic health records.\nConfidentMatch predicts the success of an organ transplant (in terms of the 3\nyear survival rates) on the basis of clinical and demographic traits of the\ndonor and recipient. ConfidentMatch captures the heterogeneity of the donor and\nrecipient traits by optimally dividing the feature space into clusters and\nconstructing different optimal predictive models to each cluster. The system\ncontrols the complexity of the learned predictive model in a way that allows\nfor assuring more granular and confident predictions for a larger number of\npotential recipient-donor pairs, thereby ensuring that predictions are\n\"personalized\" and tailored to individual characteristics to the finest\npossible granularity. Experiments conducted on the UNOS heart transplant\ndataset show the superiority of the prognostic value of ConfidentMatch to other\ncompeting benchmarks; ConfidentMatch can provide predictions of success with\n95% confidence for 5,489 patients of a total population of 9,620 patients,\nwhich corresponds to 410 more patients than the most competitive benchmark\nalgorithm (DeepBoost).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2016 01:53:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

To answer such queries with high throughput and low latency,\nwe partition the graph and process the data in parallel across a cluster of\nservers. State-of-the-art distributed graph querying systems place each graph\npartition on a separate server, where query answering over that partition takes\nplace. This design has two major disadvantages. First, the router needs to\nmaintain a fixed routing table. Hence, these systems are less flexible with\nrespect to query routing, fault tolerance, and graph updates. Second, the graph\ndata must be partitioned such that the workload across the servers is balanced,\nand the inter-machine communication is minimized. In addition, it is required\nto update the existing partitions based on workload changes over graph nodes.\nHowever, graph partitioning, online monitoring of workloads, and dynamically\nupdating the graph partitions are expensive. In this work, we mitigate both\nthese problems by decoupling graph storage from query processors, and by\ndeveloping smart routing strategies that improve the cache locality in query\nprocessors. Since a query processor is no longer assigned any fixed part of the\ngraph, it is equally capable of handling any request, thus facilitating load\nbalancing and fault tolerance. On the other hand, due to our smart routing\nstrategies, query processors can effectively leverage their cache contents,\nreducing the overall impact of how the graph is partitioned across storage\nservers. A detailed experimental evaluation with several real-world, large\ngraph datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, gRouting - even with\nsimple hash partitioning of the data - achieves up to an order of magnitude\nbetter query throughput compared to existing graph querying systems that employ\nexpensive graph partitioning and re-partitioning strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2016 06:22:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Oct 2017 02:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

The\nliterature on decision making suggests two main hypotheses to account for this\nkind of bias: internal bias signals are derived from (a) the residual of motor\nresponse-related signals, and (b) the sensory information residues of the\ndecisions that we made in the past. Beside these hypotheses, a credible\nhypothesis proposed by this study to explain the cause of decision biasing,\nsuggests that the decision-related neuron can make use of the residual\ninformation of the previous decision for the current decision. We demonstrate\nthe validity of this assumption, first by performing behavioral experiments\nbased on the two-alternative forced-choice (TAFC) discrimination of motion\ndirection paradigms and then, we modified the pure drift-diffusion model (DDM)\nbased on accumulation to the bound mechanism to account for the sequential\neffect. In both cases, the trace of the previous trial influences the current\ndecision. Results indicate that the probability of being correct in a current\ndecision increases if it is in line with the previously made decision. Also,\nthe model that keeps the previous decision information provides a better fit to\nthe behavioral data. Our findings suggest that the state of a decision variable\nwhich is represented in the activity of decision-related neurons after crossing\nthe bound (in the previous decision) can accumulate with the decision variable\nfor the current decision in consecutive trials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2016 07:33:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Oct 2017 11:26:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-17"}

Traditional object detection methods often\nperform worse under unconstrained video environments. To address this problem,\nmany modern approaches model deep hierarchical appearance representations for\nobject detection. Most of these methods require a timeconsuming training\nprocess on large manual labelling sample set. In this paper, the proposed\nframework takes a remarkably different direction to resolve the multi-scene\ndetection problem in a bottom-up fashion. First, a scene-specific objector is\nobtained from a fully autonomous learning process triggered by marking several\nbounding boxes around the object in the first video frame via a mouse. Here the\nhuman labeled training data or a generic detector are not needed. Second, this\nlearning process is conveniently replicated many times in different\nsurveillance scenes and results in particular detectors under various camera\nviewpoints. Thus, the proposed framework can be employed in multi-scene object\ndetection applications with minimal supervision. Obviously, the initial\nscene-specific detector, initialized by several bounding boxes, exhibits poor\ndetection performance and is difficult to improve with traditional online\nlearning algorithm. Consequently, we propose Generative-Discriminative model to\npartition detection response space and assign each partition an individual\ndescriptor that progressively achieves high classification accuracy. A novel\nonline gradual optimized process is proposed to optimize the\nGenerative-Discriminative model and focus on the hard samples.Experimental\nresults on six video datasets show our approach achieves comparable performance\nto robust supervised methods, and outperforms the state of the art\nself-learning methods under varying imaging conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Nov 2016 08:15:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2016 06:07:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 06:17:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2018 01:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-14"}

Our aim is to study the connection between the persistent X-ray\nspectra and the X-ray burst spectra in a broad spectral range. Methods. We\nperformed spectral modeling of the persistent emission and the X-ray burst\nemission of 4U 1728-34 using data from the INTEGRAL JEM-X and IBIS/ISGRI\ninstruments. Results. We constructed a hardness intensity diagram to track\nspectral state variations. In the soft state the energy spectra are\ncharacterized by two thermal components - likely from the accretion disc and\nthe boundary/spreading layer - together with a weak hard X-ray tail that we\ndetect in 4U 1728-34 for the first time in the 40 to 80 keV range. In the hard\nstate the source is detected up to 200 keV and the spectrum can be described by\na thermal Comptonization model plus an additional component: either a powerlaw\ntail or reflection. By stacking 123 X-ray bursts in the hard state, we detect\nemission up to 80 keV during the X-ray bursts. We find that during the bursts\nthe emission above 40 keV decreases by a factor of about three with respect to\nthe persistent emission level. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the\nenhanced X-ray burst emission changes the spectral properties of the accretion\ndisc in the hard state.

For practical use, this paper proposes a novel\nsemi-supervised wrapper method, Dual Teaching, whose assumptions are easy to\nset up. Dual Teaching adopts two external classifiers to estimate the false\npositives and false negatives of the base learner. Only if the recall of every\nexternal classifier is greater than zero and the sum of the precision is\ngreater than one, Dual Teaching will train a base learner from partially\nlabeled data as effectively as the fully-labeled-data-trained classifier.

The laws of\npropagation of electromagnetic disturbances modify Newtonian formalism for\nsufficiently fast free motions within each spatial domain of its validity for\nslow motions and introduce the extended concept of time by uniting those of\nNewtonian which can exist in different spatial domains of their validity.\n  A boost direction for a pair of physical spaces is that spatial direction in\none of the spaces along which the other space moves. Free motions of point\nparticles make an instrumentation for identifying the boost direction as well\nas events on a straight line along that direction. The concept of a boost\ndirection secures the physics-based formulation of the basic relativity\neffects, which eventually results in the relation between two arbitrary spaces\nin terms of their position vectors and time of a given event.\n  The obtained transformation rules for the components of the position vector\ndiffer from the vector-like relationship known in the literature because the\nlatter actually deals with column vectors made of Cartesian coordinates of true\nvectors and appears identical to a coordinate transformation referred to as a\nboost.\n  Within the physics-based approach, the transformation of coordinates implies\nspecifying coordinate systems in each frame in terms of physical\nobjects/directions. This yields a logically consistent and physically\nmeaningful presentation of the coordinate transformations commonly exploited in\nthe special relativity theory, which makes manifestations of those\ntransformations evident. Specifically, for a Cartesian coordinate system\nsubjected to a boost, the coordinate-free technique of reasoning allows one to\nevaluate its apparent distortion easily.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Nov 2016 21:36:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jan 2018 22:30:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-04"}
