Methods: The proton pencil\nbeams of a clinically commissioned proton treatment facility are replicated in\na Monte Carlo simulation system (FLUKA). For each available energy the beam\ndeposition in water medium is characterized by the dose deposition. Using an\nalpha--stable distribution methodology each beam with a nominal energy $E$ is\ncharacterized by the lateral spread at depth $z$: $S(z;\\alpha,\\gamma,E)$ and a\ntotal energy deposition $I_D(z)$. The beams are then described as a function of\nthe variation of the parameters at depth. Finally, an implementation in a\nfreely available open source dose calculation suite (matRad, DKFZ, Heidelberg,\nGermany) is proposed. Results: Quantitatively, the fit of the stable\ndistributions, compared to those implemented in standard treatment planning\nsystems, are equivalent. The efficiency of the representation is better (2\ncompared to 3 and more parameters needed). The meta--parametrization (i.e. the\ndescription of the dose deposition by only providing the fitted parameters)\nallows for interpolation of non--measured data. In the case of the clinical\ndata used in this paper, it was possible to only commission 1 out of 5 nominal\nenergies to obtain a viable data set. Conclusions: Alpha--stable distributions\nare intrinsically suited to describe charged particle pencil beams in a medium\nand can be easily implemented in existing treatment planning systems. The use\nof alpha-distributions can easily be extended to other particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2016 16:19:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-29"}

As the capacity of FPGAs grows, it is increasingly common for\ndesigners to incorporate implementations of algorithms and protocols from a\nrange of third-party sources. The monolithic nature of FPGAs means that all\non-chip circuits, including third party black-box designs, must share common\non-chip infrastructure, such as routing resources.

In this thesis we go beyond MDPs and consider RL in\nenvironments that are non-Markovian, non-ergodic and only partially observable.\nOur focus is not on practical algorithms, but rather on the fundamental\nunderlying problems: How do we balance exploration and exploitation? How do we\nexplore optimally? When is an agent optimal? We follow the nonparametric\nrealizable paradigm.\n  We establish negative results on Bayesian RL agents, in particular AIXI. We\nshow that unlucky or adversarial choices of the prior cause the agent to\nmisbehave drastically. Therefore Legg-Hutter intelligence and balanced Pareto\noptimality, which depend crucially on the choice of the prior, are entirely\nsubjective. Moreover, in the class of all computable environments every policy\nis Pareto optimal. This undermines all existing optimality properties for AIXI.\nHowever, there are Bayesian approaches to general RL that satisfy objective\noptimality guarantees: We prove that Thompson sampling is asymptotically\noptimal in stochastic environments in the sense that its value converges to the\nvalue of the optimal policy. We connect asymptotic optimality to regret given a\nrecoverability assumption on the environment that allows the agent to recover\nfrom mistakes. Hence Thompson sampling achieves sublinear regret in these\nenvironments.\n  Our results culminate in a formal solution to the grain of truth problem: A\nBayesian agent acting in a multi-agent environment learns to predict the other\nagents' policies if its prior assigns positive probability to them (the prior\ncontains a grain of truth). We construct a large but limit computable class\ncontaining a grain of truth and show that agents based on Thompson sampling\nover this class converge to play Nash equilibria in arbitrary unknown\ncomputable multi-agent environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2016 00:36:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-29"}

Especially, we show that the continuous evolution of\nthe charge gap visualized by STM is due to the immersion of the\nlocalized-orbital-induced Hubbard bands into the extended-orbital-spanned Fermi\nsea, featuring a unique evolution from a Mott gap to a charge-transfer gap.\nThis new mechanism of orbital-driven Mottness collapse revealed here suggests\nan interesting route for creating novel electronic state and designing future\nelectronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2016 02:02:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2017 08:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

The new models predict TAMS masses that are\nsignificantly greater than those from equivalent non-magnetic models, reducing\nthe total mass lost by a strongly magnetized 80 Msun star during its main\nsequence evolution by 20 Msun.

Accordingly, the resulting\ngrowth patterns are usually highly branched, fractal structures. However, in\nsome of the unstable growth processes the envelope of the structure grows in a\nhighly regular manner, with the perturbations smoothed out over the course of\ntime. In this paper, we show that the regularity of the envelope growth can be\nconnected to small-scale instabilities leading to the tip splitting of the\nfingers at the advancing front of the structure. Whenever the growth velocity\nbecomes too large, the finger splits into two branches. In this way it can\nabsorb an increased flux and thus damp the instability. Hence, somewhat\ncounterintuitively, the instability at a small scale results in a stability at\na larger scale. The quantitative analysis of these effects is provided by means\nof the Loewner equation, which one can use to reduce the problem of the\ninterface motion to that of the evolution of the conformal mapping onto the\ncomplex plane. This allows an effective analysis of the multifingered growth in\na variety of different geometries.

Long\ntail distribution specifically refers to the fact that a small number of\ngeneric entities appear frequently while other objects far less existing.\nConsidering the existence of long tail distribution of the real world data,\nlarge but uniform distributed data are usually hard to retrieve. Empirical\nexperiences and analysis show that classes with more samples will pose greater\nimpact on the feature learning process and inversely cripple the whole models\nfeature extracting ability on tail part data. Contrary to most of the existing\nworks that alleviate this problem by simply cutting the tailed data for uniform\ndistributions across the classes, this paper proposes a new loss function\ncalled range loss to effectively utilize the whole long tailed data in training\nprocess. More specifically, range loss is designed to reduce overall\nintra-personal variations while enlarging inter-personal differences within one\nmini-batch simultaneously when facing even extremely unbalanced data. The\noptimization objective of range loss is the $k$ greatest range's harmonic mean\nvalues in one class and the shortest inter-class distance within one batch.\nExtensive experiments on two famous and challenging face recognition benchmarks\n(Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) and YouTube Faces (YTF) not only demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach in overcoming the long tail effect\nbut also show the good generalization ability of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2016 03:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-29"}

Recently, convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable\nperformance for classification tasks, but require substantial amounts of\nlabelled training data. This data must sufficiently cover the variability\nexpected to be encountered in the environment. For hyperspectral data, one of\nthe main variations encountered outdoors is due to incident illumination, which\ncan change in spectral shape and intensity depending on the scene geometry. For\nexample, regions occluded from the sun have a lower intensity and their\nincident irradiance skewed towards shorter wavelengths.\n  In this work, a data augmentation strategy based on relighting is used during\ntraining of a hyperspectral convolutional neural network. It allows training to\noccur in the outdoor environment given only a small labelled region, which does\nnot need to sufficiently represent the geometric variability of the entire\nscene. This is important for applications where obtaining large amounts of\ntraining data is labourious, hazardous or difficult, such as labelling pixels\nwithin shadows.

We follow a standard two-step pipeline by first detecting the 2D\nposition of the $N$ body joints, and then using these observations to infer 3D\npose. For the first step, we use a recent CNN-based detector. For the second\nstep, most existing approaches perform 2$N$-to-3$N$ regression of the Cartesian\njoint coordinates. We show that more precise pose estimates can be obtained by\nrepresenting both the 2D and 3D human poses using $N\\times N$ distance\nmatrices, and formulating the problem as a 2D-to-3D distance matrix regression.\nFor learning such a regressor we leverage on simple Neural Network\narchitectures, which by construction, enforce positivity and symmetry of the\npredicted matrices. The approach has also the advantage to naturally handle\nmissing observations and allowing to hypothesize the position of non-observed\njoints. Quantitative results on Humaneva and Human3.6M datasets demonstrate\nconsistent performance gains over state-of-the-art.

This paper discusses\nseveral ways of enhancing the paradigm of bottom-up model generation. The two\nmain contributions are new, generalized blocking techniques and a new\nrange-restriction transformation. The blocking techniques are based on simple\ntransformations of the input set together with standard equality reasoning and\nredundancy elimination techniques. These provide general methods for finding\nsmall, finite models. The range-restriction transformation refines existing\ntransformations to range-restricted clauses by carefully limiting the creation\nof domain terms. All possible combinations of the introduced techniques and\nclassical range-restriction were tested on the clausal problems of the TPTP\nVersion 6.0.0 with an implementation based on the SPASS theorem prover using a\nhyperresolution-like refinement. Unrestricted domain blocking gave best results\nfor satisfiable problems showing it is a powerful technique indispensable for\nbottom-up model generation methods. Both in combination with the new\nrange-restricting transformation, and the classical range-restricting\ntransformation, good results have been obtained. Limiting the creation of terms\nduring the inference process by using the new range restricting transformation\nhas paid off, especially when using it together with a shifting transformation.\nThe experimental results also show that classical range restriction with\nunrestricted blocking provides a useful complementary method. Overall, the\nresults showed bottom-up model generation methods were good for disproving\ntheorems and generating models for satisfiable problems, but less efficient\nthan SPASS in auto mode for unsatisfiable problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2016 07:54:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 22:30:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-01"}

The radially\ncooler populations form a strong bar, and are vertically thin and\npeanut-shaped, while the hotter populations form a weaker bar and become a\nvertically thicker box. We demonstrate that it is the radial, not the vertical,\nvelocity dispersion that dominates this evolution.

It is quite challenging due to the model diversities to\nillustrate varied text effects for different characters. To address this issue,\nour key idea is to exploit the analytics on the high regularity of the spatial\ndistribution for text effects to guide the synthesis process. Specifically, we\ncharacterize the stylized patches by their normalized positions and the optimal\nscales to depict their style elements. Our method first estimates these two\nfeatures and derives their correlation statistically. They are then converted\ninto soft constraints for texture transfer to accomplish adaptive multi-scale\ntexture synthesis and to make style element distribution uniform.

In this paper, we propose an\nunsupervised temporal modeling method that learns from untrimmed videos. The\nspeed of motion varies constantly, e.g., a man may run quickly or slowly. We\ntherefore train a Multirate Visual Recurrent Model (MVRM) by encoding frames of\na clip with different intervals. This learning process makes the learned model\nmore capable of dealing with motion speed variance. Given a clip sampled from a\nvideo, we use its past and future neighboring clips as the temporal context,\nand reconstruct the two temporal transitions, i.e., present$\\rightarrow$past\ntransition and present$\\rightarrow$future transition, reflecting the temporal\ninformation in different views. The proposed method exploits the two\ntransitions simultaneously by incorporating a bidirectional reconstruction\nwhich consists of a backward reconstruction and a forward reconstruction. We\napply the proposed method to two challenging video tasks, i.e., complex event\ndetection and video captioning, in which it achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance.

As a consequence, it is possible to provide\nquantum states for the theory by building separate states on each direct\nsummand.

Stronger\nconvection supports the evolution of more massive organisms.

We show that video popularity prediction based on the\nembed and link data coupled with the internal search and browsing data\nsignificantly improves video popularity prediction based only on the data\nprovided by the video hosting and can even adequately replace the API data in\nthe cases when it is partly or completely unavailable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2016 11:43:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-29"}

Although several background\nsubtraction and foreground detection have been proposed recently, no\ntraditional algorithm today still seem to be able to simultaneously address all\nthe key challenges of illumination variation, dynamic camera motion, cluttered\nbackground and occlusion. This limitation can be attributed to the lack of\nsystematic investigation concerning the role and importance of features within\nbackground modeling and foreground detection.

This paper is based on a detailed\nclassification of quantum states for bipartite systems. States for bipartite\ncomposite systems are categorised in quantum theory as either separable or\nentangled, but the states can also be divided differently into Bell local or\nBell non-local states in terms of local hidden variable theory (LHVT). For the\nBell local states there are three cases depending on whether both, one of or\nneither of the LHVT probabilities for each sub-system are also given by a\nquantum probability involving sub-system density operators. Cases where one or\nboth are given by a quantum probability are known as local hidden states (LHS)\nand such states are non-steerable. The steerable states are the Bell local\nstates where there is no LHS, or the Bell non-local states. The relationship\nbetween the quantum and hidden variable theory classification of states is\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2016 13:13:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 04:38:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2017 04:09:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 05:22:52 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 6 Sep 2019 15:47:18 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2020 01:46:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

Here we show how the\nMaster Stability Function, a celebrated framework for analyzing synchronization\non a single network, can be extended to certain classes of multiplex networks\nwith different intra-layer and inter-layer coupling functions. We derive three\nmaster stability equations that determine respectively the necessary regions of\ncomplete synchronization, intra-layer synchronization and inter-layer\nsynchronization. We calculate these three regions explicitly for the case of a\ntwo-layer network of R{\\\"o}ssler oscillators and show that the overlap of the\nregions determines the type of synchronization achieved. In particular, if the\ninter- or intra-layer coupling function is such that the inter-layer or\nintra-layer synchronization region is empty, complete synchronization cannot be\nachieved regardless of the coupling strength. Furthermore, for any given nodal\ndynamics and network structure, the occurrence of intra-layer and inter-layer\nsynchronization depend mainly on the coupling functions of nodes within a layer\nand across layers, respectively.

No assumptions are made with\nregard to the radial location of the toroidal flux.

In this paper, we investigate\nconvolutional denoising auto-encoders to show that unsupervised pre-training\ncan still improve the performance of high-level image related tasks such as\nimage classification and semantic segmentation. The architecture we use is a\nconvolutional auto-encoder network with symmetric shortcut connections. We\nempirically show that symmetric shortcut connections are very important for\nlearning abstract representations via image reconstruction. When no extra\nunlabeled data are available, unsupervised pre-training with our network can\nregularize the supervised training and therefore lead to better generalization\nperformance. With the help of unsupervised pre-training, our method achieves\nvery competitive results in image classification using very simple\nall-convolution networks. When labeled data are limited but extra unlabeled\ndata are available, our method achieves good results in several semi-supervised\nlearning tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2016 13:56:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2017 14:49:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

Rather\nthan relying on transcripts and subtitles, as has been demonstrated in the\npast, we show how to achieve this goal starting from a set of example images of\neach of the main actors involved, collected from the Internet Movie Database\n(IMDB). The problem then becomes one of domain adaptation: actors' IMDB photos\nare typically taken at awards ceremonies and are quite different from their\nappearances in TV series. In each series as well, there is considerable change\nin actor appearance due to makeup, lighting, ageing, etc. To bridge this gap,\nwe propose a graph-matching based self-labelling algorithm, which we coin HSL\n(Hungarian Self Labeling). Further, we propose a new edge cost to be used in\nthis context, as well as an extension that is more robust to outliers, where\nprototypical faces for each of the actors are selected based on a hierarchical\nclustering procedure. We conduct experiments with 15 episodes from 3 different\nTV series and demonstrate automatic annotation with an accuracy of 90% and up.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2016 15:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-29"}

This set-up is motivated by peak-demand minimization problems in\nsmart grids. Here, the goal is to minimize the peak value over a finite horizon\nwith: (i) the demand at each time instant being the sum of contributions from\ndifferent devices, and (ii) the device states at different time instants being\ncoupled through local constraints (e.g., the dynamics). The min-max structure\nand the double coupling (through the devices and over the time horizon) makes\nthis problem challenging in a distributed set-up (e.g., existing distributed\ndual decomposition approaches cannot be applied). We propose a distributed\nalgorithm based on the combination of duality methods and properties from\nmin-max optimization. Specifically, we repeatedly apply duality theory and\nproperly introduce ad-hoc slack variables in order to derive a series of\nequivalent problems. On the resulting problem we apply a dual subgradient\nmethod, which turns out to be a distributed algorithm consisting of a\nminimization on the original primal variables and a suitable dual update. We\nprove the convergence of the proposed algorithm in objective value. Moreover,\nwe show that every limit point of the primal sequence is an optimal (feasible)\nsolution.

To\nensure that users experience the best Quality of Service (QoS) with respect to\ntheir quality needs, service composition has to be QoS-aware. Establishing\nQoS-aware service compositions entails efficient service selection taking into\naccount the QoS requirements of users. A challenging issue towards this purpose\nis to consider service selection under global QoS requirements (i.e.,\nrequirements imposed by the user on the whole task), which is of high\ncomputational cost. This challenge is even more relevant when we consider the\ndynamics, limited computational resources and timeliness constraints of\nubiquitous environments. To cope with the above challenge, we present QASSA, an\nefficient service selection algorithm that provides the appropriate ground for\nQoS-aware service composition in ubiquitous environments. QASSA formulates\nservice selection under global QoS requirements as a set-based optimisation\nproblem, and solves this problem by combining local and global selection\ntechniques.

Many of these are universally recognized, while there are\ncontroversies regarding the definitions, membership and even the names of some\nsub-classes; we will try to review here the commonly-used nomenclature, noting\nthe main variants when possible. SN Types are defined according to\nobservational properties; mostly visible-light spectra near maximum light, as\nwell as according to their photometric properties. However, a long-term goal of\nSN classification is to associate observationally-defined classes with specific\nphysical explosive phenomena. We show here that this aspiration is now finally\ncoming to fruition, and we establish the SN classification scheme upon direct\nobservational evidence connecting SN groups with specific progenitor stars.\nObservationally, the broad class of Type II SNe contains objects showing strong\nspectroscopic signatures of hydrogen, while objects lacking such signatures are\nof Type I, which is further divided to numerous subclasses. Recently a class of\nsuper-luminous SNe (SLSNe, typically 10 times more luminous than standard\nevents) has been identified, and it is discussed. We end this chapter by\nbriefly describing a proposed alternative classification scheme that is\ninspired by the stellar classification system. This system presents our\nemerging physical understanding of SN explosions, while clearly separating\nrobust observational properties from physical inferences that can be debated.\nThis new system is quantitative, and naturally deals with events distributed\nalong a continuum, rather than being strictly divided into discrete classes.\nThus, it may be more suitable to the coming era where SN numbers will quickly\nexpand from a few thousands to millions of events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2016 18:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-25"}

Its combination with\nnumerical simulations of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence allows the\ndiagnosis of the ICM turbulence. Being the ICM plasma weakly collisional, the\nthermal velocity distribution of the particles naturally develops anisotropies\nas a consequence of the large scale motions and the conservation of the\nmagnetic moment of the charged particles. A previous study (Paper I) analyzed\nthe impact of large scale thermal anisotropy on the statistics of RM maps\nsynthesized from simulations of turbulence; these simulations employed a\ncollisionless MHD model which considered a tensor pressure with uniform\nanisotropy. In the present work, we extend that analysis to a collisionless MHD\nmodel in which the thermal anisotropy develops according to the conservation of\nthe magnetic moment of the thermal particles. We also consider the effect of\nanisotropy relaxation caused by the micro-scale mirror and firehose\ninstabilities. We show that if the relaxation rate is fast enough to keep the\nanisotropy limited by the threshold values of the instabilities, the dispersion\nand power spectrum of the RM maps are indistinguishable from those obtained\nfrom collisional MHD. Otherwise, there is a reduction in the dispersion and\nsteepening of the power spectrum of the RM maps (compared to the collisional\ncase). Considering the first scenario, the use of collisional MHD simulations\nfor modeling the RM statistics in the ICM becomes better justified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2016 20:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-01"}
