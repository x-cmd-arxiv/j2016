The effect, known as the copper-related\nlight-induced degradation (Cu-LID) of Si solar cells, has been connected to the\nrelease of Cu interstitials within the bulk [Solar Energy Materials & Solar\nCells, 147:115-126, 2016]. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive analysis\nof the formation/dissociation process of the CuB pair in Si by means of\nfirst-principles modelling, as well as the interaction of CuB defects with\nphoto-excited minority carriers. We confirm that the long-range interaction\nbetween the Cu cation and the B anion has a Coulomb-like behaviour, in line\nwith the trapping-limited diffusivity of Cu observed by transient ion drift\nmeasurements. On the other hand, the short-range interaction between the\nd-electrons of Cu and the excess of negative charge on B produces a repulsive\neffect, thereby decreasing the binding energy of the pair when compared to the\nideal point-charge Coulomb model. We also find that metastable CuB pairs\nproduce acceptor states just below the conduction band minimum, which arise\nfrom the Cu level emptied by the B acceptor. Based on these results, we argue\nthat photo-generated minority carriers trapped by the metastable pairs can\nswitch off the Coulomb interaction that holds the pairs together, enhancing the\nrelease of Cu interstitials, and acting as a catalyst for Cu-LID.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2016 16:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

However, it is still not well understood how to create a\nbiologically plausible network of brain-like, spiking neurons with multi-layer,\nunsupervised learning. This paper explores a novel bio-inspired spiking CNN\nthat is trained in a greedy, layer-wise fashion. The proposed network consists\nof a spiking convolutional-pooling layer followed by a feature discovery layer\nextracting independent visual features. Kernels for the convolutional layer are\ntrained using local learning. The learning is implemented using a sparse,\nspiking auto-encoder representing primary visual features. The feature\ndiscovery layer extracts independent features by probabilistic, leaky\nintegrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons that are sparsely active in response to\nstimuli. The layer of the probabilistic, LIF neurons implicitly provides\nlateral inhibitions to extract sparse and independent features. Experimental\nresults show that the convolutional layer is stack-admissible, enabling it to\nsupport a multi-layer learning. The visual features obtained from the proposed\nprobabilistic LIF neurons in the feature discovery layer are utilized for\ntraining a classifier. Classification results contribute to the independent and\ninformative visual features extracted in a hierarchy of convolutional and\nfeature discovery layers. The proposed model is evaluated on the MNIST digit\ndataset using clean and noisy images. The recognition performance for clean\nimages is above 98%. The performance loss for recognizing the noisy images is\nin the range 0.1% to 8.5% depending on noise types and densities. This level of\nperformance loss indicates that the network is robust to additive noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2016 16:25:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2017 16:40:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 17:14:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 24 Jun 2017 02:20:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-27"}

In this paper, we\nfocus on user-irrepressible (UI) protocol sequences that can guarantee a\npositive individual throughput per sequence period with probability one for a\nslot-synchronous channel, regardless of the delay offsets among the users. As\nthe sequence period has a fundamental impact on the worst-case channel access\ndelay, a common objective of designing UI sequences is to make the sequence\nperiod as short as possible. Consider a communication channel that is shared by\n$M$ active users, and assume that each protocol sequence has a constant Hamming\nweight $w$. To attain a better delay performance than previously known UI\nsequences, this paper presents a CRTm construction of UI sequences with\n$w=M+1$, which is a variation of the previously known CRT construction. For all\nnon-prime $M\\geq 8$, our construction produces the shortest known sequence\nperiod and the shortest known worst-case delay of UI sequences. Numerical\nresults show that the new construction enjoys a better average delay\nperformance than the optimal random access scheme and other constructions with\nthe same sequence period, in a variety of traffic conditions. In addition, we\nderive an asymptotic lower bound on the minimum sequence period for $w=M+1$ if\nthe sequence structure satisfies some technical conditions, called\nequi-difference, and prove the tightness of this lower bound by using the CRTm\nconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2016 17:04:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2017 18:09:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2017 07:10:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-05"}

Our primary sample is a group of\nwell-studied classical T Tauri stars (CTTS), mostly in Taurus-Auriga. WASP\nlightcurves cover timescales up to 7 years and typically contain 10000-30000\ndatapoints. We quantify the variability as function of timescale using the\ntime-dependent standard deviation 'pooled sigma'. We find that the overwhelming\nmajority of CTTS has low-level variability with sigma<0.3mag dominated by\ntimescales of a few weeks, consistent with rotational modulation. Thus, for\nmost young stars monitoring over a month is sufficient to constrain the total\namount of variability over timescales up to a decade. The fraction of stars\nwith strong optical variability (sigma>0.3mag) is 21% in our sample and 21% in\nan unbiased control sample. An even smaller fraction (13% in our sample, 6% in\nthe control) show evidence for an increase in variability amplitude as a\nfunction of timescale from weeks to months or years. The presence of long-term\nvariability correlates with the spectral slope at 3-5mu, which is an indicator\nof inner disk geometry, and with the U-B band slope, which is an accretion\ndiagnostics. This shows that the long-term variations in CTTS are predominantly\ndriven by processes in the inner disk and in the accretion zone. Four of the\nstars with long-term variations show periods of 20-60d, significantly longer\nthan the rotation periods and stable over months to years. One possible\nexplanation are cyclic changes in the interaction between the disk and the\nstellar magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2016 17:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

When supercooled beneath its characteristic melting\ntemperature, a liquid sees a sharp rise in its viscosity over a narrow\ntemperature range, eventually becoming frozen on laboratory timescales.\nExplaining this immense increase in viscosity is one of the principle goals of\ncondensed matter physicists. To that end, numerous theoretical frameworks have\nbeen proposed which explain and reproduce the temperature dependence of the\nviscosity of supercooled liquids. Each of these frameworks appears only\napplicable to specific classes of glassformers and each possess a number of\nvariable parameters. Here we describe a classical framework for explaining the\ndynamical behavior of supercooled liquids based on statistical mechanical\nconsiderations, and possessing only a single variable parameter. This parameter\nvaries weakly from liquid to liquid. Furthermore, as predicted by this new\nclassical theory and its earlier quantum counterpart, we find with the aid of a\nsmall dimensionless constant that varies in size from $\\sim 0.05-0.12$, a\nuniversal (16 decade) collapse of the viscosity data as a function of\ntemperature.

Theoretical considerations and experimental evidence\nsupport the view that the human brain can be modeled as a system operating at a\ncritical point between ordered (sub-critical) and disordered (super-critical)\nphases. Here, we explore the hypothesis that pathologies resulting from brain\ninjury of different etiology are related to the model of a critical brain. For\nthis purpose, we investigate how damage to the integrity of the structural\nconnectome impacts on the signatures of critical dynamics. Adopting a hybrid\nmodeling approach combining an empirical weighted network of human structural\nconnections with a conceptual model of critical dynamics, we show that lesions\nlocated at highly transited connections progressively displace the model\ntowards the sub-critical regime.

Using\nfirst-principles methods we investigate the point defect thermodynamics and\nphase segregation in the technologically-important metastable alloy GaAsBi. Our\ncalculations predict defect energy levels in good agreement with abundant\nprevious experiments and clarify the defect structures giving rise to these\nlevels. We find that vacancies in some charge states become metastable or\nunstable with respect to antisite formation, and this instability is a general\ncharacteristic of zincblende semiconductors with small ionicity. The dominant\npoint defects degrading electronical and optical performances are predicted to\nbe As$_G$$_a$, Bi$_G$$_a$, Bi$_G$$_a$+Bi$_A$$_s$, As$_G$$_a$+Bi$_A$$_s$,\nV$_G$$_a$ and V$_G$$_a$+Bi$_A$$_s$, of which the first-four and second-two\ndefects are minority-electron and minority-hole traps, respectively. V$_G$$_a$\nis also found to play a critical role in controlling the metastable Bi\nsupersaturation through mediating Bi diffusion and clustering. To reduce the\ninfluences of these deleterious defects, we suggest shifting the growth away\nfrom As-rich condition and/or using hydrogen passivation to reduce the\nminority-carrier traps.

We provide a self-consistent, unified treatment of TDEs by non-spinning\n(Schwarzschild) black holes, investigating several effects of general\nrelativity including changes to the boundary in phase space that defines the\nloss-cone orbits on which stars are tidally disrupted or captured. TDE rates\ndecrease rapidly at large black-hole masses due to direct stellar capture, but\nthis effect is slightly countered by the widening of the loss cone due to the\nstronger tidal fields in general relativity. We provide a new mapping procedure\nthat translates between Newtonian gravity and general relativity, allowing us\nto better compare predictions in both gravitational theories. Partial tidal\ndisruptions in relativity will strip more material from the star and produce\nmore tightly bound debris than in Newtonian gravity for a stellar orbit with\nthe same angular momentum. However, for deep encounters leading to full\ndisruption in both theories, the stronger tidal forces in relativity imply that\nthe star is disrupted further from the black hole and that the debris is\ntherefore less tightly bound, leading to a smaller peak fallback accretion\nrate. We also examine the capture of tidal debris by the horizon and the\nrelativistic pericenter precession of tidal debris, finding that black holes of\n$10^6$ solar masses and above generate tidal debris precessing by $10^\\circ$ or\nmore per orbit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2016 18:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

The\nmethod is widely used in numerous medical image segmentation applications.\nHowever, nodes in the graph based optimal surface segmentation method typically\nencode uniformly distributed orthogonal voxels of the volume. Thus the\nsegmentation cannot attain an accuracy greater than a single unit voxel, i.e.\nthe distance between two adjoining nodes in graph space. Segmentation accuracy\nhigher than a unit voxel is achievable by exploiting partial volume information\nin the voxels which shall result in non-equidistant spacing between adjoining\ngraph nodes. This paper reports a generalized graph based multiple surface\nsegmentation method with convex priors which can optimally segment the target\nsurfaces in an irregularly sampled space. The proposed method allows\nnon-equidistant spacing between the adjoining graph nodes to achieve subvoxel\nsegmentation accuracy by utilizing the partial volume information in the\nvoxels. The partial volume information in the voxels is exploited by computing\na displacement field from the original volume data to identify the\nsubvoxel-accurate centers within each voxel resulting in non-equidistant\nspacing between the adjoining graph nodes. The smoothness of each surface\nmodeled as a convex constraint governs the connectivity and regularity of the\nsurface. We employ an edge-based graph representation to incorporate the\nnecessary constraints and the globally optimal solution is obtained by\ncomputing a minimum s-t cut. The proposed method was validated on 10\nintravascular multi-frame ultrasound image datasets for subvoxel segmentation\naccuracy. In all cases, the approach yielded highly accurate results. Our\napproach can be readily extended to higher-dimensional segmentations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2016 19:46:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 May 2017 21:09:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Feb 2019 19:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-18"}

Carbon burning includes a weak reaction that removes electrons,\nresulting in a lower electron-to-baryon ratio ($Y_{\\rm e}$) in the regions\nprocessed by carbon burning compared to the unburned C/O core, making the O/Ne\nmantle denser than the C/O core as the WD cools.

We study incremental learning in the\ncontext of sequence learning, using generative RNNs in the form of multi-layer\nrecurrent Mixture Density Networks. While the potential of incremental or\ncurriculum learning to enhance learning is known, indiscriminate application of\nthe principle does not necessarily lead to improvement, and it is essential\ntherefore to know which forms of incremental or curriculum learning have a\npositive effect. This research contributes to that aim by comparing three\ninstantiations of incremental or curriculum learning.\n  We introduce Incremental Sequence Learning, a simple incremental approach to\nsequence learning. Incremental Sequence Learning starts out by using only the\nfirst few steps of each sequence as training data. Each time a performance\ncriterion has been reached, the length of the parts of the sequences used for\ntraining is increased.\n  We introduce and make available a novel sequence learning task and data set:\npredicting and classifying MNIST pen stroke sequences. We find that Incremental\nSequence Learning greatly speeds up sequence learning and reaches the best test\nperformance level of regular sequence learning 20 times faster, reduces the\ntest error by 74%, and in general performs more robustly; it displays lower\nvariance and achieves sustained progress after all three comparison methods\nhave stopped improving. The other instantiations of curriculum learning do not\nresult in any noticeable improvement. A trained sequence prediction model is\nalso used in transfer learning to the task of sequence classification, where it\nis found that transfer learning realizes improved classification performance\ncompared to methods that learn to classify from scratch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2016 20:12:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 21:33:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-05"}

The problem is\nmotivated by the large current gap between the regime when it is NP-hard, and\nthe regime when it is efficiently solvable (i.e., the Johnson radius).\n  We show the first NP-hardness results for asymptotically smaller decoding\nradii than the maximum likelihood decoding radius of Guruswami and Vardy.\nSpecifically, for Reed-Solomon codes of length $N$ and dimension $K=O(N)$, we\nshow that it is NP-hard to decode more than $ N-K- c\\frac{\\log N}{\\log\\log N}$\nerrors (with $c>0$ an absolute constant). Moreover, we show that the problem is\nNP-hard under quasipolynomial-time reductions for an error amount $> N-K-\nc\\log{N}$ (with $c>0$ an absolute constant).\n  These results follow from the NP-hardness of a generalization of the\nclassical Subset Sum problem to higher moments, called {\\em Moments Subset\nSum}, which has been a known open problem, and which may be of independent\ninterest.\n  We further reveal a strong connection with the well-studied\nProuhet-Tarry-Escott problem in Number Theory, which turns out to capture a\nmain barrier in extending our techniques. We believe the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott\nproblem deserves further study in the theoretical computer science community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2016 20:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-10"}

We find that the the amplitude of variability at a given time-interval,\nor equivalently the time-scale of variability to reach a certain amplitude, is\nmost strongly correlated with luminosity with weak or no dependence on black\nhole mass and redshift. For a variability level of SF($\\tau$)=0.07 mag, the\ntime-scale has a dependency of $\\tau \\propto L^{0.4}$. This is broadly\nconsistent with the expectation from a simple Keplerian accretion disk model,\nwhich provides $\\tau \\propto L^{0.5}$. The PSD analysis also reveals that many\nquasar light curves are steeper than a damped random walk. We find a\ncorrelation between the steepness of the PSD slopes, specifically the fraction\nof slopes steeper than 2.5, and black hole mass, although we cannot exclude the\npossibility that luminosity or Eddington ratio are the drivers of this effect.\nThis effect is also seen in the SF analysis of the (i)PTF data, and in a PSD\nanalysis of quasars in the SDSS Stripe 82.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2016 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

Pebble accretion has been\ndemonstrated to play an important role in core accretion and to have growth\nrates that are consistent with planetary migration. The high pebble accretion\nrates allow planetary cores to start their growth beyond 10 AU and subsequently\nmigrate to cold (>~ 1 AU), warm (~0.1 AU- 1AU) or hot (<~ 0.1 AU) orbits.

We present a new analysis method, superABC, for obtaining\ncosmological constraints from Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) light curves using\nApproximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) without any likelihood assumptions. The\nABC method works by using a forward model simulation of the data where\nsystematic uncertainties can be simulated and marginalized over. A key feature\nof the method presented here is the use of two distinct metrics, the `Tripp'\nand `Light Curve' metrics, which allow us to compare the simulated data to the\nobserved data set. The Tripp metric takes as input the parameters of models fit\nto each light curve with the SALT-II method, whereas the Light Curve metric\nuses the measured fluxes directly without model fitting. We apply the superABC\nsampler to a simulated data set of $\\sim$1000 SNe corresponding to the first\nseason of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program. Varying $\\Omega_m, w_0,\n\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ and a magnitude offset parameter, with no systematics we\nobtain $\\Delta(w_0) = w_0^{\\rm true} - w_0^{\\rm best \\, fit} = -0.036\\pm0.109$\n(a $\\sim11$% 1$\\sigma$ uncertainty) using the Tripp metric and $\\Delta(w_0) =\n-0.055\\pm0.068$ (a $\\sim7$% 1$\\sigma$ uncertainty) using the Light Curve\nmetric.

Overall we find a $17$% increase in the\nuncertainty on $w_0$ with systematics compared to without. We contrast this\nwith a MCMC approach where systematic effects are approximately included. We\nfind that the MCMC method slightly underestimates the impact of calibration\nuncertainties for this simulated data set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2016 21:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-11"}

However, at present a\nsystematic way of taking these inhomogeneities into account in drag\ncalculations has been lacking, making the interpretation of experimental data\nproblematic. On the other hand, there exists a highly successful and widely\naccepted formalism describing transport within single inhomogeneous layers\nknown as effective medium theory. In this work, we generalize the standard\neffective medium theory to the case of Coulomb drag between two inhomogeneous\nsheets and demonstrate that inhomogeneity in the layers has a strong impact on\ndrag transport. In the case of exciton condensation between the layers, we show\nthat drag resistivity takes on a value determined by the amplitude of density\nfluctuation. Next we consider drag between graphene sheets, in which the\nexistence of spatial charge density fluctuations is well-known. We show that\nthese inhomogeneities play a crucial role in explaining existing experimental\ndata. In particular, the temperature dependence of the experimentally observed\npeaks in drag resistivity can only be explained by taking the layer density\nfluctuations into account.

In\norder to avoid the problem, I have used a proper scheme, e.g., splitting into\nmany subintervals and the width of each subinterval is determined by the\nvariation of the integrand, to calculate the scattering angle. The collision\nintegrals are calculated by using Romberg's method therefore the accuracy is\nhigh (i.e., $ \\sim 10^{-12}$).

We show that, due to these\ndegeneracies, a thermalization analysis performed by the popular quantum\noptical master equation reveals a number of serious pathologies, possibly\nincluding a lack of ergodicity. On the other hand, a consistent thermalization\nscenario is obtained by introducing a Lindblad-based approach, in which the\nLindblad operators, instead of being derived from a microscopic calculation,\nare established as the elements of an operatorial basis with squared amplitudes\nfixed by imposing a detailed balance condition and requiring their\ncorrespondence with the dipole transition rates evaluated under the first-order\nperturbation theory.

Often, the incurred costs are\nprohibitive for real-time monitoring. This leads to data being stored locally\nor transmitted to a central storage site for post-incident examination. The\nrequired communication links and archiving of the video data are still\nexpensive and this setup excludes preemptive actions to respond to imminent\nthreats. An effective way to overcome these limitations is to build a smart\ncamera that transmits alerts when relevant video sequences are detected. Deep\nneural networks (DNNs) have come to outperform humans in visual classifications\ntasks. The concept of DNNs and Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) can easily be\nextended to make use of higher-dimensional input data such as multispectral\ndata. We explore this opportunity in terms of achievable accuracy and required\ncomputational effort. To analyze the precision of DNNs for scene labeling in an\nurban surveillance scenario we have created a dataset with 8 classes obtained\nin a field experiment. We combine an RGB camera with a 25-channel VIS-NIR\nsnapshot sensor to assess the potential of multispectral image data for target\nclassification.

The transient has duration $T_{90} \\gtrsim\n100$s and fluence $S_\\gamma\\approx 4\\times 10^{-6}$ erg cm$^{-2}$, increasing\nthe energy budget for this event by more than a billion times; at the nominal\n$z\\approx 0.55$ redshift implied by its dispersion measure, the burst's\ngamma-ray energy output is $E_\\gamma \\approx 5\\times 10^{51}$ erg. The observed\nradio to gamma-ray fluence ratio for FRB131104 is consistent with a lower limit\nwe derive from Swift observations of another FRB, which is not detected in\ngamma-rays, and with an upper limit previously derived for the brightest\ngamma-ray flare from SGR 1806-20, which was not detected in the radio. X-ray,\nultraviolet, and optical observations beginning two days after the FRB do not\nreveal any associated afterglow, supernova, or transient; Swift observations\nexclude association with the brightest 65% of Swift gamma-ray burst X-ray\nafterglows, while leaving the possibility of an associated supernova at much\nmore than 10% the FRB's nominal distance, $D\\gtrsim 320$ Mpc, largely\nunconstrained. Transient high-luminosity gamma-ray emission arises most\nnaturally in a relativistic outflow or shock breakout, as for example from\nmagnetar flares, gamma-ray bursts, relativistic supernovae, and some types of\ngalactic nuclear activity. Our discovery thus bolsters the case for an\nextragalactic origin for some FRBs and suggests that future rapid-response\nobservations might identify long-lived counterparts, resolving the nature of\nthese mysterious phenomena and realizing their promise as probes of cosmology\nand fundamental physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 00:29:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}

An extension of CNT taking into\naccount the properties of the transition region between coexisting bulk phases\nis proposed. For this purpose, the finite-thickness layer method which is an\nalternative to Gibbs one is used; the transition region is considered as a\nseparate (surface) phase. An equation for the nucleation work is derived which\nis basic for the multivariable theory of nucleation. Equations of equilibrium\nfollowing from it are employed for considering the dependences of surface\ntension on radius and temperature for droplets; Kelvin formula for the\nequilibrium vapor pressure is extended to small radii. It is shown that the\nratio of the isothermal nucleation rate to that of CNT can achieve several\norders of magnitude due to the curvature effect (the dependence of surface\ntension on curvature). The analysis of different dependences of the Tolman\nlength on radius, d(R), suggests that (i) the curvature effect is determined by\nthe value of d(0) which is positive and relates to the limiting (spinodal)\nvapor supersaturation and (ii) the function d(R) decreases with increasing\nradius; at the same time, this effect is weakly sensitive to the form of the\nfunction d(R) and its asymptotic value. The second differential of the work is\nobtained as a quadratic form with contributions from both the bulk and surface\nphases.

Rev. Lett. {\\bf 90}, 247201 (2003)) reported\nthat when ferromagnetic nickel is subject to an intense ultrashort laser pulse,\nits exchange splitting is reduced quickly. But to simulate such reduction\nremains a big challenge. The popular rigid band approximation (RBA), where both\nthe band structure and the exchange splitting are held fixed before and after\nlaser excitation, is unsuitable for this purpose, while the time-dependent\ndensity functional theory could be time-consuming. To overcome these\ndifficulties, we propose a time-dependent Liouville and density functional\ntheory (TDLDFT) that integrates the time-dependent Liouville equation into the\ndensity functional theory. As a result, the excited charge density is\nreiterated back into the Kohn-Sham equation, and the band structure is allowed\nto change dynamically. Even with the ground-state density functional, a larger\ndemagnetization than RBA is found; after we expand Ortenzi's spin scaling\nmethod into an excited-state (laser) density functional, we find that the\nexchange splitting is indeed strongly reduced, as seen in the experiment. Both\nthe majority and minority bands are shifted toward the Fermi level, but the\nmajority shifts a lot more.

The basic idea is to produce\nlow-threshold single-epoch catalogs, and use a probabilistic approach to\naccumulate catalog information across epochs; this is in contrast to more\nconventional strategies based on co-added or stacked image data across all\nepochs. We adopt a Bayesian approach, addressing object detection by\ncalculating the marginal likelihoods for hypotheses asserting there is no\nobject, or one object, in a small image patch containing at most one cataloged\nsource at each epoch. The object-present hypothesis interprets the sources in a\npatch at different epochs as arising from a genuine object; the no-object\n(noise) hypothesis interprets candidate sources as spurious, arising from noise\npeaks. We study the detection probability for constant-flux objects in a\nsimplified Gaussian noise setting, comparing results based on single exposures\nand stacked exposures to results based on a series of single-epoch catalog\nsummaries. Computing the detection probability based on catalog data amounts to\ngeneralized cross-matching: it is the product of a factor accounting for\nmatching of the estimated fluxes of candidate sources, and a factor accounting\nfor matching of their estimated directions. We find that probabilistic fusion\nof multi-epoch catalog information can detect sources with only modest\nsacrifice in sensitivity and selectivity compared to stacking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 03:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

The cylinder and elastic splitter plate are contained within a\nnarrow channel and the Reynolds number is mostly restricted to Re = 100,\nprimarily covering the two-dimensional flow regime. An in-house fluid-structure\ninteraction code is employed for simulations, which couples a sharp-interface\nimmersed boundary method for the fluid dynamics with a finite-element method to\ntreat the structural dynamics. The structural solver is implicitly (two-way)\ncoupled with the flow solver using a partitioned approach. This implicit\ncoupling ensures numerical stability at low structure-fluid density ratios. A\npower spectrum analysis of the time-varying plate displacement shows that the\nplate oscillates at more than a single frequency for pulsatile inflow, compared\nto a single frequency observed for steady inflow. The multiple frequencies\nobtained for the former case can be explained by beating between the applied\nand plate oscillatory signals. The plate attains a self-sustained time-periodic\noscillation with a plateau amplitude in the case of steady flow, while the\nsuperimposition of pulsatile inflow with induced plate oscillation affects the\nplateau amplitude. Lock-in of the plate oscillation with the pulsatile inflow\noccurs at a forcing frequency that is twice of the plate natural frequency in a\nparticular mode and this mode depends on the plate length. The plate\ndisplacement as well as pressure drag increases at the lock-in condition.

The proposed method firstly estimates the frequency\ncomponents of the signal from the piezoelectric device. The frequency\ncharacteristics for filtering the microphone sound are changed so that it pass\nthe estimated frequency components. Thus we can extractthe target sound without\ndistortion.

Some previous studies have suggested\nthat magnetic fields of active regions in the solar chromosphere are close to\nbe force-free whereas there is no consistency among previous studies on whether\nmagnetic fields of active regions in the solar photosphere are force-free or\nnot. Here we use three kinds of representative magnetic fields (analytical\nforce-free solutions, modeled solar-like force-free fields and observed\nnon-force-free fields) to discuss on how the measurement issues such as limited\nfield of view, instrument sensitivity and measurement error could affect the\nestimation of force-freeness based on observed magnetograms. Unlike previous\nstudies that focus on discussing the effect of limited field of view or\ninstrument sensitivity, our calculation shows that just measurement error alone\ncan significantly influence the results of force-freeness estimate, due to the\nfact that measurement errors in horizontal magnetic fields are usually ten\ntimes larger than that of the vertical fields. This property of measurement\nerrors, interacting with the particular form of force-freeness estimate\nformula, would result in wrong judgments of the force-freeness: a truly\nforce-free field may be mistakenly estimated as being non-force-free and a true\nnon-force-free field may be estimated as being force-free. Our analysis calls\nfor caution when interpreting the force-freeness estimates based on measured\nmagnetograms, and also suggests that the true photospheric magnetic field may\nbe further away from being force-free than they currently appear to be.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 05:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

Using polygenic risk scores (PRS) and LD score regression, we\ninvestigated the shared genetic bases of SCZ and BD with a panel of 28\ncardiometabolic traits. We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) to elucidate\ncasual relationships between the two groups of disorders. The analysis was\nbased on large-scale meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS).\nWe also identified the potential shared genetic variants by a statistical\napproach based on local true discovery rates, and inferred the pathways\ninvolved. We found polygenic associations of SCZ with glucose metabolism\nabnormalities, adverse adipokine profiles, increased wait-hip ratio and raised\nvisceral adiposity. However, BMI showed inverse genetic correlation and\npolygenic link with SCZ. On the other hand, we observed polygenic associations\nwith an overall favorable CM profile in BD. MR analysis showed that SCZ may be\ncausally linked to raised triglyceride and that lower fasting glucose may be\nlinked to BD; otherwise MR did not reveal other significant causal\nrelationships in general. We also identified numerous SNPs and pathways shared\nbetween SCZ/BD with cardiometabolic traits, some of which are related to\ninflammation or the immune system. In conclusion, SCZ patients may be\ngenetically associated with several CM abnormalities independent of medication\nside-effects, and proper surveillance and management of CV risk factors may be\nrequired from the onset of the disease.

Simulations are\npresented by choosing Nickel (Ni) as a test material to compute electron-phonon\nrelaxation time due to its large electron-phonon coupling constant that expects\nto reveal more conclusively the influence of the non-equilibrium electrons. We\ndemonstrate the consideration of the above factors leads to significant changes\ncompared to the results the traditional Two Temperature Model (TTM) provides.\nThe proposed model predicts a substantially (~33%) smaller damage threshold and\na large increase of the stress (~20%, at early times) which firstly underlines\nthe role of the nonthermal electron interactions and secondly enhances its\nimportance with respect to the precise determination of laser specifications in\nmaterial micromachining techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 07:46:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 08:28:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

For years, programming of these platforms\nwas very tedious and simultaneous use of all available GPP and GPU resources\nrequired low-level programming to ensure efficient synchronization and data\ntransfer between processors. However, in the last few years several high-level\nprogramming frameworks have emerged, which enable programmers to describe\napplications by means of abstractions such as dataflow or Kahn process networks\nand leave parallel execution, data transfer and synchronization to be handled\nby the framework.\n  Unfortunately, even the most advanced high-level programming frameworks have\nhad shortcomings that limit their applicability to certain classes of\napplications. This paper presents a new, dataflow-flavored programming\nframework targeting heterogeneous platforms, and differs from previous\napproaches by allowing GPU-mapped actors to have data dependent consumption of\ninputs / production of outputs. Such flexibility is essential for configurable\nand adaptive applications that are becoming increasingly common in signal\nprocessing.

This smallness of the\ncorrelation factor is however overcompensated by a large macrojump frequency,\nand, as a result, the Y atom diffuses more rapidly than iron at all\ntemperatures by orders of magnitude in the two structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 09:19:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2017 13:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-05"}

From these results\nand the estimated exchange interaction J=6.15 K by Okuta et al., the ground\nstate of Cr-jarosite is discussed in connection with the Monte Carlo\nsimulations result with classical Heisenberg spins on the kagome lattice by\nElhajal et al. Finally, the angular dependence of linewidth and the lineshape\nobserved at 296 K by X-band ESR show typical behavior of a two-dimensional\nHeisenberg antiferromagnet, suggesting a good two-dimensionality of\nCr-jarosite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 11:28:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2016 13:39:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-19"}

But one of the biggest challenges faced with\nresearchers is how to program a memristor's resistance precisely. Recently, an\nalgorithm designed to save 8 valid bits in each memristor is proposed, but this\nis still not sufficient for precise computation. In this paper, we propose a\ncrossbar-based memristor computation scheme supporting precise computations\nwhose operands have 32 valid bits. As a brief introduction, in a multiplication\nwith two operands, one operand is programmed as input signal, and the other\noperand is saved into a so-called crossbar structure, which contains a group of\nmemristors, and each memristor saves several valid bits, usually one or two\nbits only. The computation results,i.e. the multiplication of the two operands,\nare contained in the outputs of the crossbar structure together with noise.\nAnalog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) are then used to extract the valid bits,\nwhich are the most significant bits of outputs. These valid bits can be\ncombined together with Digital-to-Analog Converters(DACs) to get the final\nresults. What's more, the precision of this computation scheme can be adjusted\naccording to the definition of the user, 32 valid bits at most, so it is\nqualified for different application contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 11:30:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2016 15:04:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-22"}

The dissipation in\nsuch systems arises from two different sources: inelasticity in particle\ncollisions and viscous friction dissipation due to the influence of gas phase\non solid particles. The starting point is a suspension model based on the\n(inelastic) Enskog kinetic equation where the effect of the interstitial gas\nphase on the dynamics of grains is modeled via a viscous drag force. The study\nis carried out in two different steps. First, the transport coefficients of the\nsystem are obtained by solving the Enskog equation by means of the\nChapman-Enskog method up to first order in spatial gradients. Once the\ntransport properties are known, then the corresponding linearized hydrodynamic\nequations are solved to get the dispersion relations. In contrast to previous\nstudies [V.

In this work, we develop a new\ndata-driven framework to identify nonlinear reduced-order models of a fluid by\ncombining dimensionality reductions techniques (e.g. proper orthogonal\ndecomposition) and sparse regression techniques from machine learn- ing. In\nparticular, we extend the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)\nalgorithm to enforce physical constraints in the regression, namely\nenergy-preserving quadratic nonlinearities. The resulting models, hereafter\nreferred to as Galerkin regression models, incorporate many beneficial aspects\nof Galerkin projection, but without the need for a full-order or high-fidelity\nsolver to project the Navier-Stokes equations. Instead, the most parsimonious\nnonlinear model is determined that is consistent with observed mea- surement\ndata and satisfies necessary constraints. Galerkin regression models also\nreadily generalize to include higher-order nonlinear terms that model the\neffect of truncated modes. The effectiveness of Galerkin regression is\ndemonstrated on two different flow configurations: the two-dimensional flow\npast a circular cylinder and the shear-driven cavity flow.

This is in part due to a lack of reliable oxygen abundance indicators in\nthe metal-poor stars, in part due to shortcomings in 1D LTE abundance analyses.\nIn this study we determined the oxygen abundance in the metal-poor halo giant\nHD 122563 using a 3D hydrodynamical CO5BOLD model atmosphere. Our main goal was\nto understand whether a 3D LTE analysis may help to improve the reliability of\noxygen abundances determined from OH UV lines in comparison to those obtained\nusing standard 1D LTE methodology. The oxygen abundance in HD 122563 was\ndetermined using 71 OH UV lines located in the wavelength range between 308-330\nnm. The analysis was done using a high-resolution VLT UVES spectrum with a 1D\nLTE spectral line synthesis performed using the SYNTHE package and classical\nATLAS9 model atmosphere. Subsequently, a 3D hydrodynamical CO5BOLD, and 1D\nhydrostatic LHD model atmospheres were used in order to compute 3D-1D abundance\ncorrections. For this, the microturbulence velocity used with the 1D LHD model\natmosphere was derived from the hydrodynamical CO5BOLD model atmosphere. As in\nprevious studies, we found trends of the 1D LTE oxygen abundances determined\nfrom OH UV lines with line parameters, such as the line excitation potential\nand the line strength. These trends become significantly less pronounced in 3D\nLTE. Using OH UV lines we determined a 3D LTE oxygen abundance in HD 122563 of\nA(O) = 6.23 +/- 0.13. This is in fair agreement with the oxygen abundance\nobtained from OH IR lines, A(O) = 6.39 +/- 0.11, but it is noticeably lower\nthan that determined using the forbidden [OI] line, A(O) = 6.53 +/- 0.15. While\nthe exact cause for this discrepancy remains unclear, it is very likely that\nnon-LTE effects may play a decisive role here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 12:36:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

We relate the underlying physics to that of an absorbing\nstate phase transition in the presence of a field (i.e. off-resonant excitation\nprocesses) which slightly offsets the system from criticality. We observe a\ncharacteristic power-law scaling of the Rydberg excitation density as well as\nincreased fluctuations close to the transition point.

The mechanics of the generalized Langevin\nequation (GLE) are considered and insight gained from the orthogonal dynamics\nequation is used as a starting point for model development. A class of sub-grid\nmodels is considered which represent non-local behavior via a finite memory\napproximation (Stinis, P., \"Mori-Zwanzig reduced models for uncertainty\nquantification I: Parametric uncertainty,\" \\textit{arXiv:1211.4285}, 2012.),\nthe length of which is determined using a heuristic that is related to the\nspectral radius of the Jacobian of the resolved variables.

The trajectory of each resolved mode in\nphase-space is accurately predicted for cases where the coarse-graining is\nmoderate.

Its Br-containing\nanalogue is stable in the room-temperature crystal structure down to at least\n10K, although the Br compound is on the verge of a similar antiferroelectric\ninstability and reveals local displacements of Cu and Br atoms. The\nI-containing compound is stable in its room-temperature structure according to\ndensity-functional calculations. We show that the distortion involves\ncooperative displacements of Cu and Cl atoms, and originates from the\noptimization of interatomic distances for weakly bonded halogen atoms. The\ndistortion introduces a tangible deformation of the kagome spin lattice and may\nbe responsible for the reduced net magnetization of the Cl compound compared to\nthe Br one. The polar structure of Cu$_3$Bi(SeO$_3$)$_2$O$_2$Cl is only\nslightly higher in energy than the non-polar antiferroelectric structure, but\nno convincing evidence of its formation could be obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 14:39:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

While\northo-rectification can be done, it tends to be expensive and time consuming.\nImage stitching offers a more economical, low-tech approach. However direct\napplication tends to fail for low-elevation imagery due to one or more factors\nincluding insufficient keypoints, parallax issues, and homogeneity of the\nsurveyed area. This paper discusses these problems and possible solutions when\nusing techniques such as image stitching and structure from motion for\ngenerating ortho-rectified imagery.

Alternatively,\nand perhaps equivalently, it could be the consequence that the metrics of the\nearly universe was a strongly concentrated gravitational coherent state with\nvery high frequency oscillations, allowing local pair creations by a\ngeneralisation to gravity of the Schwinger mechanism, perhaps by creation of\nblack holes of masses superior to the Planck scale. The lattice spacing between\ntwo clicks in the discrete time picture corresponds to the inverse frequency of\nthe gravitational coherent state in the other picture. In both cases, a much\nlower time than the Planck time might represent a new fundamental scale, giving\nnew type of physics. To make possible a concrete estimation of the pair\nproduction probability, we propose that the oscillating coherent state metrics\nthat defines this very early geometry minimises the Einstein gravity action\ncoupled to interacting 1-,2- and 3-forms.

The term Magic Mirror implies that the display\nshows the users enantiomorph, i.e. the mirror image, such that the system\nmimics a real-world physical mirror. However, the question arises whether one\nshould design a traditional mirror, or instead display the true mirror image by\nmeans of a non-reversing mirror? This is an intriguing perceptual question, as\nthe image one observes in a mirror is not a real view, as it would be seen by\nan external observer, but a reflection, i.e. a front-to-back reversed image.

We validate our results through simulations on synthetic\ndatasets as well as on a few real world networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 10:13:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 09:45:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 13:26:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-07"}

Therefore, the cell range is expected to\nbe limited to 50 - 100 meters, and directive high gain antennas are required at\nleast for the base stations. This paper investigates the kind of topology that\nis required to serve a suburban area with a small-cell network operating at 60\nGHz and equipped with beam-steering antennas. A real environment is considered\nto introduce practical deployment and propagation constraints. The analysis\nrelies on Monte-Carlo system simulations with non-full buffer, and ray-based\npredictions. The ray-tracing techniques are today identified as a relevant\nsolution to capture the main channel properties impacting the beam-steering\nperformance (angular dispersion, inter-link correlation); and the one involved\nin the present study was specifically enhanced to deal with detailed vegetation\nmodeling. In addition to the user outage, the paper evaluates the evolution of\nthe inter-cell interference along with the user density, and investigates the\nnetwork behavior in case of local strong obstructions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 09:34:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}
