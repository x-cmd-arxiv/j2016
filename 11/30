The polarization anisotropy leads to a\nshift in the conventional Brewster angle defined for a planar interface with\ncertain refractive index. The observed shift in Brewster angle strongly depends\non the index contrast and lattice constant. Polarization-dependent stop gap\nmeasurements are performed on photonic crystals with different index contrast\nand lattice constants.

While saturated-buffer\nscenarios have been widely investigated and yield useful throughput estimates\nfor persistent sessions, they fail to capture the fluctuations in buffer\ncontents over time, and provide no insight in the delay performance of flows\nwith intermittent packet arrivals. Motivated by that issue, we explore in the\npresent paper random-access networks with buffer dynamics, where flows with\nempty buffers refrain from competition for the medium. The occurrence of empty\nbuffers thus results in a complex dynamic interaction between activity states\nand buffer contents, which severely complicates the performance analysis. Hence\nwe focus on a many-sources regime where the total number of nodes grows large,\nwhich not only offers mathematical tractability but is also highly relevant\nwith the densification of wireless networks as the Internet of Things emerges.\nWe exploit time scale separation properties to prove that the properly scaled\nbuffer occupancy process converges to the solution of a deterministic\ninitial-value problem, and establish the existence and uniqueness of the\nassociated fixed point.

Numerical\nsimulations allow a determination of the spatial dependence of all the\ncomponents of the stress field as a function of systems size, the coefficient\nof static friction and the frictional interaction with the bottom surface. Our\nstudy clearly demonstrates that interaction with the bottom surface plays a\ncrucial role in the formation of a pressure dip under the apex of a granular\npile. Basic to the theory of sandpiles are assumptions about the form of\nscaling solutions and constitutive relations for cohesive-less hard grains for\nwhich no typical scale is available. We find that these constitutive relations\nmust be modified; moreover for smaller friction coefficients and smaller piles\nthese scaling assumptions break down in the bulk of the sandpile due to the\npresence of length scales that must be carefully identified. After identifying\nthe crucial scale we provide a predictive theory to when scaling solutions are\nexpected to break down. At the bottom of the pile the scaling assumption always\nbreaks, due to the different interactions with the bottom surface. The\nconsequences for measurable quantities like the pressure distribution and shear\nstress at the bottom of the pile are discussed.

In this work we present a\ncomputational program based on the principles of non-commutative geometry and\nshowcase several applications to topological insulators. In the first part we\nintroduce the notion of a homogeneous material and define the class of\ndisordered crystals together with the classification table which conjectures\nall topological phases from this class. We continue with a discussion of\nelectron dynamics in disordered crystals and we briefly review the theory of\ntopological invariants in the presence of strong disorder. We show how all\nthese can be captured in the language of non-commutative geometry using the\nconcept of non-commutative Brillouin torus, and present a list of known\nformulas for various physical response functions.

We focus\non large scales where cosmic density fields are quasi-linear. On these scales,\nthe clustering of galaxies can be described by a perturbative bias expansion,\nand the complicated physics of galaxy formation is absorbed by a finite set of\ncoefficients of the expansion, called bias parameters. The review begins with a\ndetailed derivation of this very important result, which forms the basis of the\nrigorous perturbative description of galaxy clustering, under the assumptions\nof General Relativity and Gaussian, adiabatic initial conditions. Key\ncomponents of the bias expansion are all leading local gravitational\nobservables, which include the matter density but also tidal fields and their\ntime derivatives. We hence expand the definition of local bias to encompass all\nthese contributions. This derivation is followed by a presentation of the\npeak-background split in its general form, which elucidates the physical\nmeaning of the bias parameters, and a detailed description of the connection\nbetween bias parameters and galaxy statistics. We then review the excursion-set\nformalism and peak theory which provide predictions for the values of the bias\nparameters. In the remainder of the review, we consider the generalizations of\ngalaxy bias required in the presence of various types of cosmological physics\nthat go beyond pressureless matter with adiabatic, Gaussian initial conditions:\nprimordial non-Gaussianity, massive neutrinos, baryon-CDM isocurvature\nperturbations, dark energy, and modified gravity. Finally, we discuss how the\ndescription of galaxy bias in the galaxies' rest frame is related to clustering\nstatistics measured from the observed angular positions and redshifts in actual\ngalaxy catalogs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 18:57:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 19:40:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2017 19:29:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 6 Aug 2018 18:00:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 14 Jan 2019 18:30:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-01-15"}

As of today, asteroseismology mainly allows us to probe the internal\nrotation of stars when modes are only weakly affected by rotation using\nperturbative methods. Such methods cannot be applied to rapidly rotating stars,\nwhich exhibit complex oscillation spectra. In this context, the so-called\ntraditional approximation, which neglects the terms associated with the\nlatitudinal component of the rotation vector, describes modes that are strongly\naffected by rotation. This approximation is sometimes used for interpreting\nasteroseismic data, however, its domain of validity is not established yet.\n  Aims. We aim at deriving analytical prescriptions for period spacings of\nlow-frequency gravity modes strongly affected by rotation through the full\nCoriolis acceleration, which can be used to probe stellar internal structure\nand rotation.\n  Methods. We approximated the asymptotic theory of gravito-inertial waves in\nuniformly rotating stars using ray theory described in a previous paper in the\nlow-frequency regime, where waves are trapped near the equatorial plane. We put\nthe equations of ray dynamics into a separable form and used the EBK\nquantisation method to compute modes frequencies from rays.\n  Results.

In this paper, we study this process\nvia smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the disruption and\nearly debris evolution including the stellar magnetic field. As the gas\nstretches into a stream, we show that the magnetic field evolution is strongly\ndependent on its orientation with respect to the stretching direction. In\nparticular, an alignment of the field lines with the direction of stretching\ninduces an increase of the magnetic energy. For disruptions happening well\nwithin the tidal radius, the star compression causes the magnetic field\nstrength to sharply increase by an order of magnitude at the time of pericentre\npassage. If the disruption is partial, we find evidence for a dynamo process\noccurring inside the surviving core due to the formation of vortices. This\ncauses an amplification of the magnetic field strength by a factor of $\\sim\n10$. However, this value represents a lower limit since it increases with\nnumerical resolution. For an initial field strength of 1 G, the magnetic field\nnever becomes dynamically important. Instead, the disruption of a star with a\nstrong 1 MG magnetic field produces a debris stream within which magnetic\npressure becomes similar to gas pressure a few tens of hours after disruption.\nIf the remnant of one or multiple partial disruptions is eventually fully\ndisrupted, its magnetic field could be large enough to magnetically power the\nrelativistic jet detected from Swift J1644+57.

Two\nlarge sets of SSMs, each based on a different canonical set of solar abundances\nwith high and low metallicity (Z), are computed to determine model\nuncertainties and correlations among different observables. We present detailed\ncomparisons of high- and low-Z models against different ensembles of solar\nobservables including solar neutrinos, surface helium abundance, depth of\nconvective envelope and sound speed profile. A global comparison, including all\nobservables, yields a p-value of 2.7$\\sigma$ for the high-Z model and\n4.7$\\sigma$ for the low-Z one.

In this framework we monitored the\nstar, hosting two giant planets, HD108874, with HARPS-N for three years in\norder to refine the orbits, to improve the dynamical study and to search for\nadditional low-mass planets in close orbits. We subtracted the radial velocity\n(RV) signal due to the known outer planets, finding a clear modulation of 40.2\nd period.

The main goal of this study is to examine the\nradial profiles of the gas-phase Fe/{\\alpha} ratio in galaxy halos based on the\nobserved Fe II to Mg II column density ratios.

For\nquiescent galaxies, a median and dispersion of log <N(Fe II)/N(Mg II)>\n=-0.06+/-0.15 is found at d<~60 kpc, which declines to log <N(Fe II)/N(Mg II)>\n<-0.3 at d>~100 kpc.

Thermal emission during\nthermonuclear X-ray bursts from NSs in low-mass X-ray binaries provides a\nunique opportunity to study NS parameters, because of the high fluxes, large\nluminosity variations and the related changes in the spectral properties. The\nstandard cooling tail method uses hot NS atmosphere models to convert the\nobserved spectral evolution during cooling stages of X-ray bursts to the\nEddington flux F_Edd and the stellar angular size \\Omega. These are then\ntranslated to the constraints on the NS mass M and radius R. Here we present\nthe improved, direct cooling tail method that generalises the standard\napproach. First, we adjust the cooling tail method to account for the\nbolometric correction to the flux. Then, we fit the observed dependence of the\nblackbody normalization on flux with a theoretical model directly on the M-R\nplane by interpolating theoretical dependences to a given gravity, hence\nensuring only weakly informative priors for M and R instead of F_Edd and\n\\Omega.\n  The direct cooling method is demonstrated using a photospheric radius\nexpansion burst from SAX J1810.8--2609, which has happened when the system was\nin the hard state.

This is among the densest spectroscopic coverage, and\nbest-constrained rising lightcurve, for a fast-declining hydrogen-poor SLSN.\nThe bolometric lightcurve can be reproduced with a millisecond magnetar model\nwith ~ 4 M_sol ejecta mass, and the temperature and velocity evolution is also\nsuggestive of a magnetar as the power source.

Next we turn to the question of learning,\nwhich is especially important for the practical applications of the model. So\nfar, learning of the Choquet integral has been mostly confined to the learning\nof the capacity. Such an approach requires making a powerful assumption that\nall dimensions (e.g. criteria) are evaluated on the same scale, which is rarely\njustified in practice. Too often categorical data is given arbitrary numerical\nlabels (e.g. AHP), and numerical data is considered cardinally and ordinally\ncommensurate, sometimes after a simple normalization.

Second, we\nobserve that EJR is incompatible with the Perfect Representation criterion,\nwhich is important for many applications of multi-winner voting, and propose a\nrelaxation of EJR, which we call Proportional Justified Representation (PJR).\nPJR is more demanding than JR, but, unlike EJR, it is compatible with perfect\nrepresentation, and a committee that provides PJR can be computed in polynomial\ntime if the committee size divides the number of voters. Moreover, just like\nEJR, PJR can be used to characterize the classic PAV rule in the class of\nweighted PAV rules.

In the case of lead chalcogenide NCs, for example, replacing thiols\nwith halide anion surface termination has been shown to increase power\nconversion efficiency in NC-based solar cells. To gain insight into the origins\nof these improvements, we perform ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) on\nexperimentally-relevant sized lead sulfide (PbS) NCs constructed with thiol or\nCl, Br, and I anion surfaces. The surface of both the thiol- and\nhalide-terminated NCs exhibit low and high-energy phonon modes with large\nthermal displacements not present in bulk PbS; however, halide anion surface\ntermination reduces the overlap of the electronic wavefunctions with these\nvibration modes. These findings suggest that electron-phonon interactions will\nbe reduced in the halide terminated NCs, a conclusion that is supported by\nanalyzing the time-dependent evolution of the electronic energies and\nwavefunctions extracted from the AIMD. This work explains why electron-phonon\ninteractions are crucial to charge carrier dynamics in NCs and how surface\nengineering can be applied to systematically control their electronic and\nphononic properties. Furthermore, we propose that the computationally efficient\napproach of gauging electron-phonon interaction implemented here can be used to\nguide the design of application-specific surface terminations for arbitrary\nnanomaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 22:53:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-24"}

Then, an optimal PDM is determined by jointly maximizing all the\nresponse maps simultaneously, with a global shape constraint.

In this sense, our approach is a unified framework for\nmodeling both contextual cues and visual appearance of person instances. Our\nmodel is trained end-to-end with a sequence of annotated instances in a photo\nas inputs, and a sequence of corresponding labels as targets. We demonstrate\nthat this simple but elegant formulation achieves state-of-the-art performance\non the newly released People In Photo Albums (PIPA) dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 01:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-01"}

An one dimensional model of linear\nperturbation, which neglects dependence of variables on the coordinate along\nthe rotational axis of the star, is solved to obtain stable and unstable\neigenmodes. A linear eigenmode having a corotation radius, at which azimuthal\npattern speed of the mode coincides with the stellar angular velocity, is\ncategorized to either a complex (growing or damping) mode or a purely real mode\nbelonging to a continuous spectrum of frequency. We compute canonical angular\nmomentum and its flux to study eigenmodes with corotation radius. In a\ndynamically unstable mode, sound wave transports its angular momentum in such a\nway that the absolute value of the angular momentum is increased on both sides\nof the corotation radius. We further evaluate growth of amplitude of reflected\nsound wave incident to a corotation point and find that the over-reflection of\nthe wave and the trapping of it between the corotation radius and the surface\nof the star may qualitatively explain dependences of eigenfrequencies on the\nstellar differential rotation. The results suggest that the low $T/W$\ninstability may be caused by over-reflection of sound waves trapped mainly\nbetween the surface of the star and a corotation radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 02:28:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

With very precise Gaia parallaxes becoming\navailable in the near future, angular diameters with a precision better than 1%\nwill be abundant. At that point, the main uncertainty in the total error budget\nof the SBC relations will come from transformations between different\nphotometric systems, disentangling of component magnitudes, and for hot OB\nstars, the main uncertainty will come from the interstellar extinction\ndetermination.

Many\nwidely-used data structures (e.g., bitmap indices in databases) rely on fast\nbitwise operations on large bit vectors to achieve high performance.\nUnfortunately, in existing systems, regardless of the underlying architecture\n(e.g., CPU, GPU, FPGA), the throughput of such bulk bitwise operations is\nlimited by the available memory bandwidth.\n  We propose Buddy, a new mechanism that exploits the analog operation of DRAM\nto perform bulk bitwise operations completely inside the DRAM chip. Buddy\nconsists of two components. First, simultaneous activation of three DRAM rows\nthat are connected to the same set of sense amplifiers enables us to perform\nbitwise AND and OR operations. Second, the inverters present in each sense\namplifier enables us to perform bitwise NOT operations, with modest changes to\nthe DRAM array. These two components make Buddy functionally complete. Our\nimplementation of Buddy largely exploits the existing DRAM structure and\ninterface, and incurs low overhead (1% of DRAM chip area).\n  Our evaluations based on SPICE simulations show that, across seven\ncommonly-used bitwise operations, Buddy provides between 10.9X---25.6X\nimprovement in raw throughput and 25.1X---59.5X reduction in energy\nconsumption. We evaluate three real-world data-intensive applications that\nexploit bitwise operations: 1) bitmap indices, 2) BitWeaving, and 3)\nbitvector-based implementation of sets.

The essential idea is to fabricate a single layered\nperiodic elastic composite with constituent materials that have\ntemperature-dependent properties. As temperature is changed, such a composite\nexhibits a band structure that changes with the change in temperature. Once a\ndesired band structure is attained and the corresponding constituent properties\nare identified, then new constituents that have those properties at the\nrequired temperature can be selected and new sample fabricated. We fabricated a\n2-phase composite with periodic layers of polyurea and steel. The temperature\nis changed from -20{\\deg}C to 60{\\deg}C and ultrasonic measurements are\nperformed on the sample over 0.15 to 2.2MHz at each temperature. The first\nthree pass bands are captured experimentally and significant change in the band\nstructure is observed over the test temperature range. Experimental\ntransmission spectrum at each temperature is compared with the theoretical band\nstructure and it is shown that good agreement exists for the observed variation\nin the band structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 05:23:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-01"}

These sets are\nknown to be the main culprits in the error floor region of such codes. The\ncharacterization of ETSs for irregular codes has been known to be a challenging\nproblem due to the large variety of non-isomorphic ETS structures that can\nexist within the Tanner graph of these codes. This is a direct consequence of\nthe variety of the degrees of the variable nodes that can participate in such\nstructures. The proposed characterization is based on a hierarchical graphical\nrepresentation of ETSs, starting from simple cycles of the graph, or from\nsingle variable nodes, and involves three simple expansion techniques:\ndegree-one tree ($dot$), $path$ and $lollipop$, thus, the terminology {\\em dpl\ncharacterization}. A similar dpl characterization was proposed in an earlier\nwork by the authors for the leafless ETSs (LETSs) of variable-regular LDPC\ncodes. The present paper generalizes the prior work to codes with a variety of\nvariable node degrees and to ETSs that are not leafless. The proposed dpl\ncharacterization corresponds to an efficient search algorithm that, for a given\nirregular LDPC code, can find all the instances of $(a,b)$ ETSs with size $a$\nand with the number of unsatisfied check nodes $b$ within any range of interest\n$a \\leq a_{max}$ and $b \\leq b_{max}$, exhaustively. Although, (brute force)\nexhaustive search algorithms for ETSs of irregular LDPC codes exist, to the\nbest of our knowledge, the proposed search algorithm is the first of its kind,\nin that, it is devised based on a characterization of ETSs that makes the\nsearch process efficient. Extensive simulation results are presented to show\nthe versatility of the search algorithm, and to demonstrate that, compared to\nthe literature, significant improvement in search speed can be obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 06:12:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-01"}

A\nflare occurrence near the light wall caused material to erupt from the lower\nsolar atmosphere into the corona. Some material falls back to the solar\nsurface, and hits the light bridge (i.e., the base of the light wall), then\nsudden brightenings appear at the wall base followed by the rise of wall top,\nleading to an increase of the wall height. Once the brightness of the wall base\nfades, the height of the light wall begins to decrease. Five hours later,\nanother nearby flare takes place, a bright channel is formed that extends from\nthe flare towards the light bridge. Although no obvious material flow along the\nbright channel is found, some ejected material is conjectured to reach the\nlight bridge. Subsequently, the wall base brightens and the wall height begins\nto increase again. Once more, when the brightness of the wall base decays, the\nwall top fluctuates to lower heights. We suggest, based on the observed cases,\nthat the interaction of falling material and ejected flare material with the\nlight wall results in the brightenings of wall base and causes the height of\nthe light wall to increase.

It has various\nconfiguration parameters (knobs) which play an important role in deciding the\nperformance i.e., the execution time of a given big data processing job.\nDefault values of these parameters do not always result in good performance and\nhence it is important to tune them. However, there is inherent difficulty in\ntuning the parameters due to two important reasons - firstly, the parameter\nsearch space is large and secondly, there are cross-parameter interactions.\nHence, there is a need for a dimensionality-free method which can automatically\ntune the configuration parameters by taking into account the cross-parameter\ndependencies.

Finally, in the context of gauge theories\nsupplemented with a fundamental Higgs field, we use <A^h A^h> to probe the pole\nstructure of the massive gauge boson in a gauge invariant fashion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 10:15:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Dec 2016 11:27:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

In theory, the claim is well founded in the\nfact that many biologically relevant interactions between residues of protein\nsequences have a character of nested or crossed dependencies. In practice,\nthere is hardly any evidence that grammars of higher expressiveness have an\nedge over old good HMMs in typical applications including recognition and\nclassification of protein sequences. This is in contrast to RNA modeling, where\nCFG power some of the most successful tools. There have been proposed several\nexplanations of this phenomenon. On the biology side, one difficulty is that\ninteractions in proteins are often less specific and more \"collective\" in\ncomparison to RNA. On the modeling side, a difficulty is the larger alphabet\nwhich combined with high complexity of CF and CS grammars imposes considerable\ntrade-offs consisting on information reduction or learning sub-optimal\nsolutions. Indeed, some studies hinted that CF level of expressiveness brought\nan added value in protein modeling when CF and regular grammars where\nimplemented in the same framework. However, there have been no systematic study\nof explanatory power provided by various grammatical models. The first step to\nthis goal is define objective criteria of such evaluation. Intuitively, a\ndecent explanatory grammar should generate topology, or the parse tree,\nconsistent with topology of the protein, or its secondary and/or tertiary\nstructure. In this piece of research we build on this intuition and propose a\nset of measures to compare topology of the parse tree of a grammar with\ntopology of the protein structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 10:20:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2017 10:52:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-30"}

Although there is not a general consensus among\nresearchers yet, many studies point that scale-free topologies, where few\nhighly related firms are combined with many low-related firms, assure the\nhighest efficiency of a supply chain. This paper studies the network topology\nthat leads to the highest agility of the supply chain when sudden demand\nchanges occur. To do this, an agent-based model of a supply chain with\nrestricted relationship between agents is built. The model includes three\ntiers, where the flow of material is distributed from the bottom supplier to\nthe final customer passing necessarily through firms in every tier. Agility is\nmeasured in the model simulations through the order fulfillment rate. Unlike to\nprevious theoretical and lab results, the simulation of the model shows that\nthe highest levels of agility are not obtained with a scale-free topology.\nInstead, homogeneous distribution of links, such as those induced by regular or\nPoisson probability laws, shows higher agility values than heterogeneous\ndistributions. Other previous recommendations, such as redundancy or having\nmultiple suppliers, are confirmed by the simulations. The general conclusion is\nthat the most suitable network topology in terms of agility depends on the\nspecific conditions of the supply chain and the aspects of the performance to\nbe analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 11:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-01"}

Multicast\nbeamforming design is a well-known non-convex quadratically constrained\nquadratic programming (QCQP) problem. A conventional method to tackle this\nproblem is to approximate it as a semi-definite programming problem via\nsemi-definite relaxation, whose performance, however, deteriorates considerably\nas the number of per-group users goes large. A recent attempt is to apply\nconvex-concave procedure (CCP) to find a stationary solution by treating it as\na difference of convex programming problem, whose complexity, however,\nincreases dramatically as the problem size increases. In this paper, we propose\na low-complexity high-performance algorithm for multi-group multicast\nbeamforming design in large-scale wireless systems by leveraging the\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) together with CCP. In\nspecific, the original non-convex QCQP problem is first approximated as a\nsequence of convex subproblems via CCP. Each convex subproblem is then\nreformulated as a novel ADMM form. Our ADMM reformulation enables that each\nupdating step is performed by solving multiple small-size subproblems with\nclosed-form solutions in parallel.

We suggest that, even at the simplest level, the\ninternal structure of a fractal cluster requires the specification of three\nparameters. (i) The 3D fractal dimension, $\\mathcal{D}$, measures the extent to\nwhich the clusters on one level of the nested hierarchy fill the volume of\ntheir parent cluster. (ii) The number of levels, $\\mathcal{L}$, reflects the\nfinite ratio between the linear size of the large root-cluster at the top of\nthe hierarchy, and the smallest leaf-clusters at the bottom of the hierarchy.\n(iii) The volume-density scaling exponent, $\\mathcal{C}=-\\textrm{d}\\ln[\\delta\nn]/\\textrm{d}\\ln[L]$ measures the factor by which the excess density, $\\delta\nn$, in a structure of scale $L$, exceeds that of the background formed by\nlarger structures; it is similar, but not exactly equivalent, to the exponent\nin Larson's scaling relation between density and size for molecular clouds.

This paper proposes an effective and robust\napproach for facial landmark detection by combining data- and model-driven\nmethods. Firstly, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) is trained to compute\nresponse maps of all facial landmark points. Such a data-driven method could\nmake full use of holistic information in a facial image for global estimation\nof facial landmarks. After that, the maximum points in the response maps are\nfitted with a pre-trained Point Distribution Model (PDM) to generate the\ninitial facial shape. This model-driven method is able to correct the\ninaccurate locations of outliers by considering the shape prior information.\nFinally, a weighted version of Regularized Landmark Mean-Shift (RLMS) is\nemployed to fine-tune the facial shape iteratively. This\nEstimation-Correction-Tuning process perfectly combines the advantages of the\nglobal robustness of data-driven method (FCN), outlier correction capability of\nmodel-driven method (PDM) and non-parametric optimization of RLMS.

Bayesian Networks (BN) have been shown to be a viable means for\nassessment and prediction incorporating variables with uncertainty. This paper\ndescribes how activity-based quality models can be used to derive BN models for\nquality assessment and pre- diction. The proposed approach is demonstrated in a\nproof of concept using publicly available data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 14:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-01"}

Google Android, an\nopen-source mobile Operating System (OS), is currently the market leader.\nAndroid popularity has motivated the malware authors to employ set of cyber\nattacks leveraging code obfuscation techniques. Obfuscation is an action that\nmodifies an application (app) code, preserving the original semantics and\nfunctionality to evade anti-malware. Code obfuscation is a contentious issue.\nTheoretical code analysis techniques indicate that, attaining a verifiable and\nsecure obfuscation is impossible. However, obfuscation tools and techniques are\npopular both among malware developers (to evade anti-malware) and commercial\nsoftware developers (protect intellectual rights). We conducted a survey to\nuncover answers to concrete and relevant questions concerning Android code\nobfuscation and protection techniques. The purpose of this paper is to review\ncode obfuscation and code protection practices, and evaluate efficacy of\nexisting code de-obfuscation tools. In particular, we discuss Android code\nobfuscation methods, custom app protection techniques, and various\nde-obfuscation methods. Furthermore, we review and analyse the obfuscation\ntechniques used by malware authors to evade analysis efforts. We believe that,\nthere is a need to investigate efficiency of the defense techniques used for\ncode protection.

The\nNavier-Stokes equation has an extra force term which reflects the\nnon-commutativity of the space, being proportional to $\\theta^2$. This\nparameter $\\theta$ is related to the minimum size of fluid particles which is\nimplied by the uncertainty principle, $\\Delta x \\Delta y \\ge \\theta/2$. To see\nthe effect of this parameter on the flow, following situation is considered. An\nobstacle placed in the middle of the stream, separates the flow into small slit\nand large slit, but the flow is joined afterwards in the down stream. For the\nReynolds number 700, the behavior of the flows with and without $\\theta$ is\nobserved to differ, and the difference is seen to be correlated to the\ndifference of the activity of vortices in the down stream. The oscillation of\nthe flow rate at the small slit diminishes after the certain time in the usual\nflow when the \"two attached eddies\" appear. In the non-commutative flow this\ntwo attached eddies appear from the beginning and the behavior of the flows\ndoes not fluctuate largely. The irregularity in the flow existing in the\nbeginning disappears after the certain time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Nov 2016 01:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}
