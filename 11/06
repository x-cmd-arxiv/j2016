These methods are cumbersome and lack flexibility. Here we propose a\nconvenient framework for numerically solving the forward problem of\ntime-distance helioseismology in the frequency domain. The fundamental quantity\nto be computed is the cross-covariance of the seismic wavefield. We choose\nsources of wave excitation that enable us to relate the cross-covariance of the\noscillations to the Green's function in a straightforward manner. We illustrate\nthe method by considering the 3D acoustic wave equation in an axisymmetric\nreference solar model, ignoring the effects of gravity on the waves. The\nsymmetry of the background model around the rotation axis implies that the\nGreen's function can be written as a sum of longitudinal Fourier modes, leading\nto a set of independent 2D problems. We use a high-order finite-element method\nto solve the 2D wave equation in frequency space. The computation is\n`embarrassingly parallel', with each frequency and each azimuthal order solved\nindependently on a computer cluster. We compute travel-time sensitivity kernels\nin spherical geometry for flows, sound speed, and density perturbations under\nthe first Born approximation. Convergence tests show that travel times can be\ncomputed with a numerical precision better than one millisecond, as required by\nthe most precise travel-time measurements. The method presented here is\ncomputationally efficient and will be used to interpret travel-time\nmeasurements in order to infer, e.g., the large-scale meridional flow in the\nsolar convection zone. It allows the implementation of (full-waveform)\niterative inversions, whereby the axisymmetric background model is updated at\neach iteration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2016 16:24:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-29"}

The FI is\ncalculated simply as the proportion $f$ of accumulated age related deficits\nrelative to the total, leading to a theoretical maximum of $f \\leq 1$.\nObservational studies have generally reported a much more stringent bound, with\n$f \\leq f_{max} <1$. The value of $f_{max}$ in observational studies appears to\nbe non-universal, but $f_{max} \\approx 0.7$ is often reported. A previously\ndeveloped network model of individual aging was unable to recover $f_{max}<1$\nwhile retaining the other observed phenomenology of increasing $f$ and\nmortality rates with age. We have developed a computationally accelerated\nnetwork model that also allows us to tune the scale-free network exponent\n$\\alpha$. The network exponent $\\alpha$ significantly affects the growth of\nmortality rates with age. However, we are only able to recover $f_{max}$ by\nalso introducing a deficit sensitivity parameter $1-q$, which is equivalent to\na false-negative rate $q$. Our value of $q=0.3$ is comparable to finite\nsensitivities of age-related deficits with respect to mortality that are often\nreported in the literature. In light of non-zero $q$, we use mutual information\n$I$ to provide a non-parametric measure of the predictive value of the FI with\nrespect to individual mortality. We find that $I$ is only modestly degraded by\n$q<1$, and this degradation is mitigated when increasing number of deficits are\nincluded in the FI. We also find that the information spectrum, i.e. the mutual\ninformation of individual deficits vs connectivity, has an approximately\npower-law dependence that depends on the network exponent $\\alpha$. Mutual\ninformation $I$ is therefore a useful tool for characterizing the network\ntopology of aging populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2016 17:39:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-21"}

The model realizes an interaction-driven quantum\nphase transition between an ergodic and a many-body localized phase (MBL). We\npropose a single-particle framework to characterize these phases by the\neigenstates (the natural orbitals) and the eigenvalues (the occupation\nspectrum) of the one-particle density matrix (OPDM) in many-body eigenstates.\nAs a main result, we find that the natural orbitals are localized in the MBL\nphase, but delocalized in the ergodic phase. This qualitative change in these\nsingle-particle states is a many-body effect, since without interactions the\nsingle-particle energy eigenstates are all localized. The occupation spectrum\nin the ergodic phase is thermal in agreement with the eigenstate thermalization\nhypothesis, while in the MBL phase the occupations preserve a discontinuity at\nan emergent Fermi edge. This suggests that the MBL eigenstates are weakly\ndressed Slater determinants, with the eigenstates of the underlying Anderson\nproblem as reference states. We discuss the statistical properties of the\nnatural orbitals and of the occupation spectrum in the two phases and as the\ntransition is approached. Our results are consistent with the existing picture\nof emergent integrability and localized integrals of motion, or quasiparticles,\nin the MBL phase. We emphasize the close analogy of the MBL phase to a\nzero-temperature Fermi liquid: in the studied model, the MBL phase is\nadiabatically connected to the Anderson insulator and the occupation-spectrum\ndiscontinuity directly indicates the presence of quasiparticles localized in\nreal space. Finally, we show that the same picture emerges for interacting\nfermions in the presence of an experimentally-relevant bichromatic lattice and\nthereby demonstrate that our findings are not limited to a specific model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2016 18:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}

Structuring\ntechniques provide means to control complexity, the latter being a relevant\nfactor for the introduction of design faults. This fact and the ever increasing\ncomplexity of today's distributed software justify the need for simple,\ncoherent, and effective structures for the expression of fault-tolerance in the\napplication software. A first contribution of this dissertation is the\ndefinition of a base of structural attributes with which application-level\nfault-tolerance structures can be qualitatively assessed and compared with each\nother and with respect to the above mentioned need. This result is then used to\nprovide an elaborated survey of the state-of-the-art of software\nfault-tolerance structures. The key contribution of this work is a novel\nstructuring technique for the expression of the fault-tolerance design concerns\nin the application layer of those distributed software systems that are\ncharacterized by soft real-time requirements and with a number of processing\nnodes known at compile-time. The main thesis of this dissertation is that this\nnew structuring technique is capable of exhibiting satisfactory values of the\nstructural attributes in the domain of soft real-time, distributed and parallel\napplications. Following this novel approach, beside the conventional\nprogramming language addressing the functional design concerns, a\nspecial-purpose linguistic structure (the so-called \"recovery language\") is\navailable to address error recovery and reconfiguration. This recovery language\ncomes into play as soon as an error is detected by an underlying error\ndetection layer, or when some erroneous condition is signaled by the\napplication processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2016 19:29:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-08"}

Assuming meaning of the signal or the semantic information is in its\nshape, we can say that P(s(t)) is the rate at which kinetic energy of the\nparticle is dissipated to encode semantic information in s(t) at t. After s(t)\nis digitized (to make it s[n]) the discrete form P(s[n]) is valid. Considering\nthe sign changes of P(s[n]) it has been shown that in the smallest neighborhood\nof n, in which n is the middle point, semantic information in s[n] can be\nencoded in 13 distinct ways. This list is exhaustive. A deterministic finite\nautomaton (DFA) has been designed which can accept any finite length digital\nsignal and therefore collection of all finite length digital signals forms a\nregular language. The DFA has been generalized to a weighted finite state\ntransducer (WFST), which has been used to identify action potentials in a spike\ntrain and also to distinguish two speakers when uttering the same phoneme. It\nhas been shown that in any analog signal semantic information can be encoded at\na point in the form of the shape of its infinitesimal neighborhood in 17\ndistinct ways. The list is exhaustive. A new entropy measure called semantic\nentropy has been introduced.

Because of their sequential\nnature, RNNs are good at capturing the local structure of a word sequence -\nboth semantic and syntactic - but might face difficulty remembering long-range\ndependencies. Intuitively, these long-range dependencies are of semantic\nnature. In contrast, latent topic models are able to capture the global\nunderlying semantic structure of a document but do not account for word\nordering. The proposed TopicRNN model integrates the merits of RNNs and latent\ntopic models: it captures local (syntactic) dependencies using an RNN and\nglobal (semantic) dependencies using latent topics.

Recently, efforts have been made in designing objective quality\nmetrics trained on subjective data (e.g. VMAF), demonstrating better\ncorrelation with video quality perceived by human. Clearly, the accuracy of\nsuch a metric heavily depends on the quality of the subjective data that it is\ntrained on. In this paper, we propose a new approach to recover subjective\nquality scores from noisy raw measurements, using maximum likelihood\nestimation, by jointly estimating the subjective quality of impaired videos,\nthe bias and consistency of test subjects, and the ambiguity of video contents\nall together.

The observed fluvio-lacustrine\ndeposits suggest that individual lake-forming climates persisted for at least\nseveral thousand years (assuming dilute flow). But the lake watersheds' little\nweathered soils indicate a largely dry climate history, with intermittent\nrunoff events. Here we show that these observational constraints, while\ninconsistent with many previously-proposed triggers for lake-forming climates,\nare consistent with a methane burst scenario. In this scenario, chaotic\ntransitions in mean obliquity drive latitudinal shifts in temperature and ice\nloading that destabilize methane clathrate. Using numerical simulations, we\nfind that outgassed methane can build up to atmospheric levels sufficient for\nlake forming climates, for past clathrate hydrate stability zone occupancy\nfractions >0.04. Such occupancy fractions are consistent with methane\nproduction by water-rock reactions due to hydrothermal circulation on early\nMars. We further estimate that photochemical destruction of atmospheric methane\ncurtails the duration of individual lake-forming climates to less than a\nmillion years, consistent with observations. We conclude that methane bursts\nrepresent a potential pathway for intermittent excursions to a warm, wet\nclimate state on early Mars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2016 01:58:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Nov 2018 18:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-11-26"}

The average nuclear recoil direction is expected to coincide with the\naverage direction of dark matter particles arriving to Earth. Here we point out\nthat for a particular type of dark matter, inelastic exothermic dark matter,\nthe mean recoil direction as well as a secondary feature, a ring of maximum\nrecoil rate around the mean recoil direction, could instead be opposite to the\naverage dark matter arrival direction.

This result suggests that image\nquality information is available in the DCNN features, such that consistently\naverage feature values reflect coding failures that reliably indicate poor or\nunusable images.

Since ResNet, we are able to train very deep CNNs as the\ngradient vanishing issue has been largely addressed by the introduction of skip\nconnections. However, we observe that, when the depth is very large, the\nintermediate layers (especially shallow layers) may fail to receive sufficient\nsupervision from the loss due to the severe transformation through a long\nbackpropagation path. As a result, the representation power of intermediate\nlayers can be very weak and the model becomes very redundant with limited\nperformance.

Traditional methods for determining the\nfrequency response of an optical system (e.g. optical cavity or waveguide\nmodulator) usually rely on calibrated broadband photo-detectors or complicated\nRF mixdown operations. As the bandwidths of these devices continue to increase,\nthere is a growing need for a characterization method that does not have\nbandwidth limitations, or require a previously calibrated device. We\ndemonstrate a new calibration technique on an optical system (consisting of an\noptical cavity and a high-speed waveguide modulator) that is free from\nlimitations imposed by detector bandwidth, and does not require a calibrated\nphoto-detector or modulator. We use a low-frequency (DC) photo-detector to\nmonitor the cavity's optical response as a function of modulation frequency,\nwhich is also used to determine the modulator's frequency response. Knowledge\nof the frequency-dependent modulation depth allows us to more precisely\ndetermine the cavity's characteristics (free spectral range and linewidth). The\nprecision and repeatability of our technique is demonstrated by measuring the\ndifferent resonant frequencies of orthogonal polarization cavity modes caused\nby the presence of a non-linear crystal. Once the modulator has been\ncharacterized using this simple method, the frequency response of any passive\noptical element can be determined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2016 15:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

It is related to the necessary doubling of the Fock\nSpace (as in the Barut and Ziino works), thus extending the corresponding\nClifford Algebra. However, the logical interrelations of different mathematical\nfoundations with the physical interpretations are not so obvious. Physics\nshould choose only one correct formalism, it is not clear, why two correct\nmathematical formalisms (which are based on the same postulates) lead to\ndifferent physical results?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2016 16:25:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Aug 2018 15:11:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-08-28"}

The\ncomposite medium is considered to be constructed by juxtaposition together of\nmagnetic and semiconductor layers providing all characteristic dimensions of\nthe resulting multilayered system are much smaller than the wavelength in the\ncorresponding part of the composite medium. The waveguide dispersion equation\nand its eigenmodes are derived. The mode classification is made in a standard\nmanner so that the guided modes are sorted into a class of hybrid HE and EH\nwaves in terms of their unique dispersion characteristics. The numerical\nresults are obtained in the band near the frequencies of corresponding\nresonances in constitutive materials of the composite medium, and they show\nthat the modes behaviors become to be quite diverse due to manifestation of a\nstrong combined geometrical and material dispersion related to the waveguide\nparameters and gyroelectromagnetic filling, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2016 12:38:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2017 13:42:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-10"}

The interesting thing about the Plankonion is\nthat it has an onion like structure.
