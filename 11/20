In general, it is hard to design a tracking\nmodel suitable for all object categories, e.g., a rigid tracker for a car is\nnot suitable for a deformable gymnast. Category-based trackers usually achieve\nsuperior tracking performance for the objects of that specific category, but\nhave difficulties being generalised. Therefore, we propose a novel unified\nrobust tracking framework which explicitly encodes both generic features and\ncategory-based features. The tracker consists of a shared convolutional network\n(NetS), which feeds into two parallel networks, NetC for classification and\nNetT for tracking. NetS is pre-trained on ImageNet to serve as a generic\nfeature extractor across the different object categories for NetC and NetT.\nNetC utilises those features within fully connected layers to classify the\nobject category. NetT has multiple branches, corresponding to multiple\ncategories, to distinguish the tracked object from the background. Since each\nbranch in NetT is trained by the videos of a specific category or groups of\nsimilar categories, NetT encodes category-based features for tracking. During\nonline tracking, NetC and NetT jointly determine the target regions with the\nright category and foreground labels for target estimation. To improve the\nrobustness and precision, NetC and NetT inter-supervise each other and trigger\nnetwork adaptation when their outputs are ambiguous for the same image regions\n(i.e., when the category label contradicts the foreground/background\nclassification). We have compared the performance of our tracker to other\nstate-of-the-art trackers on a large-scale tracking benchmark (100\nsequences)---the obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\ntracker as it outperformed other 38 state-of-the-art tracking algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2016 16:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-22"}

The\nproperties of the extended clusters are remarkably similar to those of dwarf\ngalaxies: high inferred mass-to-light ratios due to binaries; binary properties\nmildly affected by dynamical evolution; no observable mass segregation; and\nflattened stellar mass function.

This paper argues why a uniform prior is\nunreasonable and introduces the use of a penalised complexity (PC) prior for H.\nThe PC prior is computed to penalise divergence from the special case of white\nnoise, and is invariant to reparameterisations. An immediate advantage is that\nthe exact same prior can be used for the autocorrelation coefficient of a\nfirst-order autoregressive process AR(1), as this model also reflects a\nflexible version of white noise.

We aim to redetermine\nthe oxygen ratios in these stars using new spectral analysis tools and further\ndevelop discussions on the carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios in order to\nelucidate this problem. Oxygen isotopic ratios were derived from spectra in the\nK-band in a sample of galactic AGB carbon stars of different spectral types and\nnear solar metallicity. Synthetic spectra calculated in LTE with spherical\ncarbon-rich atmosphere models and updated molecular line lists were used. The\nCNO isotope ratios derived in a homogeneous way, were compared with theoretical\npredictions for low-mass (1.5-3 M_o) AGB stars computed with the FUNS code\nassuming extra mixing both during the RGB and AGB phases. For most of the stars\nthe 16O/17O/18O ratios derived are in good agreement with theoretical\npredictions confirming that, for AGB stars, are established using the values\nreached after the FDU according to the initial stellar mass. This fact, as far\nas the oxygen isotopic ratios are concerned, leaves little space for the\noperation of any extra mixing mechanism during the AGB phase. Nevertheless, for\na few stars with large 16O/17O/18O, the operation of such a mechanism might be\nrequired, although their observed 12C/13C and 14N/15N ratios would be difficult\nto reconcile within this scenario. Furthermore, J-type stars tend to have lower\n16O/17O ratios than the normal carbon stars, as already indicated in previous\nstudies. Excluding these peculiar stars, AGB carbon stars occupy the same\nregion as pre-solar type I oxide grains in a 17O/16O vs. 18O/16O diagram,\nshowing little spread.

Here, we use a\nquasi-two-dimensional nematically ordered layer of a protein-based active gel\nto experimentally demonstrate that the geometry of active flows, which we have\ncharacterized by means of the statistical distribution of eddy sizes, can be\nreversibly modified. To this purpose, the active material is prepared in\ncontact with a thermotropic liquid crystal, whose lamellar smectic-A phase\ntiles the water/oil interface with a lattice of anisotropic domains that\nfeature circular easy-flow directions. The active flow, which arises from the\nmotion of parabolic folds within the filamentous active material, becomes\neffectively confined into circulating eddies that are in registry with the\nunderlying smectic-A domains. Based on topological arguments applied to the\ncircular confinement, together with well-known properties of the active\nmaterial, we show that the structure of the active flow is determined by a\nsingle intrinsic length scale. The role of this length scale thus reemerges\nfrom setting the decay length in the exponential eddy size distribution of the\nfree turbulent regime, to determining the minimum size of circulating eddies\nfeaturing a scale-free power law. Our results demonstrate that soft-confinement\nprovides with an invaluable tool to probe the intrinsic length and time scales\nof active materials, and pave the way for further exploration looking for\nsimilarities and differences between active and passive two-dimensional\nturbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2016 19:37:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-11-01"}

In this paper, we compute\nthe flux emergence rate (FER) by accounting for such small fluxes, which was\nnot possible before Sunrise. By tracking the features with fluxes in the range\n10^15-10^18 Mx, we measure an FER of 1100 Mx cm^-2 day^-1.

However, the ABC formulation has\nso far only been applied in combination with a special torsion-free beam model,\nwhich yields a very simple and efficient finite element formulation, but which\nis restricted to initially straight beams with isotropic cross-sections. In\norder to abstain from these restrictions, the current work combines the ABC\nformulation with a geometrically exact Kirchhoff-Love beam element formulation\nthat is capable of treating even the most general cases of slender beam\nproblems in terms of initial geometry and external loads. While the neglect of\nshear deformation that is inherent to this formulation has been shown to\nprovide considerable numerical advantages in the range of high beam slenderness\nratios, alternative shear-deformable beam models are required for examples with\nthick beams. The current contribution additionally proposes a novel\ngeometrically exact beam element based on the Simo-Reissner theory. Similar to\nthe torsion-free and the Kirchhoff-Love beam elements, also this Simo-Reissner\nelement is based on a C1-continuous Hermite interpolation of the beam\ncenterline, which will allow for smooth contact kinematics. For this Hermitian\nSimo-Reissner element, a consistent spatial convergence behavior as well as the\nsuccessful avoidance of membrane and shear locking will be demonstrated\nnumerically. All in all, the combination of the ABC formulation with these\ndifferent beam element variants (i.e.~the torsion-free element, the\nKirchhoff-Love element and the Simo-Reissner element) results in a very\nflexible and modular simulation framework that allows to choose the optimal\nelement formulation for any given application in terms of accuracy, efficiency\nand robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2016 22:11:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-05-08"}

We use the Heston\nstochastic volatility model to describe the price of a single stock option. In\norder to speed up the calibration process, we apply two model reduction\nstrategies. Firstly, a reduced basis method (RBM) is used to define a suitable\nlow-dimensional basis for the numerical approximation of the\nparameter-dependent partial differential equation ($\\mu$PDE) model. By doing so\nthe computational complexity for solving the $\\mu$PDE is drastically reduced,\nand applications of standard minimization algorithms for the calibration are\nsignificantly faster than working with a high-dimensional finite element basis.\nSecondly, so-called de-Americanization strategies are applied.

Social media is now an indispensable mode of communication; online\ngaming is not only a genuine social activity but also a popular spectator\nsport. With support for anonymity and larger audiences, online interaction\nshrinks social and geographical barriers. Despite such benefits, social\ndisparities such as gender inequality persist in online social media. In\nparticular, online gaming communities have been criticized for persistent\ngender disparities and objectification. As gaming evolves into a social\nplatform, persistence of gender disparity is a pressing question.

Resonance\ncapture requires slow convergent migration of the planets, with sufficiently\nlarge eccentricity damping timescale $T_e$ and small pre-resonance\neccentricities. We quantify these requirements and find that they can be\nsatisfied for super-Earths under protoplanetary disk conditions. For planets\ncaptured into resonance, an equilibrium state can be reached, in which\neccentricity excitation due to resonant planet-planet interaction balances\neccentricity damping due to planet-disk interaction. We show that this\n\"captured\" equilibrium can be overstable, leading to partial or permanent\nescape of the planets from the resonance. In general, the stability of the\ncaptured state depends on the inner to outer planet mass ratio $q=m_1/m_2$ and\nthe ratio of the eccentricity damping times. The overstability growth time is\nof order $T_e$, but can be much larger for systems close to the stability\nthreshold. For low-mass planets undergoing type I (non-gap opening) migration,\nconvergent migration requires $q \\lesssim 1$, while the stability of the\ncapture requires $q\\gtrsim 1$. These results suggest that planet pairs stably\ncaptured into second-order MMRs have comparable masses. This is in contrast to\nfirst-order MMRs, where a larger parameter space exists for stable resonance\ncapture. We confirm and extend our analytical results with $N$-body\nsimulations, and show that for overstable capture, the escape time from the MMR\ncan be comparable to the time the planets spend migrating between resonances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2016 03:02:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Mar 2017 00:50:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Once\na rare galaxy is identified, studying it more effectively requires a set of\ngalaxies of similar morphology, allowing generalization and statistical\nanalysis that cannot be done when $N=1$. Databases generated by digital sky\nsurveys can contain a very large number of galaxy images, and therefore once a\nrare galaxy of interest is identified it is possible that more instances of the\nsame morphology are also present in the database. However, when a researcher\nidentifies a certain galaxy of rare morphology in the database, it is virtually\nimpossible to mine the database manually in the search for galaxies of similar\nmorphology.

We adopt a novel approach that\ndoes not rely on a \"reverse engineering\" method to make explicit the loop\nmomenta, thus avoiding a certain ambiguity pointed out in a recent paper by\nSen, while also keeping the genus of the worldsheet generic. This approach will\nalso be useful in discussions of quantum gravity and in particular in relation\nto black holes in string theory, non-locality and breakdown of local effective\nfield theory, as well as in discussions of cosmic superstrings and their\nphenomenological relevance. We also discuss the manifestation of wave/particle\n(or rather wave/string) duality in string theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2016 10:51:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

To tackle these two challenges, the\nstandard capon beamformer is manipulated to a form where the beamformer output\nis obtained as a scaled version of the inner product of two vectors.

This work is\nmotivated by the thrust of developing a deeper understanding of recurrent\nneural networks, particularly LSTM/GRU-like networks. As the highly complex\nstructure of the recurrent unit in LSTM and GRU networks makes them difficult\nto analyze, our methodology in this research theme is to construct an\nalternative recurrent unit that is as simple as possible and yet also captures\nthe key components of LSTM/GRU recurrent units. Such a unit can then be used\nfor the study of recurrent networks and its structural simplicity may allow\neasier analysis. Towards that goal, we take a system-theoretic perspective to\ndesign a new recurrent unit, which we call the prototypical recurrent unit\n(PRU). Not only having minimal complexity, PRU is demonstrated experimentally\nto have comparable performance to GRU and LSTM unit. This establishes PRU\nnetworks as a prototype for future study of LSTM/GRU-like recurrent networks.\nThis paper also studies the memorization abilities of LSTM, GRU and PRU\nnetworks, motivated by the folk belief that such networks possess long-term\nmemory. For this purpose, we design a simple and controllable task, called\n``memorization problem'', where the networks are trained to memorize certain\ntargeted information. We show that the memorization performance of all three\nnetworks depends on the amount of targeted information, the amount of\n``interfering\" information, and the state space dimension of the recurrent\nunit.

These laws are in\nterms of `classical' fields whose sources are quantal expectations of Hermitian\noperators taken with respect to the wave function. The laws reveal the\nfollowing physics: (a) In addition to the external field, each electron\nexperiences an internal field whose components are representative of a specific\nproperty of the system such as the correlations due to the Pauli exclusion\nprinciple and Coulomb repulsion, the electron density, kinetic effects, and an\ninternal magnetic field component. (The response of the electron is described\nby the current density field.); (b) The scalar potential energy of an electron\nis the work done in a conservative field which is the sum of the internal and\nLorentz fields. It is thus inherently related to the properties of the system.\nIts constituent property-related components are hence known. It is a known\nfunctional of the wave function; (c) As such the Hamiltonian is a functional of\nthe wave function, thereby revealing the intrinsic self-consistent nature of\nthe Schr\\\"odinger equation. This then provides a path for the determination of\nthe exact wave function. (d) With the Schr\\\"odinger equation written in\nself-consistent form, the Hamiltonian now admits via the Lorentz field a new\nterm that explicitly involves the external magnetic field. The new\nunderstandings are explicated for the stationary state case by application to a\nquantum dot in a magnetostatic field in both a ground and excited state. For\nthe time-dependent case, the same states of the quantum dot in both a\nmagnetostatic and a time-dependent electric field are considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Nov 2016 18:57:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

Such an equation of state\nallows us to go beyond the Van der Waals approximation for any number of\ndifferent hard-core radii. A comparison with the Carnahan-Starling equation of\nstate shows that the new model is valid for packing fractions 0.2-0.22, while\nthe usual Van der Waals model is inapplicable at packing fractions above\n0.1-0.11. Moreover, it is shown that the equation of state with induced surface\ntension is softer than the one of hard spheres and remains causal at higher\nparticle densities. The great advantage of our model is that there are only two\nequations to be solved and it does not depend on the various values of the\nhard-core radii used for different hadronic resonances. Using this novel\nequation of state we obtain a high-quality fit of the ALICE hadron\nmultiplicities measured at center-of-mass energies of 2.76 TeV per nucleon.\nFurthermore, using the traditional hadron-resonance gas model with\nmulti-component hard-core repulsion and the novel one we investigate the\nrecently suggested model in which the proper volume of a hadron is proportional\nto its mass.

Among many centrality indices, the $k$-shell index performs very well in\nfinding out influential spreaders. However, the traditional method for\ncalculating the $k$-shell indices of nodes needs the global topological\ninformation, which limits its applications in large-scale dynamically growing\nnetworks. Recently, L\\@\\\"{u} \\emph{et al.} [Nature Communications 7 (2016)\n10168] proposed a novel asynchronous algorithm to calculate the $k$-shell\nindices, which is suitable to deal with large-scale growing networks. In this\npaper, we propose two algorithms to select nodes and update their intermediate\nvalues towards the $k$-shell indices, which can help in accelerating the\nconvergence of the calculation of $k$-shell indices. The former algorithm takes\ninto account the degrees of nodes while the latter algorithm prefers to choose\nthe node whose neighbors' values have been changed recently. We test these two\nmethods on four real networks and three artificial networks. The results\nsuggest that the two algorithms can respectively reduce the convergence time up\nto 75.4\\% and 92.9\\% in average, compared with the original asynchronous\nupdating algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2016 00:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}
