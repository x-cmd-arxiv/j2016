We use complete leading-order and next-to-leading-order matrix\nelements for four-lepton production, including contributions of virtual photons\nand all off-shell effects of Z bosons, where the finite Z-boson width is taken\ninto account using the complex-mass scheme. The matrix elements are implemented\ninto Monte Carlo programs allowing for the evaluation of arbitrary differential\ndistributions. We present integrated and differential cross sections for the\nLHC at 13 TeV both for an inclusive setup where only lepton identification cuts\nare applied, and for a setup motivated by Higgs-boson analyses in the\nfour-lepton decay channel. The electroweak corrections are divided into\nphotonic and purely weak contributions. The former show the well-known\npronounced tails near kinematical thresholds and resonances; the latter are\ngenerically at the level of $\\sim-5\\%$ and reach several $-10\\%$ in the\nhigh-energy tails of distributions. Comparing the results for\n$\\mu^+\\mu^-\\mathrm{e}^+\\mathrm{e}^-$ and $\\mu^+\\mu^-\\mu^+\\mu^-$ final states,\nwe find significant differences mainly in distributions that are sensitive to\nthe $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ pairing in the $\\mu^+\\mu^-\\mu^+\\mu^-$ final state.

More recently, there has been an\nincreased attention on mechanisms for two-sided markets, in which buyers and\nsellers act strategically. For two-sided markets, an impossibility result of\nMyerson and Satterthwaite states that no mechanism can simultaneously satisfy\nindividual rationality (IR), incentive compatibility (IC), strong\nbudget-balance (SBB), and be efficient. On the other hand, important\napplications to web advertisement, stock exchange, and frequency spectrum\nallocation, require us to consider two-sided combinatorial auctions in which\nbuyers have preferences on subsets of items, and sellers may offer multiple\nheterogeneous items. No efficient mechanism was known so far for such two-sided\ncombinatorial markets. This work provides the first IR, IC and SBB mechanisms\nthat provides an O(1)-approximation to the optimal social welfare for two-sided\nmarkets. An initial construction yields such a mechanism, but exposes a\nconceptual problem in the traditional SBB notion. This leads us to define the\nstronger notion of direct trade strong budget balance (DSBB). We then proceed\nto design mechanisms that are IR, IC, DSBB, and again provide an\nO(1)-approximation to the optimal social welfare. Our mechanisms work for any\nnumber of buyers with XOS valuations - a class in between submodular and\nsubadditive functions - and any number of sellers. We provide a mechanism that\nis dominant strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) if the sellers each have one\nitem for sale, and one that is bayesian incentive compatible (BIC) if sellers\nhold multiple items and have additive valuations over them. Finally, we present\na DSIC mechanism for the case that the valuation functions of all buyers and\nsellers are additive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 16:15:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 14:17:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

In this work, we use a new technique to\ninvestigate how the particles are displaced from their original field lines,\nand quantify the parameters of the transition from field-aligned particle\npropagation along meandering field lines to particle diffusion across the mean\nmagnetic field. We show that the initial decoupling of the particles from the\nfield lines is slow, and particles remain within a Larmor radius from their\ninitial meandering field lines for tens to hundreds of Larmor periods, for\n0.1-10 MeV protons in turbulence conditions typical of the solar wind at 1~AU.\nSubsequently, particles decouple from their initial field lines and after\nhundreds to thousands of Larmor periods reach time-asymptotic diffusive\nbehaviour consistent with particle diffusion across the mean field caused by\nthe meandering of the field lines. We show that the typical duration of the\npre-diffusive phase, hours to tens of hours for 10 MeV protons in 1~AU solar\nwind turbulence conditions, is significant for SEP propagation to 1~AU and must\nbe taken into account when modelling SEP propagation in the interplanetary\nspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 16:29:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

The\nspatiotemporal visual semantics provided by a first-person view allows us to\nreason about the camera wearer's actions while he/she is participating in an\nunscripted basketball game. Our method takes a player's first-person video and\nprovides a player's performance measure that is specific to an evaluator's\npreference.\n  To achieve this goal, we first use a convolutional LSTM network to detect\natomic basketball events from first-person videos. Our network's ability to\nzoom-in to the salient regions addresses the issue of a severe camera wearer's\nhead movement in first-person videos. The detected atomic events are then\npassed through the Gaussian mixtures to construct a highly non-linear visual\nspatiotemporal basketball assessment feature.

Honda's Asimo humanoid robot,\niRobot's Roomba robot vacuum cleaner and Google's driverless cars have fired\nthe imagination of the general public, and social media buzz with speculation\nabout a utopian world of helpful robot assistants or the coming robot\napocalypse! However, there is a long way to go before autonomous systems reach\nthe level of capabilities required for even the simplest of tasks involving\nhuman-robot interaction - especially if it involves communicative behaviour\nsuch as speech and language. Of course the field of Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) has made great strides in these areas, and has moved on from abstract\nhigh-level rule-based paradigms to embodied architectures whose operations are\ngrounded in real physical environments. What is still missing, however, is an\noverarching theory of intelligent communicative behaviour that informs\nsystem-level design decisions in order to provide a more coherent approach to\nsystem integration. This chapter introduces the beginnings of such a framework\ninspired by the principles of Perceptual Control Theory (PCT). In particular,\nit is observed that PCT has hitherto tended to view perceptual processes as a\nrelatively straightforward series of transformations from sensation to\nperception, and has overlooked the potential of powerful generative model-based\nsolutions that have emerged in practical fields such as visual or auditory\nscene analysis. Starting from first principles, a sequence of arguments is\npresented which not only shows how these ideas might be integrated into PCT,\nbut which also extend PCT towards a remarkably symmetric architecture for a\nneeds-driven communicative agent. It is concluded that, if behaviour is the\ncontrol of perception, then perception is the simulation of behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 17:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

This paper studies the problem of market\nsegmentation for the free online services market by augmenting the classical\nHotelling model for market segmentation analysis to include the fact that for\nthe free services market, a consumer values service not in monetized terms but\nby its quality of service (QoS) and that the differentiator of services is not\nproduct price but the privacy risk advertised by a SP. Building upon the\nHotelling model, this paper presents a parametrized model for SP profit and\nconsumer valuation of service for both the two- and multi-SP problems to show\nthat: (i) when consumers place a high value on privacy, it leads to a lower use\nof private data by SPs (i.e., their advertised privacy risk reduces), and thus,\nSPs compete on the QoS; (ii) SPs that are capable of differentiating on\nservices that do not directly target consumers gain larger market share; and\n(iii) a higher valuation of privacy by consumers forces SPs with smaller\nuntargeted revenue to offer lower privacy risk to attract more consumers.

For strong U, two holes at the same site form a\ncompound object whose decay is impeded by the lack of phase space. Still, a\npartial decay is possible on an extremely short time scale where phase-space\narguments do not yet apply.

The ambivalent role\nof singly occupied sites is key to understanding the doublon physics: For high\nfillings, ground-state configurations with single occupancies are recognized to\nstrongly relax the kinematic constraints and to open up decay channels. For\nfillings close to half filling, however, their presence actually blocks the\ndoublon decay.

We examine training at reduced\nprecision, both from a theoretical and practical perspective, and ask: is it\npossible to train models at end-to-end low precision with provable guarantees?\nCan this lead to consistent order-of-magnitude speedups? We present a framework\ncalled ZipML to answer these questions. For linear models, the answer is yes.\nWe develop a simple framework based on one simple but novel strategy called\ndouble sampling. Our framework is able to execute training at low precision\nwith no bias, guaranteeing convergence, whereas naive quantization would\nintroduce significant bias. We validate our framework across a range of\napplications, and show that it enables an FPGA prototype that is up to 6.5x\nfaster than an implementation using full 32-bit precision. We further develop a\nvariance-optimal stochastic quantization strategy and show that it can make a\nsignificant difference in a variety of settings. When applied to linear models\ntogether with double sampling, we save up to another 1.7x in data movement\ncompared with uniform quantization. When training deep networks with quantized\nmodels, we achieve higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art XNOR-Net.

We show that, although using low-precision data induces bias, we can\nappropriately bound and control the bias.

As a consequence, many (in fact 99\\%) of the cloudy\nobserved measurements are not being used although they may contain useful\ninformation.

In search of AlO, we mined data obtained with APEX, the\nIRAM 30m telescope, Herschel/HIFI, SMA, and ALMA, which were primarily aimed at\nstudying other molecular species. We report here on observations of AlO towards\na sample of eight oxygen-rich AGB stars in different rotational transitions, up\nto seven for some stars. We present definite detections of one rotational\ntransition of AlO for o Cet and R Aqr, and tentative detections of one\ntransition for R Dor and o Cet, and two for IK Tau and W Hya. The presented\nspectra of WX Psc, R Cas, and TX Cam show no signature of AlO. For o Cet, R\nAqr, and IK Tau, we find that the AlO(N=9-8) emission likely traces the inner\nparts of the wind, out to only a few tens of AU, where the gas has not yet\nreached its terminal velocity. The conclusive detections of AlO emission in the\ncase of o Cet and R Aqr confirm the presence of AlO gas in outflows of AGB\nstars. The tentative detections further support this. Since most of the\nobservations presented in this study were obtained with stronger emission from\nother species than AlO in mind, observations with higher sensitivity in\ncombination with high angular resolution will improve our understanding of the\npresence and behaviour of AlO. From the current data sets we cannot firmly\nconclude whether there is a direct correlation between the wind properties and\nthe detection rate of AlO emission.

It has been studied for\narbitrary kinds of quantum channels, but its practical estimation has so far\nbeen limited to devices that implement independent and identically distributed\n(i.i.d.) quantum channels, where each qubit is affected by the same noise\nprocess. Real devices, however, typically exhibit correlated errors.\n  Here, we overcome this limitation by presenting protocols that estimate a\nchannel's one-shot quantum capacity for the case where the device acts on (an\narbitrary number of) qubits. The one-shot quantum capacity quantifies a\ndevice's ability to store or communicate quantum information, even if there are\ncorrelated errors across the different qubits.\n  We present a protocol which is easy to implement and which comes in two\nversions. The first version estimates the one-shot quantum capacity by\npreparing and measuring in two different bases, where all involved qubits are\nused as test qubits. The second version verifies on-the-fly that a channel's\none-shot quantum capacity exceeds a minimal tolerated value while storing or\ncommunicating data, therefore combining test qubits and data qubits in one\nprotocol. We discuss the performance of our method using simple examples, such\nas the dephasing channel for which our method is asymptotically optimal.\nFinally, we apply our method to estimate the one-shot capacity in an experiment\nusing a transmon qubit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 19:16:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-05-16"}

The low momentum resonance properties have a\nuniversal description that is independent of the atomic species. To arrive at\nthese conclusions, we first develop a formal extension of Floquet theory to\ndescribe scattering of atoms with time-periodic, short-range interaction\npotentials. We then calculate the atomic scattering properties by modeling the\natomic interactions with a square well potential with oscillating depth and\nthen explicitly solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation.

At the lowest temperature of 3\nK we find a general trend where the lifetime is short at low field strengths,\nthen increases to a maximum lifetime at a few hundreds of mT, and then finally\ndecays rapidly for high field strengths. This behaviour can be modelled with a\nrelaxation rate dominated by Nd$^{3+}$-Nd$^{3+}$ cross relaxation at low fields\nand spin lattice relaxation at high magnetic fields. The maximum lifetime\ndepends strongly on both the field strength and orientation, due to the\ncompetition between these processes and their different angular dependencies.\nThe cross relaxation limits the maximum lifetime for concentrations as low as\n30 ppm of Nd$^{3+}$ ions.

We select red giant branch\nstars to derive stellar halo density profiles. The projected minor axis density\nprofiles can be approximated by power laws with projected slopes of between\n$-2$ and $-3.7$ and a diversity of stellar halo masses of $1-6\\times\n10^{9}M_{\\odot}$, or $2-14\\%$ of the total galaxy stellar masses. The typical\nintrinsic scatter around a smooth power law fit is $0.05-0.1$ dex owing to\nsubstructure. By comparing the minor and major axis profiles, we infer\nprojected axis ratios $c/a$ at $\\sim 25$ kpc between $0.4-0.75$. The GHOSTS\nstellar haloes are diverse, lying between the extremes charted out by the\n(rather atypical) haloes of the Milky Way and M31. We find a strong correlation\nbetween the stellar halo metallicities and the stellar halo masses. We compare\nour results with cosmological models, finding good agreement between our\nobservations and accretion-only models where the stellar haloes are formed by\nthe disruption of dwarf satellites. In particular, the strong observed\ncorrelation between stellar halo metallicity and mass is naturally reproduced.\nLow-resolution hydrodynamical models have unrealistically high stellar halo\nmasses. Current high-resolution hydrodynamical models appear to predict stellar\nhalo masses somewhat higher than observed but with reasonable metallicities,\nmetallicity gradients and density profiles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 21:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

We find that shock dissipation is a steep function of\nradius, with most of the energy dissipated within 30 kpc, while radiative\ncooling loses area less concentrated.

Therefore there do\nnot exist many hi-res optical spectra of bulge stars with large wavelength\ncoverage, whose determined abundances can be compared with nearby, similarly\nanalyzed stellar samples. We aim to determine the, for chemical evolution\nmodels, so important alpha elements of a sample of bulge giants using hi-res\noptical spectra with large wavelength coverage. The abundances found will be\ncompared to similarly derived abundances from similar spectra of similar stars\nin the local thin and thick disks. In this first paper we focus on the Solar\nneighborhood reference sample. We use spectral synthesis to derive the stellar\nparameters as well as the elemental abundances of both the local as well as the\nbulge samples of giants. Special care is taken to benchmark our method of\ndetermining stellar parameters against independent measurements of effective\ntemperatures from angular diameter measurements and surface gravities from\nasteroseismology. In this first paper we present the method used to determine\nthe stellar parameters as well as the elemental abundances, evaluate them, and\npresent the results for our local disk sample of 291 giants. When comparing our\ndetermined spectroscopic temperatures to those derived from angular diameter\nmeasurements, we reproduce these with a systematic difference of +10 K and a\nstandard deviation of 53 K. The spectroscopic gravities are reproducing the\nones determined from asteroseismology with a systematic offset of +0.10 dex and\na standard deviation of 0.12 dex. When it comes to the abundance trends, our\nsample of local disk giants is closely following that of other works analyzing\nsolar neighborhood dwarfs, showing that the much brighter giant stars are as\ngood abundance probes as the often used dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 21:01:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

At LHC, the major limiting locations in terms of particle losses on\nsuperconducting (SC) magnets are the dispersion suppressors (DS) downstream of\nthe transverse collimation insertion. These losses are due to the protons\nexperiencing single diffractive interactions in the primary collimators. How to\nsolve this problem is very important for future proton-proton colliders, such\nas the FCC-hh and SPPC. In this article, a novel method is proposed, which\narranges both the transverse and momentum collimation in the same long straight\nsection. In this way, the momentum collimation system can clean those particles\nrelated to the single diffractive effect. The effectiveness of the method has\nbeen confirmed by multi-particle simulations. In addition, SC quadrupoles with\nspecial designs such as enlarged aperture and good shielding are adopted to\nenhance the phase advance in the transverse collimation section, so that\ntertiary collimators can be arranged to clean off the tertiary halo which\nemerges from the secondary collimators and improve the collimation efficiency.\nWith one more collimation stage in the transverse collimation, the beam losses\nin both the momentum collimation section and the experimental regions can be\nlargely reduced. Multi-particle simulation results with the MERLIN code confirm\nthe effectiveness of the collimation method. At last, we provide a protection\nscheme of the SC magnets in the collimation section. The FLUKA simulations show\nthat by adding some special protective collimators in front of the magnets, the\nmaximum power deposition in the SC coils is reduced dramatically, which is\nproven to be valid for protecting the SC magnets from quenching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 22:43:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:04:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 28 Nov 2018 11:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-27"}

Two different treatments are\nused to prepare the MgO substrates for deposition and they introduce\ncharacteristic differences in film surface morphology. Thin films that are\ngrown on the phosphoric acid-treated substrates present reduced nucleation\ndensity during the initial stages of film growth which results in long and wide\nterraces.

Radio-loud AGNs with powerful relativistic jets are thought to be\nassociated with rapidly spinning black holes (BHs).

We study the intriguing\nproperties of the powerful (L_bol ~ 10^47 erg s^-1) radio-loud quasar 3C 186.\nThis object shows peculiar features both in the images and in the spectra.\nMethods. We utilize near-IR Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images to study the\nproperties of the host galaxy, and HST UV and Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical\nspectra to study the kinematics of the source. Chandra X-ray data are also used\nto better constrain the physical interpretation. Results. HST imaging shows\nthat the active nucleus is offset by 1.3 +- 0.1 arcsec (i.e. ~11 kpc) with\nrespect to the center of the host galaxy. Spectroscopic data show that the\nbroad emission lines are offset by -2140 +-390 km/s with respect to the narrow\nlines.

The host galaxy of the quasar displays a\ndistorted morphology with possible tidal features that are typical of the late\nstages of a galaxy merger. Conclusions. A number of scenarios can be envisaged\nto account for the observed features. While the presence of a peculiar outflow\ncannot be completely ruled out, all of the observed features are consistent\nwith those expected if the QSO is associated with a gravitational wave (GW)\nrecoiling BH.

In the diquark-antidiquark model, a scalar\ndiquark is a compact object when its color and flavor structures are in\n($\\bar{\\bm{3}}_c$, $\\bar{\\bm{3}}_f$). Assuming that all the quarks are in an\n$S$-wave, the spin-0 tetraquark formed out of this scalar diquark has only one\nspin configuration, $|J,J_{12},J_{34}\\rangle=|000\\rangle$, where $J$ is the\nspin of the tetraquark, $J_{12}$ the diquark spin, $J_{34}$ the antidiquark\nspin.

Traditional methods in this category inherently suffer three\nlimitations: 1) they commonly adopt a two-stage scheme where similarity matrix\nis first constructed, followed by a subsequent hash function learning; 2) these\nmethods are commonly developed on the assumption that data samples with\nmultiple representations are noise-free,which is not practical in real-life\napplications; 3) they often incur cumbersome training model caused by the\nneighborhood graph construction using all $N$ points in the database ($O(N)$).\nIn this paper, we motivate the problem of jointly and efficiently training the\nrobust hash functions over data objects with multi-feature representations\nwhich may be noise corrupted.

To learn robust hash functions, a\nlatent low-rank kernel function is used to construct hash functions in order to\naccommodate linearly inseparable data. In particular, a latent kernelized\nsimilarity matrix is recovered by rank minimization on multiple kernel-based\nsimilarity matrices.

Highly star-forming DYNAMO\ngalaxies share many similar attributes to clumpy, star-forming galaxies at high\nredshift. Considering integrated Sloan Digital Sky Survey observations, trends\nbetween attenuation and other galaxy properties for DYNAMO galaxies are well\nmatched to star-forming galaxies at high redshift. Integrated gas attenuations\nof DYNAMO galaxies are 0.2-2.0 mags in the V-band, and the ratio of stellar\nE(B-V) and gas E(B-V) is 0.78-0.08 (compared to 0.44 at low redshift). Four\nhighly star-forming DYNAMO galaxies were observed at H-alpha using the Hubble\nSpace Telescope and at Pa-alpha using integral field spectroscopy at Keck.

We\npropose and evaluate several strategies for achieving Zero-Shot VQA, including\nmethods based on pretrained word embeddings, object classifiers with semantic\nembeddings, and test-time retrieval of example images. Our extensive\nexperiments are intended to serve as baselines for Zero-Shot VQA, and they also\nachieve state-of-the-art performance in the standard VQA evaluation setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 03:21:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2016 21:51:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-22"}

If these elementary emitters\nare synchronized, the resulting emission is coherent. Moreover, the faster the\nemitters approach an observer, the more intense and directional their apparent\nemission is, with associated frequency increase. Multi-stream flows\nubiquitously occur in media (such as with shock waves and jets in astrophysical\nand laboratory plasmas) and produce fast moving density singularities, where\nhigh concentration and synchronism can bring constructive interference.\nHowever, a singularity emitting such characteristic coherent radiation has not\nbeen demonstrated yet. We show this general phenomenon in laser-driven\nrelativistic plasma, which is an ideal medium for realizing these effects in\nthe laboratory under controllable conditions. Our experiments and simulations\nreveal bright coherent soft x-ray radiation from nanoscale electron density\nsingularities in multi-stream plasma. They constitute a new compact x-ray\nsource of ultrashort duration, demanded in numerous applications. In general,\nsingularities can be bright sources of other types of traveling waves. Thus our\nfindings open new opportunities in different fields of science. For example,\ngravitational wave generation, as proposed in ultrahigh-energy accelerators,\ncan be significantly enhanced by intentionally induced density singularities in\nthe particle bunches. Further, we anticipate that multi-stream flows in cosmic\nmedia can produce intense bursts of coherent electromagnetic and/or\ngravitational waves, especially at longer wavelengths which facilitate\nconstructive interference. We can then expect to observe more directional short\nwavelength bursts from cosmic emitters approaching at relativistic speeds.\nThus, we present a new framework for interpreting a broad range of experimental\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 03:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-01-15"}

The twin boundaries varying from one to five providing twin\nboundary spacing in the range 8.5 - 2.8 nm were introduced perpendicular to the\nloading direction. The simulation results indicated that the twin boundaries in\nBCC Fe play a contrasting role during deformation under tensile and compressive\nloadings. During tensile deformation, a large reduction in yield stress was\nobserved in twinned nanopillars compared to perfect nanopillar. However, the\nyield stress exhibited only marginal variation with respect to twin boundary\nspacing. On the contrary, a decrease in yield stress with increase in twin\nboundary spacing was obtained during compressive deformation. This contrasting\nbehaviour originates from difference in operating mechanisms during yielding\nand subsequent plastic deformation. It has been observed that the deformation\nunder tensile loading was dominated mainly by twin growth mechanism, due to\nwhich the twin boundaries offers a negligible resistance to slip of twinning\npartials. This is reflected in the negligible variation of yield stress as a\nfunction of twin boundary spacing.

The radio variable flares by a factor of $3$ above its long\nterm average within $10$ d of the FRB at 7.5 GHz, with a factor-of-$2$ increase\nat $5.5$ GHz. Within our observations, the variable has persisted with only\nmodest modulation and never approached the flux density observed in the days\nafter the FRB. We identify an optical counterpart to the variable. Optical and\ninfrared photometry, and deep optical spectroscopy, suggest that the object is\na narrow-line radio AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 06:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-15"}

However, black\nphosphorus and graphene heterostructures have low efficiency of heat\ndissipation due to its intrinsic high thermal resistance at the interfaces. The\naccumulated energy from Joule heat has to be removed efficiently to avoid the\nmalfunction of the devices. Therefore, it is of significance to investigate the\ninterfacial thermal dissipation properties and manipulate the properties by\ninterfacial engineering on demand. In this work, the interfacial thermal\nconductance between few-layer black phosphorus and graphene is studied\nextensively using molecular dynamics simulations. Two critical parameters, the\ncritical power Pcr to maintain thermal stability and the maximum heat power\ndensity Pmax with which the system can be loaded, are identified. Our results\nshow that interfacial thermal conductance can be effectively tuned in a wide\nrange with external strains and interracial defects. The compressive strain can\nenhance the interfacial thermal conductance by one order of magnitude, while\ninterface defects give a two-fold increase.

We observed Ryugu with the\nHerschel Space Observatory in Apr 2012 at far-IR thermal wavelengths, supported\nby several ground-based observations to obtain optical lightcurves. We\nreanalysed previously published Subaru-COMICS and AKARI-IRC observations and\nmerged them with a Spitzer-IRS data set.

In\nthis model, the set of active elements, i.e., those that must be covered at any\ngiven time, can change due to element arrivals and departures. The goal is to\nmaintain an algorithmic solution that is competitive with respect to the\ncurrent optimal solution. This model is popular in both the dynamic algorithms\nand online algorithms communities. The difference is in the restriction placed\non the algorithm: in dynamic algorithms, the running time of the algorithm\nmaking updates (called update time) is bounded, while in online algorithms, the\nnumber of updates made to the solution (called recourse) is limited.\n  In this paper we show the following results: In the update time setting, we\nobtain O(log n)-competitiveness with O(f log n) amortized update time, and\nO(f^3)-competitiveness with O(f^2) update time. The O(log n)-competitive\nalgorithm is the first one to achieve a competitive ratio independent of f in\nthis setting. In the recourse setting, we show a competitive ratio of O(min{log\nn,f}) with constant amortized recourse. Note that this matches the best offline\nbounds with just constant recourse, something that is impossible in the\nclassical online model.\n  Our results are based on two algorithmic frameworks in the fully-dynamic\nmodel that are inspired by the classic greedy and primal-dual algorithms for\noffline set cover. We show that both frameworks can be used for obtaining both\nrecourse and update time bounds, thereby demonstrating algorithmic techniques\ncommon to these strands of research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 12:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

In addition to bringing in the swap equilibrium\n(SE) concept, we extend the model from an attack on the edges of the network to\nan attack on its vertices.

Using a projective measurement approach, with a sampling time\n$\\tau$, we obtain the statistics of first detection events for quantum dynamics\non a lattice, with the detector located at the origin. A quantum renewal\nequation for a first detection wave function, in terms of which the first\ndetection probability can be calculated, is derived. This formula gives the\nrelation between first detection statistics and the solution of the\ncorresponding Schr\\\"odinger equation in the absence of measurement.

The initial condition\nmodifies the statistics of a quantum walk on a finite ring in surprising ways.\nIn some cases the average detection time is independent of the sampling time\nwhile in others the average exhibits multiple divergences as the sampling time\nis modified.

As well as being valuable in their own\nright, the QMC benchmarks obtained provide reference data against which the\nperformance of cheaper DFT methods can be tested. Indeed using various DFT\nexchange-correlation functionals yields a very broad range of adsorption\nenergies, and it is unclear a priori which evaluation is better. QMC reveals\nthat in the systems considered here it is essential to account for van der\nWaals (vdW) dispersion forces since this alters both the absolute and relative\nadsorption energies of water and methanol.

Using linear perturbation theory, we show that the force exerted by the\nperturbed gas on the perturber differs from the force without radiation (or\nstandard dynamical friction). Hot, underdense gas trails the mass, which gives\nrise to a new force component, the heating force, with direction $+V$, thus\nopposed to the standard dynamical friction. In the limit of low Mach numbers,\nthe heating force has expression $F_\\mathrm{heat}=\\gamma(\\gamma-1)GML/(2\\chi\nc_s^2)$, $c_s$ being the sound speed and $\\gamma$ the ratio of specific heats.\nIn the limit of large Mach numbers, $F_\\mathrm{heat}=(\\gamma-1)GML/(\\chi\nV^2)f(r_\\mathrm{min}V/4\\chi)$, where $f$ is a function that diverges\nlogarithmically as $r_\\mathrm{min}$ tends to zero. Remarkably, the force in the\nlow Mach number limit does not depend on the velocity. The equilibrium speed,\nwhen it exists, is set by the cancellation of the standard dynamical friction\nand heating force. In the low Mach number limit, it scales with the luminosity\nto mass ratio of the perturber.

This\n{\\em added-mass partitioned} (AMP) algorithm remains stable, without\nsub-iterations, for light and even zero mass rigid bodies when added-mass and\nviscous added-damping effects are large. The scheme is based on a generalized\nRobin interface condition for the fluid pressure that includes terms involving\nthe linear acceleration and angular acceleration of the rigid body. Added-mass\neffects are handled in the Robin condition by inclusion of a boundary integral\nterm that depends on the pressure. Added-damping effects due to the viscous\nshear forces on the body are treated by inclusion of added-damping tensors that\nare derived through a linearization of the integrals defining the force and\ntorque. Added-damping effects may be important at low Reynolds number, or, for\nexample, in the case of a rotating cylinder or rotating sphere when the\nrotational moments of inertia are small. In this first part of a two-part\nseries, the properties of the AMP scheme are motivated and evaluated through\nthe development and analysis of some model problems. The analysis shows when\nand why the traditional partitioned scheme becomes unstable due to either\nadded-mass or added-damping effects. The analysis also identifies the proper\nform of the added-damping which depends on the discrete time-step and the\ngrid-spacing normal to the rigid body. The results of the analysis are\nconfirmed with numerical simulations that also demonstrate a second-order\naccurate implementation of the AMP scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 14:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-07"}

In addition to these general considerations, we obtain\nlimits for the frequency dependence of the $\\alpha$ parameter in scalar tensor\ntheories of gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 16:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

To do so they extend the Bass Diffusion Model\nand apply it to a unique data set of 6 years of daily downloads of the Firefox\nbrowser and 52 of its add-ons. The study then re-casts the resulting\ndifferential equations into non-linear, discrete-time, state space forms; and\nestimate them using an MCMC approach to the Extended Kalman Filtern (EKF-MCMC).\nUnlike continuous-time filters, the EKF-MCMC approach avoids numerical\nintegration, and so is more computational efficient, given the length of our\ntime-series, high dimension of our state space and need to model heterogeneity.\nResults show, for example, that observational learning and add-on ratings\nincrease the demand for Firefox add-ons; add-ons can increase the market\npotential of the Firefox platform; a slow add-on review process can diminish\nplatform success; and OSS platforms (i.e. Chrome and Firefox) compete rather\nthan complement each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 04:35:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-24"}
