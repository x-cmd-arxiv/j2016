It is argued that a\nzonostrophic instability (of homogeneous turbulence to the formation of zonal\nflows) occurs just below the threshold for linear instability. The scenario\nprovides a new interpretation of the random forcing that is ubiquitously\ninvoked in stochastic models such as the second-order cumulant expansion (CE2)\nor stochastic structural instability theory (SSST); neither intrinsic\nturbulence nor coupling to extrinsic turbulence is required. A representative\ncalculation of the zonostrophic neutral curve is made for a simple two-field\nmodel of toroidal ion-temperature-gradient-driven modes. To the extent that the\ndamping of zonal flows is controlled by the ion--ion collision rate, the point\nof zonostrophic instability is independent of that rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 16:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

These systems are susceptible to be tidally\nevolving, in particular the dissipation of the kinetic energy of tidal flows in\nthe host star may modify its rotational evolution and also shape the orbital\narchitecture of the surrounding planetary system. Recent theoretical studies\nhave shown that the amplitude of the stellar dissipation can vary over several\norders of magnitude as the star evolves, and that it also depends on the\nstellar mass and rotation. We present here one of the first studies of the\ndynamics of close-in planets orbiting low-mass stars (from $0.6~M_\\odot$ to\n$1.2~M_\\odot$) where we compute the simultaneous evolution of the star's\nstructure, rotation and tidal dissipation in its external convective envelope.\nWe demonstrate that tidal friction due to the stellar dynamical tide, i.e.\ntidal inertial waves (their restoring force is the Coriolis acceleration)\nexcited in the convection zone, can be larger by several orders of magnitude\nthan the one of the equilibrium tide currently used in celestial mechanics.\nThis is particularly true during the Pre Main Sequence (PMS) phase and to a\nlesser extent during the Sub Giant (SG) phase. Numerical simulations show that\nonly the high dissipation occurring during the PMS phase has a visible effect\non the semi-major axis of close-in planets.

A number of\ncorrelations between the DRW model parameters, the signal decorrelation\ntimescale and amplitude, and the physical AGN parameters such as the black hole\nmass or luminosity have been reported. Aims: We are interested in whether it is\nplausible to correctly measure the DRW parameters from a typical ground-based\nsurvey, in particular how accurate the recovered DRW parameters are compared to\nthe input ones. Methods: By means of Monte Carlo simulations of AGN light\ncurves, we study the impact of the light curve length, the source magnitude,\ncadence, and additional light on the DRW model parameters. Results: The most\nsignificant finding is that currently existing surveys are going to return\nunconstrained DRW decorrelation timescales, because typical rest-frame data do\nnot probe long enough timescales or the white noise part of PSD for DRW. The\nexperiment length must be at least ten times longer than the true DRW\ntimescale, being presumably in the vicinity of one year, meaning a minimum\n10-years-long AGN light curves (rest-frame). The DRW timescales for\nsufficiently long light curves are typically weakly biased, and the exact bias\ndepends on the fitting method and used priors. The DRW amplitude is mostly\naffected by the photometric noise (so the source magnitude or the\nsignal-to-noise ratio), cadence, and the AGN host light. Conclusions: Because\nthe DRW parameters appear to be incorrectly determined from typically existing\ndata, the reported correlations of the DRW variability and physical AGN\nparameters from other works seem unlikely to be correct. In particular, the\nanti-correlation of the DRW timescale with redshift is a manifestation of the\nsurvey length being too short. Application of DRW to modeling typical AGN\noptical light curves is questioned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 16:51:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

Numerical methods for solving\nthe model equations are being developed. Precursors to the model and potential\napplications are discussed.

This proves that the structural transition in\nFe-based materials is electronic in nature due to orbital ordering. An\nuniversal correlations among various structural parameters and electronic\nstructure are also obtained.

We consider two types of quantum fluctuations,\nharmonic ones by using linear spin wave theory (LSWT) with single-spin flip\nexcitations above a long range magnetically ordered background and anharmonic\nfluctuations, by employing a cluster-operator approach (COA) with multi-spin\ncluster type fluctuations above a non-magnetic cluster ordered background.

While star\nformation rates (SFRs) are regularly estimated with phenomenological formulas\nbased on the local FIR-radio correlation, we present here a physically\nmotivated model to relate star formation with radio fluxes. Such a relation\nholds only in frequency ranges where the flux is dominated by synchrotron\nemission, as this radiation originates from cosmic rays produced in supernova\nremnants, therefore reflecting recent star formation. At low frequencies\nsynchrotron emission can be absorbed by the free-free mechanism. This\nsuppression becomes stronger with increasing number density of the gas, more\nprecisely of the free electrons. We estimate the critical observing frequency\nbelow which radio emission is not tracing the SFR, and use the three\nwell-studied local galaxies M 51, M 82, and Arp 220 as test cases for our\nmodel. If the observed galaxy is at high redshift, this critical frequency\nmoves along with other spectral features to lower values in the observing\nframe. In the absence of systematic evolutionary effects, one would therefore\nexpect that the method can be applied at lower observing frequencies for high\nredshift observations. However, in case of a strong increase of the typical gas\ncolumn densities towards high redshift, the increasing free-free absorption may\nerase the star formation signatures at low frequencies. At high radio\nfrequencies both, free-free emission and the thermal bump, can dominate the\nspectrum, also limiting the applicability of this method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 21:13:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2017 00:35:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-12"}

Such values introduce a\nnew variant in the evolution of young pulsars and their relationship with other\npopulations in the P-P' diagram.

While these networks exhibit\noutstanding recognition performance (i.e., what is visible?), they lack\nlocalization accuracy (i.e., where precisely is something located?). Therefore,\nadditional processing steps have to be performed in order to obtain\npixel-accurate segmentation masks at the full image resolution. To alleviate\nthis problem we propose a novel ResNet-like architecture that exhibits strong\nlocalization and recognition performance. We combine multi-scale context with\npixel-level accuracy by using two processing streams within our network: One\nstream carries information at the full image resolution, enabling precise\nadherence to segment boundaries. The other stream undergoes a sequence of\npooling operations to obtain robust features for recognition. The two streams\nare coupled at the full image resolution using residuals. Without additional\nprocessing steps and without pre-training, our approach achieves an\nintersection-over-union score of 71.8% on the Cityscapes dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 23:55:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Dec 2016 19:36:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

A flare ribbon overlapped with the sunspot umbra, which is typical of\nlarge particle events. Atypical were: i) long duration of the flare of more\nthan one hour; ii) moderate intensity of a microwave burst, about $10^4$ sfu;\niii) low peak frequency of the gyrosynchrotron spectrum, around 6 GHz; and its\ninsensitivity to the flux increase by more than one order of magnitude. This\nwas accompanied by a nearly constant ratio of the flux emitted by the volume in\nthe high-frequency part of the spectrum to its elevated low-frequency part\ndetermined by the area of the source. With the self-similarity of the spectrum,\na similarity was observed between the moving microwave sources and the\nbrightest parts of the flare ribbons in 1600 \\AA.

To understand the properties of the event, we simulated its\nmicrowave emission using a system of several homogeneous gyrosynchrotron\nsources above the ribbons. The scatter between the spectra and sizes of the\nindividual sources is determined by the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field\nwithin the ribbons. The microwave flux is mainly governed by the magnetic flux\npassing through the ribbons and the sources. An apparent simplicity of\nmicrowave structures is caused by a poorer spatial resolution and dynamic range\nof the microwave imaging.

If a language contains complex\nwords like sandhi where two or more morphemes join based on some rules, spell\nchecking becomes very tedious. In such situations, having a spell checker with\nsandhi splitter which alerts the user by flagging the errors and providing\nsuggestions is very useful. A novel algorithm of sandhi splitting is proposed\nin this paper. The sandhi splitter can split about 7000 most common sandhi\nwords in Kannada language used as test samples. The sandhi splitter was\nintegrated with a Kannada spell checker and a mechanism for generating\nsuggestions was added. A comprehensive, platform independent, standalone spell\nchecker with sandhi splitter application software was thus developed and tested\nextensively for its efficiency and correctness. A comparative analysis of this\nspell checker with sandhi splitter was made and results concluded that the\nKannada spell checker with sandhi splitter has an improved performance. It is\ntwice as fast, 200 times more space efficient, and it is 90% accurate in case\nof complex nouns and 50% accurate for complex verbs. Such a spell checker with\nsandhi splitter will be of foremost significance in machine translation\nsystems, voice processing, etc. This is the first sandhi splitter in Kannada\nand the advantage of the novel algorithm is that, it can be extended to all\nIndian languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2016 06:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-28"}

Although this problem has been studied in the past, there\nhas not been a method that guarantees both goal satisfaction and safety for\nvehicles with general nonlinear dynamics while taking into account disturbances\nand potential adversarial agents, to the best of our knowledge. Hamilton-Jacobi\n(HJ) reachability is the ideal tool for guaranteeing goal satisfaction and\nsafety under such scenarios, and has been successfully applied to many\nsmall-scale problems. However, a direct application of HJ reachability in most\ncases becomes intractable when there are more than two vehicles due to the\nexponentially scaling computational complexity with respect to system\ndimension. In this paper, we take advantage of the guarantees HJ reachability\nprovides, and eliminate the computation burden by assigning a strict priority\nordering to the vehicles under consideration. Under this sequential path\nplanning (SPP) scheme, vehicles reserve \"space-time\" portions in the airspace,\nand the space-time portions guarantee dynamic feasibility, collision avoidance,\nand optimality of the paths given the priority ordering. With a computation\ncomplexity that scales quadratically when accounting for both disturbances and\nan intruder, and linearly when accounting for only disturbances, SPP can\ntractably solve the multi-vehicle path planning problem for vehicles with\ngeneral nonlinear dynamics in a practical setting.

One of the main challenges in MVP analysis is validating\nthe generated results across subjects. However, analyzing multi-subject fMRI\ndata requires accurate functional alignments between neuronal activities of\ndifferent subjects, which can rapidly increase the performance and robustness\nof the final results. Hyperalignment (HA) is one of the most effective\nfunctional alignment methods, which can be mathematically formulated by the\nCanonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) methods. Since HA mostly uses the\nunsupervised CCA techniques, its solution may not be optimized for MVP\nanalysis. By incorporating the idea of Local Discriminant Analysis (LDA) into\nCCA, this paper proposes Local Discriminant Hyperalignment (LDHA) as a novel\nsupervised HA method, which can provide better functional alignment for MVP\nanalysis. Indeed, the locality is defined based on the stimuli categories in\nthe train-set, where the correlation between all stimuli in the same category\nwill be maximized and the correlation between distinct categories of stimuli\napproaches to near zero.

Interestingly, the calculated diffusion\nbarrier for the O atom slightly increases from 0.81 eV on graphene to 0.85 eV\nwithin bilayer graphene, while that for the F atom significantly decreases from\n0.30 eV on graphene to 0.18 eV within bilayer graphene. Such contrasting\nbehaviors of the O and F diffusions within bilayer graphene can be traced to\ntheir different bonding natures: i.e., the O adatom that has a strongly\ncovalent C$-$O$-$C bonding on the bridge site of the C$-$C bond diffuses on one\ngraphene layer with a slight interference of the other layer, while the F\nadatom that has a weakly ionic F$-$C bonding on top of a C atom easily diffuses\nby hopping between two graphene layers with accepting more electron charges\nfrom the two layers. The present findings have important implications for\nunderstanding the diffusion processes of F and O atoms on graphene and within\nbilayer graphene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2016 09:11:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

Previous proposals on rowhammer\nmitigation either require hardware changes or follow heuristic-based approaches\n(based on CPU performance counters). To date, there exists no instant\nprotection against rowhammer attacks on legacy systems.\n  In this paper, we present the design and implementation of two practical and\nefficient software-only defenses against rowhammer attacks. Our defenses\nprevent the attacker from leveraging rowhammer to corrupt physically co-located\ndata in memory that is owned by a different system entity. Our first defense,\nB-CATT, extends the system bootloader to disable vulnerable physical memory.\nB-CATT is highly practical, does not require changes to the operating system,\nand can be deployed on virtually all x86-based systems. While B-CATT is able to\nstop all known rowhammer attacks, it does not yet tackle the fundamental\nproblem of missing memory isolation in physical memory. To address this\nproblem, we introduce our second defense G-CATT, a generic solution that\nextends the physical memory allocator of the OS to physically isolate the\nmemory of different system entities (e.g., kernel and user space).\n  As proof of concept, we implemented B-CATT on x86, and our generic defense,\nG-CATT, on x86 and ARM to mitigate rowhammer-based kernel exploits. Our\nextensive evaluation shows that both mitigation schemes (i) can stop available\nreal- world rowhammer attacks, (ii) impose virtually no run-time overhead for\ncommon user and kernel benchmarks as well as commonly used applications, and\n(iii) do not affect the stability of the overall system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2016 09:37:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Dec 2016 12:19:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-08"}

It is now generally accepted that the near-infrared excess of Herbig\nAeBe stars originates in the dust of a circumstellar disk. Aims. The aims of\nthis article are to infer the radial and vertical structure of these disks at\nscales of order one au, and the properties of the dust grains. Methods. The\nprogram objects (51 in total) were observed with the H-band (1.6micron)\nPIONIER/VLTI interferometer. The largest baselines allowed us to resolve (at\nleast partially) structures of a few tenths of an au at typical distances of a\nfew hundred parsecs. Dedicated UBVRIJHK photometric measurements were also\nobtained. Spectral and 2D geometrical parameters are extracted via fits of a\nfew simple models: ellipsoids and broadened rings with azimuthal modulation.\nModel bias is mitigated by parallel fits of physical disk models. Sample\nstatistics were evaluated against similar statistics for the physical disk\nmodels to infer properties of the sample objects as a group. Results. We find\nthat dust at the inner rim of the disk has a sublimation temperature\nTsub~1800K. A ring morphology is confirmed for approximately half the resolved\nobjects; these rings are wide delta_r>=0.5. A wide ring favors a rim that, on\nthe star-facing side, looks more like a knife edge than a doughnut. The data\nare also compatible with a the combination of a narrow ring and an inner disk\nof unspecified nature inside the dust sublimation radius. The disk inner part\nhas a thickness z/r~0.2, flaring to z/r~0.5 in the outer part. We confirm the\nknown luminosity-radius relation; a simple physical model is consistent with\nboth the mean luminosity-radius relation and the ring relative width; however,\na significant spread around the mean relation is present. In some of the\nobjects we find a halo component, fully resolved at the shortest interferometer\nspacing, that is related to the HAeBe class.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2016 11:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

To this end we derive a general CTRW framework in radial\ncoordinates starting from the random walk equations for radial particle\npositions and times. The particle density, or solute concentration is governed\nby a non-local radial advection-dispersion equation (ADE). Unlike in CTRWs for\nuniform flow scenarios, particle transition times here depend on the radial\nparticle position, which renders the CTRW non-stationary. As a consequence, the\nmemory kernel characterizing the non-local ADE, is radially dependent. Based on\nthis general formulation, we derive radial CTRW implementations that (i)\nemulate non-local radial transport due to heterogeneous advection, (ii) model\nmultirate mass transfer (MRMT) between mobile and immobile continua, and (iii)\nquantify both heterogeneous advection in a mobile region and mass transfer\nbetween mobile and immobile regions. The expected solute breakthrough behavior\nis studied using numerical random walk particle tracking simulations. This\nbehavior is analyzed by explicit analytical expressions for the asymptotic\nsolute breakthrough curves. We observe clear power-law tails of the solute\nbreakthrough for broad (power-law) distributions of particle transit times\n(heterogeneous advection) and particle trapping times (MRMT model). The\ncombined model displays two distinct time regimes. An intermediate regime, in\nwhich the solute breakthrough is dominated by the particle transit times in the\nmobile zones, and a late time regime that is governed by the distribution of\nparticle trapping times in immobile zones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2016 13:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-28"}

Covert aspects of ongoing user mental states provide key context\ninformation for user-aware human computer interactions. In this paper, we focus\non the problem of estimating the vigilance of users using EEG and EOG signals.\nApproach. To improve the feasibility and wearability of vigilance estimation\ndevices for real-world applications, we adopt a novel electrode placement for\nforehead EOG and extract various eye movement features, which contain the\nprincipal information of traditional EOG. We explore the effects of EEG from\ndifferent brain areas and combine EEG and forehead EOG to leverage their\ncomplementary characteristics for vigilance estimation. Considering that the\nvigilance of users is a dynamic changing process because the intrinsic mental\nstates of users involve temporal evolution, we introduce continuous conditional\nneural field and continuous conditional random field models to capture dynamic\ntemporal dependency. Main results. We propose a multimodal approach to\nestimating vigilance by combining EEG and forehead EOG and incorporating the\ntemporal dependency of vigilance into model training. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that modality fusion can improve the performance compared with a\nsingle modality, EOG and EEG contain complementary information for vigilance\nestimation, and the temporal dependency-based models can enhance the\nperformance of vigilance estimation. From the experimental results, we observe\nthat theta and alpha frequency activities are increased, while gamma frequency\nactivities are decreased in drowsy states in contrast to awake states.\nSignificance. The forehead setup allows for the simultaneous collection of EEG\nand EOG and achieves comparative performance using only four shared electrodes\nin comparison with the temporal and posterior sites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2016 15:29:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-28"}

Those functions have to be extended to the whole complex plane,\nvia analytic continuation, in order to infer real-time properties of those\nphysical systems. In this Review, we will present the Genetic Inversion via\nFalsification of Theories method, which allowed us to compute dynamical\nproperties of strongly interacting quantum many--body systems with very high\naccuracy. Even though the method arose in the realm of Condensed Matter\nPhysics, it provides a very general framework to face analytic continuation\nproblems that could emerge in several areas of applied Science. Here we provide\na pedagogical review that elucidates the approach we have developed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2016 15:58:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2017 09:46:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-07"}

The non-bonding\nmode enables an electromagnetic induced transparency like transfer of energy.\nHere the non-bonding mode, resulting from the strong electric coupling of two\ndielectric resonators and an enclosure, is exploited to show that it is\nfeasible to transfer power over a distance comparable to the operating\nwavelength. In this scheme, the enclosure acts as a mediator. The strong\ncoupling permits the excitation of the non-bonding mode with high purity. This\napproach is different from resonant inductive coupling which works in the\nsub-wavelength regime. Optimal loads and the corresponding maximum efficiency\nare determined using two independent methods: Coupled Mode Theory and Circuit\nmodelling. It is shown that, unlike resonant inductive coupling, the figure of\nmerit depends on the enclosure quality and not on the load, which emphasizes\nthe role of the enclosure as a mediator. Briefly after the input excitation is\nturned on, the energy in the receiver builds up via all coupled and spurious\nmodes. As time elapses, all modes except the non-bonding cease to sustain. Due\nto the strong coupling between the dielectrics and the enclosure, such systems\nhave unique properties such as high and uniform efficiency over large\ndistances; and minimal fringing fields. These properties suggest that\nelectromagnetic induced transparency like schemes which rely on the use of\ndielectric resonators can be used to power autonomous systems inside an\nenclosure or find applications when exposure to the fields needs to be minimal.\nFinite Element computations are used to verify the theoretical predictions by\ndetermining the transfer efficiency, fields profile and coupling coefficients\nfor two different systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Nov 2016 06:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-21"}

However, the performance of the EKF degrades\nconsiderably in highly non-linear system applications as it requires local\nlinearisation in its prediction stage. The Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) was\ndeveloped to address the non-linearity in the system by deterministic sampling.\nThe UKF provides better estimation accuracy than the EKF for highly non-linear\nsystems. However, the UKF requires multiple propagations of sampled state\nvectors in the measurement interval, which results in higher processing time\nthan for the EKF. This paper proposes an application of two newly developed UKF\nvariants in launch vehicle navigation. These two algorithms called the Single\nPropagation Unscented Kalman Filter (SPUKF) and the Extrapolated Single\nPropagation Unscented Kalman Filter (ESPUKF), reduce the processing time of the\noriginal UKF significantly and provide estimation accuracies comparable to the\nUKF.
