These novel analysis tools exploit the\nunique properties of positron interaction with surfaces, which comprise the\nabsence of exchange interaction, repulsive crystal potential and positron\ntrapping in delocalized surface states at low energies. By applying reflection\nhigh-energy positron diffraction (RHEPD) one can benefit from the phenomenon of\ntotal reflection below a critical angle that is not present in electron surface\ndiffraction. Therefore, RHEPD allows the determination of the atom positions of\n(reconstructed) surfaces with outstanding accuracy. The main advantages of\npositron annihilation induced Auger-electron spectroscopy (PAES) are the\nmissing secondary electron background in the energy region of Auger-transitions\nand its topmost layer sensitivity for elemental analysis. In order to enable\nthe investigation of the electron polarization at surfaces low-energy\nspin-polarized positrons are used to probe the outermost electrons of the\nsurface. Furthermore, in fundamental research the preparation of well defined\nsurfaces tailored for the production of bound leptonic systems plays an\noutstanding role. In this report, it is envisaged to cover both, the\nfundamental aspects of positron surface interaction and the present status of\nsurface studies using modern positron beam techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2016 16:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Our observations span roughly 16 square degrees and reach a 3-sigma\ndepth of mu(B)=29.5 and mu(V)=28.5 mag/arcsec^2. At these depths, the limiting\nsystematic uncertainties are astrophysical: scattered starlight from foreground\nGalactic dust, and variations in faint background sources. The dust-scattered\nstarlight is well-traced by deep far-infrared imaging, making it\ndistinguishable from true Virgo diffuse light. Our imaging maps the Virgo core\naround M87 and the adjacent M86/M84 region, in subcluster B around M49, and in\nthe more distant W' cloud around NGC 4365. Most of the detected ICL is found in\nthe Virgo core and within the W' cloud, with little evidence for extensive ICL\nin subcluster B. The large amount of diffuse light seen in the infalling W'\ncloud likely illustrates the importance of the group environment for generating\nICL. The bulk of the detected ICL is fairly red (B-V=0.7-0.9), indicative of\nold stellar populations.

We trace M87's extremely boxy halo\nout to ~ 150 kpc, and show that the current stripping rate of low luminosity\ngalaxies is insufficient to have built M87's outer halo over a Hubble time.\nFinally, we identify another large ultra-diffuse galaxy in Virgo, likely in the\nprocess of being shredded by the cluster tidal field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2016 16:09:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 14:32:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

The current experimental knowledge\nindicates that this possibility strongly favors a co-annihilation scenario. In\nsuch scenarios, the mass difference between the next-to-lightest SUSY particle\n(the NLSP) and the lightest one (the LSP) is quite small, which assures that\nthe annihilation cross-section is sufficient not to predict a too large\nabundance of dark matter. However, the small mass difference also means that\nobserving SUSY becomes hard at hadron colliders, where the observation hinges\non the tell-tale signature of missing transverse energy: if the mass difference\nNLSP-to-LSP is small, only little energy is carried away by the invisible LSP.\nThis is also true even if several other SUSY particles are within the kinematic\nreach, since these states would to a large extent decay via cascades ending\nwith an NLSP to LSP decay. A lepton collider does not have this problem. The\nclean environment and known initial state at such machines assures that SUSY\ncan be detected even if the mass difference is very small, provided the\ncenter-of-mass energy is sufficiently high. We present prospects for\nobservation and precision characterization of SUSY with small mass differences\nat the ILC, based on detailed simulations of the ILD detector concept.

Such embeddings are applicable to\nspeech retrieval and recognition tasks, where reasoning about whole words may\nmake it possible to avoid ambiguous sub-word representations. The main idea is\nto map acoustic sequences to fixed-dimensional vectors such that examples of\nthe same word are mapped to similar vectors, while different-word examples are\nmapped to very different vectors. In this work we take a multi-view approach to\nlearning acoustic word embeddings, in which we jointly learn to embed acoustic\nsequences and their corresponding character sequences.

The splay-bend periodic landscape thus allows one to spatially\nseparate these two types of particles.

However, an\nimportant aspect to consider in this scenario is that orbits of high-altitude\nopen clusters will eventually cross the Galactic plane, where the vertical\ntidal field of the disk is strong.

The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is\nachieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from\nnon-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to\na variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate\nthe data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are\ntransient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so\nthat accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible.\nIn this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing\nwith machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the\nglitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we\nengage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches\ninto pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that\nappear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are\nused to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of\nthe morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification\nmethods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency\nand accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and\ncharacterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and\nsubsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby\nimproving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We\ndemonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO's first\nobserving run.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2016 21:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2017 21:36:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-02"}

In\nthe process we introduce a new treatment of the photophoresis force which is\nconsistent at all optical depths with the representation of the radiative\nintensity field in a two-stream radiative transfer approximation. The\nlevitation of large dust grains creates a photophoretic dust trap several scale\nheights above the mid-plane in the inner regions of the disk where the\ndissipation of accretion energy is significant. We find that differential\nsettling of dust grains is radically altered in these regions of the disk, with\nlarge dust grains trapped in a layer below the stellar irradiation surface in\nwhere the dust to gas mass ratio can be enhanced by a factor of a hundred for\nthe relevant particles. The photophoretic trapping effect has a strong\ndependence on particle size and porosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2016 21:00:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2017 11:54:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-10"}

These observations feature long, continuous, and\nsimultaneous exposures with XMM-Newton (covering X-ray and optical/ultraviolet\nbands) and VERITAS (covering TeV gamma-ray band), along with contemporaneous\nobservations from other gamma-ray facilities (MAGIC and Fermi-LAT) and a number\nof radio and optical facilities. Although neither rapid flares nor significant\nX-ray/TeV correlation are detected, these observations reveal subtle changes in\nthe X-ray spectrum of the source over the course of a few days. We search the\nsimultaneous X-ray and TeV data for spectral hysteresis patterns and time\ndelays, which could provide insight into the emission mechanisms and the source\nproperties (e.g. the radius of the emitting region, the strength of the\nmagnetic field, and related timescales).

However, their high sensitivity to external\nfields also makes them poor sensors of DC fields. Indeed, the usual method of\nRamsey magnetometry leaves them prone to environmental noise, limiting the\nallowable interrogation time to the short dephasing time T2*. Here we introduce\na hybridized magnetometery platform, consisting of a sensor and ancilla, that\nallows sensing static magnetic fields with interrogation times up to the much\nlonger T2 coherence time, allowing significant potential gains in field\nsensitivity. While more generally applicable, we demonstrate the method for an\nelectronic NV sensor and a nuclear ancilla. It relies on frequency upconversion\nof transverse DC fields through the ancilla, allowing quantum lock-in detection\nwith low-frequency noise rejection. In our experiments, we demonstrate\nsensitivities better than 6uT/vHz, comparable to the Ramsey method, and\nnarrow-band signal noise filtering better than 64kHz. With technical\noptimization, we expect more than an one order of magnitude improvement in each\nof these parameters.

The mass of the\nstar-forming component ($M_{\\rm SF}$) correlates with the star formation rate\n(SFR) following a relation SFR $\\propto M_{\\rm SF}^{\\alpha_{\\rm SF}}$, where\n$\\alpha_{\\rm SF}\\sim 1.0$ . The quenched component contributes to the stellar\nmass but does not to the SFR. It is thus possible to quantify $f_{\\rm Q}$ based\non the departure of the observed MS slope $\\alpha$ from $\\alpha_{\\rm SF}$.\nAdopting the redshift-dependent MS slope reported by \\citet{Whitaker 2014}, we\nexplore the evolution of the $f_{\\rm Q}-M_{\\ast}$ relations over $z=[0.5,2.5]$.\nWe find that Milky-Way mass SFGs (with $M_{\\ast}\\approx 10^{10.7}M_{\\odot}$)\ntypically have a $f_{\\rm Q}=30\\%-40\\%$ at $z\\sim 2.25$, whereas this value\nrapidly rises up to $70\\%-80\\%$ at $z\\sim 0.75$. The origin of an $\\alpha\\sim\n1.0$ MS slope seen in the low mass regime is also discussed. We argue for a\nscenario in which the majority of low mass SFGs stay in a \"steady-stage\" star\nformation phase. In this phase, the SFR is mainly regulated by stellar feedback\nand not significantly influenced by the quenching mechanisms, thus keeping\nroughly constant over cosmic time. This scenario successfully produces an\n$\\alpha \\sim 1.0$ MS slope, as well as the observed MS evolution from $z=2.5$\nto $z=0$ at low masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 03:57:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-04"}

These problems are often formulated as stochastic\noptimal control problems and solved using dynamic programming algorithms.\nUnfortunately, most existing algorithms that guarantee convergence to optimal\nsolutions suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the run time of the\nalgorithm grows exponentially with the dimension of the state space of the\nsystem. We propose novel dynamic programming algorithms that alleviate the\ncurse of dimensionality in problems that exhibit certain low-rank structure.\nThe proposed algorithms are based on continuous tensor decompositions recently\ndeveloped by the authors. Essentially, the algorithms represent\nhigh-dimensional functions (e.g., the value function) in a compressed format,\nand directly perform dynamic programming computations (e.g., value iteration,\npolicy iteration) in this format. Under certain technical assumptions, the new\nalgorithms guarantee convergence towards optimal solutions with arbitrary\nprecision. Furthermore, the run times of the new algorithms scale polynomially\nwith the state dimension and polynomially with the ranks of the value function.\nThis approach realizes substantial computational savings in \"compressible\"\nproblem instances, where value functions admit low-rank approximations. We\ndemonstrate the new algorithms in a wide range of problems, including a\nsimulated six-dimensional agile quadcopter maneuvering example and a\nseven-dimensional aircraft perching example.

It is generally\nthought that count-based methods cannot be applied in high-dimensional state\nspaces, since most states will only occur once. Recent deep RL exploration\nstrategies are able to deal with high-dimensional continuous state spaces\nthrough complex heuristics, often relying on optimism in the face of\nuncertainty or intrinsic motivation. In this work, we describe a surprising\nfinding: a simple generalization of the classic count-based approach can reach\nnear state-of-the-art performance on various high-dimensional and/or continuous\ndeep RL benchmarks. States are mapped to hash codes, which allows to count\ntheir occurrences with a hash table. These counts are then used to compute a\nreward bonus according to the classic count-based exploration theory. We find\nthat simple hash functions can achieve surprisingly good results on many\nchallenging tasks. Furthermore, we show that a domain-dependent learned hash\ncode may further improve these results. Detailed analysis reveals important\naspects of a good hash function: 1) having appropriate granularity and 2)\nencoding information relevant to solving the MDP. This exploration strategy\nachieves near state-of-the-art performance on both continuous control tasks and\nAtari 2600 games, hence providing a simple yet powerful baseline for solving\nMDPs that require considerable exploration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 06:42:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 18:29:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2017 16:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-06"}

The semantics of\nsupervenience modality is very natural to correspond to the\nsupervenience-determined consequence relation, in a quite similar way that the\nstrict implication corresponds to the inference-determined consequence\nrelation.

While several groups\nhave reported such FC changes in PD, there are also significant discrepancies\nbetween studies. Investigating the reproducibility of PD-related FC changes on\nindependent datasets is therefore of crucial importance. We acquired\nresting-state fMRI scans for 43 subjects (27 patients , 16 controls) and\ncompared the observed FC changes with those obtained in 2 independent datasets,\none made available by the PPMI consortium and a second one by the group of Tao\nWu. Unfortunately, PD-related functional connectivity changes turned out to be\nnon-reproducible across datasets. This could be due to disease heterogeneity,\nbut also to technical differences. To distinguish between the two, we devised a\nmethod to directly check for disease heterogeneity using random splits of a\nsingle dataset.

We find that\nin this region the magnetic field lines form a canopy with lower magnetic field\nstrength in the inner part. The photospheric light bridge is dominated by gas\npressure (high-$\\beta$), as opposed to the surrounding umbra where the magnetic\npressure is higher. A convective flow is observed in the light bridge. This\nflow is able to bend the magnetic field lines and to produce field reversals.\nThe field lines close above the light bridge and become as vertical and strong\nas in the surrounding umbra. We conclude that it develops because of two highly\nmagnetized regions which come closer during the sunspot evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 12:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-30"}

In\nthe family of Earth-like planets, such as Venus, this physical mechanism\ncoupled with solid tides makes the angular velocity evolve over long timescales\nand determines the equilibrium configurations of their spin. Contrary to the\nsolid core, the atmosphere is submitted to both tidal gravitational potential\nand insolation flux coming from the star. The complex response of the gas is\nintrinsically linked to its physical properties. This dependence has to be\ncharacterized and quantified to study the large variety of extrasolar planetary\nsystems. We develop a theoretical global model where radiative losses, which\nare predominant in slowly rotating atmospheres, are taken into account. We\nanalytically compute the tidal perturbation of pressure, density, temperature\nand velocity field from which we deduce the expressions of atmospheric Love\nnumbers and tidal torque exerted by the star. The dynamics of atmospheric tides\ndepends on the frequency regime of the tidal perturbation: the thermal regime\nnear synchronization and the dynamical regime characterizing fast-rotating\nplanets. The dependence of the torque on the tidal frequency is quantified for\nEarth-like and Venus-like exoplanets and is in good agreement with the results\ngiven by Global Climate Models (GCM) simulations. Introducing dissipative\nprocesses such as radiation regularizes the tidal response of the atmosphere,\notherwise it is singular at synchronization. We demonstrate the important role\nplayed by the physical and dynamical properties of a super-Earth atmosphere\n(e.g. Coriolis, stratification, background pressure, density, temperature,\nradiative emission) and point out the key parameters defining tidal regimes\n(e.g. inertia, Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a, radiative frequencies, tidal frequency) and\ncharacterize the behaviour of the fluid shell with dissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 12:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-19"}

When the\ncritical fluctuations in these systems are constrained by boundary conditions,\ncritical Casimir forces (CCF) emerge. Here we analyze CCF between boundaries\nwith alternating boundary conditions in two dimensions, employing conformal\nfield theory (CFT). After presenting the concept of boundary changing\noperators, we specifically consider two different boundary configurations for a\nstrip of critical Ising spins: (I) alternating equi-sized domains of up and\ndown spins on both sides of the strip, with a possible lateral shift, and (II)\nalternating domains of up and down spins of different size on one side and\nhomogeneously fixed spins on the other side of the strip. Asymptotic results\nfor the CCF at small and large distances are derived. We introduce a novel\nmodified Szeg\\\"o formula for determinants of real antisymmetric block Toeplitz\nmatrices to obtain the exact CCF and the corresponding scaling functions at all\ndistances. We demonstrate the existence of a surface Renormalization Group flow\nbetween universal force amplitudes of different magnitude and sign.

According to our lens mass models constrained by the {\\it\nHubble Space Telescope} F814W image, we expect the maximum relative time delay\nto be less than a day, which is consistent with the maximum of 100 hours\nreported by Goobar et al. but places a stringent upper limit. Furthermore, the\nfluxes of most of the supernova images depart from expected values suggesting\nthat they are affected by microlensing. The microlensing timescales are small\nenough that they may pose significant problems to measure the time delays\nreliably. Our lensing rate calculation indicates that the occurrence of a\nlensed SN in iPTF is likely. However, the observed total magnification of\niPTF16geu is larger than expected, given its redshift. This may be a further\nindication of ongoing microlensing in this system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 14:44:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 00:39:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

Understanding these core properties would empower\nus in making generalizable conclusions about the quality of representations.\nOur work presented here constitutes the first step in opening the black-box of\nvector embedding for social media posts, with emphasis on tweets in particular.\n  In order to understand the core properties encoded in a tweet representation,\nwe evaluate the representations to estimate the extent to which it can model\neach of those properties such as tweet length, presence of words, hashtags,\nmentions, capitalization, and so on. This is done with the help of multiple\nclassifiers which take the representation as input. Essentially, each\nclassifier evaluates one of the syntactic or social properties which are\narguably salient for a tweet. This is also the first holistic study on\nextensively analysing the ability to encode these properties for a wide variety\nof tweet representation models including the traditional unsupervised methods\n(BOW, LDA), unsupervised representation learning methods (Siamese CBOW,\nTweet2Vec) as well as supervised methods (CNN, BLSTM).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 15:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-16"}

We demonstrate successful application of the SINO method both for\nstandard fiber communication links and for few-mode\nspatial-division-multiplexing systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 12:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}
