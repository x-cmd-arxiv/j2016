A\ncomplex electrode structure is required for the beam splitter which would be\nvery difficult to produce with traditional manufacturing methods. Instead, we\nmake use of a nascent manufacturing technique: 3D printing of a plastic piece,\nfollowed by electroplating. This fabrication method opens a plethora of avenues\nfor research, since 3D printing imposes practically no limitations on possible\nshapes, and the plating produces chemically robust, conductive construction\nelements with an almost free choice of surface material; it has the added\nadvantage of dramatically reduced production cost and time. Our beam splitter\nis an electrostatic hexapole guide that smoothly transforms into two bent\nquadrupoles. We demonstrate the correct functioning of this device by\nseparating a supersonic molecular beam of ND3 into two correlated fractions. It\nis shown that this device can be used to implement experiments with\ndifferential detection wherein one of the fractions serves as a probe and the\nother as a reference. Reverse operation would allow to merging of two beams of\nneutral polar molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 02:14:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 13:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-03"}

The training of VGAN takes a two\nstep procedure: given $p(\\mathbf{x})$, $q(\\mathbf{x})$ is updated to maximize\nthe lower bound; $p(\\mathbf{x})$ is then updated one step with samples drawn\nfrom $q(\\mathbf{x})$ to decrease the lower bound. VGAN is inspired by the\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs), where $p(\\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to\nthe discriminator and $q(\\mathbf{x})$ corresponds to the generator, but with\nseveral notable differences. We hence name our model variational GANs (VGANs).\nVGAN provides a practical solution to training deep EBMs in high dimensional\nspace, by eliminating the need of MCMC sampling. From this view, we are also\nable to identify causes to the difficulty of training GANs and propose viable\nsolutions. \\footnote{Experimental code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Shuangfei/vgan}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2016 16:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-08"}

In this paper we present a new framework\nthat can accurately estimate the cardinality of any set expression between any\nnumber of streams using only a small sample of each stream. The proposed\nframework consists of a new sketch, called Maximal-Term with Subsample (MTS),\nand a family of algorithms that use this sketch. An example of a possible query\nthat can be efficiently answered using the proposed sketch is, How many\ndistinct tuples appear in tables $T_1$ and $T_2$, but not in $T_3$? The\nalgorithms presented in this paper answer such queries accurately, processing\nonly a small sample of the tuples in each table and using a constant amount of\nmemory.

An updated analysis of the H.E.S.S. data shows that the spectrum of\nthe entire SNR connects smoothly to the high-energy spectrum measured by\nFermi-LAT. The increased data set makes it possible to demonstrate that the\nH.E.S.S. spectrum deviates significantly from a power law and is well described\nby both a curved power law and a power law with an exponential cutoff at an\nenergy of $E_\\mathrm{cut} = (6.7 \\pm 1.2_\\mathrm{stat} \\pm 1.2_\\mathrm{syst})$\nTeV.

A simple modeling using one particle population to model the SNR\nemission demonstrates that both leptonic and hadronic emission scenarios remain\nplausible. It is also shown that at least a part of the shell emission is\nlikely due to the presence of a pulsar wind nebula around PSR J0855$-$4644.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 00:27:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2018 21:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-04-30"}

In this work, we describe an algorithm to construct\nfamilies of sum-network instances using incidence structures. The computation\ncapacity of several of these sum-network families is characterized. We\ndemonstrate that unlike the multiple unicast problem, the computation capacity\nof sum-networks depends on the characteristic of the finite field over which\nthe sum is computed. This dependence is very strong; we show examples of\nsum-networks that have a rate-1 solution over one characteristic but a rate\nclose to zero over a different characteristic. Additionally, a sum-network can\nhave an arbitrary different number of computation capacities for different\nalphabets.

Recently, some studies handle multiple modalities on deep generative\nmodels, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs). However, these models\ntypically assume that modalities are forced to have a conditioned relation,\ni.e., we can only generate modalities in one direction. To achieve our\nobjective, we should extract a joint representation that captures high-level\nconcepts among all modalities and through which we can exchange them\nbi-directionally. As described herein, we propose a joint multimodal\nvariational autoencoder (JMVAE), in which all modalities are independently\nconditioned on joint representation. In other words, it models a joint\ndistribution of modalities. Furthermore, to be able to generate missing\nmodalities from the remaining modalities properly, we develop an additional\nmethod, JMVAE-kl, that is trained by reducing the divergence between JMVAE's\nencoder and prepared networks of respective modalities. Our experiments show\nthat our proposed method can obtain appropriate joint representation from\nmultiple modalities and that it can generate and reconstruct them more properly\nthan conventional VAEs.

This suggests that\nthere is a fundamental link -- termed the Black Hole Uncertainty Principle or\nCompton-Schwarzschild correspondence -- between elementary particles in the $M\n< M_{P}$ regime and black holes in the $M > M_{P}$ regime. In the presence of\n$n$ extra dimensions, compactified on some scale $R_E$, one expects $R_S\n\\propto M^{1/(1+n)}$ for $R < R_E$, which breaks this duality. However, it may\nbe restored in some circumstances because the effective Compton wavelength\ndepends on the form of the $(3+n)$-dimensional wavefunction. If this is\nspherically symmetric, then one still has $R_C \\propto M^{-1}$, as in the\n$3$-dimensional case. The effective Planck length is then increased and the\nPlanck mass reduced, allowing the possibility of TeV quantum gravity and black\nhole production at the LHC.

The superpotential is induced by the\nstring wrapping holomorphic, isolated, genus 0 curves. According to the residue\ntheorem of Beasley and Witten, the non-perturbative superpotential must vanish\nin a large class of heterotic vacua because the contributions from curves in\nthe same homology class cancel each other. We point out, however, that in\ncertain cases the curves treated in the residue theorem as lying in the same\nhomology class, can actually have different area with respect to the physical\nKahler form and can be in different homology classes. In these cases, the\nresidue theorem is not directly applicable and the structure of the\nsuperpotential is more subtle. We show, in a specific example, that the\nsuperpotential is non-zero both on \\tilde{X} and on X. On the non-simply\nconnected manifold X, we explicitly compute the leading contribution to the\nsuperpotential from all holomorphic, isolated, genus 0 curves with minimal\narea. The reason for the non-vanishing of the superpotental on X is that the\nsecond homology class contains a finite part called discrete torsion. As a\nresult, the curves with the same area are distributed among different torsion\nclasses and, hence, do not cancel each other.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 07:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

Other\napplications, such as activity recognition, extract manually designed features\nfrom sensor inputs for classification. Such applications face two challenges.\nOn one hand, on-device sensor measurements are noisy. For many mobile\napplications, it is hard to find a distribution that exactly describes the\nnoise in practice. Unfortunately, calculating target quantities based on\nphysical system and noise models is only as accurate as the noise assumptions.\nSimilarly, in classification applications, although manually designed features\nhave proven to be effective, it is not always straightforward to find the most\nrobust features to accommodate diverse sensor noise patterns and user\nbehaviors. To this end, we propose DeepSense, a deep learning framework that\ndirectly addresses the aforementioned noise and feature customization\nchallenges in a unified manner. DeepSense integrates convolutional and\nrecurrent neural networks to exploit local interactions among similar mobile\nsensors, merge local interactions of different sensory modalities into global\ninteractions, and extract temporal relationships to model signal dynamics.\nDeepSense thus provides a general signal estimation and classification\nframework that accommodates a wide range of applications. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of DeepSense using three representative and challenging tasks:\ncar tracking with motion sensors, heterogeneous human activity recognition, and\nuser identification with biometric motion analysis. DeepSense significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods for all three tasks. In addition,\nDeepSense is feasible to implement on smartphones due to its moderate energy\nconsumption and low latency\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 09:10:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Jul 2017 22:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-04"}

Specifically, we consider three\nuplink pilot transmission scenarios in a mmWave MU-MIMO cellular system: 1)\nnon-precoded and uncombined, 2) precoded but uncombined, and 3) precoded and\ncombined. We show that a simple precoder that utilizes only the second-order\nstatistics of the channel reduces the variance of the channel estimation error\nby a factor that is proportional to the number of user equipment (UE) antennas.\nWe also show that using a linear combiner designed based on the second-order\nstatistics of the channel significantly reduces multiuser interference and\nprovides the possibility of reusing some pilots. Specifically, in the large\nantenna regime, pilot precoding and combining help to accommodate a large\nnumber of UEs in one cell, significantly improve channel estimation quality,\nboost the signal-to-noise ratio of the UEs located close to the cell edges,\nalleviate pilot contamination, and address the imbalanced coverage of pilot and\ndata signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 09:25:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 09:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

This is shown here on a\nlarge variety of silica nanoparticle self-assemblies obtained by electrostatic\ncomplexation with carefully selected oppositely charged bio-polyelectrolytes of\ndifferent rigidity. The effective rigidity is quantified by the total\npersistence length $L_T$ representing the sum of the intrinsic ($L_p$) and\nelectrostatic ($L_e$) polyelectrolyte persistence length, which depends on the\nscreening, i.e., on ionic strength due to counter-ions and external salt\nconcentrations.

By working with the Cartesian components of the electric,\nE and magnetic, H fields and with the scalar functions (r*E) and (r*H), the\nproblem is cast as solving a set of scalar Helmholtz equations for the field\ncomponents that are coupled by the usual electromagnetic boundary conditions at\nmaterial boundaries. This facilitates a direct solution for E and H rather than\nworking with surface currents as intermediate quantities in existing methods.\nConsequently, our formulation is free of the well-known numerical instability\nthat occurs in the zero frequency or long wavelength limit in traditional\nsurface integral solutions of Maxwell's equations and our numerical results\nconverge uniformly to the static results in the long wavelength limit.\nFurthermore, we use a formulation of the scalar Helmholtz equation that is\nexpressed as classically convergent integrals and does not require the\nevaluation of principal value integrals or any knowledge of the solid angle.\nTherefore, standard quadrature and higher order surface elements can readily be\nused to improve numerical precision. In addition, near and far field values can\nbe calculated with equal precision and multiscale problems in which the\nscatterers possess characteristic length scales that are both large and small\nrelative to the wavelength can be easily accommodated.

One way to solve this problem is the existence of an alternative\nor additional mechanism for generating turbulence. It can be the bypass\nmechanism, which is responsible for transition to turbulence in Couette and\nPoiseuille flows. This mechanism is based on the transient growth of linear\nperturbations in the flow with the subsequent transition to the nonlinear\nstage. In order to clarify the role of this mechanism in astrophysical disks\nfirst of all it is necessary to calculate the maximal possible growth factor of\nlinear perturbations in the flow.

The Sun and solar-like stars undergo activity cycles for which the\nunderlying mechanisms are not well understood.

We analyse the photometric short cadence Kepler time series of a set of\n24 solar-like stars, which were observed for at least 960 days each, with the\naim to find signatures of stellar magnetic activity in the oscillation\nparameters.\n  Methods.

Using the wavelet technique we construct a new\ntype of map of oscillations for selected periods in the whole domain of the\nradio spectrum. While the oscillation with the period of 181 seconds was\nrecognized in the whole 25-2000 MHz radio spectrum, oscillations with periods\nof 69 and 40 seconds were confirmed only in the 250-870 MHz frequency range. In\nthe 800-2000 MHz range we found periods of 50 and 80 seconds. Moreover, in the\n250-870 MHz frequency range, the oscillation with the period of about 420\nseconds was detected.

At the beginning of the\nradio event, in the 2000-500 MHz frequency range the phase of the 181-second\noscillation drifts towards lower frequencies.

While the phase drift\nat higher frequencies can be interpreted as being caused by the UV wave, the\nsynchronization of the phase on lower frequencies is explained by the\nfast-electron beams, whose acceleration is modulated by the UV wave. Owing to\nthis modulation, the electron beams are accelerated with the period of the UV\nwave (181 seconds). These beams propagate upwards through the solar corona and\ngenerate the 25-500 MHz radio emission with the 181-second period. Due to high\nbeam velocity (~c/3, where c is the light speed) the 25-500 MHz radio emission,\ncorresponding to a large interval of heights in the solar corona, is nearly\nsynchronous.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 14:41:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

In particular, the\nimplementation of the Schwinger mechanism in pure Yang-Mills theories hinges\ncrucially on the inclusion of massless bound-state excitations in the\nfundamental nonperturbative vertices of the theory. The dynamical formation of\nsuch excitations is controlled by a homogeneous linear Bethe-Salpeter equation,\nwhose nontrivial solutions have been studied only in the Landau gauge. Here,\nthe form of this integral equation is derived for general values of the\ngauge-fixing parameter, under a number of simplifying assumptions that reduce\nthe degree of technical complexity. The kernel of this equation consists of\nfully-dressed gluon propagators, for which recent lattice data are used as\ninput, and of three-gluon vertices dressed by a single form factor, which is\nmodelled by means of certain physically motivated Ans\\\"atze. The\ngauge-dependent terms contributing to this kernel impose considerable\nrestrictions on the infrared behavior of the vertex form factor; specifically,\nonly infrared finite Ans\\\"atze are compatible with the existence of nontrivial\nsolutions. When such Ans\\\"atze are employed, the numerical study of the\nintegral equation reveals a continuity in the type of solutions as one varies\nthe gauge-fixing parameter, indicating a smooth departure from the Landau\ngauge. Instead, the logarithmically divergent form factor displaying the\ncharacteristic \"zero crossing\", while perfectly consistent in the Landau gauge,\nhas to undergo a dramatic qualitative transformation away from it, in order to\nyield acceptable solutions.

Given that other\nparts of the spectral energy distribution follow the characteristics implied by\nthe source classification, the inverse Compton component spans 10 orders of\nmagnitude, which cannot be reproduced by the one-zone model. Additionally,\nobservational constraints in both the synchrotron and inverse Compton\ncompoenent strongly constrain the parameters of a self-consistent model ruling\nout the possibility of TeV photon production in the vicinity of the galactic\ncenter. We discuss the possibility that the TeV radiation is emitted by highly\nenergetic particles in the extended, arcsec-scale jet, which has been detected\nat radio and X-ray energies. The slope of the jet X-ray spectrum indicates an\ninverse Compton origin, and an extrapolation to higher energies coincides with\na break feature in the $\\gamma$-ray band. Modeling the jet emission with\ninverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background results in an\nexcellent fit of the radio, X-ray and TeV emission.

Models of spatial working memory typically employ networks\nthat generate persistent activity via a combination of local excitation and\nlateral inhibition. Our model is comprised of a multilayer set of equations\nthat describes connectivity between neurons in the same and different layers\nusing an integral term. The kernel of this integral term then captures the\nimpact of different interlaminar connection strengths, spatial heterogeneity,\nand velocity input.

Both the performance\nand computational complexity of such models are heavily dependant on the design\nof characteristic hyper-parameters (e.g., number of hidden layers, nodes per\nlayer, or choice of activation functions), which have traditionally been\noptimized manually. With machine learning penetrating low-power mobile and\nembedded areas, the need to optimize not only for performance (accuracy), but\nalso for implementation complexity, becomes paramount. In this work, we present\na multi-objective design space exploration method that reduces the number of\nsolution networks trained and evaluated through response surface modelling.\nGiven spaces which can easily exceed 1020 solutions, manually designing a\nnear-optimal architecture is unlikely as opportunities to reduce network\ncomplexity, while maintaining performance, may be overlooked.

For nonstiff systems, common explicit\nintegration algorithms can be used on GPUs, where individual GPU threads\nconcurrently integrate independent ODEs with different initial conditions or\nparameters. One example is the fifth-order adaptive Runge-Kutta-Cash-Karp\n(RKCK) algorithm. In the case of stiff ODEs, standard explicit algorithms\nrequire impractically small time-step sizes for stability reasons, and implicit\nalgorithms are therefore commonly used instead to allow larger time steps and\nreduce the computational expense. However, typical high-order implicit\nalgorithms based on backwards differentiation formulae (e.g., VODE, LSODE)\ninvolve complex logical flow that causes severe thread divergence when\nimplemented on GPUs, limiting the performance. Therefore, alternate algorithms\nare needed. A GPU-based Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev (RKC) algorithm can handle\nmoderate levels of stiffness and performs significantly faster than not only an\nequivalent CPU version but also a CPU-based implicit algorithm (VODE) based on\nresults shown in the literature. In this chapter, we present the mathematical\nbackground, implementation details, and source code for the RKCK and RKC\nalgorithms for use integrating large numbers of independent systems of ODEs on\nGPUs. In addition, brief performance comparisons are shown for each algorithm,\ndemonstrating the potential benefit of moving to GPU-based ODE integrators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Nov 2016 18:11:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

For planewave signals measured with a ULA, the locations of the\nensemble MVDR polynomial zeros are constrained on the unit circle.

Recent years have witnessed a growing interest\nin this long-standing question. Is the wave function ontic, directly\nrepresenting a state of reality, or epistemic, merely representing a state of\n(incomplete) knowledge, or something else? If the wave function is not ontic,\nthen what, if any, is the underlying state of reality? If the wave function is\nindeed ontic, then exactly what physical state does it represent? In this book,\nI aim to make sense of the wave function in quantum mechanics and find the\nontological content of the theory. The book can be divided into three parts.\nThe first part addresses the question of the nature of the wave function\n(Chapters 1-5). After giving a comprehensive and critical review of the\ncompeting views of the wave function, I present a new argument for the ontic\nview in terms of protective measurements. In addition, I also analyze the\norigin of the wave function by deriving the free Schroedinger equation. The\nsecond part analyzes the ontological meaning of the wave function (Chapters 6,\n7). I propose a new ontological interpretation of the wave function in terms of\nrandom discontinuous motion of particles, and give two main arguments\nsupporting this interpretation. The third part investigates whether the\nsuggested quantum ontology is complete in accounting for our definite\nexperience and whether it needs to be revised in the relativistic domain\n(Chapters 8, 9).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 11:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-10"}

This\npaper extends the cyclical model of vacuum observation and posits that choice,\nor the experience of reality, may be expressed as the initial part of the\nself-referencing loop, while the conscious awareness of the experience is the\nother part of the loop. In particular, the inseparability of the two sides of\nthe loop is established through the cyclical time process, which bears a\nresemblance to Heidegger's analysis of existence. The cyclical looping model is\nalso discussed in terms of Wittgenstein's analysis of language as attaching\nsemantic meaning, or continuous or infinite conscious awareness, to physical\nreality. We also discuss the proposed model of subjectivity and cyclical time -\nas opposed to objectivity and linear time - which may be considered similar to\nHebrew thought.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 11:56:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2017 11:52:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-04"}
