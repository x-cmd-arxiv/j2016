From the Kepler catalog, the mean probability of these short-period\ntransiting planets having additional longer period transiters (which would be\nmissed by TESS) is 18%, a value ten times higher than the average star. In this\nwork, we show how this probability is not uniform but functionally dependent\nupon the properties of the observed short-period transiters, ranging from less\nthan 1% up to over 50%. Using artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained on the\nKepler catalog and making careful feature selection to account for the\ndiffering sensitivity of TESS, we are able to predict the most likely\nshort-period transiters to be accompanied by additional transiters. Through\ncross-validation, we predict that a targeted, optimized TESS transit and/or\nradial velocity follow-up program using our trained ANN would have a discovery\nyield improved by a factor of two. Our work enables a near-optimal follow-up\nstrategy for surveys following TESS targets for additional planets, improving\nthe science yield derived from TESS and particularly beneficial in the search\nfor habitable-zone transiting worlds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 16:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-25"}

In this paper, we study this classifier learning problem\nfrom a graph signal processing (GSP) perspective. Specifically, by viewing a\nbinary classifier as a piecewise constant graph-signal in a high-dimensional\nfeature space, we cast classifier learning as a signal restoration problem via\na classical maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation. Unlike previous\ngraph-signal restoration works, we consider in addition edges with negative\nweights that signify anti-correlation between samples. One unfortunate\nconsequence is that the graph Laplacian matrix $\\mathbf{L}$ can be indefinite,\nand previously proposed graph-signal smoothness prior $\\mathbf{x}^T \\mathbf{L}\n\\mathbf{x}$ for candidate signal $\\mathbf{x}$ can lead to pathological\nsolutions. In response, we derive an optimal perturbation matrix\n$\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ - based on a fast lower-bound computation of the minimum\neigenvalue of $\\mathbf{L}$ via a novel application of the Haynsworth inertia\nadditivity formula---so that $\\mathbf{L} + \\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ is positive\nsemi-definite, resulting in a stable signal prior. Further, instead of forcing\na hard binary decision for each sample, we define the notion of generalized\nsmoothness on graph that promotes ambiguity in the classifier signal. Finally,\nwe propose an algorithm based on iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) that\nsolves the posed MAP problem efficiently. Extensive simulation results show\nthat our proposed algorithm outperforms both SVM variants and graph-based\nclassifiers using positive-edge graphs noticeably.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 16:36:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2017 13:10:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-21"}

Our model\nadditionally suggests that microtubule anchoring at the cell cortex may play an\nimportant role for successful bipolar division. This can be tested\nexperimentally by regulating microtubule anchoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 17:43:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2017 15:22:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-24"}

We use three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D\nMHD) simulations to determine the effect of photospheric flows on the open and\nclosed magnetic flux of a model corona with a dipole magnetic field and an\nisothermal solar wind.

Each\nfast neutron event was associated with specific weather metrics (pressure,\ntemperature, absolute humidity) and GPS coordinates. The expected exponential\ndependence of the fast neutron count rate on atmospheric pressure was\ndemonstrated and event rates were subsequently adjusted given the measured\npressure at the time of detection. Pressure adjusted data was also used to\ninvestigate the influence of other environmental conditions on the neutron\nbackground rate. Using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\ncoastal area lidar data, an algorithm was implemented to approximate sky-view\nfactors (the total fraction of visible sky) for points along RadMAPs route.\nThree areas analyzed in San Francisco, Downtown Oakland, and Berkeley all\ndemonstrated a suppression in the background rate of over 50% for the range of\nsky-view factors measured. This effect, which is due to the shielding of\ncosmic-ray produced neutrons by surrounding buildings, was comparable to the\npressure influence which yielded a 32% suppression in the count rate over the\nrange of pressures measured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 19:26:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-26"}

However, due to the\nlack of energy conservation and heating effects, non-trivial (e.g.,\ntopological) many-body states in periodically driven (Floquet) systems are\ngenerally metastable. Therefore it is necessary to find strategies for\npreparing long-lived many-body states in Floquet systems. We develop a\ntheoretical framework for describing the dynamical preparation of states in\nFloquet systems by a slow turn-on of the drive. We find that the dynamics of\nthe system is well approximated by the initial state evolving under a slowly\nvarying effective Hamiltonian $H_{\\rm eff}^{(s)}(t)$, provided the ramp speed\n$s \\gg t_*^{-1} \\sim e^{-{\\mathcal{C} \\frac{\\omega}{J}}}$, the inverse of the\ncharacteristic heating time-scale in the Floquet system. At such ramp speeds,\nthe heating effects due to the drive are exponentially suppressed. We compute\nthe slowly varying effective Hamiltonian $H_{\\rm eff}^{(s)}(t)$, and show that\nat the end of the ramp it is identical to the effective Hamiltonian of the\nunramped Floquet system, up to small corrections of the order $O(s)$.\nTherefore, the system effectively undergoes a slow quench from $H_0$ to $H_{\\rm\neff}$. As an application, we consider the passage of the slow quench through a\nquantum critical point (QCP), and estimate the energy absorbed due to the\nnon-adiabatic passage through the QCP via a Kibble-Zurek mechanism. By\nminimizing the energy absorbed due to both the drive and the ramp, we find an\noptimal ramp speed $s_* \\sim t_*^{-z/({d+2z})}$ for which both heating effects\nare exponentially suppressed.

We argue that the charge separation effect also inevitably occurs during\nthe same QCD transition in the presence of the $\\cal{CP}$ odd axion field\n$a(x)$. It leads to preferential formation of one species of nuggets on the\nscales of the visible Universe where the axion field $a(x)$ is coherent.

We\npresent the XMM-Newton Cluster Outskirts Project (X-COP), which targets the\nouter regions of a sample of 13 massive clusters\n($M_{500}>3\\times10^{14}M_\\odot$) in the redshift range 0.04-0.1 at uniform\ndepth. The sample was selected based on the signal-to-noise ratio in the Planck\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) survey with the aim of combining high-quality X-ray and\nSZ constraints throughout the entire cluster volume. Our observing strategy\nallows us to reach a sensitivity of $3\\times10^{-16}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$\narcmin$^{-2}$ in the [0.5-2.0] keV range thanks to a good control of systematic\nuncertainties. The combination of depth and field of view achieved in X-COP\nwill allow us to pursue the following main goals: i) measure the distribution\nof entropy and thermal energy to an unprecedented level of precision; ii)\nassess the presence of non-thermal pressure support in cluster outskirts; iii)\nstudy the occurrence and mass distribution of infalling gas clumps. We\nillustrate the capabilities of the program with a pilot study on the cluster\nAbell 2142.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 21:01:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

The reconstruction task is challenging as human faces\nvary extensively when considering expressions, poses, textures, and intrinsic\ngeometries. While many approaches tackle this complexity by using additional\ndata to reconstruct the face of a single subject, extracting facial surface\nfrom a single image remains a difficult problem. As a result, single-image\nbased methods can usually provide only a rough estimate of the facial geometry.\nIn contrast, we propose to leverage the power of convolutional neural networks\nto produce a highly detailed face reconstruction from a single image. For this\npurpose, we introduce an end-to-end CNN framework which derives the shape in a\ncoarse-to-fine fashion. The proposed architecture is composed of two main\nblocks, a network that recovers the coarse facial geometry (CoarseNet),\nfollowed by a CNN that refines the facial features of that geometry (FineNet).\nThe proposed networks are connected by a novel layer which renders a depth\nimage given a mesh in 3D. Unlike object recognition and detection problems,\nthere are no suitable datasets for training CNNs to perform face geometry\nreconstruction. Therefore, our training regime begins with a supervised phase,\nbased on synthetic images, followed by an unsupervised phase that uses only\nunconstrained facial images. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed model\nis demonstrated by both qualitative and quantitative evaluation tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 21:08:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2017 15:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-07"}

Firstly we propose a new way of defining\nmessages (fields) in a generic CVM approximation, such that messages arrive on\na given region from all its ancestors, and not only from its direct parents, as\nin the standard Parent-to-Child GBP. We call this approach maximal messages.\nSecondly we focus on the case of binary variables, re-interpreting the messages\nas fields enforcing the consistency between the moments of the local (marginal)\nprobability distributions. We provide a precise rule to enforce all\nconsistencies, avoiding any redundancy, that would otherwise lead to a gauge\ntransformation on the messages. This moment matching method is gauge free, i.e.\nit guarantees that the resulting GBP is not gauge invariant.\n  We apply our maximal messages and moment matching GBP to obtain an analytical\nexpression for the critical temperature of the Ising model in general\ndimensions at the level of plaquette-CVM. The values obtained outperform Bethe\nestimates, and are comparable with loop corrected Belief Propagation equations.\nThe method allows for a straightforward generalization to disordered systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 21:37:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 16:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-27"}

We re-assess the potential of asteroseismology for probing the chemical\nstratification in white dwarf cores, in light of new highly efficient tools\nrecently developed for that purpose.\n  Methods. Using the forward modeling approach and a new parameterization for\nthe core chemical stratification in ZZ Ceti stars, we test several situations\ntypical of the usually limited constraints available, such as small numbers of\nobserved independent modes, to carry out asteroseismology of these stars.\n  Results. We find that, even with a limited number of modes, the core chemical\nstratification (in particular, the location of the steep chemical transitions\nexpected in the oxygen profile) can be determined quite precisely due to the\nsignificant sensitivity of some confined modes to partial reflexion (trapping)\neffects.

From Bethe Ansatz results and a variational approach, we confirm\nthat the Chern number is preserved in the delocalized phase for $\\alpha<1$. We\nreport a divergence of the Berry curvature at the equator when $\\alpha_c=1$\nthat appears at the localization Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition\nin this model. Recent experiments in quantum circuits have engineered\nnon-equilibrium protocols in time to access topological properties at\nequilibrium from the measure of the (quasi-)adiabatic out-of-equilibrium spin\nexpectation values. Applying a numerically exact stochastic Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation we find that, for a fixed sweep velocity, the bath induces a crossover\nfrom (quasi-)adiabatic to non-adiabatic dynamical behavior when the spin bath\ncoupling increases. We also investigate the particular regime $H/\\omega_c \\ll\nv/H \\ll 1$, where the dynamical Chern number observable built from\nout-of-equilibrium spin expectation values vanishes at $\\alpha=1/2$. In this\nregime, the mapping to an interacting resonance level model enables us to\ncharacterize the evolution of the dynamical Chern number in the vicinity of\n$\\alpha=1/2$. Then, we provide an intuitive physical explanation of the\nbreakdown of adiabaticity in analogy to the Faraday effect in electromagnetism.\nWe demonstrate that the driving of the spin leads to the production of a large\nnumber of bosonic excitations in the bath, which in return strongly affect the\nspin dynamics. Finally, we quantify the spin-bath entanglement and build an\nanalogy with an effective model at thermal equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 22:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

First, we learn local\ncontrollers that are able to perform the task starting at a predefined initial\nstate. These controllers are constructed using trajectory optimization with\nrespect to locally-linear time-varying models learned directly from sensor\ndata. In some cases, we initialize the optimizer with human demonstrations\ncollected via teleoperation in a virtual environment. We demonstrate that such\ncontrollers can perform the task robustly, both in simulation and on the\nphysical platform, for a limited range of initial conditions around the trained\nstarting state. We then consider two interpolation methods for generalizing to\na wider range of initial conditions: deep learning, and nearest neighbors. We\nfind that nearest neighbors achieve higher performance. Nevertheless, the\nneural network has its advantages: it uses only tactile and proprioceptive\nfeedback but no visual feedback about the object (i.e. it performs the task\nblind) and learns a time-invariant policy.

In\nthis paper we explore the idea that \"well-typed languages are sound\": the idea\nthat the appropriate typing discipline over language specifications guarantees\nthat the language is type sound. We instantiate this idea for a certain class\nof languages defined using small step operational semantics by ensuring the\nprogress and preservation theorems. Our first contribution is a syntactic\ndiscipline for organizing and restricting language specifications so that they\nautomatically satisfy the progress theorem. This discipline is not novel but\nmakes explicit the way expert language designers have been organizing a certain\nclass of languages for long time. We give a formal account of this discipline\nby representing language specifications as (higher-order) logic programs and by\ngiving a meta type system over that collection of formulas. Our second\ncontribution is a methodology and meta type system for guaranteeing that\nlanguages satisfy the preservation theorem. Ultimately, we proved that language\nspecifications that conform to our meta type systems are guaranteed to be type\nsound. We have implemented these ideas in the TypeSoundnessCertifier, a tool\nthat takes language specifications in the form of logic programs and type\nchecks them according to our meta type systems. For those languages that pass\nour type checker, our tool automatically produces a proof of type soundness\nthat can be machine-checked by the Abella proof assistant. For those languages\nthat fail our type checker, the tool pinpoints the design mistakes that hinder\ntype soundness. We have applied the TypeSoundnessCertifier to a large number of\nprogramming languages, including those with recursive types, polymorphism,\nletrec, exceptions, lists and other common types and operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 00:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The key limiting factor is the high energy consumption of CNN\nprocessing due to its high computational complexity. While there are many\nprevious efforts that try to reduce the CNN model size or amount of\ncomputation, we find that they do not necessarily result in lower energy\nconsumption, and therefore do not serve as a good metric for energy cost\nestimation.\n  To close the gap between CNN design and energy consumption optimization, we\npropose an energy-aware pruning algorithm for CNNs that directly uses energy\nconsumption estimation of a CNN to guide the pruning process. The energy\nestimation methodology uses parameters extrapolated from actual hardware\nmeasurements that target realistic battery-powered system setups. The proposed\nlayer-by-layer pruning algorithm also prunes more aggressively than previously\nproposed pruning methods by minimizing the error in output feature maps instead\nof filter weights. For each layer, the weights are first pruned and then\nlocally fine-tuned with a closed-form least-square solution to quickly restore\nthe accuracy. After all layers are pruned, the entire network is further\nglobally fine-tuned using back-propagation. With the proposed pruning method,\nthe energy consumption of AlexNet and GoogLeNet are reduced by 3.7x and 1.6x,\nrespectively, with less than 1% top-5 accuracy loss.

In contrast to traditional Stokes\ninversion codes, which solve the Unno-Rachkovsky equations for the polarized\nradiative transfer numerically and fit the Stokes profiles iteratively, the new\ntechnique provides the full set of atmospheric parameters. This gives us the\nability to start an MHD simulation that takes the inversion result as initial\ncondition. After a relaxation process of half an hour solar time we obtain\nphysically consistent MHD data sets with a target similar to the observation.\nThe new MHD simulation is used to repeat the method in a second iteration,\nwhich further improves the match between observation and simulation, resulting\nin a factor of 2.2 lower mean $\\chi^2$ value. One advantage of the new\ntechnique is that it provides the physical parameters on a geometrical height\nscale. It constitutes a first step towards inversions giving results consistent\nwith the MHD equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 07:47:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

Interestingly, even scattering between\nco-propagating modes induces longitudinal forces as the transverse confinement\nof the light modes creates mode dependent longitudinal wave-vectors and photon\nmomenta. We generalize a proven scattering matrix based approach to calculate\nsingle as well as inter-particle forces to include several forward and backward\npropagating modes.

In particular, the\nexact role of rotation has been questioned by puzzling properties of OB stars\nin the Magellanic Clouds. Our goal is to study the relation between surface\nchemical composition and rotational velocity, and to test predictions of\nevolutionary models including rotation. We have performed a spectroscopic\nanalysis of a sample of fifteen Galactic O7-8 giant stars. This sample is\nhomogeneous in terms of mass, metallicity and evolutionary state. It is made of\nstars with a wide range of projected rotational velocities. We show that the\nsample stars are located on the second half of the main sequence, in a\nrelatively narrow mass range (25-40 Msun). Almost all stars with projected\nrotational velocities above 100 km/s have N/C ratios about ten times the\ninitial value. Below 100 km/s a wide range of N/C values is observed. The\nrelation between N/C and surface gravity is well reproduced by various sets of\nmodels. Some evolutionary models including rotation are also able to\nconsistently explain slowly rotating, highly enriched stars. This is due to\ndifferential rotation which efficiently transports nucleosynthesis products and\nallows the surface to rotate slower than the core. In addition, angular\nmomentum removal by winds amplifies surface braking on the main sequence.\nComparison of the surface composition of O7-8 giant stars with a sample of B\nstars with initial masses about four times smaller reveal that chemical\nenrichment scales with initial mass, as expected from theory. Although\nevolutionary models that include rotation face difficulties in explaining the\nchemical properties of O- and B-type stars at low metallicity, some of them can\nconsistently account for the properties of main-sequence Galactic O stars in\nthe mass range 25-40 Msun\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 11:17:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-22"}

Such a control\naims at appropriately optimizing decoherence processes of a central two-level\nsystem (a given vibrational mode, for instance) towards its environmental bath\n(including, for instance, all other normal modes). A variety of applications\ncould potentially be envisioned, either to preserve the central system from\ndecaying (long duration molecular alignment or orientation, qubit decoherence\nprotection) or, to speed up the information flow towards the bath (efficient\ncharge or proton transfers in long chain organic compounds). Achieving such\ncontrols require some quantitative measures of decoherence in relation with\nmemory effects in the bath response, actually given by the degree of\nnon-Markovianity. Characteristic decoherence rates of a Spin-Boson model are\ncalculated using a Nakajima-Zwanzig type master equation with converged HEOM\nexpansion for the memory kernel. It is shown that, by adequately tuning the\ntwo-level transition frequency through a controlled Stark shift produced by an\nexternal laser field, non-Markovianity can be enhanced in a continuous way\nleading to a first attempt towards the control of OQS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 11:35:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Dec 2016 09:27:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

In\nphotoluminescence experiments, we identify three magnetic field regimes. At low\nfields, the exciton density is increased by a reduced charge carrier escape\nfrom the trap, and additionally, the excitons' emission energy is corrected by\na positive diamagnetic shift. At intermediate fields, magnetic field dependent\ncorrection terms apply which follow the characteristics of a neutral\nmagnetoexciton. Due to a combined effect of an increasing binding energy and\nlifetime, the exciton density is roughly doubled from zero to about seven\nTesla. At the latter high field value, the charge carriers occupy only the\nlowest Landau level. In this situation, the exciton trap can overflow\nindependently from the electrostatic depth of the trapping potential, and the\nenergy shift of the excitons caused by the so-called quantum confined Stark\neffect is effectively compensated. Instead, the exciton energetics seem to be\ndriven by the magnetic field dependent renormalization of the many-body\ninteraction terms. In this regime, the impact of parasitic in-plane fields at\nthe edge of trapping potential is eliminated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 11:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-28"}

The occlusions incurred by random\nmeshes severely degenerate the performance of face verification systems, which\nraises the MeshFace verification problem between MeshFace and daily photos.\nPrevious methods cast this problem as a typical low-level vision problem, i.e.\nblind inpainting. They recover perceptually pleasing clear ID photos from\nMeshFaces by enforcing pixel level similarity between the recovered ID images\nand the ground-truth clear ID images and then perform face verification on\nthem. Essentially, face verification is conducted on a compact feature space\nrather than the image pixel space. Therefore, this paper argues that pixel\nlevel similarity and feature level similarity jointly offer the key to improve\nthe verification performance. Based on this insight, we offer a novel feature\noriented blind face inpainting framework. Specifically, we implement this by\nestablishing a novel DeMeshNet, which consists of three parts. The first part\naddresses blind inpainting of the MeshFaces by implicitly exploiting extra\nsupervision from the occlusion position to enforce pixel level similarity. The\nsecond part explicitly enforces a feature level similarity in the compact\nfeature space, which can explore informative supervision from the feature space\nto produce better inpainting results for verification. The last part copes with\nface alignment within the net via a customized spatial transformer module when\nextracting deep facial features. All the three parts are implemented within an\nend-to-end network that facilitates efficient optimization. Extensive\nexperiments on two MeshFace datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed DeMeshNet as well as the insight of this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 13:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

One of the main bottlenecks is a disocclusion step,\nwhich in commercial 3D conversion is usually done by teams of artists armed\nwith a toolbox of inpainting algorithms. A current difficulty in this is that\nmost available algorithms are either too slow for interactive use, or provide\nno intuitive means for users to tweak the output. In this paper we present a\nnew fast inpainting algorithm based on transporting along automatically\ndetected splines, which the user may edit. Our algorithm is implemented on the\nGPU and fills the inpainting domain in successive shells that adapt their shape\non the fly. In order to allocate GPU resources as efficiently as possible, we\npropose a parallel algorithm to track the inpainting interface as it evolves,\nensuring that no resources are wasted on pixels that are not currently being\nworked on. Theoretical analysis of the time and processor complexiy of our\nalgorithm without and with tracking (as well as numerous numerical experiments)\ndemonstrate the merits of the latter. Our transport mechanism is similar to the\none used in coherence transport, but improves upon it by corrected a \"kinking\"\nphenomena whereby extrapolated isophotes may bend at the boundary of the\ninpainting domain. Theoretical results explaining this phenomena and its\nresolution are presented. Although our method ignores texture, in many cases\nthis is not a problem due to the thin inpainting domains in 3D conversion.\nExperimental results show that our method can achieve a visual quality that is\ncompetitive with the state-of-the-art while maintaining interactive speeds and\nproviding the user with an intuitive interface to tweak the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 15:30:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 18:26:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 19:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

In this paper, we employ deep\nnetworks to learn distinct fake image related features. In contrast to\nauthentic images, fake images tend to be eye-catching and visually striking.\nCompared with traditional visual recognition tasks, it is extremely challenging\nto understand these psychologically triggered visual patterns in fake images.\nTraditional general image classification datasets, such as ImageNet set, are\ndesigned for feature learning at the object level but are not suitable for\nlearning the hyper-features that would be required by image credibility\nanalysis. In order to overcome the scarcity of training samples of fake images,\nwe first construct a large-scale auxiliary dataset indirectly related to this\ntask. This auxiliary dataset contains 0.6 million weakly-labeled fake and real\nimages collected automatically from social media. Through an AdaBoost-like\ntransfer learning algorithm, we train a CNN model with a few instances in the\ntarget training set and 0.6 million images in the collected auxiliary set. This\nlearning algorithm is able to leverage knowledge from the auxiliary set and\ngradually transfer it to the target task. Experiments on a real-world testing\nset show that our proposed domain transferred CNN model outperforms several\ncompeting baselines.

For pulsed laser micromachining, this important\nobservable depends upon material properties, pulse properties and the number of\npulses applied in a complex manner that is not yet well understood. The\nincubation effect is one example. It manifests as a change in the ablation\nthreshold as a function of number of laser pulses applied and is driven by\nphotoinduced defect accumulation in the material. Here, we study femtosecond\n(800 nm, 110 fs, 0.1-1 mJ/pulse) micromachining of a material with well-defined\ninitial defect concentrations: doped Si across a range of dopant types and\nconcentrations.

In contrast, the\ninfinite-pulse ablation threshold (Fth,inf) was the same for all doping levels\nand types. We attribute this asymptotic behaviour to a maximum defect\nconcentration that is independent of the initial defect concentration and type.\nThese results lend insight into the mechanism of multipulse, femtosecond laser\nablation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 16:29:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

Most prior methods for this task learn to\ndetect such important objects from the manually labeled first-person data in a\nsupervised fashion. However, important objects are strongly related to the\ncamera wearer's internal state such as his intentions and attention, and thus,\nonly the person wearing the camera can provide the importance labels. Such a\nconstraint makes the annotation process costly and limited in scalability.\n  In this work, we show that we can detect important objects in first-person\nimages without the supervision by the camera wearer or even third-person\nlabelers. We formulate an important detection problem as an interplay between\nthe 1) segmentation and 2) recognition agents.

Our VSN consists of spatial (\"where\") and visual (\"what\") pathways, one\nof which learns common visual semantics while the other focuses on the spatial\nlocation cues.

While interacting with others, humans tend to\nspontaneously coordinate their movement and unconsciously give rise to joint\nimprovisation. However, it has yet to be shed light on the relationship between\nindividuality and joint improvisation. By means of an ad-hoc virtual agent, in\nthis work we uncover the internal mechanisms of the transition from solo to\njoint improvised motion in the mirror game, a simple yet effective paradigm for\nstudying interpersonal human coordination. According to the analysis of\nexperimental data, normalized segments of velocity in solo motion are regarded\nas individual motor signature, and the existence of velocity segments\npossessing a prescribed signature is theoretically guaranteed. In this work, we\nfirst develop a systematic approach based on velocity segments to generate\n\\emph{in-silico} trajectories of a given human participant playing solo. Then\nwe present an online algorithm for the virtual player to produce joint\nimprovised motion with another agent while exhibiting some desired kinematic\ncharacteristics, and to account for movement coordination and mutual adaptation\nduring joint action tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed approach\nsucceeds in revealing the kinematic features transition from solo to joint\nimprovised motions, thus revealing the existence of a tight relationship\nbetween individuality and joint improvisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Nov 2016 14:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-18"}

There are several proposals in the\nliterature for causally consistent data stores. Thanks to the use of single\nscalar physical clocks, GentleRain has a throughput higher than other proposals\nsuch as COPS or Orbe. However, both of its correctness and performance relay on\nmonotonic synchronized physical clocks. Specifically, if physical clocks go\nbackward its correctness is violated. In addition, GentleRain is sensitive on\nthe clock synchronization, and clock skew may slow write operations in\nGenlteRain. In this paper, we want to solve this issue in GenlteRain by using\nHybrid Logical Clock (HLC) instead of physical clocks. Using HLC, GentleRain\nprotocl is not sensitive on the clock skew anymore.
