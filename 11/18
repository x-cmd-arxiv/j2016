To\naddress this need, several \\textit{in vivo} and \\textit{in vitro} techniques\nhave been developed so far that try to characterize and predict the binding\nspecificity of a protein to different DNA loci. The major problem with these\ntechniques is that they are not accurate enough in prediction of the binding\naffinity and characterization of the corresponding motifs.

Lock-free data structures are based\non retry loops and are called by application-specific routines. In contrast to\nprevious work, we consider in this paper lock-free data structures in dynamic\nenvironments. The size of each of the retry loops, and the size of the\napplication routines invoked in between, are not constant but may change\ndynamically. The new frameworks follow two different approaches. The first\nframework, the simplest one, is based on queuing theory. It introduces an\naverage-based approach that facilitates a more coarse-grained analysis, with\nthe benefit of being ignorant of size distributions. Because of this\nindependence from the distribution nature it covers a set of complicated\ndesigns. The second approach, instantiated with an exponential distribution for\nthe size of the application routines, uses Markov chains, and is tighter\nbecause it constructs stochastically the execution, step by step.\n  Both frameworks provide a performance estimate which is close to what we\nobserve in practice. We have validated our analysis on (i) several fundamental\nlock-free data structures such as stacks, queues, deques and counters, some of\nthem employing helping mechanisms, and (ii) synthetic tests covering a wide\nrange of possible lock-free designs.

In order to make\nthese models computationally tractable, they rely on a number of assumptions\nthat may not be realistic for the domain of application; in particular, the\nability to provide exact numerical parameter assessments, and the applicability\nof time-homogeneity and the eponymous Markov property. In this work, we extend\nthese models to imprecise continuous-time Markov chains (ICTMC's), which are a\nrobust generalisation that relaxes these assumptions while remaining\ncomputationally tractable.\n  More technically, an ICTMC is a set of \"precise\" continuous-time finite-state\nstochastic processes, and rather than computing expected values of functions,\nwe seek to compute lower expectations, which are tight lower bounds on the\nexpectations that correspond to such a set of \"precise\" models. Note that, in\ncontrast to e.g. Bayesian methods, all the elements of such a set are treated\non equal grounds; we do not consider a distribution over this set.\n  The first part of this paper develops a formalism for describing\ncontinuous-time finite-state stochastic processes that does not require the\naforementioned simplifying assumptions. Next, this formalism is used to\ncharacterise ICTMC's and to investigate their properties. The concept of lower\nexpectation is then given an alternative operator-theoretic characterisation,\nby means of a lower transition operator, and the properties of this operator\nare investigated as well. Finally, we use this lower transition operator to\nderive tractable algorithms (with polynomial runtime complexity w.r.t. the\nmaximum numerical error) for computing the lower expectation of functions that\ndepend on the state at any finite number of time points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 17:29:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 21:26:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-22"}

We find\nthat Plummer's (1916) conclusion that the asteroids' eccentricities follow a\nRayleigh distribution holds for the osculating eccentricities of large\nasteroids, but the proper eccentricities deviate from a Rayleigh distribution:\nthere is a deficit of eccentricities smaller than $\\sim0.1$ and an excess of\nlarger eccentricities. We further find that the proper eccentricities do not\ndepend significantly on asteroid size but have strong dependence on\nheliocentric distance: the outer asteroid belt follows a Rayleigh distribution,\nbut the inner belt is strikingly different. Eccentricities in the inner belt\ncan be modeled as a vector sum of a primordial eccentricity vector of random\norientation and magnitude drawn from a Rayleigh distribution of parameter\n$\\sim0.06$, and an excitation of random phase and magnitude $\\sim0.13$. These\nresults imply that a late dynamical excitation of the asteroids occurred, it\nwas independent of asteroid size, it was stronger in the inner belt than in the\nouter belt.

MERA also shares many deep relationships with the AdS/CFT\n(gauge-gravity) correspondence by realizing a UV complete holographic duality\nwithin the tensor networks framework. Motivated by this, we have re-purposed\nthe MERA tensor network as an analysis tool to study the real-time evolution of\nthe 1D transverse Ising model in its low energy excited state sector. We\nperformed this analysis by allowing the ancilla qubits of the MERA tensor\nnetwork to acquire quantum fluctuations, which yields a unitary transform\nbetween the physical (boundary) and ancilla qubit (bulk) Hilbert spaces. This\nthen defines a reversible quantum circuit which is used as a `holographic\ntransform' to study excited states and their real-time dynamics from the point\nof the bulk ancillae. In the gapped paramagnetic phase of the transverse field\nIsing model, we demonstrate the holographic duality between excited states\ninduced by single spin-flips (Ising `magnons') acting on the ground state and\nsingle ancilla qubit spin-flips. The single ancillae qubit excitation is shown\nto be stable in the bulk under real-time evolution and hence defines a stable\nholographic quasiparticle which we have named the `hologron'. The `dictionary'\nbetween the bulk and boundary is determined and realizes many features of the\nholographic correspondence in a non-CFT limit of the boundary theory. As an\nadded spin-off, this dictionary together with the extension to multi-hologron\nsectors gives us a systematic way to construct quantitatively accurate low\nenergy effective Hamiltonians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 21:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-31"}

Besides naturally providing dark matter (DM) candidates as the\nlightest charged twin fermions, the twin sector contains a light photon and\nneutrinos, which can modify structure formation relative to the prediction from\nthe $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm. We focus on two scenarios. First, we study a\nFraternal Twin Higgs model in which the spin-3/2 baryon\n$\\hat{\\Omega}\\sim(\\hat{b}\\hat{b}\\hat{b})$ and the lepton twin tau $\\hat{\\tau}$\ncontribute to the dominant and subcomponent dark matter densities. A\nnon-decoupled scattering between the twin tau and twin neutrino arising from a\ngauged twin lepton number symmetry provides a drag force that damps the density\ninhomogeneity of a dark matter subcomponent. Next, we consider the possibility\nof having the twin hydrogen atom $\\hat{H}$ as the dominant DM component. After\nrecombination, a small fraction of the twin protons and leptons remains ionized\nduring structure formation, and their scattering to twin neutrinos through a\ngauged U$(1)_{B-L}$ force provides the mechanism that damps the density\ninhomogeneity. Both scenarios realize the Partially Acoustic dark matter\n(PAcDM) scenario and explain the $\\sigma_8$ discrepancy between the CMB and\nweak lensing results. Moreover, the self-scattering neutrino behaves as a dark\nfluid that enhances the size of the Hubble rate $H_0$ to accommodate the local\nmeasurement result while satisfying the CMB constraint. For the small-scale\nstructure, the scattering of $\\hat{\\Omega}$'s and $\\hat{H}$'s through the twin\nphoton exchange generates a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model that\nsolves the mass deficit problem from dwarf galaxy to galaxy cluster scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 21:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2017 17:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-11"}

To this purpose we have run a suite of\nhigh-resolution N-body simulations to accurately characterise the low mass-end\nof the halo mass function and derive DM model predictions of the high-z\nluminosity function. In order to convert halo masses into UV-magnitudes we\nintroduce an empirical approach based on halo abundance matching which allows\nus to model the LF in terms of the amplitude and scatter of the ensemble\naverage star formation rate halo mass relation of each DM model, $\\langle {\\rm\nSFR}({\\rm M_{ h}},z)\\rangle$. We find that independent of the DM scenario the\naverage SFR at fixed halo mass increases from z=6 to 8, while the scatter\nremains constant. At halo mass ${\\rm M_{h}}\\gtrsim 10^{12}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$\nh$^{-1}$ the average SFR as function of halo mass follows a double power law\ntrend that is common to all models, while differences occur at smaller masses.\nIn particular, we find that models with a suppressed low-mass halo abundance\nexhibit higher SFR compared to the CDM results. Using deviance statistics we\nobtain a lower limit on the WDM thermal relic particle mass, $m_{\\rm\nWDM}\\gtrsim 1.5$ keV at $2\\sigma$. In the case of LFDM models, the phase\ntransition redshift parameter is bounded to $z_t\\gtrsim 8\\cdot 10^5$ at\n$2\\sigma$.

We remark\nthat measurements at $z=6$ slightly favour a flattening of the LF at faint\nUV-magnitudes.

The promise of efficient parallel data processing\nand low power consumption renders this field one of the most promising research\nareas in spintronics. In this context, the process of parallel parametric\namplification, i.e., the conversion of microwave photons into magnons at one\nhalf of the microwave frequency, has proven to be a versatile tool. Its\nbeneficial and unique properties, such as frequency and mode-selectivity, the\npossibility to excite spin waves in a wide wavevector range and the creation of\nphase-correlated wave pairs, render it one of the key methods of spin-wave\ngeneration and amplification.\n  The application of parallel parametric amplification to micro- and\nnanostructures is an important step towards the realization of magnonic\nnetworks. This is motivated not only by the fact that amplifiers are an\nimportant tool for the construction of any extended logic network but also by\nthe unique properties of parallel parametric amplification, such as a\nphase-dependent amplification.

To maintain connectivity as the\norganism grows, dendrites must also continue to grow. For example, the\ndendrites in the peripheral nervous system continue to grow and branch to\nmaintain proper coverage of their receptor fields [2, 3, 4, 5]. One such neuron\nis the Drosophila melanogaster class IV dendritic arborization neuron [6]. The\ndendritic arbors of these neurons tile the larval surface [7], where they\ndetect localized noxious stimuli, such as jabs from parasitic wasps [8]. In the\npresent study, we used a novel measure, the hitting probability, to show that\nthe class IV neuron forms a tight mesh that covers the larval surface.\nFurthermore, we found that the mesh size remains largely unchanged during the\nlarval stages, despite a dramatic increase in overall size of the neuron and\nthe larva. We also found that the class IV dendrites are dense (assayed with\nthe fractal dimension) and uniform (assayed with the lacunarity) throughout the\nlarval stages. To understand how the class IV neuron maintains its morphology\nduring larval development, we constructed a mathematical model based on random\nbranching and self-avoidance. We found that if the branching rate is uniform in\nspace and time and that if all contacting branches are deleted, we can\nreproduce the branch length distribution, mesh size and density of the class IV\ndendrites throughout the larval stages. Thus, a simple set of statistical rules\ncan generate and maintain a complex branching morphology during growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 22:08:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-21"}

In addition to the\ntransits of a planet in front of its star and the eclipses of the planet by its\nstar, researchers have reported flux variations at the orbital frequency and\nits harmonics: planetary reflection and/or emission and Doppler beaming of\nstarlight produce one peak per orbit, while ellipsoidal variations of a tidally\ndistorted star and/or planet produce two maxima per orbit. Researchers have\nalso reported significant photometric variability at three times the orbital\nfrequency, sometimes much greater than the predictions of tidal theory. The\nreflected phase variations of a homogeneous planet contains power at even\norbital harmonics-important for studies of ellipsoidal variations-but cannot\ncontain odd orbital harmonics. We show that odd harmonics can, however, be\nproduced by an edge-on planet with a time-variable map, or an inclined planet\nwith a North-South (N-S) asymmetric map. Either of these scenarios entail\nweather: short-period planets are expected to have zero obliquity and hence N-S\nsymmetric stellar forcing. North-South asymmetry in a giant planet would\ntherefore suggest stochastic localized features, such as weather. However, we\nfind that previous claims of large-amplitude odd modes in Kepler photometry are\nartifacts of removing planetary transits rather than modeling them. The only\nreliable claims of odd harmonics remain HAT-P-7b and Kepler-13Ab, for which the\nthird mode amplitude is 6-8% of the planetary flux. Although time-variable\nalbedo maps could in principle explain these odd harmonics, upper-limits on the\ninfrared variability of hot Jupiters make this hypothesis unlikely.

After\nrecalibrating star formation measures, we are able to reliably measure specific\nstar formation rates well below the \"main sequence\" of star formation vs mass.\nWe find an unexpectedly large population of galaxies with star formation rates\nintermediate between vigorously star-forming main sequence galaxies and passive\ngalaxies, and with gas content disproportionately high for their star formation\nrates. Several lines of evidence suggest that these quiescent galaxies form a\ndistinct population rather than a low star formation tail of the main sequence.\nWe demonstrate that a tight main sequence, evolving with epoch, is a natural\noutcome of most histories of star formation and has little astrophysical\nsignificance, but that the quiescent population requires additional\nastrophysics to explain its properties. Using a simple model for disk evolution\nbased on the observed dependence of star formation on gas content in local\ngalaxies, and assuming simple histories of cold gas inflow, we show that the\nevolution of galaxies away from the main sequence can be attributed to the\ndepletion of gas due to star formation after a cutoff in gas inflow. The\nquiescent population is composed of galaxies in which the density of disk gas\nhas fallen below a threshold for disk stability. The evolution of galaxies\nbeyond the quiescent state to gas exhaustion requires another process, probably\nwind-driven mass loss. The SSFR distribution of the quiescent and passive\nimplies that the timescale of this process must be greater than a few Gyrs but\nless than a few tens of Gyrs. The environmental dependence of the galaxy\npopulations is consistent with recent theory suggesting that cold gas inflows\ninto galaxies are truncated at earlier times in denser environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 00:08:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 15:16:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-26"}

In this paper, the effect of a guide field on reconnection during\nisland merging is considered. In contrast to the earlier current sheet studies,\nwe identify a limited range of guide fields for which the reconnection rate,\noutflow velocity, and pile-up magnetic field increase in magnitude as the guide\nfield increases. The Hall-MHD fluid model is found to reproduce kinetic\nreconnection rates only for a sufficiently strong guide field, for which ion\ninertia breaks the frozen-in condition and the outflow becomes Alfvenic in the\nkinetic system. The merging of large islands occurs on a longer timescale in\nthe zero guide field limit, which may in part be due to a mirror-like\ninstability that occurs upstream of the reconnection region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 00:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

In this\nmodel, a carbon-oxygen white dwarf star explodes following detonation of a\nsurface layer of helium. One potential signature of this explosion mechanism is\nthe presence of unburned helium in the outer ejecta, left over from the surface\nhelium layer. In this paper we present simple approximations to estimate the\noptical depths of important He I lines in the ejecta of double-detonation\nmodels. We use these approximations to compute synthetic spectra, including the\nHe I lines, for double-detonation models obtained from hydrodynamical explosion\nsimulations. Specifically, we focus on photospheric-phase predictions for the\nnear-infrared 10830 \\AA~and 2 $\\mu$m lines of He I. We first consider a double\ndetonation model with a luminosity corresponding roughly to normal SNe Ia. This\nmodel has a post-explosion unburned He mass of 0.03 $M_{\\odot}$ and our\ncalculations suggest that the 2 $\\mu$m feature is expected to be very weak but\nthat the 10830 \\AA~feature may have modest opacity in the outer ejecta.\nConsequently, we suggest that a moderate-to-weak He I 10830 \\AA~feature may be\nexpected to form in double-detonation explosions at epochs around maximum\nlight. However, the high velocities of unburned helium predicted by the model\n($\\sim 19,000$~km~s$^{-1}$) mean that the He I 10830 \\AA~feature may be\nconfused or blended with the C I 10690~\\AA~line forming at lower velocities. We\nalso present calculations for the He I 10830 \\AA~and 2 $\\mu$m lines for a lower\nmass (low luminosity) double detonation model, which has a post-explosion He\nmass of 0.077 $M_{\\odot}$. In this case, both the He I features we consider are\nstrong and can provide a clear observational signature of the double-detonation\nmechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 01:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-01"}

Presently, executing the software-based DCNNs\nrequires high-performance server clusters in practice, restricting their\nwidespread deployment on the mobile devices. To overcome this issue,\nconsiderable research efforts have been conducted in the context of developing\nhighly-parallel and specific DCNN hardware, utilizing GPGPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs.\nStochastic Computing (SC), which uses bit-stream to represent a number within\n[-1, 1] by counting the number of ones in the bit-stream, has a high potential\nfor implementing DCNNs with high scalability and ultra-low hardware footprint.\nSince multiplications and additions can be calculated using AND gates and\nmultiplexers in SC, significant reductions in power/energy and hardware\nfootprint can be achieved compared to the conventional binary arithmetic\nimplementations. The tremendous savings in power (energy) and hardware\nresources bring about immense design space for enhancing scalability and\nrobustness for hardware DCNNs. This paper presents the first comprehensive\ndesign and optimization framework of SC-based DCNNs (SC-DCNNs). We first\npresent the optimal designs of function blocks that perform the basic\noperations, i.e., inner product, pooling, and activation function.

Besides, weight storage methods are\ninvestigated to reduce the area and power/energy consumption for storing\nweights. Finally, the whole SC-DCNN implementation is optimized, with feature\nextraction blocks carefully selected, to minimize area and power/energy\nconsumption while maintaining a high network accuracy level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 01:11:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2017 16:19:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

With an initial intensity-difference\nsqueezing of $-8.5\\pm0.4$ dB using parametrically-amplified-non-degenerate\nfour-wave mixing process in a three-level $\\Lambda$-type configuration, the\ndegree of intensity-difference squeezing can be enhanced to $-11.9\\pm0.4$\ndB/$-13.9\\pm0.4$ dB (corrected for losses) when we use one/two laser beam(s) to\nmodulate the involved ground/excited state(s). More importantly, a maximal\nnoise reduction of $-9.7\\pm0.4$ dB (only corrected for electronic noise) is\nobserved below the standard quantum limit, which is the strongest reported to\ndate in phase insensitive amplification in four-wave mixing. Applying the model\nto quantum metrology, the signal-to-noise ratio is improved by 23 dB compared\nto the conventional Mach-Zehnder interferometer under the same phase-sensing\nintensity, which is a 14-fold enhancement in rms phase measurement sensitivity\nbeyond the shot noise limit. Our results show a low-loss, robust and efficient\nway to produce high degree of IDS and facilitate its potential applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 01:38:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 07:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

To overcome this problem, in 2010 the National Center for Biomedical\nOntology (NCBO) released the Ontology Recommender, which is a service that\nreceives a biomedical text corpus or a list of keywords and suggests ontologies\nappropriate for referencing the indicated terms.

LP decoding has several\nadvantages over BP-based methods, including convergence guarantees and better\nerror-rate performance in high-reliability channels. The latter makes LP\ndecoding attractive for optical transport and storage applications. However, LP\ndecoding, when implemented with general solvers, does not scale to large\nblocklengths and is not suitable for a parallelized implementation in hardware.\nIt has been recently shown that the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers\n(ADMM) can be applied to decompose the LP decoding problem.

We consider the\nperiodicity in the layer as the small variable $\\delta$ and the thickness of\nthe layer to be at the same order. Moreover we assume the thin layer to\nterminate at re-entrant corners leading to a singular behaviour in the\nasymptotic expansion of the solution representation. This singular behaviour\nbecomes visible in the asymptotic expansion in powers of $\\delta$ where the\npowers depend on the opening angle. We construct the asymptotic expansion order\nby order. It consists of a macroscopic representation away from the layer, a\nboundary layer corrector in the vicinity of the layer, and a near field\ncorrector in the vicinity of the end-points. The boundary layer correctors and\nthe near field correctors are obtained by the solution of canonical problems\nbased, respectively, on the method of periodic surface homogenization and on\nthe method of matched asymptotic expansions. This will lead to transmission\nconditions for the macroscopic part of the solution on an infinitely thin\ninterface and corner conditions to fix the unbounded singular behaviour at its\nend-points.

This paper studies an uplink multi-user mmWave single-sided lens MIMO\nsystem, where only the base station (BS) is equipped with a full-dimensional\n(FD) lens antenna array with both elevation and azimuth angle resolution\ncapabilities, and each mobile station (MS) employs the conventional uniform\nplanar array (UPA) without the lens. By exploiting the angle-dependent energy\nfocusing property of the lens antenna array at the BS as well as the multi-path\nsparsity of mmWave channels, we propose a low-complexity path division multiple\naccess (PDMA) scheme, which enables virtually interference-free multi-user\ncommunications when the angle of arrivals (AoAs) of all MS multi-path signals\nare sufficiently separable at the BS. To this end, a new technique called path\ndelay compensation is proposed at the BS to effectively transform the\nmulti-user frequency-selective MIMO channels to parallel frequency-flat\nsmall-size MIMO channels for different MSs, for each of which the\nlow-complexity single-carrier(SC) transmission is applied. For general\nscenarios with insufficient AoA separations, analog beamforming at the MSs and\ndigital combining at the BS are jointly designed to maximize the achievable\nsum-rate of the MSs based on their effective MIMO channels resulting from path\ndelay compensation. In addition, we propose a new and efficient channel\nestimation scheme tailored for PDMA, which requires negligible training\noverhead in practical mmWave systems and yet leads to comparable performance as\nthat based on perfect channel state information (CSI).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 08:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-21"}

In spite of these practical successes, optimization of deep networks\nremains an active topic in deep learning research. In this work, we focus on\ninvestigation of the network solution properties that can potentially lead to\ngood performance. Our research is inspired by theoretical and empirical results\nthat use orthogonal matrices to initialize networks, but we are interested in\ninvestigating how orthogonal weight matrices perform when network training\nconverges. To this end, we propose to constrain the solutions of weight\nmatrices in the orthogonal feasible set during the whole process of network\ntraining, and achieve this by a simple yet effective method called Singular\nValue Bounding (SVB). In SVB, all singular values of each weight matrix are\nsimply bounded in a narrow band around the value of 1.

In this approach, information on the passive advection of particles\nis transformed into a Markov chain based on transition probabilities of\nparticles between the volume elements of a given partition of space for a fixed\ntime step. We employ perturbation-theoretic methods to investigate the effects\nof modifications of transport processes in the underlying flow for three\ndifferent problem classes: efficient absorption (corresponding to particle\ntrapping or leaking), constant input of particles (with additional source terms\nmodeling, e.g., localized contamination), and shifts of the steady state under\nprobability mass conservation (as arising if the background flow is perturbed\nitself). Our results demonstrate that in all three cases, changes to the steady\nstate solution can be analytically expressed in terms of the eigensystem of the\nunperturbed flow and the perturbation itself.

Rev.\nLett. {\\bf 113}, 045001 (2014)] for the electron--positron plasma) is\nintroduced. This thermal inertia effect allows for violation of the frozen-in\nmagnetic flux condition in marked contrast to nonrelativistic Hall MHD that\ndoes satisfy the frozen-in condition. We also find violation of the frozen-in\ncondition is accompanied by freezing-in of an alternative flux determined by a\ngeneralized vector potential. Finally, we derive a more general 3+1 Poisson\nbracket for nonrelativistic extended MHD, one that does not assume smallness of\nthe electron ion mass ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 10:42:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2017 20:31:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-08"}

After chemical, the next most important cue is\nmechanical, and protein complexes that produce or enable a chemical signal in\nresponse to a mechanical stimulus are called mechanosensors. There is a sharp\ndistinction between sensing an external force or pressure/tension applied to\nthe cell, and sensing the mechanical stiffness of the environment. We call the\nfirst mechanosensitivity of the 1st kind, and the latter mechanosensitivity of\nthe 2nd kind. There are two variants of protein complexes that act as\nmechanosensors of the 2nd kind: producing either a one-off or a reversible\naction. The latent complex of TGF-$\\beta$ is an example of the one-off action:\non the release of active TGF-$\\beta$ signal, the complex is discarded and needs\nto be replaced. In contrast, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in a complex with\nintegrin is a reversible mechanosensor, which initiates the chemical signal in\nits active phosphorylated conformation, but can spontaneously return to its\nclosed folded conformation. Here we study the physical mechanism of the\nreversible mechanosensor of the 2nd kind, using FAK as a practical example. We\nfind how the rates of conformation changes depend on the substrate stiffness\nand the pulling force applied from the cell cytoskeleton. The results compare\nwell with the phenotype observations of cells on different substrates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 11:55:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2017 12:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

The latter has been\nobserved to evolve on a very short timescale of ~70 Myr which is more than an\norder of magnitude shorter than expected. There is an ongoing debate on the\npossibility that the pulsar spin-down power ablates the companion generating\nlarge amount of mass-loss in the system. It is interesting therefore to study\nwhether IGR J00291+5934 does show a similar behaviour as its twin system SAX\nJ1808.4-3658. In this work we present the first measurement of the orbital\nperiod derivative of IGR J00291+5934. By using XMM-Newton data recorded during\nthe 2015 outburst and adding the previous results of the 2004 and 2008\noutbursts, we are able to measure a 90% confidence level upper limit for the\norbital period derivative of -5x10^-13<Pb_dot<6x10^-13. This implies that the\nbinary is evolving on a timescale longer than ~0.5 Gyr, which is compatible\nwith the expected timescale of mass transfer driven by angular momentum loss\nvia gravitational radiation. We discuss the scenario in which the power loss\nfrom magnetic dipole radiation of the neutron star is hitting the companion\nstar. If this model is applied to SAX J1808.4-3658 then the difference in\norbital behavior can be ascribed to a different efficiency for the conversion\nof the spin-down power into energetic relativistic pulsar wind and\nX-ray/gamma-ray radiation for the two pulsars, with IGR J00291+5934 requiring\nan extraordinarily low efficiency of less than 5% to explain the observations.\nAlternatively, the donor in IGR J00291+5934 is weakly/not magnetized which\nwould suppress the possibility of generating mass-quadrupole variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 12:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

One of the biggest observational challenges is to remove the\nforeground spectrum which is at least four orders of magnitude brighter than\nthe cosmological 21-cm emission. Conventional global 21-cm experiments rely on\nthe spectral smoothness of the foreground synchrotron emission to separate it\nfrom the unique 21-cm spectral structures in a single total-power spectrum.\nHowever, frequency-dependent instrumental and observational effects are known\nto corrupt such smoothness and complicates the foreground subtraction. We\nintroduce a polarimetric approach to measure the projection-induced\npolarization of the anisotropic foreground onto a stationary dual-polarized\nantenna. Due to Earth rotation, when pointing the antenna at a celestial pole,\nthe revolving foreground will modulate this polarization with a unique\nfrequency-dependent sinusoidal signature as a function of time. In our\nsimulations, by harmonic decomposing this dynamic polarization, our technique\nproduces two separate spectra in parallel from the same observation: (i) a\ntotal sky power consisting both the foreground and the 21-cm background, (ii) a\nmodel-independent measurement of the foreground spectrum at a harmonic\nconsistent to twice the sky rotation rate.

To perform this action, we\nneed to pass the end of the rope through an area that is enclosed by another\nsegment of rope. As for all knotting actions, the robot must for this exercise\ncontrol over a semi-compliant and flexible body whose complex 3d shape is\ndifficult to perceive and follow. Additionally, the target loop often deforms\nduring the insertion. We address this problem by defining a virtual magnetic\nfield through the loop's interior and use the Biot Savart law to guide the\nrobotic manipulator that holds the end of the rope. This approach directly\ndefines, for any manipulator position, a motion vector that results in a path\nthat passes through the loop. The motion vector is directly derived from the\nposition of the loop and changes as soon as it moves or deforms. In simulation,\nwe test the insertion action against dynamic loop deformation of different\nintensity. We also combine insertion with grasp and release actions,\ncoordinated by a hybrid control system, to tie knots in simulation and with a\nNAO robot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 13:41:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-21"}

The focus is\non a distinction between mostly unstructured proteins and proteins which\ncontain long unstructured regions accommodated in an overall folded structure.\nIn particular we distinguish: i) Not disordered proteins (NDPs), that either\nhave all their residues ordered or do not have disordered segments longer than\n30 residues nor more than 30% of disordered residues; ii) Proteins with\nintrinsically disordered regions (IDRPs), that have at least one disordered\ndomain longer than 30 residues, but disordered in less than 30% of their\nresidues; iii) Proteins that are intrinsically disordered (IDPs), that have\nboth at least one disordered segment longer than 30 residues and that are\ndisordered on more than 30% of their residues; iv) Proteins with fragmented\ndisorder (FRAG_IDPs), that do not have a disordered fragment longer than 30\nresidues but that, nevertheless, have at least 30% or more of their residues\npredicted as disordered. The potential use of these variants is checked over\nseveral groups of disease-related proteins. Our main conclusions point out that\nIDRPs are more similar to NDPs than to IDPs. IDRPs and NDPs have a similar\nfunctional repertoire and probably share a lock-and-key mechanism of\ninteraction with substrates. IDRPs and IDPs are differently present among human\ndisease-related proteins. IDRPs probably do not play a specific role in the\ndevelopment of complex diseases, since their frequency is similar in\ndisease-related proteins and in the entire human proteome.

One way to support it is by classifying and filtering\nethernet packets within network devices. Packet classification is a fundamental\ntask for network devices such as routers, firewalls, and intrusion detection\nsystems. In this paper we present architecture of fast and reconfigurable\nPacket Classification Engine (PCE). This engine is used in FPGA-based firewall.\nOur PCE inspects multi-dimensional field of packet header sequentially based on\ntree-based algorithm. This algorithm simplifies overall system to a lower scale\nand leads to a more secure system. The PCE works with an adaptation of single\ncycle processor architecture in the system. Ethernet packet is examined with\nPCE based on Source IP Address, Destination IP Address, Source Port,\nDestination Port, and Protocol fields of the packet header. These are basic\nfields to know whether it is a dangerous or normal packet before inspecting the\ncontent. Using implementation of tree-based algorithm in the architecture,\nfirewall rules are rebuilt into 24-bit sub-rules which are read as processor\ninstruction in the inspection process. The inspection process is comparing one\nsub-rule with input field of header every clock cycle. The proposed PCE shows\n91 MHz clock frequency in Cyclone II EP2C70F896C6 with 13 clocks throughput\naverage from input to output generation. The use of tree-based algorithm\nsimplifies the multidimensional packet inspection and gives us reconfigurable\nas well as scalable system. The architecture is fast, reliable, and adaptable\nand also can maximize the advantages of the algorithm very well. Although the\nPCE has high frequency and little amount of clock, filtering speed of a\nfirewall also depends on the other components, such as packet FIFO buffer. Fast\nand reliable FIFO buffer is needed to support the PCE. This PCE also is not\ncompleted with rule update mechanism yet. This proposed PCE is tested as a\ncomponent of FPGA-based firewall to filter Ethernet packet with FPGA DE2 Board\nusing NIOS II platform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 13:59:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-21"}

In this\nproceedings contribution this topic is explored for the linearly polarized\ngluons inside unpolarized hadrons and unpolarized gluons inside transversely\npolarized hadrons. It is argued that $\\chi_{b0/2}$ and $\\eta_b$ production at\nLHC are best to study the effects of linearly polarized gluons in hadronic\ncollisions, by means of angular independent ratios of ratios of cross sections.\nThis can be directly compared to $\\cos 2\\phi$ asymmetries in heavy quark pair\nand dijet production in DIS at a future high-energy Electron-Ion Collider\n(EIC), which probe the same TMDs. In the small-$x$ limit this corresponds to\nthe Weizs\\\"acker-Williams (WW) gluon distributions, which should show a change\nin behavior for transverse momenta around the saturation scale. Together with\ninvestigations of the dipole (DP) gluon distributions, this can provide\nvaluable information about the polarization of the Color Glass Condensate if\nsufficiently small $x$ are reached. Quarkonia can also be useful in the study\nof single transverse spin asymmetries. For transversely polarized hadrons the\ngluon distribution can be asymmetric, which is referred to as the Sivers\neffect. It leads to single spin asymmetries in for instance $J/\\psi$ (pair)\nproduction at AFTER@LHC, which probe the WW or $f$-type gluon Sivers TMD. It\nallows for a test of a sign-change relation w.r.t. the gluon Sivers TMD probed\nat an EIC in open heavy quark pair production. Single spin asymmetries in\nbackward inclusive $C$-odd quarkonium production, such as $J/\\psi$ production,\nmay offer probes of the DP or $d$-type gluon Sivers TMD at small $x$-values in\nthe polarized proton, which in that limit corresponds to a correlator of a\nsingle Wilson loop, describing the spin-dependent odderon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 14:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

Here we show that a\nsignature of the pseudo-magnetic field is a local sublattice symmetry breaking\nobservable as a redistribution of the local density of states. This can be\ninterpreted as a polarization of graphene's pseudospin due to a strain induced\npseudo-magnetic field, in analogy to the alignment of a real spin in a magnetic\nfield. We reveal this sublattice symmetry breaking by tunably straining\ngraphene using the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope. The tip locally\nlifts the graphene membrane from a SiO$_2$ support, as visible by an increased\nslope of the $I(z)$ curves. The amount of lifting is consistent with molecular\ndynamics calculations, which reveal a deformed graphene area under the tip in\nthe shape of a Gaussian. The pseudo-magnetic field induced by the deformation\nbecomes visible as a sublattice symmetry breaking which scales with the lifting\nheight of the strained deformation and therefore with the pseudo-magnetic field\nstrength.

In this paper, we\ndiscuss the possibility to interpret the observed GW events as mergers of PBHs\nwhich are produced by cosmic inflation. The primordial curvature perturbation\nshould be large enough to produce a sizable amount of PBHs and thus we have\nseveral other probes to test this scenario.

Gaussian processes are successfully used for\nclassification/regression problems and dimensionality reduction. In this work\nwe consider the classification problem only. The complexity of standard methods\nfor GP-classification scales cubically with the size of the training dataset.\nThis complexity makes them inapplicable to big data problems. Therefore, a\nvariety of methods were introduced to overcome this limitation. In the paper we\nfocus on methods based on so called inducing inputs. This approach is based on\nvariational inference and proposes a particular lower bound for marginal\nlikelihood (evidence). This bound is then maximized w.r.t. parameters of kernel\nfunction of the Gaussian process, thus fitting the model to data. The\ncomputational complexity of this method is $O(nm^2)$, where $m$ is the number\nof inducing inputs used by the model and is assumed to be substantially smaller\nthan the size of the dataset $n$. Recently, a new evidence lower bound for\nGP-classification problem was introduced. It allows using stochastic\noptimization, which makes it suitable for big data problems. However, the new\nlower bound depends on $O(m^2)$ variational parameter, which makes optimization\nchallenging in case of big m. In this work we develop a new approach for\ntraining inducing input GP models for classification problems. Here we use\nquadratic approximation of several terms in the aforementioned evidence lower\nbound, obtaining analytical expressions for optimal values of most of the\nparameters in the optimization, thus sufficiently reducing the dimension of\noptimization space.

We highlight the successes of neural IR\nthus far, catalog obstacles to its wider adoption, and suggest potentially\npromising directions for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 03:44:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Nov 2016 07:26:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2017 15:46:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-06"}

Two approaches were recently\nproposed to address such issue: crowdsourcing and RSS radiomap prediction,\nbased on either interpolation or propagation channel model fitting from a small\nset of measurements. RSS prediction promises better positioning accuracy when\ncompared to crowdsourcing, but no systematic analysis of the impact of system\nparameters on positioning accuracy is available. This paper fills this gap by\nintroducing ViFi, an indoor positioning system that relies on RSS prediction\nbased on Multi-Wall Multi-Floor (MWMF) propagation model to generate a discrete\nRSS radiomap (virtual fingerprints). Extensive experimental results, obtained\nin multiple independent testbeds, show that ViFi outperforms virtual\nfingerprinting systems adopting simpler propagation models in terms of\naccuracy, and allows a sevenfold reduction in the number of measurements to be\ncollected, while achieving the same accuracy of a traditional fingerprinting\nsystem deployed in the same environment. Finally, a set of guidelines for the\nimplementation of ViFi in a generic environment, that saves the effort of\ncollecting additional measurements for system testing and fine tuning, is\nproposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 09:57:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 2017 17:04:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Apr 2019 07:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-04-03"}

The\nspatial distribution of access points (APs) and users are first modeled as\nmutually independent Poisson point processes (PPPs). Different from most\nprevious literatures which assume all the APs are fully loaded, we consider the\nfact that APs having no data to transmit do not generate interference to users.\nThe APs opportunistically share the channel according to the existence of the\npacket to be transmitted and the proposed interference suppression strategy. In\nthe interference suppression region, only one AP can be active at a time to\ntransmit the packet on the channel and the other adjacent APs keep silent to\nreduce serious interference. The idle probability of any AP, influenced by the\ntraffic load and availability of the channels, is analyzed. The density of\nsimultaneously active APs in the network is obtained and the packet loss rate\nis further elaborated. We reveal the impacts of network features (e.g., AP\ndensity, user density and channel state) and service features (e.g., user\nrequest, packet size) on the network performance. Simulation results validate\nour proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Nov 2016 16:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-13"}
