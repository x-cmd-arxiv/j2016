Examples of such events include disease\ntransmission, opinion transition in elections, and rumor propagation. Unlike\nprevious research focusing on the collective effects of social systems, this\nstudy makes efficient inferences at the individual level. In order to cope with\ndynamic interactions among a large number of individuals, we introduce the\nstochastic kinetic model to capture adaptive transition probabilities and\npropose an efficient variational inference algorithm the complexity of which\ngrows linearly --- rather than exponentially --- with the number of\nindividuals. To validate this method, we have performed epidemic-dynamics\nexperiments on wireless sensor network data collected from more than ten\nthousand people over three years. The proposed algorithm was used to track\ndisease transmission and predict the probability of infection for each\nindividual. Our results demonstrate that this method is more efficient than\nsampling while nonetheless achieving high accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 17:29:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-08"}

We propose that the diffusion of CO$_2$ along\npores inside water ice is the key to quantify segregation. We combined\nTemperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) and Reflection Absorption InfraRed\nSpectroscopy (RAIRS) to study how CO$_2$ molecules interact on a non-porous\namorphous solid water (np-ASW) surface. We found that CO$_2$ diffuses\nsignificantly on a np-ASW surface above 65~K and clusters are formed at well\nbelow one monolayer. A simple rate equation simulation finds that the diffusion\nenergy barrier of CO$_2$ on np-ASW is 2150$\\pm$50 K, assuming a diffusion\npre-exponential factor of 10$^{12}$ s$^{-1}$. This energy should also apply to\nthe diffusion of CO$_2$ on wall of pores. The binding energy of CO$_2$ from\nCO$_2$ clusters and CO$_2$ from H$_2$O ice have been found to be $2415\\pm20$\nand $2250\\pm20$~K, respectively, assuming the same prefactor for desorption.\nCO$_2$-CO$_2$ interaction is stronger than CO$_2$-H$_2$O interaction, in\nagreement with the experimental finding that CO$_2$ does not wet np-ASW\nsurface. For comparison, we carried out similar experiments with CO on np-ASW,\nand found that the CO-CO interaction is always weaker than CO-H$_2$O. As a\nresult, CO wets np-ASW surface. This study should be of help to uncover the\nthermal history of CO$_2$ on the icy mantles of dust grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 17:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

As the\nreservoir of comets is not expected to be replenished, the presence of these\nexozodis in old systems has yet to be adequately explained.\n  It was recently suggested that mean-motion resonances (MMR) with exterior\nplanets on moderately eccentric ($\\mathrm{e_p}\\gtrsim 0.1$) orbits could\nscatter planetesimals on to cometary orbits with delays of the order of several\n100 Myr.

The emergence of the basic model is analytically traced. Namely, by\nusing a sequence of unitary transformations and a subsequent reduction to the\nspin space, the SOC Hamiltonian, with the gravitational potential incorporated,\nis exactly converted into the primary LZ scenario. Moreover, the transitions\ninduced by harmonic acceleration are approximately cast into the framework of\nthe basic LZ model through a complete analytical procedure.

Although\nno evidence was found to indicate a larger the longer sonication times resulted\nin a significant increase in yield of single layer MoS2, the increased\nsonication did result in the formation of several types of carbon allotropes in\naddition to the sheets of MoS2.

This paper\naims to investigate the surface effects, specifically residual surface stress\nand surface elasticity, on the EPI of micro and nano-scale cantilevers as well\nas double clamped beams. Since the cantilever has one end free, it has no\nresidual stress, thus the strain-independent component of the surface stress or\nintrinsic surface stress has no influence on the EPI, as long as it has small\ndeformation. The strain-dependent component of the surface stress or surface\nelasticity changes the bending stiffness of the cantilever and, consequently,\ninduces shifts in the EPI. For double clamped beams, the effective residual\nsurface stress comes into play and modifies the effective residual stress of\nthe beam. The nonlinear electromechanical coupled equations, which take into\naccount the surface effects are solved numerically. The theoretical results\npresented in this paper indicate that the EPI is very sensitive to the surface\neffects, especially when a double clamped beam is employed. The results show\nthat the influence of surface effects on the EPI of cantilevers become more\nprofound when the thickness is below 50 nm, while the influence on double\nclamped beams is significant even at sub-micron scale.

A higher signal to noise ratio is achieved by a\ncooperative action of Ca release channels such as IP3 receptors or ryanodine\nreceptors arranged in clusters or release units containing a few to several\nhundred release channels. The release channels synchronize their openings via\nCa-induced-Ca-release, generating high-amplitude local Ca signals known as\npuffs in neurons or sparks in muscle cells. Despite the high release amplitude\nand positive feedback nature of the activation, Ca signals are strictly\nconfined in time and space by an unexplained termination mechanism.

In\nour simulations, planetesimals with sizes between 80 km and several hundred\nkilometers form.

In addition, an\noptimal radio resource management scheme is proposed to maximize the overall\nradio resource utilization and at the same time guarantee service availability\nand continuity quality of service (QoS) for disaster responders. The\neffectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated by numerical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 22:00:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 15:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-11"}

On the other hand adversarial noise\nhas improved the results of clas- sical supervised learning. Recently, a new\nneural network topology called Ladder Network, where the key idea is based in\nsome properties of hierar- chichal latent variable models, has been proposed as\na technique to train a neural network using supervised and unsupervised data at\nthe same time with what is called semi-supervised learning.

The robot is\ncapable of obtaining noisy measurements of the target's position. The key idea\nin active target tracking is to choose control laws that drive the robot to\nmeasurement locations that will reduce the uncertainty in the target's\nposition. The challenge is that measurement uncertainty often is a function of\nthe (unknown) relative positions of the target and the robot. Consequently, a\nclosed-loop control policy is desired which can map the current estimate of the\ntarget's position to an optimal control law for the robot.\n  Our main contribution is to devise a closed-loop control policy for target\ntracking that plans for a sequence of control actions, instead of acting\ngreedily. We consider scenarios where the noise in measurement is a function of\nthe state of the target. We seek to minimize the maximum uncertainty (trace of\nthe posterior covariance matrix) over all possible measurements. We exploit the\nstructural properties of a Kalman Filter to build a policy tree that is orders\nof magnitude smaller than naive enumeration while still preserving optimality\nguarantees. We show how to obtain even more computational savings by relaxing\nthe optimality guarantees.

One important tool for efficient\ncomputation in the rooted case is called chain reduction, which replaces an\narbitrary chain of subtrees identical in both trees with a chain of three\nleaves.

It was demonstrated that addition of 5 wt. %\nof equal mixture of graphene and graphite flakes to the composite results in a\nfactor of x2.6 enhancement of the thermal conductivity without significant\ndegradation of the saturation magnetization. The microscopy and spectroscopic\ncharacterization reveal that sp2 carbon fillers preserve their crystal\nstructure and morphology during the composite processing.

We aim to minimize the ratio of user requests blocked by the SBS. With\nfinite battery capacity, Markov decision process based problem is formulated,\nand the optimal policy is found by dynamic programming (DP). Two\nthreshold-based policies are proposed: the push-only threshold-based (POTB)\npolicy and the energy-efficient threshold-based (EETB) policy, and the\nclosed-form blocking probabilities with infinite battery capacity are derived.\nNumerical results show that the proposed policies outperform the conventional\nnon-push policy if the content popularity changes slowly or the content request\ngenerating rate is high, and can achieve the performance of the greedy optimal\nthreshold-based (GOTB) policy.

The most general solution for the distribution function is given in\nterms of appropriate symplectic coordinates on the cotangent bundle, and the\nassociated observables, including the particle current density and stress\nenergy-momentum tensor, are determined. Next, we explore the case where the\nflow is steady-state and spherically symmetric.

We show that this\nleads to the appearance of complex tunnelling amplitudes and allows for the\nimplementation of spatial non-adiabatic passage. We demonstrate the ability of\nsuch a system to transport a particle between two different wells and to\ngenerate a delocalised superposition between the three traps with high fidelity\nin short times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 06:03:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2017 05:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-31"}

We insert the sample in the Hong-Ou-Mandel\ninterferometer4 and infer the phase relaxation time from the modification of\nthe two-photon interference pattern. In addition to its simplicity and ease of\nuse, the technique does not require compensation of group velocity\ndispersion5-8 and does not induce photo-damage of the samples. This technique\nwill be useful for characterization of ultrafast phase relaxation processes in\nmaterial science, chemistry, and biology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 07:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-02"}

Recently, spiking\nneural networks (SNNs) have been attracting a great deal of attention, notably\nowning to their power efficiency, which can potentially allow us to implement a\nlow-power deep learning engine suitable for real-time/mobile applications.\nHowever, implementing SNN-based deep learning remains challenging, especially\ngradient-based training of SNNs by error backpropagation. We cannot simply\npropagate errors through SNNs in conventional way because of the property of\nSNNs that process discrete data in the form of a series. Consequently, most of\nthe previous studies employ a workaround technique, which first trains a\nconventional weighted-sum deep neural network and then maps the learning\nweights to the SNN under training, instead of training SNN parameters directly.\nIn order to eliminate this workaround, recently proposed is a new class of SNN\nnamed deep spiking networks (DSNs), which can be trained directly (without a\nmapping from conventional deep networks) by error backpropagation with\nstochastic gradient descent. In this paper, we show that the initialization of\nthe membrane potential on the backward path is an important step in DSN\ntraining, through diverse experiments performed under various conditions.\nFurthermore, we propose a simple and efficient method that can improve DSN\ntraining by controlling the initial membrane potential on the backward path. In\nour experiments, adopting the proposed approach allowed us to boost the\nperformance of DSN training in terms of converging time and accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 07:41:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2019 09:24:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-02-28"}

We introduce new formal mathematical\nobject called regular continuum system of point particles (with continuum\nnumber of particles). Initially, each particle is characterized by the pair:\n(initial coordinate, initial velocity) in $R^{2d}$. Moreover, all initial\ncoordinates are different and fill up some domain in $R^{d}$. Each particle\nmoves via normal Newtonian dynamics under influence of some external force, but\nthere is no interaction between particles. If the external force is bounded\nthen trajectories of any two particles in the phase space do not intersect.\nMore exactly, at any time moment any two particles have either different\ncoordinates or different velocities. The system is called regular if there are\nno particle collisions in the coordinate space.\n  The regularity condition is necessary for the velocity of the particle,\nsituated at a given time at a given space point, were uniquely defined. Then\nthe classical Euler equation for the field of velocities has rigorous meaning.\nThough the continuum of particles is in fact a continuum medium, the crucial\nnotion of regularity was not studied in mathematical literature.\n  It appeared that the seeming simplicity of the object (absence of\ninteraction) is delusive. Even for simple external forces we could not find\nsimple necessary and sufficient regularity conditions.

For thin Cu layers (up to 1.5 nm), anisotropic magnetoresistance\n(AMR) was observed whereas multilayers with thicker Cu layers exhibited clear\ngiant magnetoresistance (GMR) behaviour. The GMR magnitude increased up to\nabout 3.5 to 4 nm Cu layer thickness and slightly decreased afterwards.\nAccording to magnetic measurements, all samples exhibited ferromagnetic (FM)\nbehaviour. The relative remanence turned out to be about 0.75 for both AMR and\nGMR type multilayers. This clearly indicates the absence of an\nantiferromagnetic (AF) coupling between adjacent magnetic layers for Cu layers\neven above 1.5 nm where the GMR effect occurs. The AMR behaviour at low spacer\nthicknesses indicates the presence of strong FM coupling (due to, e.g.,\npin-holes in the spacer and/or areas of the Cu layer where the layer thickness\nis very small). With increasing spacer thickness, the pin-hole density reduces\nand/or the layer thickness uniformity improves which both lead to a weakening\nof the FM coupling. This improvement in multilayer structure quality results in\na better separation of magnetic layers and the weaker coupling (or complete\nabsence of interlayer coupling) enables a more random magnetization orientation\nof adjacent layers, all this leading to an increase of the GMR. Coercive field\nand zero-field resistivity measurements as well as the results of a structural\nstudy reported earlier on the same multilayers provide independent evidence for\nthe microstructural features established here.

In that\npaper we introduced a companion QR algorithm that finds the roots of a\npolynomial by computing the eigenvalues of the companion matrix in $O(n^{2})$\ntime using $O(n)$ memory. We proved that the method is backward stable. Here we\nintroduce, as an alternative, a companion QZ algorithm that solves a\ngeneralized eigenvalue problem for a companion pencil. More importantly, we\nprovide an improved backward error analysis that takes advantage of the special\nstructure of the problem. The improvement is also due, in part, to an\nimprovement in the accuracy (in both theory and practice) of the turnover\noperation, which is the key component of our algorithms.\n  We prove that for the companion QR algorithm, the backward error on the\npolynomial coefficients varies linearly with the norm of the polynomial's\nvector of coefficients. Thus the companion QR algorithm has a smaller backward\nerror than the unstructured QR algorithm (used by MATLAB's \\texttt{roots}\ncommand, for example), for which the backward error on the polynomial\ncoefficients grows quadratically with the norm of the coefficient vector. The\ncompanion QZ algorithm has the same favorable backward error as companion QR,\nprovided that the polynomial coefficients are properly scaled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 09:11:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Dec 2016 09:42:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Jul 2018 08:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-07-20"}

Whenever two or more particles meet at a given node, they merge and\ncontinue as a single random walk. The coalescence time is defined as the\nexpected time until only one particle remains, starting from one particle at\nevery node. Despite recent progress the coalescence time for graphs such as\nbinary trees, d-dimensional tori, hypercubes and more generally,\nvertex-transitive graphs, remains unresolved. We provide a powerful toolkit\nthat results in tight bounds for various topologies including the\naforementioned ones. The meeting time is defined as the worst-case expected\ntime required for two random walks to arrive at the same node at the same time.\nAs a general result, we establish that for graphs whose meeting time is only\nmarginally larger than the mixing time (a factor of log^2 n), the coalescence\ntime of n random walks equals the meeting time up to constant factors. This\nupper bound is complemented by the construction of a graph family demonstrating\nthat this result is the best possible up to constant factors. For\nalmost-regular graphs, we bound the coalescence time by the hitting time,\nresolving the discrete-time variant of a conjecture by Aldous for this class of\ngraphs. Finally, we prove that for any graph the coalescence time is bounded by\nO(n^3) (which is tight for the Barbell graph); surprisingly even such a basic\nquestion about the coalescing time was not answered before this work. By\nduality, our results give bounds on the voter model and therefore give bounds\non the consensus time in arbitrary undirected graphs.

We cover three\naspects of the self-assembly. The first one focuses on non-covalent\nself-assembly dealing with site-selectivity due to inherent moire pattern\npresent on 2D materials deposited on substrates. Modification of intermolecular\ninteractions and molecule-substrate interactions influences the assembly\ndrastically and 2D materials can also be used as a platform to carry out\ncovalent and metal-coordinated assembly. The second part deals with the\nelectronic properties of molecules adsorbed on 2D materials. By virtue of being\ninert and possessing low density of states near the Fermi level, 2D materials\ndecouple molecules electronically from the underlying metal substrate and allow\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy and imaging of molecular orbitals.

We show that both existing and novel TE modules can\nefficiently expose the attack, and study the benefits of each approach. We\nimplement defense prototypes using simulation mechanisms and evaluate them\nextensively on multiple real topologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 11:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

However, because of its height,\nabout 1450 km compared with about 5800-5900 km for the two LAGEOS satellites,\nLARES is exposed to a much stronger drag due to neutral atmosphere. From a\nprecise orbit determination, analyzing the laser ranging normal points of LARES\nover a time span of about 3.7 years, it was found an average semi-major axis\ndecay rate of -0.999 m per year, corresponding to a non-conservative net force\nwith a mean along-track acceleration of -1.444 x 10^-11 m/s^2.

Mutation analysis effectiveness rests on the assumption\nthat mutants are coupled with real faults i.e. mutant detection is strongly\ncorrelated with real fault detection. The work that validated this also showed\nthat a large portion of defects remain out of reach.\n  We introduce tailored mutation operators to reach and capture these defects.\nTailored mutation operators are built from and apply to an existing codebase\nand its history. They can, for instance, identify and replay errors specific to\nthe project for which they are tailored. As our point of departure, we define\ntailored mutation operators for identifiers, which mutation analysis has\nlargely ignored, because there are too many ways to mutate them. Evaluated on\nthe Defects4J dataset, our new mutation operators creates mutants coupled to\n14% more faults, compared to traditional mutation operators.\n  These new mutation operators, however, quadruple the number of mutants. To\ncombat this problem, we propose a new approach to mutant selection focusing on\nthe location at which to apply mutation operators and the unnaturalness of the\nmutated code. The results demonstrate that the location selection heuristics\nproduce mutants more closely coupled to real faults for a given budget of\nmutation operator applications.\n  In summary, this paper defines and explores tailored mutation operators,\nadvancing the state of the art in mutation testing in two ways: 1) it suggests\nmutation operators that mutate identifiers and literals, extending mutation\nanalysis to a new class of faults and 2) it demonstrates that selecting the\nlocation where a mutation operator is applied decreases the number of generated\nmutants without affecting the coupling of mutants and real faults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 13:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-09"}

The FD cellular network is assumed\nto be based on orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and\nconsists of a base station communicating with multiple users. Some of the users\nin the network act as relay for other users and help them to transmit their\ndata to the base station. These relays are FD and work based on amplify and\nforward (AF) protocol. By appropriate selection of the relays and optimized\nallocation of subcarriers and powers to all users, we try to maximize the total\nsum rate of the network. During this optimization, we also impose some\nconstraints on the users' quality of service (QoS) and power. We propose a new\nalgorithm to select the best relays based on the users' maximum data rate and\nalso use Linear Assignment Problem Jonker-Volgenant (LAPJV) algorithm for\nsubcarrier assignment.

In order to respect causality the rigidly\nrotating system must be bound by a cylindrical boundary with appropriate\nboundary conditions that confine the fermions inside the cylinder. We show the\nfinite geometry with the MIT boundary conditions affects strongly the phase\nstructure of the model leading to three distinct regions characterized by\nexplicitly broken (gapped), partially restored (nearly gapless) and\nspontaneously broken (gapped) phases at, respectively, small, moderate and\nlarge radius of the cylinder. The presence of the boundary leads to specific\nsteplike irregularities of the chiral condensate as functions of coupling\nconstant, temperature and angular frequency. These steplike features have the\nsame nature as the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations with the crucial difference\nthat they occur in the absence of both external magnetic field and Fermi\nsurface. At finite temperature the rotation leads to restoration of\nspontaneously broken chiral symmetry while the vacuum at zero temperature is\ninsensitive to rotation (\"cold vacuum cannot rotate\"). As the temperature\nincreases the critical angular frequency decreases and the transition becomes\nsofter. A phase diagram in angular frequency-temperature plane is presented. We\nalso show that at fixed temperature the fermion matter in the chirally restored\n(gapless) phase has a higher moment of inertia compared to the one in the\nchirally broken (gapped) phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2016 17:46:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Nov 2016 08:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-08"}

The accuracy of the abundances\nis currently limited by systematic uncertainties introduced by the available\ninstruments and uncertainties in the modeling of the spectra, which are of the\norder of 20-30%. We discuss the possible gain of extending the current samples\nat low and high redshift. We conclude that expanding the samples would be\nexpensive in terms of exposure time, but will not yield significantly improved\nresults, because the current samples already reach the systematic limits. New\ninstrumentation, like Astro-H2 and ATHENA, and improvements to the atomic\ndatabases are needed to make significant advances in this field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 15:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-10"}

In the marketing context, a message is viral when it is broadly sent\nand received by the target market through person-to-person transmission. This\nspecific marketing communication strategy is commonly referred as viral\nmarketing. Due to this similarity between an epidemic and the viral marketing\nprocess and because the understanding of the critical factors to this\ncommunications strategy effectiveness remain largely unknown, the mathematical\nmodels in epidemiology are presented in this marketing specific field. In this\npaper, an epidemiological model SIR (Susceptible- Infected-Recovered) to study\nthe effects of a viral marketing strategy is presented. It is made a comparison\nbetween the disease parameters and the marketing application, and Matlab\nsimulations are performed. Finally, some conclusions are carried out and their\nmarketing implications are exposed: interactions across the parameters suggest\nsome recommendations to marketers, as the profitability of the investment or\nthe need to improve the targeting criteria of the communications campaigns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 15:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

The proposed approach is a control method that, rather than an entire\nsystem model, requires a model of the subsystem of interest for controller\ndesign. To design the retrofit controller, we use a novel approach based on\nhierarchical state-space expansion that generates a higher-dimensional cascade\nrealization of a given network system. The upstream dynamics of the cascade\nrealization corresponds to an isolated model of the subsystem of interest,\nwhich is stabilized by a local controller. The downstream dynamics can be seen\nas a dynamical model representing the propagation of interference signals among\nsubsystems, the stability of which is equivalent to that of the original\nsystem. This cascade structure enables a systematic analysis of both the\nstability and control performance of the resultant closed-loop system. The\nresultant retrofit controller is formed as a cascade interconnection of the\nlocal controller and an output rectifier that rectifies an output signal of the\nsubsystem of interest so as to conform to an output signal of the isolated\nsubsystem model while acquiring complementary signals neglected in the local\ncontroller design, such as interconnection signals from neighboring subsystems.\nFinally, the efficiency of the retrofit control method is demonstrated through\nnumerical examples of power systems control and vehicle platoon control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 07:03:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 07:10:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2018 05:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-13"}

This extended Standard Model\nreproduces the experimental gravitational differential cross sections without\nresorting to the graviton field and instead by exchanging SO(4) gauge fields.\nBy construction, each SO(4) generator in quantum gravitodynamics does not\ncommute with the Dirac gamma matrices. This produces additional interactions\nabsent to non-Abelian gauge fields in the Standard Model. The contributions\nfrom these new terms yield differential cross sections consistent with the\nNewtonian and post Newtonian interactions derived from General Relativity.\nDimensional analysis of the Lagrangian shows that all its terms have total\ndimensionality four or less and therefore that all physical quantities in the\ntheory renormalize by finite amounts. These properties make QGD the only\nrenormalizable 4-dimensional theory describing gravitational interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Nov 2016 01:18:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}
