FR observations of a\nsource near the Sun can provide information on the plasma structure of a CME\nshortly after launch.\n  We report on simultaneous white-light and radio observations made of three\nCMEs in August 2012. We made sensitive Very Large Array (VLA) full-polarization\nobservations using 1 - 2 GHz frequencies of a \"constellation\" of radio sources\nthrough the solar corona at heliocentric distances that ranged from 6 - 15\nsolar radii. Of the nine sources observed, three were occulted by CMEs: two\nsources (0842+1835 and 0900+1832) were occulted by a single CME and one source\n(0843+1547) was occulted by two CMEs. In addition to our radioastronomical\nobservations, which represent one of the first active hunts for CME Faraday\nrotation since Bird et al.

In general though, the data structure is not readily\navailable and becomes pretty difficult to define. In particular, the global\nsmoothness assumptions, that most of the existing works adopt, are often too\ngeneral and unable to properly capture localized properties of data. In this\npaper, we go beyond this classical data model and rather propose to represent\ninformation as a sparse combination of localized functions that live on a data\nstructure represented by a graph. Based on this model, we focus on the problem\nof inferring the connectivity that best explains the data samples at different\nvertices of a graph that is a priori unknown.

Multi-currency portfolio is an alternative to\nachieve higher returns and more diversified portfolios but it requires a\ncareful management of the entailed risks from changes in exchange rates.\n  The deviation between asset and currency exposures in a portfolio is defined\nas the \"currency overlay\".

This article outlines comprehensive principles of electron-transport\nspectroscopy relevant to both these approaches and presents a new,\nhigh-resolution experiment on a high-spin single-molecule junction exemplifying\nthese principles. Such spectroscopy plays a key role in further advancing our\nunderstanding of molecular and atomic systems, in particular the relaxation of\ntheir spin. In this joint experimental and theoretical analysis, particular\nfocus is put on the crossover between resonant regime [single-electron\ntunneling (SET)] and the off-resonant regime [inelastic electron (co)tunneling\n(IETS)]. We show that the interplay of these two processes leads to unexpected\nmirages of resonances not captured by either of the two pictures alone.\nAlthough this turns out to be important in a large fraction of the possible\nregimes of level positions and bias voltages, it has been given little\nattention in molecular transport studies. Combined with nonequilibrium IETS --\nfour-electron pump-probe excitations -- these mirages provide crucial\ninformation on the relaxation of spin excitations.

The channels associated with\ndifferent transmitreceive pairs can be highly correlated due to the i) high\nprobability of line-of-sight (LOS) communication between user equipment (UE)\nand base station (BS), and ii) insufficient spacing between antenna elements at\nboth UE and BS. In this paper, we propose a novel transmission technique titled\nDiversity Pulse Shaped Transmission (DPST) to enhance the throughput over the\ncorrelated MIMO channels in an ultra-dense small cell network. The fundamental\nof DPST is to shape transmit signals at adjacent antennas with distinct\ninterpolating filters, introducing pulse shaping diversity. In DPST, each\nantenna transmits its own data stream with a relative deterministic time\noffset-which must be a fraction of the symbol period-with respect to the\nadjacent antenna. The delay is interpolated with the pulse shaped signal\ngenerating a virtual MIMO channel that benefits from increased diversity from\nthe receiver perspective. To extract the diversity, the receiver must operate\nin an over-sampled domain and hence a fractionally spaced equaliser (FSE) is\nproposed. The joint impact of DPST and FSE helps the receiver to sense a less\ncorrelated channel, eventually enhancing the UE's throughput. Moreover, in\norder to minimise the spatial correlation, we aim to optimise the deterministic\nfractional delay. Simulation results show that applying DPST to a correlated\nchannel can approximately enhance the UE throughput by 1.93x and 3.76x in 2x2\nand 4x4 MIMO systems, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2016 20:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-08"}

Specifically, this work demonstrates that the principle of\nparsimony, which has been questioned by several authors recently, is helpful in\nselecting the best model for forecasting seasonal river flow. Our work also\ndemonstrates the importance of model adequacy. An adequate model for seasonal\nriver flow must incorporate seasonal periodic correlation. The usual\nautoregressive-moving average (ARMA) and seasonal ARMA models are not adequate\nin this respect for seasonal river flow time series. A new diagnostic check,\nfor detecting periodic correlation in fitted ARMA models is developed in this\npaper. This diagnostic check is recommended for routine use when fitting\nseasonal ARMA models. It is shown that this diagnostic check indicates that\nmany seasonal economic time series also exhibit periodic correlation.

Therefore, if a region in a disc is warmed and then\nrecooled, water vapor should not be expected to refreeze evenly onto all\navailable grains. Instead it will preferentially recondense onto the most\nfavorable grains. When the recooling is slow enough, only the most favorable\ngrains will nucleate ice, allowing them to recondense thick ice mantles.

The word\nfusion has also been used in the literature for such problems involving\ndisparate data types. Holistically understanding traffic patterns, causes of\naccidents, bombings, terrorist planning and many natural phenomenon such as\nstorms, earthquakes fall into this category. Some may have real-time\nrequirements and some may need to be analyzed after the fact (post-mortem or\nforensic analysis.) What is common for all these problems is that the amount\nand types of data associated with the event. Data may also be incomplete and\ntrustworthiness of sources may also vary. Currently, manual and ad-hoc\napproaches are used in aggregating data in different ways for analyzing and\nunderstanding these problems.\n  In this paper, we approach this problem in a novel way using multilayered\nnetworks. We identify features of a central event and propose a network layer\nfor each feature. This approach allows us to study the effect of each feature\nindependently and its impact on the event. We also establish that the proposed\napproach allows us to compose these features in arbitrary ways (without loss of\ninformation) to analyze their combined effect.

We argue here that\ncrowds can become \"smarter,\" i.e., more efficient and robust, by partially\nfollowing the average opinion. This observation runs counter to the widely\naccepted claim that the wisdom of crowds deteriorates with social influence.\nThe key difference is that individuals are self-interested and hence will\nreject feedbacks that do not improve their performance. We propose a\ncontrol-theoretic methodology to compute the degree of social influence, i.e.,\nthe level to which one accepts the population feedback, that optimizes\nperformance. We conducted an experiment with human subjects ($N = 194$), where\nthe participants were first asked to solve an optimization problem\nindependently, i.e., under no social influence. Our theoretical methodology\nestimates a $30\\%$ degree of social influence to be optimal, resulting in a\n$29\\%$ improvement in the crowd's performance. We then let the same cohort\nsolve a new problem and have access to the average opinion. Surprisingly, we\nfind the average degree of social influence in the cohort to be $32\\%$ with a\n$29\\%$ improvement in performance: In other words, the crowd self-organized\ninto a near-optimal setting. We believe this new paradigm for making crowds\n\"smarter\" has the potential for making a significant impact on a diverse set of\nfields including population health to government planning.

Given a matrix $A\\in\\mathbb{F}^{N\\times N}$ and a vector $b$, it is\nknown that in the worst case $\\Theta(N^2)$ operations over $\\mathbb{F}$ are\nneeded to compute $Ab$. A broad question is to identify classes of structured\ndense matrices that can be represented with $O(N)$ parameters, and for which\nmatrix-vector multiplication can be performed sub-quadratically. One such class\nof structured matrices is the orthogonal polynomial transforms, whose rows\ncorrespond to a family of orthogonal polynomials. Other well known classes\ninclude the Toeplitz, Hankel, Vandermonde, Cauchy matrices and their extensions\nthat are all special cases of a ldisplacement rank property. In this paper, we\nmake progress on two fronts:\n  1. We introduce the notion of recurrence width of matrices. For matrices with\nconstant recurrence width, we design algorithms to compute $Ab$ and $A^Tb$ with\na near-linear number of operations. This notion of width is finer than all the\nabove classes of structured matrices and thus we can compute multiplication for\nall of them using the same core algorithm.\n  2. We additionally adapt this algorithm to an algorithm for a much more\ngeneral class of matrices with displacement structure: those with low\ndisplacement rank with respect to quasiseparable matrices.

So far in the current\nliterature, only `fully functional' ORAMs are widely studied which can protect,\nat a cost of considerable performance penalty, against the strong adversaries\nwho can monitor all read and write operations. However, recent research has\nshown that information can still be leaked even if only the write access\npattern (not reads) is visible to the adversary. For such weaker adversaries, a\nfully functional ORAM turns out to be an overkill causing unnecessary\noverheads. Instead, a simple `write-only' ORAM is sufficient, and, more\ninterestingly, is preferred as it can offer far more performance and energy\nefficiency than a fully functional ORAM.\n  In this work, we present Flat ORAM: an efficient write-only ORAM scheme which\noutperforms the closest existing write-only ORAM called HIVE. HIVE suffers from\nperformance bottlenecks while managing the memory occupancy information vital\nfor correctness of the protocol. Flat ORAM resolves these bottlenecks by\nintroducing a simple idea of Occupancy Map (OccMap) which efficiently manages\nthe memory occupancy information resulting in far better performance.

To this end, in this paper, a novel framework is\nproposed to enable devices to form multi-hop D2D connections in an effort to\nmaintain sustainable communication in the presence of device mobility. To solve\nthe problem posed by device mobility, in contrast to existing works, which\nmostly focus on physical domain information, a durable community based approach\nis introduced taking social encounters into context. It is shown that the\nproposed scheme can derive an optimal solution for time sensitive content\ntransmission while also minimizing the cost that the base station pays in order\nto incentivize users to participate in D2D. Simulation results show that the\nproposed social community aware approach yields significant performance gain,\nin terms of the amount of traffic offloaded from the cellular network to the\nD2D tier, compared to the classical social-unaware methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2016 01:14:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-08"}

Algorithms typically break down on\nprofile faces, or are too slow for real-time applications. In this work we\npropose an efficient approach to face alignment that can handle 180 degrees of\nhead rotation in a unified way (e.g., without resorting to view-based models)\nusing 2D training data. The foundation of our approach is cascaded shape\nregression (CSR), which has emerged recently as the leading strategy. We\npropose a generalization of conventional CSRs that we call branching cascaded\nregression (BCR). Conventional CSRs are single-track; that is, they progress\nfrom one cascade level to the next in a straight line, with each regressor\nattempting to fit the entire dataset. We instead split the regression problem\ninto two or more simpler ones after each cascade level. Intuitively, each\nregressor can then operate on a simpler objective function (i.e., with fewer\nconflicting gradient directions). Within the BCR framework, we model and infer\npose-related landmark visibility and face shape simultaneously using Structured\nPoint Distribution Models (SPDMs). We propose to learn task-specific feature\nmapping functions that are adaptive to landmark visibility, and that use SPDM\nparameters as regression targets instead of 2D landmark coordinates.\nAdditionally, we introduce a new in-the-wild dataset of profile faces to\nvalidate our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Nov 2016 01:42:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Nov 2016 04:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-11"}

In this process, individuals are the vertices of a connected graph $G$.\nInitially, there is a single mutant vertex, chosen uniformly at random. In each\nstep, a random vertex is selected for reproduction with a probability\nproportional to its fitness: mutants have fitness $r>1$, while non-mutants have\nfitness 1. The vertex chosen to reproduce places a copy of itself to a\nuniformly random neighbor in $G$, replacing the individual that was there. The\nprocess ends when the mutation either reaches fixation (i.e., all vertices are\nmutants), or gets extinct. The principal quantity of interest is the\nprobability with which each of the two outcomes occurs.\n  A problem that has received significant attention recently concerns the\nexistence of families of graphs, called strong amplifiers of selection, for\nwhich the fixation probability tends to 1 as the order $n$ of the graph\nincreases, and the existence of strong suppressors of selection, for which this\nprobability tends to 0. For the case of directed graphs, it is known that both\nstrong amplifiers and suppressors exist. For the case of undirected graphs,\nhowever, the problem has remained open, and the general belief has been that\nneither strong amplifiers nor suppressors exist. In this paper we disprove this\nbelief, by providing the first examples of such graphs. The strong amplifier we\npresent has fixation probability $1-\\tilde O(n^{-1/3})$, and the strong\nsuppressor has fixation probability $\\tilde O(n^{-1/4})$. Both graph\nconstructions are surprisingly simple. We also prove a general upper bound of\n$1-\\tilde \\Omega(n^{-1/3})$ on the fixation probability of any undirected\ngraph.

Traditional approaches separated the problem into two stages: designing\nor learning visual features, and prediction. More recent deep lipreading\napproaches are end-to-end trainable (Wand et al., 2016; Chung & Zisserman,\n2016a). However, existing work on models trained end-to-end perform only word\nclassification, rather than sentence-level sequence prediction. Studies have\nshown that human lipreading performance increases for longer words (Easton &\nBasala, 1982), indicating the importance of features capturing temporal context\nin an ambiguous communication channel. Motivated by this observation, we\npresent LipNet, a model that maps a variable-length sequence of video frames to\ntext, making use of spatiotemporal convolutions, a recurrent network, and the\nconnectionist temporal classification loss, trained entirely end-to-end. To the\nbest of our knowledge, LipNet is the first end-to-end sentence-level lipreading\nmodel that simultaneously learns spatiotemporal visual features and a sequence\nmodel.

However, existing binarization\nschemes are based on simple matrix approximation and ignore the effect of\nbinarization on the loss. In this paper, we propose a proximal Newton algorithm\nwith diagonal Hessian approximation that directly minimizes the loss w.r.t. the\nbinarized weights. The underlying proximal step has an efficient closed-form\nsolution, and the second-order information can be efficiently obtained from the\nsecond moments already computed by the Adam optimizer.

We\ncalculate the nucleation temperature, order parameter, characteristic\ntimescale, and peak amplitude and frequency of GW from bubble collisions during\nthe PT for the benchmarks and find that, in an optimistic scenario, GW from\nsuch a PT may be in reach of aLIGO (O5). We confirm that the singlet stabilizes\nthe electroweak vacuum whilst remaining consistent with zero-temperature\nphenomenology as well.

Here, we present dissipative topological defects in a 1-D ring\nnetwork of phase-locked lasers, and show how their formation is related to the\nKibble-Zurek mechanism and is governed in a universal manner by two competing\ntime scales of the lasers, namely the phase locking time and synchronization\ntime of their amplitude fluctuations. The ratio between these two time scales\ndepends on the system parameters such as gain and coupling strength, and thus\noffers the possibility to control the probability of topological defects in the\nsystem. Enabling the system to dissipate to the fully ordered, defect-free\nstate can be exploited for solving hard combinatorial optimization problems in\nvarious fields.

The optimal prediction\nframework of Chorin et al., which is a reformulation of the Mori-Zwanzig (M-Z)\nformalism of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, provides a methodology for\nthe development of mathematically-derived reduced models of dynamical systems.\nSeveral promising models have emerged from the optimal prediction community and\nhave found application in molecular dynamics and turbulent flows. In this work,\na new M-Z-based closure model that addresses some of the deficiencies of\nexisting methods is developed. The model is constructed by exploiting\nsimilarities between two levels of coarse-graining via the Germano identity of\nfluid mechanics and by assuming that memory effects have a finite temporal\nsupport. The appeal of the proposed model, which will be referred to as the\n`dynamic-MZ-$\\tau$' model, is that it is parameter-free and has a structural\nform imposed by the mathematics of the coarse-graining process (rather than the\nphenomenological assumptions made by the modeler, such as in classical subgrid\nscale models). To promote the applicability of M-Z models in general, two\nprocedures are presented to compute the resulting model form, helping to bypass\nthe tedious error-prone algebra that has proven to be a hindrance to the\nconstruction of M-Z-based models for complex dynamical systems. While the new\nformulation is applicable to the solution of general partial differential\nequations, demonstrations are presented in the context of Large Eddy Simulation\nclosures for Burgers equation, decaying homogeneous turbulence, and turbulent\nchannel flow.
