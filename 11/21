An analysis of the\nfluctuational region showed that the pairing of electrons in SL takes place at\nthe sites of dislocation networks.

The\ncritical current density in a superlattice is determined, and a mechanism is\nproposed for formation of excess current on the IVC of PC based on SL and HTS.\nThe values of the energy gap $\\Delta_0$ at low temperatures in units of $kT_c$\nare found to be anomalously large for SL and HTS. For anisotropic\nthree-dimensional SL with a strong bond between two-dimensional SC planes, two\ngaps emerge from the MD. For quasi-two-dimensional SL with a weak bond between\ntwo-dimensional SC planes, the $\\Delta(T)$ dependence is nonmonotonic, and the\nfluctuation region for these SL and for HTS reveals a gap that is practically\nindependent of temperature.

The quasiparticle tunneling spectra has been measured at different\ntemperatures to understand the tunneling mechanism in these double spin-filter\njunctions. The conductance spectra were found to be comparable to an asymmetric\nSINI'S-type tunnel junction.

During such\nminor mergers the secondary hole stalls on an eccentric orbit at a distance of\norder one tenth the influence radius of the primary hole (i.e., $\\approx\n10-100\\rm pc$ for massive ellipticals). We calculate the expected number of\nstalled satellites as a function of the host galaxy mass, and show that the\nbrightest cluster galaxies should have $\\gtrsim 1$ of such satellites orbiting\nwithin their cores. Our results could provide an explanation to a number of\nobservations, which include multiple nuclei in core ellipticals, off-center\nAGNs and eccentric nuclear disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2016 19:13:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 18:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-10"}

Analyzing the collision problem, this work\nstrengthens the claims found in the literature about the low Wi-Fi performance\nunder dense scenarios. Then, in particular, this article overviews the MAC\nprotocols used in the IEEE 802.11 standard and discusses solutions to mitigate\ncollisions.

The thesis consists of two parts. First one treats about the\nelectroweak sector of the model. Among others, it identifies the parameter\nregion allowed by the electroweak precision observables. Since the MRSSM\ncontains an $SU(2)_L$-triplet with a non-zero vacuum expectation value the\nemphasis is put on the calculation of the $W$ boson mass. To that end, a full\none-loop calculation of $m_W$ augmented with the leading two-loop SM result is\npresented. The region is then checked against the measurement of the Higgs\nboson mass. For this, the full one-loop and leading two-loop corrections to the\nHiggs boson mass in the MRSSM are calculated. Devised benchmark points,\nconsistent with both of these observables, are shown to fulfill also a number\nof additional experimental constraints like properties of the Higgs boson(s),\n$b$-physics observables and vacuum stability.

However, most face datasets accessible for training and\nverification are only collected in the VIS (visible light) spectrum. It remains\na challenging problem to match NIR to VIS face images due to the different\nlight spectrum. Recently, breakthroughs have been made for VIS face recognition\nby applying deep learning on a huge amount of labeled VIS face samples. The\nsame deep learning approach cannot be simply applied to NIR face recognition\nfor two main reasons: First, much limited NIR face images are available for\ntraining compared to the VIS spectrum. Second, face galleries to be matched are\nmostly available only in the VIS spectrum. In this paper, we propose an\napproach to extend the deep learning breakthrough for VIS face recognition to\nthe NIR spectrum, without retraining the underlying deep models that see only\nVIS faces. Our approach consists of two core components, cross-spectral\nhallucination and low-rank embedding, to optimize respectively input and output\nof a VIS deep model for cross-spectral face recognition. Cross-spectral\nhallucination produces VIS faces from NIR images through a deep learning\napproach. Low-rank embedding restores a low-rank structure for faces deep\nfeatures across both NIR and VIS spectrum. We observe that it is often equally\neffective to perform hallucination to input NIR images or low-rank embedding to\noutput deep features for a VIS deep model for cross-spectral recognition. When\nhallucination and low-rank embedding are deployed together, we observe\nsignificant further improvement; we obtain state-of-the-art accuracy on the\nCASIA NIR-VIS v2.0 benchmark, without the need at all to re-train the\nrecognition system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 03:22:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-22"}

RNN can utilize distributed\nrepresentations of words by first converting the tokens comprising each text\ninto vectors, which form a matrix. And this matrix includes two dimensions: the\ntime-step dimension and the feature vector dimension. Then most existing models\nusually utilize one-dimensional (1D) max pooling operation or attention-based\noperation only on the time-step dimension to obtain a fixed-length vector.\nHowever, the features on the feature vector dimension are not mutually\nindependent, and simply applying 1D pooling operation over the time-step\ndimension independently may destroy the structure of the feature\nrepresentation. On the other hand, applying two-dimensional (2D) pooling\noperation over the two dimensions may sample more meaningful features for\nsequence modeling tasks. To integrate the features on both dimensions of the\nmatrix, this paper explores applying 2D max pooling operation to obtain a\nfixed-length representation of the text.

The odd video subsequence is sampled such\nthat it has wrong temporal order of frames while the even ones have the correct\ntemporal order. Therefore, to generate a odd-one-out question no manual\nannotation is required. Our learning machine is implemented as multi-stream\nconvolutional neural network, which is learned end-to-end. Using odd-one-out\nnetworks, we learn temporal representations for videos that generalizes to\nother related tasks such as action recognition.\n  On action classification, our method obtains 60.3\\% on the UCF101 dataset\nusing only UCF101 data for training which is approximately 10% better than\ncurrent state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods. Similarly, on HMDB51\ndataset we outperform self-supervised state-of-the art methods by 12.7% on\naction classification task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 04:35:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2017 00:05:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2017 03:51:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 05:52:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-06"}

Using the dust\nemission fluxes detected in two normal galaxies at $z>6$ by ALMA as a\nconstraint, we can get the range of the time-scales (or efficiencies) of the\nabove mentioned processes. We find that if we assume extremely high\ncondensation efficiency in stellar ejecta ($f_{\\mathrm{in}} \\ga 0.5$), rapid\ndust enrichment by stellar sources in the early phase may be enough to explain\nthe observed ALMA flux, unless dust destruction by supernovae in those galaxies\nis stronger than that in nearby galaxies.

There are currently three kinds of popular approaches which are\nrespectively based on matrix factorization (MF) of collaborative filtering,\nMarkov chain (MC), and recurrent neural network (RNN). Although widely used,\nthey have some limitations. MF based methods could not capture dynamic user's\ninterest. The strong Markov assumption greatly limits the performance of MC\nbased methods. RNN based methods are still in the early stage of incorporating\nadditional information. Based on these basic models, many methods with\nadditional information only validate incorporating one modality in a separate\nway.

We find that the well-known algebraic decay of\ndisturbance velocity as derived kinematically is too conservative. Once the\nkinetics is taken into account by working on the fundamental solutions of\nfar-field linearized Navier-Stokes equations, it is proven that the furthest\nfar-field zone adjacent to the uniform fluid at infinity must be unsteady,\nviscous and compressible, where all disturbances degenerate to sound waves that\ndecay exponentially. But this optimal rate does not exist in some commonly used\nsimplified flow models, such as steady flow, incompressible flow and inviscid\nflow, because they actually work in true subspaces of the unbounded free space,\nwhich are surrounded by further far fields of different nature. This finding\nnaturally leads to a zonal structure of externally-unbounded flow field. The\nsignificance of the zonal structure is demonstrated by its close relevance to\nexisting theories of aerodynamic force and moment in external flows, including\nthe removal of the difficulties or paradoxes inherent in the simplified models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 09:35:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

While side information has been shown to be useful for\ncounting systems using traditional hand-crafted features, it has not been fully\nutilized in counting systems based on deep learning. In order to incorporate\nthe available side information, we propose an adaptive convolutional neural\nnetwork (ACNN), where the convolutional filter weights adapt to the current\nscene context via the side information.

Assuming perfect model knowledge and perfect traffic\ndemand prediction, the ramp metering problem can be cast as a finite horizon\noptimal control problem with the objective of minimizing the Total Time Spent,\ni.e., the sum of the travel times of all drivers. For this reason, the\napplication of Model Predictive Control (MPC) to the ramp metering problem has\nbeen proposed. However, practical tests on freeways show that MPC may not\noutperform simple, distributed feedback policies. Until now, a theoretical\njustification for this empirical observation was lacking. This work compares\nthe performance of distributed, non-predictive policies to the optimal solution\nin an idealised setting, specifically, for monotonic traffic dynamics and\nassuming perfect model knowledge. To do so, we suggest a distributed,\nnon-predictive policy and derive sufficient optimality conditions for the\nminimization of the Total Time Spent via monotonicity arguments. In a case\nstudy based on real-world traffic data, we demonstrate that these optimality\nconditions are only rarely violated. Moreover, we observe that the\nsuboptimality resulting from such infrequent violations appears to be\nnegligible. We complement this analysis with simulations in non-ideal settings,\nin particular allowing for model mismatch, and argue that Alinea, a successful,\ndistributed ramp metering policy, comes close to the ideal controller both in\nterms of control behavior and in performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 12:56:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 12:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-26"}

These\ncurrent systems are tightly linked, but their global behaviors are rarely\nanalyzed together. In this paper, we present estimates of the average global\nBirkeland currents and horizontal ionospheric currents from the same set of\nmagnetic field measurements. The magnetic field measurements, from the low\nEarth orbiting $\\textit{Swarm}$ and CHAMP satellites, are used to co-estimate\npoloidal and toroidal parts of the magnetic disturbance field, represented in\nmagnetic apex coordinates. The use of apex coordinates reduces effects of\nlongitudinal and hemispheric variations in the Earth's main field. We present\nglobal currents from both hemispheres during different sunlight conditions. The\nresults show that the Birkeland currents vary with the conductivity, which\ndepends most strongly on solar EUV emissions on the dayside and on particle\nprecipitation at pre-midnight magnetic local times. In sunlight, the horizontal\nequivalent current flows in two cells, resembling an opposite ionospheric\nconvection pattern, which implies that it is dominated by Hall currents. By\ncombining the Birkeland current maps and the equivalent current, we are able to\ncalculate the total horizontal current, without any assumptions about the\nconductivity. We show that the total horizontal current is close to zero in the\npolar cap when it is dark. That implies that the equivalent current, which is\nsensed by ground magnetometers, is largely canceled by the horizontal closure\nof the Birkeland currents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 13:03:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-22"}

Quantum nondemolition\nexperiments may be performed at the expense of excess fluctuations in another\nquadrature. Here we generate mid-infrared time-locked patterns of squeezed\nvacuum noise. After propagation through free space, the quantum fluctuations of\nthe electric field are studied in the time domain by electro-optic sampling\nwith few-femtosecond laser pulses. We directly compare the local noise\namplitude to the level of bare vacuum fluctuations. This nonlinear approach\noperates off resonance without absorption or amplification of the field that is\ninvestigated. Subcycle intervals with noise level significantly below the pure\nquantum vacuum are found. Enhanced fluctuations in adjacent time segments\nmanifest generation of highly correlated quantum radiation as a consequence of\nthe uncertainty principle. Together with efforts in the far infrared, this work\nopens a window to the elementary quantum dynamics of light and matter in an\nenergy range at the boundary between vacuum and thermal background conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 13:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-15"}

In this paper, we propose a Local Density\nPeaks Searching (LDPS) initialization framework to address these issues. The\nLDPS framework includes two basic components: one of them is the local density\nthat characterizes the density distribution of a data set, and the other is the\nlocal distinctiveness index (LDI) which we introduce to characterize how\ndistinctive a data point is compared with its neighbors. Based on these two\ncomponents, we search for the local density peaks which are characterized with\nhigh local densities and high LDIs to deal with 1) and 2). Moreover, we detect\noutliers characterized with low local densities but high LDIs, and exclude them\nout before clustering begins. Finally, we apply the LDPS initialization\nframework to $k$-medoids, which is a variant of $k$-means and chooses data\nsamples as centers, with diverse similarity measures other than the Euclidean\ndistance to fix the last drawback of $k$-means. Combining the LDPS\ninitialization framework with $k$-means and $k$-medoids, we obtain two novel\nclustering methods called LDPS-means and LDPS-medoids, respectively.\nExperiments on synthetic data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethods, especially when the ground truth of the cluster number $k$ is large.\nFurther, experiments on several real world data sets, Handwritten Pendigits,\nCoil-20, Coil-100 and Olivetti Face Database, illustrate that our methods give\na superior performance than the analogous approaches on both estimating $k$ and\nunsupervised object categorization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 13:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-22"}

The problem can be\neasily solved in time $O^*(2^k)$, making it fixed-parameter tractable (FPT)\nwith respect to $k$. While the fastest known algorithm takes only time\n$O^*(1.2738^k)$, much stronger improvements have been obtained by studying\nparameters that are smaller than $k$. Apart from treewidth-related results, the\narguably best algorithm for Vertex Cover runs in time $O^*(2.3146^p)$, where\n$p=k-LP(G)$ is only the excess of the solution size $k$ over the best\nfractional vertex cover (Lokshtanov et al.\\ TALG 2014). Since $p\\leq k$ but $k$\ncannot be bounded in terms of $p$ alone, this strictly increases the range of\ntractable instances.\n  Recently, Garg and Philip (SODA 2016) greatly contributed to understanding\nthe parameterized complexity of the Vertex Cover problem. They prove that\n$2LP(G)-MM(G)$ is a lower bound for the vertex cover size of $G$, where $MM(G)$\nis the size of a largest matching of $G$, and proceed to study parameter\n$\\ell=k-(2LP(G)-MM(G))$.

Our goal is to utilize information given by\nmedical images taken from GBM patients in statistical settings. To do this, we\ndesign a novel statistic---the smooth Euler characteristic transform\n(SECT)---that quantifies magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of tumors. Due to its\nwell-defined inner product structure, the SECT can be used in a wider range of\nfunctional and nonparametric modeling approaches than other previously proposed\ntopological summary statistics.

Specifically,\nwe demonstrate that SECT features alone explain more of the variance in GBM\npatient survival than gene expression, volumetric features, and morphometric\nfeatures. The main takeaways from our findings are thus twofold. First, they\nsuggest that images contain valuable information that can play an important\nrole in clinical prognosis and other medical decisions.

This paper builds on the\nresults of a previous study (Popov M. et al. Friction, 2016, submitted) by\ntaking the stiffness and resulting dynamics of the system into account. The\nmain governing parameters determining macroscopic friction, including a\ndimensionless oscillation amplitude, a dimensionless sliding velocity and the\nrelation between three characteristic frequencies (that of externally excited\noscillation and two natural oscillation frequencies associated with the contact\nstiffness and the system stiffness) are identified. In the limiting cases of a\nvery soft system and a very stiff system, our results reproduce the results of\nprevious studies. In between these two limiting cases there is also a resonant\ncase, which is studied here for the first time. The resonant case is notable in\nthat it lacks a critical sliding velocity, above which oscillations no longer\nreduce friction. Results obtained for the resonant case are qualitatively\nsupported by experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 15:34:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-30"}

It is defined as the minimal distortion of\nembedding one surface into the other, while the optimal correspondence can be\ndescribed as the map that minimizes this distortion. Solving such a\nminimization is a hard combinatorial problem that requires pre-computation and\nstoring of all pairwise geodesic distances for the matched surfaces. A popular\nway for compact representation of functions on surfaces is by projecting them\ninto the leading eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO). When\ntruncated, The basis of the LBO is known to be the optimal for representing\nfunctions with bounded gradient in a min-max sense. Methods such as\nSpectral-GMDS exploit this idea to simplify and efficiently approximate a\nminimization related to the GH distance by operating in the truncated spectral\ndomain, and obtain state of the art results for matching of nearly isometric\nshapes. However, when considering only a specific set of functions on the\nsurface, such as geodesic distances, an optimized basis could be considered as\nan even better alternative. Here, we define the geodesic distance basis, which\nis optimal for compact approximation of geodesic distances, in terms of\nFrobenius norm. We use the suggested basis to extract the Geodesic Distance\nDescriptor (GDD), which encodes the geodesic distances information as a linear\ncombination of the basis functions. We then show how these ideas can be used to\nefficiently and accurately approximate the metric spaces matching problem with\nalmost no loss of information. These observations are used to construct a very\nsimple and efficient procedure for shape correspondence. Experimental results\nshow that the GDD improves both accuracy and efficiency of state of the art\nshape matching procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 01:19:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

Common methods for dealing with\nthis problem usually introduce three additional problems: non-invariance,\nphysical interpretation, and discontinuities, calling for carefully designed\nmethods for quantifying transients.\n  In this article, we discuss how the aforementioned problems emerge and\npropose two novel metrics, Regularized Reaching Time ($T_{RR}$) and Area under\nDistance Curve (AUDIC), to solve them, capturing two complementary aspects of\nthe transient dynamics.\n  $T_{RR}$ quantifies the additional time (positive or negative) that a\ntrajectory starting at a chosen initial condition needs to reach the attractor\nafter a reference trajectory has already arrived there. A positive or negative\nvalue means that it arrives by this much earlier or later than the reference.\nBecause $T_{RR}$ is an analysis of return times after shocks, it is a\nsystematic approach to the concept of critical slowing down [1]; hence it is\nnaturally an early-warning signal [2] for bifurcations when central statistics\nover distributions of initial conditions are used.\n  AUDIC is the distance of the trajectory to the attractor integrated over\ntime. Complementary to $T_{RR}$, it measures which trajectories are reluctant,\ni.e. stay away from the attractor for long, or eager to approach it right away.\n  (... shortened for arxiv listing, full abstract in paper ...) New features in\nthese models can be uncovered, including the surprising regularity of the\nRoessler system's basin of attraction even in the regime of a chaotic\nattractor. Additionally, we demonstrate the critical slowing down\ninterpretation by presenting the metrics' sensitivity to prebifurcational\nchange and thus how they act as early-warning signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 10:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

This is due to the fact that the charged particles that\ncomprise space plasma can move almost freely along magnetic field lines, but\nnot across them. For this reason it is sensible to present such phenomena\nrelative to Earth's magnetic field. A large variety of magnetic coordinate\nsystems exist, designed for different purposes and regions, ranging from the\nmagnetopause to the ionosphere. In this paper we review the most common\nmagnetic coordinate systems and describe how they are defined, where they are\nused, and how to convert between them. The definitions are presented based on\nthe spherical harmonic expansion coefficients of the International Geomagnetic\nReference Field (IGRF) and, in some of the coordinate systems, the position of\nthe Sun which we show how to calculate from the time and date. The most\ndetailed coordinate systems take the full IGRF into account and define magnetic\nlatitude and longitude such that they are constant along field lines. These\ncoordinate systems, which are useful at ionospheric altitudes, are\nnon-orthogonal. We show how to handle vectors and vector calculus in such\ncoordinates, and discuss how systematic errors may appear if this is not done\ncorrectly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 13:31:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-01"}
