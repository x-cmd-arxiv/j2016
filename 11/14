The\nobjective is to adapt their transmission strategy to the state of the network,\nincluding the energy available to the individual nodes. In order to reduce the\ncomplexity of control, an optimization framework is proposed where energy\nstorage dynamics are replaced by dynamic average power constraints induced by\nthe time correlated energy supply, thus enabling lightweight and flexible\nnetwork control. Specifically, the BS adapts the packet transmission\nprobability of the \"active\" nodes (those currently under a favorable energy\nharvesting state) so as to maximize the average long-term throughput, under\nthese dynamic average power constraints. The resulting policy takes the form of\nthe packet transmission probability as a function of the energy harvesting\nstate and number of active nodes. The structure of the throughput-optimal\ngenie-aided policy, in which the number of active nodes is known non-causally\nat the BS, is proved. Inspired by the genie-aided policy, a Bayesian estimation\napproach is presented to address the case where the BS estimates the number of\nactive nodes based on the observed network transmission pattern. It is shown\nthat the proposed scheme outperforms by 20% a scheme in which the nodes operate\nbased on local state information only, and performs well even when energy\nstorage dynamics are taken into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2016 16:12:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2017 21:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-17"}

They improve upon the\nclassical test not only under heavy tails or in the presence of outliers, but\nalso under normality. An explanation for this at first counterintuitive result\nis that the corresponding long-run variance estimates are less affected by a\nscale change than in the case of the sample-variance-based test.\n  We use recent results on the process convergence of U-statistics and\nU-quantiles for dependent sequences to derive the limiting distribution of the\ntest statistics and propose estimators for the long-run variance.

Since satellite galaxies tend to reside in massive halos\nwith a greater halo bias, the inclusion boosts the clustering power. In\naddition, virial motions of the satellite galaxies cause a significant\nsuppression of the clustering power due to nonlinear RSD effects. We develop a\nnovel method to recover the redshift-space power spectrum of halos from the\nobserved galaxy distribution by minimizing the contamination of satellite\ngalaxies. The cylinder grouping method (CGM) we study effectively excludes\nsatellite galaxies from a galaxy sample. However, we find that this technique\nproduces apparent anisotropies in the reconstructed halo distribution over all\nthe scales which mimic RSD. On small scales, the apparent anisotropic\nclustering is caused by exclusion of halos within the anisotropic cylinder used\nby the CGM. On large scales, the misidentification of different halos in the\nlarge-scale structures, aligned along the line-of-sight, into the same CGM\ngroup, causes the apparent anisotropic clustering via their cross-correlation\nwith the CGM halos. We construct an empirical model for the CGM halo power\nspectrum, which includes correction terms derived using the CGM window function\nat small scales as well as the linear matter power spectrum multiplied by a\nsimple anisotropic function at large scales.

Since the GEV\ndistribution is a limit distribution this suggests a universal property of\nparallel systems gated by the slowest communication element of some sort.\nHence, this model is applicable to a variety of processing and IO tasks in\nparallel environments. These findings have important implications, ranging from\ncharacterizing ideal performance for parallel codes to detecting degraded\nbehaviour at extreme scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Nov 2016 18:18:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Nov 2016 15:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-21"}

To mitigate this issue, researchers often couple LES with a simplified\nmodel of the flow close to the wall, known as the wall model. One feature\ncommon to most wall models is that the first few (about 3) grid points must be\nlocated below the inviscid log-layer, and the grid must have near-isotropic\nresolution near the wall. Hence, wall-modeled LES may still require a large\nnumber of grid points in both the wall-normal and span-wise directions. Because\nof these requirements, wall-modeled LES is still unfeasible in many\napplications. We present a new formulation of wall-modeled LES that is being\ndeveloped to address this issue. In this formulation, LES is used to solve only\nfor the features of the velocity field that can be adequately represented on\nthe LES grid. The effects of the unresolved features are captured by imposing\nan integral balance of kinetic energy in the near-wall region. This integral\nenergy balance translates into a dynamic partial differential equation defined\non the walls, which is coupled to the LES equations.

In bacteria this task is accomplished by RecA proteins that are\nactive as nucleoprotein filaments formed on single-stranded segments of DNA.

However, extending deep\nRL to real-world robotic tasks has proven challenging, particularly in\nsafety-critical domains such as autonomous flight, where a trial-and-error\nlearning process is often impractical. In this paper, we explore the following\nquestion: can we train vision-based navigation policies entirely in simulation,\nand then transfer them into the real world to achieve real-world flight without\na single real training image? We propose a learning method that we call\nCAD$^2$RL, which can be used to perform collision-free indoor flight in the\nreal world while being trained entirely on 3D CAD models. Our method uses\nsingle RGB images from a monocular camera, without needing to explicitly\nreconstruct the 3D geometry of the environment or perform explicit motion\nplanning. Our learned collision avoidance policy is represented by a deep\nconvolutional neural network that directly processes raw monocular images and\noutputs velocity commands. This policy is trained entirely on simulated images,\nwith a Monte Carlo policy evaluation algorithm that directly optimizes the\nnetwork's ability to produce collision-free flight. By highly randomizing the\nrendering settings for our simulated training set, we show that we can train a\npolicy that generalizes to the real world, without requiring the simulator to\nbe particularly realistic or high-fidelity. We evaluate our method by flying a\nreal quadrotor through indoor environments, and further evaluate the design\nchoices in our simulator through a series of ablation studies on depth\nprediction.

The sequence of channels is assumed to be completely known to\nboth the transmitter and the receiver (a coherent scenario). Also, at each code\nblock transmission, each of the channels is used only once. In other words, a\ncodeword of length $N$ is constructed and then the $i$-th encoded bit is\ntransmitted over $W_i$. The goal is to operate at a rate $R$ close to the\naverage of the symmetric capacities of $W_i$'s, denoted by $\\overline{I}_N$. To\nthis end, we construct a polar coding scheme using Arikan's channel\npolarization transform in combination with certain permutations at each\npolarization level and certain skipped operations. In particular, given a\nnon-stationary sequence of BMS channels $\\left\\{W_i\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ and\n$P_e$, where $0 < P_e <1$, we construct a polar code of length $N$ and rate $R$\nguaranteeing a block error probability of at most $P_e$ for transmission over\n$\\left\\{W_i\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ such that $$ N \\leq\n\\frac{\\kappa}{(\\overline{I}_N - R)^{\\mu}}, $$ where $\\mu$ is a constant and\n$\\kappa$ is a constant depending on $P_e$ and $\\mu$.

The theory covers the cases of\nstationary process, nearly non-stationary process, unit root process, mildly\nintegrated, mildly explosive and explosive processes. It is assumed that the\ncross-sectional dimension and time-series dimension are respectively $N$ and\n$T$. The results in this paper illustrate that whichever the process is, with\nan appropriate regularization, the least squares estimator of the\nautoregressive coefficient converges to a normal distribution with rate at\nleast $O(N^{-1/3})$. Since the variance is the key to characterize the normal\ndistribution, it is important to discuss the variance of the least squares\nestimator. We will show that when the autoregressive coefficient $\\rho$\nsatisfies $|\\rho|<1$, the variance declines at the rate $O((NT)^{-1/2})$, while\nthe rate changes to $O(N^{-1/2}T^{-1})$ when $\\rho=1$ and\n$O(N^{-1/2}\\rho^{-T+2})$ when $|\\rho|>1$. $\\rho=1$ is the critical point where\nthe convergence rate changes radically. The transition process is studied by\nassuming $\\rho$ depending on $T$ and going to $1$. An interesting phenomenon\ndiscovered in this paper is that, in the explosive case, the least squares\nestimator of the autoregressive coefficient has a standard normal limiting\ndistribution in panel data case while it may not has a limiting distribution in\nunivariate time series case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2016 04:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

To overcome this problem, we introduce the first\nsparsification techniques aimed explicitly at uncertain graphs. The proposed\nmethods reduce the number of edges and redistribute their probabilities in\norder to decrease the graph size, while preserving its underlying structure.\nThe resulting graph can be used to efficiently and accurately approximate any\nquery and mining tasks on the original graph. An extensive experimental\nevaluation with real and synthetic datasets illustrates the effectiveness of\nour techniques on several common graph tasks, including clustering coefficient,\npage rank, reliability and shortest path distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2016 09:58:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2017 11:39:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 May 2017 11:29:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 24 May 2017 05:50:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-25"}

In this work we study the stability of the\ninterbank market to exogenous shocks using an agent-based network framework.\nOur model encompasses several ingredients that have been recognized in the\nliterature as pro-cyclical triggers of financial distress in the banking\nsystem: credit and liquidity shocks through bilateral exposures, liquidity\nhoarding due to counterparty creditworthiness deterioration, target leveraging\npolicies and fire-sales spillovers.

Using a dataset of tweets labeled using hashtags, the model\nestimates topic-level, and sentiment-level distributions.

The\nsimplest formulation of the problem is when the climber falls from a given\naltitude and is attached to one end of the rope while the other end of the rope\nis attached to the rock at a given height. The problem is then finding the\nproperties of the rope for which the peak force felt by the climber during the\nfall is minimal. The second problem of our consideration is again minimizing\nthe same quantity in the presence of a carabiner. We will call such ropes\n\\textit{mathematically ideal.} Given the height of the carabiner, the initial\nheight and the mass of the climber, the length of the unstretched rope, and the\ndistance between the belayer and the carabineer, we find the optimal (in the\nsense of minimized the peak force to a given elongation) dynamic rope in the\nframework of nonlinear elasticity. Wires of shape memory materials have some of\nthe desired features of the tension-strain relation of a mathematically ideal\ndynamic rope, namely a plateau in the tension over a range of strains.

By investigating the chromospheric and photospheric\nactivity of the solar analogues in this sample, it was shown that for a large\nfraction of these stars the measured activity levels are compatible to levels\nof the 11-year solar activity cycle 23. A clear correlation between the lithium\nabundance and surface rotation was found for rotation periods shorter than the\nsolar value. Comparing the lithium abundance measured in the solar analogues to\nevolutionary models with the Toulouse-Geneva Evolutionary Code (TGEC), we found\nthat the solar models calibrated to the Sun also correctly describe the set of\nsolar/stellar analogs showing that they share the same internal mixing physics.\nFinally, the star KIC 3241581 and KIC 10644353 are discussed in more detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2016 10:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-07"}

A model that is particularly well suited to quantify over-dispersion is\nthe Negative-Binomial distribution model.

The main mechanisms of energy loss\nand broadening will be firstly addressed with focus on leading particle\ncalculations beyond the eikonal approximation. Then, I will provide an overview\nof the modifications of the interference pattern between the different parton\nemitters that build up the parton shower when propagating through an extended\ncoloured medium.

We find that\ntransport in the twist bilayer is profoundly sensitive to the rotation angle of\nthe constituent layers. Similar to the electronic structure of the twist\nbilayer the transport is qualitatively different in three distinct angle\nregimes. At large angles ($\\theta > \\,\\approx\\!\\!10^\\circ$) and at temperatures\nbelow an interlayer Bloch-Gr\\\"uneisen temperature of $\\approx 10$~K the\nconductivity is independent of the twist angle i.e. the layers are fully\ndecoupled. Above this temperature the layers, even though decoupled in the\nground state, are re-coupled by electron-phonon scattering and the transport is\ndifferent both from single layer graphene as well as the Bernal bilayer. In the\nsmall angle regime $\\theta <\\,\\approx\\!\\!2^\\circ$ the conductivity drops by two\norders of magnitude and develops a rich energy dependence, reflecting the\ncomplexity of the underlying topological changes (Lifshitz transitions) of the\nFermi surface. At intermediate angles the conductivity decreases continuously\nas the twist angle is reduced, while the energy dependence of the conductivity\npresents two sharp transitions, that occur at specific angle dependent\nenergies, and that may be related to (i) the well studied van Hove singularity\nof the twist bilayer and (ii) a Lifshitz transition that occurs when trigonally\nplaced electron pockets decorate the strongly warped Dirac cone. We examine the\nrole of a layer perpendicular electric field finding that it affects the\nconductivity strongly at low temperatures whereas this effect is washed out by\nFermi smearing at room temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2016 14:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

Indeed, information routing in the Internet faces serious\nscalability problems due to its rapid growth, recently accelerated by the rise\nof the Internet of Things. Large networks like the Internet can be navigated\nefficiently if nodes, or agents, actively forward information based on hidden\nmaps underlying these systems. However, in reality most agents will deny to\nforward messages, which has a cost, and navigation is impossible. Can we design\nappropriate incentives that lead to participation and global navigability?\nHere, we present an evolutionary game where agents share the value generated by\nsuccessful delivery of information or goods. We show that global navigability\ncan emerge, but its complete breakdown is possible as well. Furthermore, we\nshow that the system tends to self-organize into local clusters of agents who\nparticipate in the navigation. This organizational principle can be exploited\nto favor the emergence of global navigability in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2016 14:36:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-19"}

This model\nconsists of two axial point sources illuminating an accretion disc that produce\nthe reverberation lags. These lags are due to the time delays between the\ndirectly observed and reflection photons and are associated with the\nlight-travel time between the source and the disc, so they allow us to probe\nthe disc-corona geometry. We assume the variations of two X-ray sources are\ntriggered by the same primary variations, but allow the two sources to respond\nin different ways (i.e. having different source responses). The variations of\neach source induce a delayed accretion disc response and the total lags consist\nof a combination of both source and disc responses. We show that the extended\ncorona model can reproduce both the low-frequency hard and high-frequency soft\n(reverberation) lags.

In addition to this primary phenotype\na number of additional traits, known as secondary phenotypes, are routinely\nrecorded and typically associations between genetic factors and these secondary\ntraits are studied too. Analysing secondary phenotypes in case-control studies\nmay lead to biased genetic effect estimates, especially when the marker tested\nis associated with the primary phenotype and when the primary and secondary\nphenotypes tested are correlated. Several methods have been proposed in the\nliterature to overcome the problem but they are limited to case-control studies\nand not directly applicable to more complex designs, such as the multiple-cases\nfamily studies.

Therefore, it is\nsuperior to the non-mutagenized impatiens in terms of drought resistance and\ndemonstrates tremendous differences from the normal impatiens in physiology,\nwhich intrigues scholars to search for the underlying reasons . Methods: By\nreference to Impatiens balsamina L,this experiment uses mutagenized impatiens\nseeds, processed by PEG-6000 in different solution concentration, to measure\nthe germination rate of impatiens, its relative enzymatic activity and\nexpression differences between gene SoS2 and gene RD29b in the drought lower\nreaches.

However, comparisons are made with\nthe more important parameter, effective collision strength ($\\Upsilon$), for\nwhich recent $R$-matrix results are available for a wide range of transitions,\nand over a large range of temperatures. To determine $\\Upsilon$, resonances\nhave been resolved in a narrow energy mesh, although these are not observed to\nbe as important as for other ions. Unfortunately, large discrepancies in\n$\\Upsilon$ values are noted for about half the transitions. The differences\nincrease with increasing temperature and worsen as the upper level J increases.\nIn most cases the earlier results are overestimated, by up to (almost) two\norders of magnitude, and this conclusion is consistent with the one observed\nearlier for Be-like ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Nov 2016 12:33:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-16"}

Recent advances in\nconnected and automated vehicle technologies enable sensor-equipped cars (probe\ncars) to detect and broadcast available parking spaces when driving through\nparking lots. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of market penetration of\nprobe cars on the system performance, and investigate different parking\nguidance policies to improve the data acquisition process. We adopt a\nsimulation-based approach to impose four policies on an off- street parking lot\ninfluencing the behavior of probe cars to park in assigned parking spaces. This\nin turn effects the scanning route and the parking space occupancy estimations.\nThe last policy we propose is a near-optimal guidance strategy that maximizes\nthe information gain of posteriors. The results suggest that an efficient\ninformation gathering policy can compensate for low penetration of connected\nand automated vehicles.

There has been\nmuch speculation that the non-monotonic behavior of $\\kappa\\sigma^{2}$ of the\nproduced protons around $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 19.6 GeV in the STAR results may\nbe due to the existence of QCD critical point. However, the experimentally\nmeasured proton distributions contain protons from heavy resonance decays, from\nbaryon stopping and from direct production processes. These proton\ndistributions are used to estimate the net-proton number fluctuation. Because\nit is difficult to disentangle the protons from the above-mentioned sources, it\nis better to devise a method which will account for the directly produced\nbaryons (protons) to study the dynamical fluctuation at different\ncenter-of-mass energies. This is because, it is assumed that any associated\ncriticality in the system could affect the particle production mechanism and\nhence the dynamical fluctuation in various conserved numbers.
