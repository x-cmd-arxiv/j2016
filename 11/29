We identify 27 planets (out of 167) that are\nsimultaneously consistent with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres and are expected\nto exhibit extreme mass-loss rates. We further estimate the mass-loss rates\n($L_{\\rm hy}$) of these planets with tailored atmospheric hydrodynamic models.\nWe compare $L_{\\rm hy}$ to the energy-limited (maximum-possible high-energy\ndriven) mass-loss rates. We confirm that 25 planets (15\\% of the sample)\nexhibit extremely high mass-loss rates ($L_{\\rm hy}>0.1\\,M_{\\oplus}{\\rm\nGyr}^{-1}$), well in excess of the energy-limited mass-loss rates. This\nconstitutes a contradiction, since the hydrogen envelopes cannot be retained\ngiven the high mass-loss rates. We hypothesize that these planets are not truly\nunder such high mass-loss rates. Instead, either hydrodynamic models\noverestimate the mass-loss rates, transit-timing-variation measurements\nunderestimate the planetary masses, optical transit observations overestimate\nthe planetary radii (due to high-altitude clouds), or Neptunes have\nconsistently higher albedos than Jupiter planets. We conclude that at least one\nof these established estimations/techniques is consistently producing biased\nvalues for Neptune planets. Such an important fraction of exoplanets with\nmisinterpreted parameters can significantly bias our view of populations\nstudies, like the observed mass--radius distribution of exoplanets for example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2016 16:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

It deals with encrypting\nand decrypting of visual information like pictures, texts, videos $ etc.$ Multi\nSecret Image Sharing (MSIS) scheme is a part of visual cryptography that\nprovides a protected method to transmit more than one secret images over a\ncommunication channel. Conventionally, transmission of a single secret image is\npossible over a channel at a time. But as technology grows, there emerge a need\nfor sharing more than one secret image. An $(n, n)$-MSIS scheme is used to\nencrypt $n$ secret images into $n$ meaningless noisy images that are stored\nover different servers. To recover $n$ secret images all $n$ noisy images are\nrequired. At earlier time, the main problem with secret sharing schemes was\nthat attacker can partially figure out secret images, even by getting access of\n$n-1$ or fewer noisy images. To tackle with this security issue, there arises a\nneed of secure MSIS scheme, so that attacker can not retrieve any information\nby using less than $n-1$ noisy images. In this paper, we propose a secure $(n,\nn+1)$-MSIS scheme using additive modulo operation for grayscale and colored\nimages. For checking the effectiveness of proposed scheme; Correlation, MSE and\nPSNR techniques are used. The experimental results show that the proposed\nscheme is highly secured and altering of noisy images will not reveal any\npartial information about secret images. The proposed $(n, n+1)$-MSIS scheme\noutperforms the existing MSIS schemes in terms of security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2016 17:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-29"}

In this thesis we introduce new models of quantum\ncomputation to study the emergence of quantum speed-up in quantum computer\nalgorithms.\n  Our first contribution is a formalism of restricted quantum operations, named\nnormalizer circuit formalism, based on algebraic extensions of the qubit\nClifford gates (CNOT, Hadamard and $\\pi/4$-phase gates): a normalizer circuit\nconsists of quantum Fourier transforms (QFTs), automorphism gates and quadratic\nphase gates associated to a set $G$, which is either an abelian group or\nabelian hypergroup. Though Clifford circuits are efficiently classically\nsimulable, we show that normalizer circuit models encompass Shor's celebrated\nfactoring algorithm and the quantum algorithms for abelian Hidden Subgroup\nProblems. We develop classical-simulation techniques to characterize under\nwhich scenarios normalizer circuits provide quantum speed-ups. Finally, we\ndevise new quantum algorithms for finding hidden hyperstructures. The results\noffer new insights into the source of quantum speed-ups for several algebraic\nproblems.\n  Our second contribution is an algebraic (group- and hypergroup-theoretic)\nframework for describing quantum many-body states and classically simulating\nquantum circuits. Our framework extends Gottesman's Pauli Stabilizer Formalism\n(PSF), wherein quantum states are written as joint eigenspaces of stabilizer\ngroups of commuting Pauli operators: while the PSF is valid for qubit/qudit\nsystems, our formalism can be applied to discrete- and continuous-variable\nsystems, hybrid settings, and anyonic systems.

In this work, we use\nnumerical-relativity simulations, equipped with a new ray-tracing module, to\nnumerically obtain this relation for a few black-hole--lattice cosmologies and\ncompare it to the well-known Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker case, as\nwell as to other relevant cosmologies and to the Empty-Beam Approximation. We\nfind that the latter provides the best estimate of the luminosity distance and\nformulate a simple argument to account for this agreement. We also find that a\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker model can reproduce this observable\nexactly, as long as a time-dependent cosmological constant is included in the\nfit. Finally, the dependence of these results on the lattice mass-to-spacing\nratio $\\mu$ is discussed: we discover that, unlike the expansion rate, the\n$D_{\\rm L}(z)$ relation in a black-hole lattice does not tend to that measured\nin the corresponding continuum spacetime as $\\mu \\to 0$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2016 18:32:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2017 20:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-19"}

This problem finds immediate\napplications, e.g., in traffic engineering in computer networks. We show that\nthe problem is generally NP-hard already for $k = 2$ flows, which motivates us\nto study rerouting on a most basic class of flow graphs, namely DAGs.\nInterestingly, we find that for general $k$, deciding whether an unsplittable\nmulti-commodity flow rerouting schedule exists, is NP-hard even on DAGs. Both\nNP-hardness proofs are non-trivial. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time\n(fixed parameter tractable) algorithm to solve the route update problem for a\nbounded number of flows on DAGs.

All rotators with Ro smaller than 0.03$\\pm$0.01 converge\nto an activity level of $L_{H\\alpha}/L_{bol}$ = (1.27$\\pm$0.02) x 10$^{-4}$.\nThis saturation threshold ($R_{o,sat}$ = 0.03$\\pm$0.01) is statistically\nsmaller than that found in most studies of the rotation-activity relation. In\nthe unsaturated regime, slower rotators have lower levels of chromospheric\nactivity, with $L_{H\\alpha}/L_{bol}$($R_o$) following a power-law of index\n$\\beta$ = -0.51$\\pm$0.02, slightly shallower than the one found for a combined\n$\\approx$650-Myr-old sample of Hyades and Praesepe stars. By comparing this\nunsaturated behavior to that previously found for coronal activity in M37 (as\nmeasured via the X-ray luminosity, $L_X$), we confirm that chromospheric\nactivity decays at a much slower rate than coronal activity with increasing\n$R_o$. While a comparison of $L_{H\\alpha}$ and $L_X$ for M37 members with\nmeasurements of both reveals a nearly 1:1 relation, removing the\nmass-dependencies by comparing instead $L_{H\\alpha}/L_{bol}$ and $L_X/L_{bol}$\ndoes not provide clear evidence for such a relation. Finally, we find that\n$R_{o,sat}$ is smaller for our chromospheric than for our coronal indicator of\nactivity ($R_{o,sat}$ = 0.03$\\pm$0.01 versus 0.09$\\pm$0.01).

The method relies on a\nnew formulation for Ewald summation of the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) tensor,\nwhich guarantees that the real-space and wave-space contributions to the tensor\nare independently symmetric and positive-definite for all possible particle\nconfigurations. Brownian displacements are drawn from a superposition of two\nindependent samples: a wave-space (far-field or long-ranged) contribution,\ncomputed using techniques from fluctuating hydrodynamics and non-uniform Fast\nFourier Transforms; and a real-space (near-field or short-ranged) correction,\ncomputed using a Krylov subspace method. The combined computational complexity\nof drawing these two independent samples scales linearly with the number of\nparticles. The proposed method circumvents the super-linear scaling exhibited\nby all known iterative sampling methods applied directly to the RPY tensor that\nresults from the power law growth of the condition number of tensor with the\nnumber of particles. Calculations for hard sphere dispersions and colloidal\ngels are illustrated and used to explore the role of microstructure on\nperformance of the algorithm. In practice, the logarithmic part of the\npredicted scaling is not observed and the algorithm scales linearly for up to 4\nmillion particles, obtaining speed ups of over an order of magnitude over\nexisting iterative methods, and making the cost of computing Brownian\ndisplacements comparable the cost of computing deterministic displacements in\nBD simulations.

The\nrest-frame optical light traces the content in low-mass evolved stars (~stellar\nmass - Mstar), minimizing potential measurement biases for Mstar. Moreover it\nis less affected by nebular line emission contamination and dust attenuation,\nis independent of stellar population models, and can be probed up to z~8\nthrough Spitzer/IRAC. Our analysis leverages the unique full depth Spitzer/IRAC\n3.6um-to-8.0um data over the CANDELS/GOODS-N, CANDELS/GOODS-S and\nCOSMOS/UltraVISTA fields. We find that at absolute magnitudes M_z' fainter than\n>-23 mag, M_z' linearly correlates with M_UV,1600. At brighter M_z', M_UV,1600\npresents a turnover, suggesting that the stellar mass-to-light ratio\nMstar/L_UV,1600 could be characterised by a very broad range of values at high\nstellar masses. Median-stacking analysis recovers a Mstar/L_z' roughly\nindependent on M_z' for M_z'>-23 mag, but exponentially increasing at brighter\nmagnitudes.

Using the 36 brightest PNe we\ndetermine a new PNLF distance modulus of 29.91^{+0.08}_{-0.13} mag\n(9.59^{+0.35}_{-0.57} Mpc), in good agreement with literature values but\nsignificantly larger than the previously reported PNLF distance. We are able to\nexplain the discrepancy and recover the previous result when we reintroduce SNR\ncontaminants to our sample. This demonstrates the power of full spectral\ninformation over narrowband imaging in isolating PNe. Given our limited spatial\ncoverage within the galaxy, we show that this technique can be used to refine\ndistance estimates even when IFU observations cover only a fraction of a galaxy\ndisk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2016 21:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

High resolution simulations for such models are\ncurrently very slow due to the highly nonlinear partial differential equation\nthat needs to be solved exactly to predict the modified gravitational force.\nThis nonlinearity is partly inherent, but is also exacerbated by the specific\nnumerical algorithm used, which employs a variable redefinition to prevent\nnumerical instabilities. The standard Newton-Gauss-Seidel iterative method used\nto tackle this problem has a poor convergence rate. Our new method not only\navoids this, but also allows the discretised equation to be written in a form\nthat is analytically solvable. We show that this new method greatly improves\nthe performance and efficiency of $f(R)$ simulations. For example, a test\nsimulation with $512^3$ particles in a box of size $512 \\, \\mathrm{Mpc}/h$ is\nnow 5 times faster than before, while a Millennium-resolution simulation for\n$f(R)$ gravity is estimated to be more than 20 times faster than with the old\nmethod.

Global image\ncontext, such as where the material is or what object it makes up, can be\ncrucial to recognizing the material. Existing methods, however, operate on an\nimplicit fusion of materials and context by using large receptive fields as\ninput (i.e., large image patches). Many recent material recognition methods\ntreat materials as yet another set of labels like objects. Materials are,\nhowever, fundamentally different from objects as they have no inherent shape or\ndefined spatial extent. Approaches that ignore this can only take advantage of\nlimited implicit context as it appears during training. We instead show that\nrecognizing materials purely from their local appearance and integrating\nseparately recognized global contextual cues including objects and places leads\nto superior dense, per-pixel, material recognition. We achieve this by training\na fully-convolutional material recognition network end-to-end with only\nmaterial category supervision. We integrate object and place estimates to this\nnetwork from independent CNNs. This approach avoids the necessity of preparing\nan impractically-large amount of training data to cover the product space of\nmaterials, objects, and scenes, while fully leveraging contextual cues for\ndense material recognition. Furthermore, we perform a detailed analysis of the\neffects of context granularity, spatial resolution, and the network level at\nwhich we introduce context.

Using three different systematically generated sets of\nequations of state we explore the relationship between the moment of inertia of\nJ0737-3039A and the binding energy of the two low mass neutron stars. We find\nthis relationship, a less strict variant of the recently discovered I-Love-Q\nrelations, is nevertheless more robust than a previously explored correlation\nbetween the binding energy and the slope of the nuclear symmetry energy L. We\nfind that, if either J0737-3039B or the J1756-2251 companion were formed in an\nECSN, no more than 0.06 solar masses could have been lost from the progenitor\ncore, more than four times the mass loss predicted by current supernova\nmodeling. A measurement of the moment of inertia of J0737-3039A to within 10%\naccuracy from pulsar timing, possible within a decade, can discriminate between\nformation scenarios such as ECSN or ultra-stripped FeCCSN and, given current\nconstraints on the predicted core mass loss, potentially rule them out. Using\nthe I-Love-Q relations we find that an Advanced LIGO can potentially measure\nthe neutron star tidal polarizability to equivalent accuracy in a neutron\nstar-neutron star merger at a distance of 200 Mpc, thus obtaining similar\nconstraints on the formation scenarios. Such information on the occurrence of\nECSNe is important for population synthesis calculations, especially for\nestimating the rate of binary neutron star mergers and resulting\nelectromagnetic and gravitational wave signals.

In this setting, we\nalso find the asymptotic distribution of the number of loose Hamilton cycles in\n$\\mathcal{G}(n,r,s)$.\n  Finally we prove that for $\\ell = 2,\\ldots, s-1$ and for $r$ growing\nmoderately as $n\\to\\infty$, the probability that $\\mathcal{G}(n,r,s)$ has a\n$\\ell$-overlapping Hamilton cycle tends to zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2016 23:18:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Feb 2017 11:10:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 May 2018 05:22:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 11 Feb 2019 13:34:42 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 19 May 2019 13:53:55 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 2019 01:18:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-11-04"}

We argue that the\nquantum theory describing the interaction of cold atoms with a vibrating\nmembrane--quantum acoustodynamics (QAD)--shares many issues and features with\nQED. Specifically, the adsorption of an atom on a vibrating membrane can be\nviewed as the counterpart to QED radiative electron capture. A calculation of\nthe adsorption rate to lowest-order in the atom-phonon coupling is finite;\nhowever, higher-order contributions suffer from an infrared problem mimicking\nthe case of radiative capture in QED. Terms in the perturbation series for the\nadsorption rate diverge as a result of massless particles in the model\n(flexural phonons of the membrane in QAD and photons in QED). We treat this\ninfrared problem in QAD explicitly to obtain finite results by regularizing\nwith a low-frequency cutoff that corresponds to the inverse size of the\nmembrane. Using a coherent state basis for the soft phonon final state, we then\nsum the dominant contributions to derive a new formula for the multiphonon\nadsorption rate of atoms on the membrane that gives results that are finite,\nnonperturbative in the atom-phonon coupling, and consistent with the KLN\ntheorem. For micromembranes, we predict a reduction with increasing membrane\nsize for the low-energy adsorption rate.

The RRPA takes into account the effect of ground-state correlations\nbeyond RPA owing to the Pauli principle between the particle-hole pairs that\nform the RPA excitations as well as the correlations due to the\nparticle-particle and hole-hole transitions, whose effects are treated here in\nan effective way. By comparing the RPA results with the RRPA ones, which are\nobtained for isoscalar (IS) and isovector (IV) dipole excitations in $^{48, 52,\n58}$Ca and $^{90, 96, 110}$Zr, it is shown that ground-state correlations\nbeyond the RPA reduce the IS transition strengths. They also shift up the\nenergy of the lowest IV dipole state and slightly push down the peak energy of\nthe IV giant dipole resonance. As the result, the energy-weighted sums of\nstrengths of both IS and IV modes decrease, causing the violation of the\ncorresponding energy-weight sum rules (EWSR).

To\nincrease the multiply imaged SN Ia discovery rate, we present a simple\nalgorithm for identifying gravitationally lensed SN Ia candidates in cadenced,\nwide-field optical imaging surveys.

For both quenching protocols, finite-size\nscaling is satisfied in terms of the scaled variable $\\ln t/L^{\\psi}$.\nFurthermore, the distribution of long-time limiting values of the magnetization\nshows that the typical and the average values scale differently and the average\nis governed by rare events. The non-equilibrium dynamical behavior of the\nmagnetization is explained through semi-classical theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 05:36:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2017 21:43:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-05"}

Besides approximating gravitational interactions, we had to\ntruncate the initial correlation hierarchy of particle momenta at the second\norder. Here, we substantially simplify KFT. We show that its central object,\nthe free generating functional, can be factorized, taking the full hierarchy of\nmomentum correlations into account. The factors appearing in the generating\nfunctional, which we identify as non-linearly evolved density-fluctuation power\nspectra, have a universal form and can thus be tabulated for fast access in\nperturbation schemes.\n  In this paper, we focus on a complete evaluation of the free generating\nfunctional of KFT, not including particle interactions yet.

Once\nparticle interactions will be taken into account, they will compensate this\ndamping.

In contrast, the proposed scheme\nachieves fairness in a random field of relays without deteriorating the outage\nprobability performance. In this scheme, each relay maintains a countdown timer\nwhose initial value is a function of the relay location and a tunable parameter\nwhich controls the level of fairness. The optimum value of this parameter is\nevaluated in an offline manner so as to achieve fairness by making the average\npowers consumed by the relays as close as possible. An exact analytical\nexpression is derived for the average power consumed by each relay. This\nexpression is then used to show the superiority of the proposed scheme over\nopportunistic relaying and random relay selection schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 07:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-30"}

In this paper, we show\nhow to extend the triply periodic Spectral Ewald method to the singly periodic\ncase, such that the cost of computing the singly periodic potential is only\nmarginally larger than the cost of computing the potential for the\ncorresponding triply periodic system.\n  In the Fourier space contribution of the Ewald decomposition, a Fourier\nseries is obtained in the periodic direction with a Fourier integral over the\nnon periodic directions for each discrete wave number.

In contrast to previous studies in which the screen is assumed to\nbe a bounded Lipschitz (or smoother) relatively open subset of the plane, we\nconsider screens occupying an arbitrary bounded subset of the plane. Thus our\nstudy includes cases where the screen is a relatively open set with a boundary\nthat is fractal, or indeed has positive surface measure, and cases where the\nscreen has empty interior and is fractal, or indeed has positive surface\nmeasure. We elucidate for which screen geometries the classical formulations of\nscreen scattering are well-posed, showing that the classical formulation for\nsound-hard scattering is not well-posed if the screen boundary has Hausdorff\ndimension greater than $n-2$. We also propose novel well-posed boundary\nintegral equation (BIE) and boundary value problem (BVP) formulations, valid\nfor arbitrary bounded screens. In fact, we show that for sufficiently irregular\nscreens there exist whole families of well-posed formulations, with infinitely\nmany distinct solutions, the distinct formulations distinguished by the sense\nin which the boundary conditions are understood.

In the Milky Way, which contains such a B/PS bulge, the X-shaped\nstructure is traced by the metal-rich stars but not by the metal-poor ones.\nRecently Debattista et al. (2016) interpreted this property as a result of the\nvarying effect of the bar on stellar populations with different starting\nkinematics. This kinematic fractionation model predicts that cooler populations\nat the time of bar formation go on to trace the X shape, whereas hotter\npopulations are more uniformly distributed. As this prediction is not specific\nto the Milky Way, we test it with MUSE observations of the B/PS bulge in the\nnearby galaxy NGC 4710. We show that the metallicity map is more peanut-shaped\nthan the density distribution itself, in good agreement with the prediction.\nThis result indicates that the X-shaped structure in B/PS bulges is formed of\nrelatively metal-rich stars that have been vertically redistributed by the bar,\nwhereas the metal-poor stars have a more uniform, box-shaped distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 10:14:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

The\nadvancement of forensic tools and methodologies are much slower than the\ncurrent technology development in mobile cloud computing. Thus, forces the\navailable tools, and techniques become increasingly obsolete. Therefore, it\nopens up the door for the new forensic tools and techniques to cope up with\nrecent developments. Hence, this work presents a detailed survey of forensic\nmethodology and corresponding issues in a mobile device, cloud environment, and\nmobile cloud applications. It mainly focuses on digital forensic issues related\nto mobile cloud applications and also analyze the scope, challenges and\nopportunities. Finally, this work reviewed the forensic procedures of two cloud\nstorage services used for mobile cloud applications such as Dropbox and\nSkyDrive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 11:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-30"}

While there are we known solvers for\nsatisfiability of Boolean formulas in CNF form, these are designed primarily\nfor deciding satisfiability of the formula and do not address the problem of\nfinding all satisfying solutions. Moreover development of parallel solvers for\nsatisfiability problems is still an unfinished problem of Computer Science. The\nsolver proposed in this paper is aimed at representing all solutions of Boolean\nformulas even without the CNF form with a parallel algorithm. Algorithm\nproposed is applied to Boolean functions in algebraic normal form (ANF). The\nalgorithm is based on the idea to represent the satisfying assignments in terms\nof a complete set of implicants of the Boolean functions appearing as factors\nof a Boolean formula. The algorithm is effective mainly in the case when the\nfactors of the formula are sparse (i.e. have a small fraction of the total\nnumber of variables). This allows small computation of a complete set of\nimplicants of individual factors one at a time and reduce the formula at each\nstep. An algorithm is also proposed for finding a complete set of orthogonal\nimplicants of functions in ANF. An advantages of this algorithm is that all\nsolutions can be represented compactly in terms of implicants. Finally due to\nsmall and distributed computation at every step as well as computation in terms\nof independent threads, the solver proposed in this paper is expected to be\nuseful for developing heuristics for a well scalable parallel solver for large\nsize problems of Boolean satisfiability over large number of processors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 12:27:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 12:42:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2017 13:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-07"}

To form SMSs by accretion, central protostars must\naccrete at as high rates as ~ 0.1-1 M_sun/yr. Such protostars have very\nextended structures with bloated envelopes, like super-giant stars, and are\ncalled super-giant protostars (SGPSs). Under the assumption of hydrostatic\nequilibrium, SGPSs have density inverted layers, where the luminosity becomes\nlocally super-Eddington, near the surface. If the envelope matter is allowed to\nflow out, however, a stellar wind could be launched and hinder the accretion\ngrowth of SGPSs before reaching the supermassive regime. We examine whether\nradiation-driven winds are launched from SGPSs by constructing steady and\nspherically symmetric wind solutions. We find that the wind velocity does not\nreach the escape velocity in any case considered. This is because once the\ntemperature falls below ~ 10^4 K, the opacity plummet drastically owing to the\nrecombination of hydrogen and the acceleration ceases suddenly. This indicates\nthat, in realistic non-steady cases, even if outflows are launched from the\nsurface of SGPSs, they would fall back again. Such a \"wind\" does not result in\nnet mass loss and does not prevent the growth of SGPSs. In conclusion, SGPSs\nwill grow to SMSs and eventually collapse to massive BHs of ~ 10^5 M_sun, as\nlong as the rapid accretion is maintained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 12:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-30"}

Designing an associative memory requires\naddressing two main tasks: 1) learning phase: given a dataset, learn a concise\nrepresentation of the dataset in the form of a graphical model (or a neural\nnetwork), 2) recall phase: given a noisy version of a message vector from the\ndataset, output the correct message vector via a neurally feasible algorithm\nover the network learnt during the learning phase. This paper studies the\nproblem of designing a class of neural associative memories which learns a\nnetwork representation for a large dataset that ensures correction against a\nlarge number of adversarial errors during the recall phase.

When the black hole absorbs the particle, the charge on it\nchanges owing to the conserved quantities of the particle. Changes in the black\nhole are constrained to the equation for the motion of the particle and are\nconsistent with the laws of thermodynamics. Particle absorption increases the\nmass of the Kerr-Sen black hole to more than that of the absorbed charges such\nas angular momentum and electric charge; hence, the black hole cannot be\novercharged.

A problem with these\nmeasures is that they reflect actual usage at most indirectly. Indeed, analytic\ncompanies have suggested that retention rates, i.e., the number of days users\ncontinue to interact with an installed app are low. We conduct the first\nindependent and large-scale study of retention rates and usage behavior trends\nin the wild. We study their impact on a large-scale database of app-usage data\nfrom a community of 339,842 users and more than 213,667 apps. Our analysis\nshows that, on average, applications lose 70% of their users in the first week,\nwhile very popular applications (top 100) lose only 45%. It also reveals,\nhowever, that many applications have more complex usage behavior patterns due\nto seasonality, marketing, or other factors. To capture such effects, we\ndevelop a novel app-usage behavior trend measure which provides instantaneous\ninformation about the \"hotness\" of an application. We identify typical trends\nin app popularity and classify applications into archetypes. From these, we can\ndistinguish, for instance, trendsetters from copycat apps. In our results,\nroughly 40% of all apps never gain more than a handful of users. Less than 0.4%\nof the remaining 60% are constantly popular, 1% flop after an initial steep\nrise, and 7% continuously rise in popularity. We conclude by demonstrating that\nusage behavior trend information can be used to develop better mobile app\nrecommendations. With the proposed usage-based measures (retention and trend),\nwe are able to shift sovereignty in app recommendations back to where it really\nmatters: actual usage statistics, in contrast to download count and user\nratings which are prone to manipulation by people.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 11:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-01"}

In\nthis work, we propose an analytical-based KZM that can accurately predict\ntopological defect generation for a given quenching condition.

In this paper, the processes that limit the\nobtainable resolution in both energy and direction in charged-current neutrino\nevents in the ORCA detector are investigated. These processes include the\ncomposition of the hadronic fragmentation products, the subsequent particle\npropagation and the photon-sampling fraction of the detector. GEANT simulations\nof neutrino interactions in seawater produced by GENIE are used to study the\neffects in the 1 - 20 GeV range. It is found that fluctuations in the hadronic\ncascade in conjunction with the variation of the inelasticity y are most\ndetrimental to the resolutions. The effect of limited photon sampling in the\ndetector is of significantly less importance. These results will therefore also\nbe applicable to similar detectors/media, such as those in ice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 10:06:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 May 2017 12:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-22"}

One conclusion one can\ndraw from centrality measures is that the node with the highest centrality is\nlikely to be the node that is determined most by its neighboring nodes.\nHowever, centrality is a relative measure: knowing that a node is highly\ncentral gives no information about the extent to which it is determined by its\nneighbors. Here we provide an absolute measure of determination (or\ncontrollability) of a node - its predictability. We introduce predictability,\nestimate the predictability of all nodes in 18 prior empirical network papers\non psychopathology, and statistically relate it to centrality.\n  Methods We carried out a literature review and collected 25 datasets from 18\npublished papers in the field (several mood and anxiety disorders, substance\nabuse, psychosis, autism, and transdiagnostic data). We fit state-of-the-art\nnet- work models to all datasets, and computed the predictability of all nodes.\n  Results Predictability was unrelated to sample size, moderately high in most\nsymptom networks, and differed considerable both within and between datasets.\nPredictability was higher in community than clinical samples, highest for mood\nand anxiety disorders, and lowest for psychosis.\n  Conclusions Predictability is an important additional characterization of\nsymptom networks because it gives an absolute measure of the controllability of\neach node. It allows conclusions about how self-determined a symptom network\nis, and may help to inform intervention strategies. Limitations of\npredictability along with future directions are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Nov 2016 23:05:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2017 08:32:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-21"}

So, besides courses presenting these\nexamples and also some courses in various forms of proofs (propositional\ncalculus, first order predicate calculus, set theory), I decided to study the\nwork of professional mathematicians, thinking that it could be good examples\nfor students. Among the works I already studied and reconstructed are the\ntheorem of Zermelo, the theorem of Cantor-Bernstein, the planar graph theorem\nof Kuratowski, the topological proof of the infinity of primes of Furstenberg,\nthe intermediate value theorem of Bolzano, the Archimedean property of the set\nof Real numbers, and others.

The fundamental concept of ABE is closer to the\nmentality of expert estimation but with an automated procedure in which the\nfinal estimate is generated by reusing similar historical projects. The main\nkey issue when using ABE is how to adapt the effort of the retrieved nearest\nneighbors. The adaptation process is an essential part of ABE to generate more\nsuccessful accurate estimation based on tuning the selected raw solutions,\nusing some adaptation strategy. In this study we show that there are three\ninterrelated decision variables that have great impact on the success of\nadaptation method: (1) number of nearest analogies (k), (2) optimum feature set\nneeded for adaptation, and (3) adaptation weights. To find the right decision\nregarding these variables, one need to study all possible combinations and\nevaluate them individually to select the one that can improve all prediction\nevaluation measures. The existing evaluation measures usually behave\ndifferently, presenting sometimes opposite trends in evaluating prediction\nmethods. This means that changing one decision variable could improve one\nevaluation measure while it is decreasing the others. Therefore, the main theme\nof this research is how to come up with best decision variables that improve\nadaptation strategy and thus, the overall evaluation measures without degrading\nthe others. The impact of these decisions together has not been investigated\nbefore, therefore we propose to view the building of adaptation procedure as a\nmulti-objective optimization problem. The Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm\n(PSO) is utilized to find the optimum solutions for such decision variables\nbased on optimizing multiple evaluation measures\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Nov 2016 15:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-09"}
