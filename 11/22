The\nsatisfaction of voters comes from the final decisions made by the elected\ncommittee. Our results suggest that depending on a decision system used by the\ncommittee to make these final decisions, different multi-winner election rules\nare most suitable for electing the committee.

The\nbackbone of the proposed method is the Incremental Mixture Importance Sampling\n(IMIS) algorithm of Raftery and Bao (2010), which builds a mixture importance\ndistribution incrementally, by positioning new mixture components where the\nimportance density lacks mass, relative to the target. The key innovation\nproposed here is that the mixture components used by IMIS are local\napproximations to the target density.

Assuming 40\\% mass\nscatter and adding a prior on the Hubble constant we can achieve a constraint\non the CPL parametrization of the dark energy equation of state parameters\n$w_0$ and $w_a$ with 100 clusters in the same redshift range: $\\sigma_{w_0} =\n0.191 $ and $\\sigma_{w_a} = 2.712$. Dropping the assumption of flatness and\nassuming $w=-1$ we also attain competitive constraints on the matter and dark\nenergy density parameters: $\\sigma_{\\Omega_M} = 0.101$ and\n$\\sigma_{\\Omega_{\\Lambda}} = 0.197$ for 100 clusters uniformly distributed in\nthe range $ 0 \\leq z \\leq 0.8$ after applying a prior on the Hubble constant.\nWe also discuss various observational strategies for tightening constraints in\nboth the near and far future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 16:30:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2017 16:52:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-09"}

In this thesis, we explore a method to drive rotation in\nlarge tokamaks: up-down asymmetry in the magnetic equilibrium. We seek to\nmaximise this rotation by finding optimal up-down asymmetric flux surface\nshapes.\n  First, we use the ideal MHD model to show that low order external shaping\n(e.g. elongation) is best for creating up-down asymmetric flux surfaces\nthroughout the device. Then, we calculate realistic up-down asymmetric\nequilibria for input into nonlinear gyrokinetic turbulence analysis. Analytic\ngyrokinetics shows that, in the limit of fast shaping effects, a poloidal tilt\nof the flux surface shaping has little effect on turbulent transport. Since\nup-down symmetric surfaces do not transport momentum, this invariance to tilt\nimplies that devices with mirror symmetry about any line in the poloidal plane\nwill drive minimal rotation. Accordingly, further analytic investigation\nsuggests that non-mirror symmetric flux surfaces with envelopes created by the\nbeating of fast shaping effects may create significantly stronger momentum\ntransport.\n  Guided by these analytic results, we carry out local nonlinear gyrokinetic\nsimulations of non-mirror symmetric flux surfaces created with the lowest\npossible shaping effects. First, we consider tilted elliptical flux surfaces\nwith a Shafranov shift and find little increase in the momentum transport when\nthe effect of the pressure profile on the equilibrium is included. We then\nsimulate flux surfaces with independently-tilted elongation and triangularity.\nThese two-mode configurations show a $60\\%$ increase over configurations with\njust elongation or triangularity.

Spectral sparsifiers generalize cut sparsifiers, and have\nfound many applications in designing graph algorithms. In recent years, there\nhas been interest in computing spectral sparsifiers in semi-streaming and\ndynamic settings. Natural algorithms in these settings often involve repeated\nsparsification of a graph, and accumulation of errors across these steps. We\npresent a framework for analyzing algorithms that perform repeated\nsparsifications that only incur error corresponding to a single sparsification\nstep, leading to better results for many resparsification-based algorithms. As\nan application, we show how to maintain a spectral sparsifier in the\nsemi-streaming setting: We present a simple algorithm that, for a graph $G$ on\n$n$ vertices and $m$ edges, computes a spectral sparsifier of $G$ with $O(n\n\\log n)$ edges in a single pass over $G$, using only $O(n \\log n)$ space, and\n$O(m \\log^2 n)$ total time. This improves on previous best semi-streaming\nalgorithms for both spectral and cut sparsifiers by a factor of $\\log{n}$ in\nboth space and runtime. The algorithm extends to semi-streaming row sampling\nfor general PSD matrices.

The root cause of this attack is that Intel SGX\ndoes not clear the branch history when switching from enclave mode to\nnon-enclave mode, leaving the fine-grained traces to the outside world through\na branch-prediction side channel. However, exploiting the channel is not so\nstraightforward in practice because 1) measuring branch\nprediction/misprediction penalties based on timing is too inaccurate to\ndistinguish fine-grained control-flow changes and 2) it requires sophisticated\ncontrol over the enclave execution to force its execution to the interesting\ncode blocks. To overcome these challenges, we developed two novel exploitation\ntechniques: 1) Intel PT- and LBR-based history-inferring techniques and 2)\nAPIC-based technique to control the execution of enclave programs in a\nfine-grained manner. As a result, we could demonstrate our attack by breaking\nrecent security constructs, including ORAM schemes, Sanctum, SGX-Shield, and\nT-SGX.

The precision of these models is limited by our\nlack of understanding of various internal mixing processes that significantly\ninfluence the lifetime of these objects (e.g. core overshoot, chemical mixing,\nor the internal differential rotation). Our goal is to calibrate models by\nextending the sample of available seismic studies of slowly pulsating B (SPB)\nstars, providing input for theoretical modelling efforts that will deliver\nprecise constraints on the parameters describing the internal mixing processes\nin these objects. We used spectral synthesis and disentangling techniques to\nderive fundamental parameters and to determine precise orbital parameters from\nhigh-resolution spectra. We employed custom masks to construct light curves\nfrom the Kepler pixel data and used standard time-series analysis tools to\nconstruct a set of significant frequencies for each target.

We detect gravity mode period series of modes of the same\ndegree l with consecutive radial order n in four new and one revisited SPB\nstar.

Managing the VMs involves a sophisticated\ntrade-off between cloud-related demands, which are expressed by the provisional\ncosts of leased cloud resources, and exogenous cost demands expressed by\nservice revenues that are typically bound to SLAs. The internal costs may\ninclude VM deployment/termination cost, and VM lease cost. The exogenous costs\nrefer to rewards accumulated due to the successfully accomplished tasks being\nrun by each application instance. In the case where the SLA restricts\nperformance to a certain load level at each VM, tasks incoming at VMs that\nreached that level are rejected. Rejections cause fines deducted against the\nrewards.

Lack of a direct probe has\nhampered its study. The first phase of Square Kilometre Array (SKA-I), will\nhave more than an order of magnitude higher sensitivity than existing radio\ntelescopes. In this contribution, we discuss specific science cases that are of\ninterest to the Indian community concerned with astrophysical turbulence and\nmagnetic fields. The SKA-I will allow observations of a large number of\nbackground sources with detectable polarisation and measure their Faraday\ndepths (FDs) through the Milky Way, other galaxies and their circum-galactic\nmedium. This will probe line-of-sight magnetic fields in these objects well and\nprovide field configurations. Detailed comparison of observational data with\nmodels which consider various processes giving rise to field amplification and\nmaintenance will then be possible. Such observations will also provide the\ncoherence scale of the fields and measure its random component. Measuring the\nrandom component is important to characterise turbulence in the medium.\nObservations of FDs with redshift will provide important information on\nmagnetic field evolution as a function of redshift. The background sources\ncould also be used to probe magnetic fields and its coherent scale in galaxy\nclusters and in bridges formed between interacting galaxies. Other than FDs,\nsensitive observations of synchrotron emission from galaxies will provide\ncomplimentary information on their magnetic field strengths in the sky plane.\nThe core shift measurements of AGNs can provide more precise measurements of\nmagnetic field very close (<pc) to the black hole and its evolution. The low\nband of SKA-I will also be useful to study circularly polarized emission from\nSun and comparing various models of field configurations with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 19:35:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-21"}

The aim and purpose of this\nstudy is fourfold: (i) To achieve consensus in general on definitions and\nprinciples when trying to establish an invariant theory for modelling\nconstitutive structures and dynamic processes in mechanics, where special focus\nis put on the principle of Material Frame-Indifference (MFI). (ii) To show that\nin constitutive modelling MFI can only be regarded as an approximation that\nneeds to be reduced to a weaker statement when trying to advance it to an axiom\nof nature. (iii) To convince that in dynamical modelling, as in turbulence, MFI\nmay not be utilized as a modelling guideline, not even in an approximative\nsense. Instead, its reduced form has to be supplemented by a second,\nindependent axiom that includes the microscopic (fluctuating) description of\nthe dynamical processes. Concerning Navier-Stokes turbulence, the axiom of\nTurbulent Frame-Indifference (TFI) is stated in which turbulence has to be\nmodelled consistently with the invariant properties of the deterministic\nNavier-Stokes equations, and finally (iv) to propose a novel invariant\nmodelling ansatz both for constitutive and dynamical modelling that allows to\ninclude the (mean) velocity field as an own independent modelling variable,\nhowever, not in an absolute but only in the relative sense as a velocity\ndifference; a result that would systematically improve current modelling\nprocedures in extended thermodynamics and turbulence theory to be more\nconsistent with physical observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 20:42:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-22"}

In this paper, a novel\nproactive spectrum hand protocol based on the Greedy Channel Selection (GCS) is\nproposed which avoids collision between secondary users, as well as, collision\nbetween primary and secondary users. In the proposed scheme, proactive spectrum\nhandoff is based on the SRV (Single Rendezvous) coordination scheme; therefore,\nthe secondary users perform proactive spectrum handoff without using the common\ncontrol channel. Moreover, the channel selection is distributed which leads to\nthe higher throughput, and lower average service time.

In its\nmodern form, scalar gravity appears as the low-energy effective field theory of\nthe spontaneous breaking of conformal symmetry within a CFT, and is AdS/CFT\ndual to the original Randall-Sundrum I model, but without a UV brane. Scalar\ngravity faithfully exhibits several qualitative features of the cosmological\nconstant problem of standard gravity coupled to quantum matter, and the\nWeinberg no-go theorem can be extended to this case as well. Remarkably, a\nsolution to the scalar gravity cosmological constant problem has been proposed,\nwhere the key is a very small violation of the scalar equivalence principle,\nwhich can be elegantly formulated as a particular type of deformation of the\nCFT. In the dual AdS picture this involves implementing Goldberger-Wise radion\nstabilization where the Goldberger-Wise field is a pseudo-Nambu Goldstone\nboson. In quantum gravity however, global symmetries protecting pNGBs are not\nexpected to be fundamental. We provide a natural six-dimensional gauge theory\norigin for this global symmetry and show that the violation of the equivalence\nprinciple and the size of the vacuum energy seen by scalar gravity can\nnaturally be exponentially small. Our solution may be of interest for study of\nnon-supersymmetric CFTs in the spontaneously broken phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 21:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-13"}

A proxy for the spin parameter\n($\\lambda_{R_e}$) and ellipticity ($\\epsilon_e$) are used to separate fast and\nslow rotators; there exists a good correspondence to regular and non-regular\nrotators, respectively, as also seen in earlier studies.

This enables us\nto investigate how the population of these objects was built up over cosmic\ntime. We find that the evolution of the number density depends on the galaxy\nmean surface stellar mass density, Sigma. In particular, dense (Sigma > 2000\nM_sun pc^-2) MPGs show a constant comoving number density over this redshift\nrange, whilst this increases by a factor ~ 4 for the least dense objects,\ndefined as having Sigma < 1000 M_sun pc^-2. We estimate stellar ages for the\nMPG population both fitting the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) and through\nthe D4000_n index, obtaining results in good agreement. Our findings are\nconsistent with passive ageing of the stellar content of dense MPGs. We show\nthat at any redshift the less dense MPGs are younger than dense ones and that\ntheir stellar populations evolve at a slower rate than predicted by passive\nevolution. This points to a scenario in which the overall population of MPGs\nwas built up over the cosmic time by continuous addition of less dense\ngalaxies: on top of an initial population of dense objects that passively\nevolves, new, larger, and younger MPGs continuously join the population at\nlater epochs. Finally, we demonstrate that the observed increase in the number\ndensity of MPGs is totally accounted for by the observed decrease in the number\ndensity of correspondingly massive star forming galaxies (i.e. all the\nnon-passive M > 10^11 M_sun objects). Such systems observed at z ~ 1 in VIPERS,\ntherefore, represent the most plausible progenitors of the subsequent emerging\nclass of larger MPGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 21:00:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-10-25"}

We find\nthat more massive galaxies tend to reside in higher-density environments over\nthe full redshift range explored. Defining star-forming and passive galaxies\nthrough their (NUV$-r$) vs ($r-K$) colours, we then quantify the fraction of\nstar-forming over passive galaxies, $f_{\\rm ap}$, as a function of environment\nat fixed stellar mass. $f_{\\rm ap}$ is higher in low-density regions for\ngalaxies with masses ranging from $\\log(\\mathcal{M}/\\mathcal{M}_\\odot)=10.38$\n(the lowest value explored) to at least\n$\\log(\\mathcal{M}/\\mathcal{M}_\\odot)\\sim11.3$, although with decreasing\nsignificance going from lower to higher masses.

Once again, Phaethon brightened by\n$\\sim$2 mag soon after its perihelion passage, contradicting expectations from\nthe phase function of a macroscopic monolithic body. Subsequently, a short\nantisolar tail of $\\sim$0{\\deg}.1 in length was formed within $\\sim$1 day and\nquickly disappeared. No trail was seen. Our syndyne-synchrone analysis\nindicates that the tail was comprised of submicron to micron particles and can\nbe approximated by a synchrone coinciding with the outburst. We estimate that\nthe outburst has released a mass of $\\sim$10$^{4}$--10$^{5}$ kg, comparable to\nthe two mass ejections in 2009 and 2012, and that the average mass-loss rate is\n$\\sim$0.1--1 kg s$^{-1}$.

Without the forward-scattering\nenhancement, detecting such activity at side-scattering phase angles is very\ndifficult. The forward-scattering effect also reinforces that the ejected dust\ngrains rather than gas emissions were responsible for the activity of Phaethon.\nDespite Phaethon's reactivation, it is highly unlikely that the Geminid\nmeteoroid stream can be sustained by similar perihelion mass-loss events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 21:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-28"}

Model-based techniques are more\ndata-efficient, but need to acquire explicit knowledge about the environment.\n  In this paper, we take a step towards using model-based techniques in\nenvironments with a high-dimensional visual state space by demonstrating that\nit is possible to learn system dynamics and the reward structure jointly. Our\ncontribution is to extend a recently developed deep neural network for video\nframe prediction in Atari games to enable reward prediction as well. To this\nend, we phrase a joint optimization problem for minimizing both video frame and\nreward reconstruction loss, and adapt network parameters accordingly. Empirical\nevaluations on five Atari games demonstrate accurate cumulative reward\nprediction of up to 200 frames. We consider these results as opening up\nimportant directions for model-based reinforcement learning in complex,\ninitially unknown environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 22:06:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 09:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-18"}

The\nbenefits of a common programming standard are clear; multiple vendors can\nprovide support for application descriptions written according to the standard,\nthus reducing the program porting effort. While the standard brings the obvious\nbenefits of platform portability, the performance portability aspects are\nlargely left to the programmer. The situation is made worse due to multiple\nproprietary vendor implementations with different characteristics, and, thus,\nrequired optimization strategies.\n  In this paper, we propose an OpenCL implementation that is both portable and\nperformance portable. At its core is a kernel compiler that can be used to\nexploit the data parallelism of OpenCL programs on multiple platforms with\ndifferent parallel hardware styles. The kernel compiler is modularized to\nperform target-independent parallel region formation separately from the\ntarget-specific parallel mapping of the regions to enable support for various\nstyles of fine-grained parallel resources such as subword SIMD extensions, SIMD\ndatapaths and static multi-issue. Unlike previous similar techniques that work\non the source level, the parallel region formation retains the information of\nthe data parallelism using the LLVM IR and its metadata infrastructure. This\ndata can be exploited by the later generic compiler passes for efficient\nparallelization.\n  The proposed open source implementation of OpenCL is also platform portable,\nenabling OpenCL on a wide range of architectures, both already commercialized\nand on those that are still under research. The paper describes how the\nportability of the implementation is achieved. Our results show that most of\nthe benchmarked applications when compiled using pocl were faster or close to\nas fast as the best proprietary OpenCL implementation for the platform at hand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 22:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

We present the results of a multi-year monitoring campaign of the\nGalactic Center (GC) with the MAGIC telescopes. These observations were\nprimarily motivated by reports that a putative gas cloud (G2) would be passing\nin close proximity to the super-massive black hole (SMBH), associated with\nSagittarius A*, located at the center of our galaxy. This event was expected to\ngive astronomers a unique chance to study the effect of in-falling matter on\nthe broad-band emission of a SMBH.\n  Aims. We search for potential flaring emission of very-high-energy (VHE;\n$\\geq$100 GeV) gamma rays from the direction of the SMBH at the GC due to the\npassage of the G2 object. Using these data we also study the morphology of this\ncomplex region.\n  Methods. We observed the GC region with the MAGIC Imaging Atmospheric\nCherenkov Telescopes during the period 2012-2015, collecting 67 hours of\ngood-quality data. In addition to a search for variability in the flux and\nspectral shape of the GC gamma-ray source, we use a point-source subtraction\ntechnique to remove the known gamma-ray emitters located around the GC in order\nto reveal the TeV morphology of the extended emission inside that region.\n  Results. No effect of the G2 object on the VHE gamma-ray emission from the GC\nwas detected during the 4 year observation campaign. We confirm previous\nmeasurements of the VHE spectrum of Sagittarius A*, and do not detect any\nsignificant variability of the emission from the source. Furthermore, the known\nVHE gamma-ray emitter at the location of the supernova remnant G0.9+0.1 was\ndetected, as well as the recently discovered VHE source close to the GG radio\nArc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Nov 2016 23:13:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-09"}

Originally proposed to occur in quantum wells in high\nmagnetic fields, experimental systems thought to harbor nonabelian anyons range\nfrom p-wave superfluids to superconducting systems with strong spin orbit\ncoupling. However, all of these systems are characterized by small energy gaps,\nand despite several decades of experimental work, definitive evidence for\nnonabelian anyons remains elusive. Here, we report the observation of arobust,\nincompressible even-denominator fractional quantum Hall phase in a new\ngeneration of dual-gated, hexagonal boron nitride encapsulated bilayer graphene\nsamples. Numerical simulations suggest that this state is in the Pfaffian phase\nand hosts nonabelian anyons, and the measured energy gaps are several times\nlarger than those observed in other systems. Moreover, the unique electronic\nstructure of bilayer graphene endows the electron system with two new control\nparameters. Magnetic field continuously tunes the effective electron\ninteractions, changing the even-denominator gap non-monotonically and\nconsistent with predictions that a transition between the Pfaffian phase and\nthe composite Fermi liquid (CFL) occurs just beyond the experimentally explored\nmagnetic field range.

By directly measuring the valley polarization, we\nobserve a continuous transition from an incompressible to a compressible phase\nat half-filling mediated by an unexpected incompressible, yet polarizable,\nintermediate phase.

It is a natural generalization of\nthe particle in a box, a canonical example of quantum mechanics, and we present\nanalytic and numerical investigations on this problem. After deriving an exact\nVolterra-type integral equation, composed of an infinite sum of modes, we show\nthat approximate formulas with the lowest-frequency modes correctly capture the\nqualitative behavior of the wave function. If we take into account hundreds of\nmodes, our numerical calculation shows that the quantum adiabatic theorem\nactually gives a very good approximation even if the barrier height diverges\nwithin finite time, as long as it is sufficiently longer than the\ncharacteristic time scale of the particle. In particular, if the barrier is\nslowly inserted at an asymmetric position, the particle is localized by the\ninsertion itself, in accordance with a prediction of the adiabatic theorem. On\nthe other hand, when the barrier is inserted quickly, the wave function becomes\nrugged after the insertion because of the energy transfer to the particle.\nRegardless of the position of the barrier, the fast insertion leaves the\nparticle unlocalized so that we can obtain meaningful information by a\nwhich-side measurement. Our numerical procedure provides a precise way to\ncalculate the wave function throughout the process, from which one can estimate\nthe amount of this information for an arbitrary insertion protocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 02:27:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

We demonstrate that this bound results\nin limits to the density-dependent symmetry energy, which is the difference\nbetween the energies of symmetric nuclear matter and PNM. In particular, this\nbound leads to a lower limit to the volume symmetry energy parameter $S_0$. In\naddition, for assumed values of $S_0$ above this minimum, this bound implies\nboth upper and lower limits to the symmetry energy slope parameter $L$, which\ndescribes the lowest-order density dependence of the symmetry energy. A lower\nbound on the neutron-matter incompressibility is also obtained. These bounds\nare found to be consistent with both recent calculations of the energies of PNM\nand constraints from nuclear experiments. Our results are significant because\nseveral equations of state that are currently used in astrophysical simulations\nof supernovae and neutron star mergers, as well as in nuclear physics\nsimulations of heavy-ion collisions, have symmetry energy parameters that\nviolate these bounds.

However,\nthe formation of the corona is still debated. Liu et al. investigated the\nspectrum of the corona heated by the reconnection of the magnetic field\ngenerated by dynamo action in the thin disk and emerging into the corona as a\nresult of buoyancy instability. In the present paper, we improve this model to\ninterpret the observed relation of the hard X-ray spectrum becoming softer at\nhigher accretion rate in luminous AGNs. The magnetic field is characterized by\n$\\beta_{\\rm 0}$, i.e., the ratio of the sum of gas pressure and radiation\npressure to magnetic pressure in the disk ($\\beta_{\\rm 0}=(P_{\\rm g,d}+P_{\\rm\nr,d})/P_{\\rm B}$). Besides, both the intrinsic disk photons and reprocessed\nphotons by the disk are included as the seed photons for inverse Compton\nscattering. These improvements are crucial for investigating the effect of\nmagnetic field on the accretion disk-corona when it is not clear whether the\nradiation pressure or gas pressure dominates in thin disk. We change the value\nof $\\beta_{\\rm 0}$ in order to constrain the magnetic field in the accretion\ndisk. We find that the energy fraction released in the corona ($f$) gradually\nincreases with the decrease of $\\beta_{\\rm 0}$ for the same accretion rate.\nWhen $\\beta_{\\rm 0}$ decreases to less than 50, the structure and spectrum of\nthe disk-corona is independent on accretion rate, which is similar to the hard\nspectrum found in Liu et al.(2003). Comparing with the observational results of\nthe hard X-ray bolometric correction factor in a sample of luminous AGNs, we\nsuggest that the value of $\\beta_{\\rm 0}$ is about 100-200 for $\\alpha=0.3$ and\nthe energy fraction $f$ should be larger than $30\\%$ for hard X-ray emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 05:46:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-12-14"}

An attacker, knowing\nthe defender's strategy, chooses which target to attack and for how long. If\nthe attacker spends time $t$ at a target $i$ of value $\\alpha_i$, and if he\nleaves before the defender visits the target, his utility is $t \\cdot \\alpha_i\n$; if the defender visits before he leaves, his utility is 0. The defender's\ngoal is to minimize the attacker's utility. The defender's strategy consists of\na schedule for visiting the targets; it takes her unit time to switch between\ntargets. Such games are a simplified model of a number of real-world scenarios\nsuch as protecting computer networks from intruders, crops from thieves, etc.\n  We show that optimal defender play for this continuous time security games\nreduces to the solution of a combinatorial question regarding the existence of\ninfinite sequences over a finite alphabet, with the following properties for\neach symbol $i$: (1) $i$ constitutes a prescribed fraction $p_i$ of the\nsequence.

Learning representations of words is a pioneering study\nin this school of research. However, paragraph (or sentence and document)\nembedding learning is more suitable/reasonable for some tasks, such as\nsentiment classification and document summarization. Nevertheless, as far as we\nare aware, there is relatively less work focusing on the development of\nunsupervised paragraph embedding methods. Classic paragraph embedding methods\ninfer the representation of a given paragraph by considering all of the words\noccurring in the paragraph. Consequently, those stop or function words that\noccur frequently may mislead the embedding learning process to produce a misty\nparagraph representation. Motivated by these observations, our major\ncontributions in this paper are twofold. First, we propose a novel unsupervised\nparagraph embedding method, named the essence vector (EV) model, which aims at\nnot only distilling the most representative information from a paragraph but\nalso excluding the general background information to produce a more informative\nlow-dimensional vector representation for the paragraph. Second, in view of the\nincreasing importance of spoken content processing, an extension of the EV\nmodel, named the denoising essence vector (D-EV) model, is proposed. The D-EV\nmodel not only inherits the advantages of the EV model but also can infer a\nmore robust representation for a given spoken paragraph against imperfect\nspeech recognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 09:11:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

Such context has been shown to\nfacilitate detection by constraining the locations to search. But can context\ndirectly benefit object detection? To do so, context needs to be learned\nindependently from target features. This is impossible in traditional object\ndetection where classifiers are trained on images containing both target\nfeatures and surrounding context. In contrast, humans can learn context and\ntarget features separately, such as when we see highways without cars. Here we\nshow for the first time that human-derived scene expectations can be used to\nimprove object detection performance in machines. To measure contextual\nexpectations, we asked human subjects to indicate the scale, location and\nlikelihood at which cars or people might occur in scenes without these objects.\nHumans showed highly systematic expectations that we could accurately predict\nusing scene features. This allowed us to predict human expectations on novel\nscenes without requiring manual annotation. On augmenting deep neural networks\nwith predicted human expectations, we obtained substantial gains in accuracy\nfor detecting cars and people (1-3%) as well as on detecting associated objects\n(3-20%). In contrast, augmenting deep networks with other conventional features\nyielded far smaller gains. This improvement was due to relatively poor matches\nat highly likely locations being correctly labelled as target and conversely\nstrong matches at unlikely locations being correctly rejected as false alarms.\nTaken together, our results show that augmenting deep neural networks with\nhuman-derived context features improves their performance, suggesting that\nhumans learn scene context separately unlike deep networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 09:45:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2017 09:17:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 Oct 2017 06:33:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 29 Mar 2018 00:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-03-30"}

The counted nodes are\nmemory-limited anonymous devices (called agents) communicating asynchronously\nin pairs (according to a fairness condition). Moreover, we assume that these\nagents are prone to failures so that they cannot be correctly initialized. This\nstudy considers two classical fairness conditions, and for each we investigate\nthe issue of time optimality of counting given the optimal space per agent. In\nthe case of randomly interacting agents (probabilistic fairness), as usual, the\nconvergence time is measured in terms of parallel time (or parallel\ninteractions), which is defined as the number of pairwise interactions until\nconvergence, divided by n (the number of agents). In case of weak fairness,\nwhere it is only required that every pair of agents interacts infinitely often,\nthe convergence time is defined in terms of non-null transitions, i.e, the\ntransitions that affect the states of the interacting agents.First, assuming\nprobabilistic fairness, we present a \"non-guessing\" time optimal protocol of\nO(n log n) expected time given an optimal space of only one bit, and we prove\nthe time optimality of this protocol. Then, for weak fairness, we show that a\nspace optimal (semi-uniform) solution cannot converge faster than in\n$\\Omega$(2^n) time (non-null transitions). This result, together with the time\ncomplexity analysis of an already known space optimal protocol, shows that it\nis also optimal in time (given the optimal space constrains).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 10:35:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

The Crewther relation, which\nwas originally derived for conformal theory, provides a remarkable connection\nbetween two observables when the $\\beta$ function vanishes. The \"Generalized\nCrewther Relation\" relates these two observables for physical QCD with nonzero\n$\\beta$ function; specifically, it connects the non-singlet Adler function\n($D^{\\rm ns}$) to the Bjorken sum rule coefficient for polarized deep-inelastic\nelectron scattering ($C_{\\rm Bjp}$) at leading twist.

The magnetic star HD148937 is the only Galactic Of?p star surrounded by\na nebula. The structure of this nebula is particularly complex and is composed,\nfrom the center out outwards, of a close bipolar ejecta nebula (NGC6164/5), an\nellipsoidal wind-blown shell, and a spherically symmetric Stromgren sphere. The\nexact formation process of this nebula and its precise relation to the star's\nevolution remain unknown. Methods. We analyzed infrared Spitzer IRS and\nfar-infrared Herschel/PACS observations of the NGC6164/5 nebula. The Herschel\nimaging allowed us to constrain the global morphology of the nebula. We also\ncombined the infrared spectra with optical spectra of the central star to\nconstrain its evolutionary status. We used these data to derive the abundances\nin the ejected material. To relate this information to the evolutionary status\nof the star, we also determined the fundamental parameters of HD148937 using\nthe CMFGEN atmosphere code. Results. The H$\\alpha$ image displays a bipolar or\n\"8\"-shaped ionized nebula, whilst the infrared images show dust to be more\nconcentrated around the central object. We determine nebular abundance ratios\nof N/O = 1.06 close to the star, and N/O = 1.54 in the bright lobe constituting\nNGC6164.

Although the interactions of\n{\\alpha}-toc with non-oxidized lipid bilayers have been studied, their on\noxidized bilayers remain unknown. In this study, atomistic molecular dynamics\n(MD) simulations of oxidized lipid bilayers were performed with varying\nconcentrations of {\\alpha}-toc. Bilayers with\n1-palmitoyl-2-lauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PLPC) lipids and its\naldehyde derivatives at 1:1 ratio were studied. Our simulations show that\noxidized lipids self-assemble into aggregates with a water pore rapidly\ndeveloping across the lipid bilayer. The free energy of transporting an\n{\\alpha}-toc molecule in a lipid bilayer suggests that {\\alpha}-tocs can\npassively adsorb into the bilayer.

For example, we are far more precise when\ndiscriminating two similar orange stimuli than two similar green stimuli. In\norder for two colors to be perceived as different, the neurons representing\nchromatic information must respond differently, and the difference must be\nlarger than the trial-to-trial variability of the response to each separate\ncolor. Photoreceptors constitute the first stage in the processing of color\ninformation; many more stages are required before humans can consciously report\nwhether two stimuli are perceived as chromatically distinguishable or not.\nTherefore, although photoreceptor absorption curves are expected to influence\nthe accuracy of conscious discriminability, there is no reason to believe that\nthey should suffice to explain it. Here we develop information-theoretical\ntools based on the Fisher metric that demonstrate that photoreceptor absorption\nproperties explain ~87% of the variance of human color discrimination ability,\nas tested by previous behavioral experiments. In the context of this theory,\nthe bottleneck in chromatic information processing is determined by\nphotoreceptor absorption characteristics.

In addition\nto the breaking of $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, separate spin or orbital rotation\nsymmetry is broken to the maximal sub-group, $SO(3)_S\\times SO(3)_L\\rightarrow\nSO(3)_J$. The Fermions acquire mass, $m_F\\equiv\\Delta$, where $\\Delta$ is the\nBCS gap. There are also 18 Bosonic excitations - 4 Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes\nand 14 massive amplitude Higgs (AH) modes. The Bosonic modes are labelled by\nthe total angular momentum, $J\\in\\{0,1,2\\}$, and parity under particle-hole\nsymmetry, $C=\\pm 1$. For each pair of angular momentum quantum numbers,\n$J,J_z$, there are two Bosonic partners with $C=\\pm 1$. Based this spectrum\nNambu proposed a sum rule connecting the Fermion and Boson masses for BCS type\ntheories, which for $^3$He-B is $M_{J^+}^2 + M_{J^-}^2 = 4m_F^2$ for each\nfamily of Bosonic modes labelled by $J$, where $M_{J^C}$ is the mass of the\nBosonic mode with quantum numbers $(J,C)$.

We analyse published grids of\ncore-hydrogen burning massive star models computed with metallicities\nappropriate for massive stars in the Milky Way, the LMC and the SMC, the very\nmetal poor dwarf galaxy I Zwicky 18, and for metal-free chemical composition.\nStellar models of all the investigated metallicities reach and exceed the\nEddington limit in their interior, aided by the opacity peaks of iron, helium\nand hydrogen, and consequently develop inflated envelopes. Envelope inflation\nleads to a redward bending of the zero-age main sequence and a broadening of\nthe main sequence band in the upper part of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We\nderive the limiting L/M-values as function of the stellar surface temperature\nabove which inflation occurs, and find them to be larger for lower metallicity.\nWhile Galactic models show inflation above ~29 Msun, the corresponding mass\nlimit for Population III stars is ~150 Msun. While the masses of the inflated\nenvelopes are generally small, we find that they can reach 1-100 Msun in models\nwith effective temperatures below ~8000 K, with higher masses reached by models\nof lower metallicity.

In the\nconventional model based on the Anderson principle, oxygen effects are\nconsidered as a property of the TM ion and only TM interactions are relevant.\nHere, we perform a systematic comparison between two approaches for spin\npolarization on oxygen in typical TM oxides.

We consider the full spin\nHamiltonian including oxygen sites, and also derive an effective model where\nthe spin polarization on oxygen renormalizes the exchange interactions between\nTM sites. Surprisingly, the exchange interactions in NiO depend on the magnetic\nstate if spin polarization on oxygen is neglected, resulting in non-Heisenberg\nbehavior.

Just the opposite, MnO behaves as a\nHeisenberg magnet when oxygen spin polarization is neglected, but shows strong\nnon-Heisenberg effects when spin polarization on oxygen is included.

Our aim is to start the process of\ncompiling an inventory of oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules toward the\nsolar-type Class 0 protostellar binary IRAS16293-2422 from an unbiased spectral\nsurvey with ALMA (PILS). Here we focus on the new detections of ethylene oxide\n(c-C$_2$H$_4$O), acetone (CH$_3$COCH$_3$), and propanal (C$_2$H$_5$CHO).\nMethods. With ALMA, we surveyed the spectral range from 329 to 363 GHz at\n0.5$\"$ (60 AU diameter) resolution. Using a simple model for the molecular\nemission in LTE, the excitation temperatures and column densities of each\nspecies were constrained. Results. We successfully detect propanal (44 lines),\nethylene oxide (20 lines) and acetone (186 lines) toward one component of the\nprotostellar binary, IRAS16293B. The high resolution maps demonstrate that the\nemission for all investigated species originates from the compact central\nregion close to the protostar. This, along with a derived common excitation\ntemperature of $\\sim$ 125 K, is consistent with a coexistence of these\nmolecules in the same gas. Conclusions. The observations mark the first\ndetections of acetone, propanal and ethylene oxide toward a low-mass protostar.\nThe relative abundance ratios of the two sets of isomers\n(CH$_3$COCH$_3$/C$_2$H$_5$CHO $\\sim$ 8 and CH$_3$CHO/c-C$_2$H$_4$O $\\sim$ 12)\nare comparable to previous observations toward high-mass protostars.
