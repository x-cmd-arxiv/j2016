In this paper, we consider a more flexible pricing model for\ninstance reservation, in which a customer can propose the time length and\nnumber of resources of her request, while in today's industry, customers can\nonly choose from several predefined reservation packages. Under this model, we\ndesign randomized mechanisms for customers coming online to optimize social\nwelfare and providers' revenue.\n  We first consider a simple case, where the requests from the customers do not\nvary too much in terms of both length and value density. We design a randomized\nmechanism that achieves a competitive ratio $\\frac{1}{42}$ for both\n\\emph{social welfare} and \\emph{revenue}, which is a improvement as there is\nusually no revenue guarantee in previous works such as\n\\cite{azar2015ec,wang2015selling}. This ratio can be improved up to\n$\\frac{1}{11}$ when we impose a realistic constraint on the maximum number of\nresources used by each request. On the hardness side, we show an upper bound\n$\\frac{1}{3}$ on competitive ratio for any randomized mechanism. We then extend\nour mechanism to the general case and achieve a competitive ratio\n$\\frac{1}{42\\log k\\log T}$ for both social welfare and revenue, where $T$ is\nthe ratio of the maximum request length to the minimum request length and $k$\nis the ratio of the maximum request value density to the minimum request value\ndensity.

Such a deficiency makes resulting scores unhelpful. This\npaper presents a practical framework, NCVS, that offers automatic and\ncontextual scoring mechanism to evaluate the severity of vulnerabilities for a\nparticular service. Specifically, for a given service S, NCVS first\nautomatically collects S contextual information including topology,\nconfigurations, vulnerabilities and their dependencies. Then, NCVS uses the\ncollected information to build a contextual dependency graph, named CDG, to\nmodel S context. Finally, NCVS scores and ranks all the vulnerabilities in S by\nanalyzing S context, such as what roles the vulnerabilities play in S, and how\ncritical they affect the functionality of S. NCVS is novel and useful, because\n1) context-based vulnerability scoring results are highly relevant and\nmeaningful for administrators to understand each vulnerability importance\nspecific to the target service; and 2) the workflow of NCVS does not need\ninstrumentation or modifications to any source code.

The proposed method is based on runtime analysis\nof system and library calls and memory access patterns of tasks running on the\ndatanodes (slaves). First, the primary datanode of a big data system creates a\nbehavior profile for every task it executes. A behavior profile includes (a)\ntrace of the system & library calls made, and (b) sequence representing the\nsizes of private and shared memory accesses made during task execution. Then,\nthe process behavior profile is shared with other replica datanodes that are\nscheduled to execute the same task on their copy of the same data. Next, these\nreplica datanodes verify their local tasks with the help of the information\nembedded in the received behavior profiles. This is realized in two steps: (i)\ncomparing the system & library calls metadata, and (ii) statistical matching of\nthe memory access patterns. Finally, datanodes share their observations for\nconsensus and report an intrusion to the namenode (master) if they find any\ndiscrepancy.

The algorithm\nuses a novel idea of physical behavior of chains along with the concept of\nvirtual force. Formation of non-linear barrier reduces the movement of the\nsensors needed as compared to linear barriers. Detailed simulation results are\npresented to show that the proposed algorithm achieves barrier coverage with\nless movement of sensors compared to other existing algorithms in the\nliterature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 16:34:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-23"}

Such a chemical inhomogeneity reveals the external origin of the\nmetal-poor gas fueling star formation, possibly indicating accretion from the\ncosmic web. This paper studies the kinematic properties of the ionized gas in\nthese galaxies. Most XMPs have rotation velocity around a few tens of km/s. The\nstar-forming regions appear to move coherently. The velocity is constant within\neach region, and the velocity dispersion sometimes increases within the\nstar-forming clump towards the galaxy midpoint, suggesting inspiral motion\ntoward the galaxy center. Other regions present a local maximum in velocity\ndispersion at their center, suggesting a moderate global expansion. The Halpha\nline wings show a number of faint emission features with amplitudes around a\nfew percent of the main Halpha component, and wavelength shifts between 100 and\n400 km/s. The components are often paired, so that red and blue emission\nfeatures with similar amplitudes and shifts appear simultaneously. Assuming the\nfaint emission to be produced by expanding shell-like structures, the inferred\nmass loading factor (mass loss rate divided by star formation rate) exceeds 10.\nSince the expansion velocity exceeds by far the rotational and turbulent\nvelocities, the gas may eventually escape from the galaxy disk. The observed\nmotions involve energies consistent with the kinetic energy released by\nindividual core-collapse supernovae. Alternative explanations for the faint\nemission have been considered and discarded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 17:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-18"}

By a variety\nof arguments of a \"homological\" nature, it is known that the answer to this\nquestion is positive if the curve is sufficiently regular. The regularity\nhypotheses are needed to rule out the possibility of arbitrarily small squares\nthat are inscribed or almost inscribed on the curve; because of this, these\narguments do not appear to be robust enough to handle arbitrarily rough curves.\n  In this paper we augment the homological approach by introducing certain\nintegrals associated to the curve. This approach is able to give positive\nanswers to the square peg problem in some new cases, for instance if the curve\nis the union of two Lipschitz graphs $f, g \\colon [t_0,t_1] \\to \\mathbf{R}$\nthat agree at the endpoints, and whose Lipschitz constants are strictly less\nthan one. We also present some simpler variants of the square problem which\nseem particularly amenable to this integration approach, including a a periodic\nversion of the problem that is not subject to the problem of arbitrarily small\nsquares (and remains open even for regular curves), as well as an almost purely\ncombinatorial conjecture regarding the sign patterns of sums $y_1+y_2+y_3$ for\n$y_1,y_2,y_3$ ranging in finite sets of real numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 18:05:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2017 04:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-06-08"}

One hopes that the posterior is robust to reasonable\nvariation in the choice of prior, since this choice is made by the modeler and\nis often somewhat subjective. A different, equally subjectively plausible\nchoice of prior may result in a substantially different posterior, and so\ndifferent conclusions drawn from the data. Were this to be the case, our\nconclusions would not be robust to the choice of prior. To determine whether\nour model is robust, we must quantify how sensitive our posterior is to\nperturbations of our prior. Despite the importance of the problem and a\nconsiderable body of literature, generic, easy-to-use methods to quantify\nBayesian robustness are still lacking.\n  Abstract In this paper, we demonstrate that powerful measures of robustness\ncan be easily calculated from Variational Bayes (VB) approximate posteriors.

In particular, we show that the\ninfluence function of Gustafson (2012) has a simple, easy-to-calculate closed\nform expression for VB approximations. We then demonstrate how local robustness\nmeasures can be inadequate for non-local prior changes, such as replacing one\nprior entirely with another.

We conjecture that the maximal ratio\n$\\tau^{(m)}(H)/\\nu^{(m)}(H)$ is attained in hypergraphs for which\n$\\nu^{(m)}(H)=1$. This would imply, in particular, the following generalization\nof Tuza's conjecture: if $H$ is $3$-uniform, then $\\tau^{(2)}(H)/\\nu^{(2)}(H)\n\\le 2$. (Tuza's conjecture is the case in which $H$ is the set of all triples\nof vertices of triangles in the graph). We show that most known results on\nTuza's conjecture go over to this more general setting.

Most\npractical implementations, however, neglect higher-order interaction vertices\nbeyond two-particle scattering in the dual effective action and further\ntruncate the diagrammatic expansion in the two-particle scattering vertex to a\nleading-order or ladder-type approximation. In this work we compute the\ndual-fermion expansion for the two-dimensional Hubbard model including all\ndiagram topologies with two-particle interactions to high orders by means of a\nstochastic diagrammatic Monte Carlo algorithm. We benchmark the obtained\nself-energy against numerically exact Diagrammatic Determinant Monte Carlo\nsimulations to systematically assess convergence of the dual-fermion series and\nthe validity of these approximations. We observe that, from high temperatures\ndown to the vicinity of the DMFT N\\'eel transition, the dual-fermion series\nconverges very quickly to the exact solution in the whole range of Hubbard\ninteractions considered ($4 \\leq U/t \\leq 12$), implying that contributions\nfrom higher-order vertices are small. As the temperature is lowered further, we\nobserve slower series convergence, convergence to incorrect solutions, and\nultimately divergence. This happens in a regime where magnetic correlations\nbecome significant. We find however that the self-consistent particle-hole\nladder approximation yields reasonable and often even highly accurate results\nin this regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 21:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 May 2017 17:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-02"}

By linking observed\ngalaxies to a mock sample, selected to reproduce the 3D-HST sample selection\nand redshift accuracy, each 3D-HST galaxy is assigned a probability density\nfunction of the host halo mass, and a probability that is a central or a\nsatellite galaxy. The same procedure is applied to a $z=0$ sample selected from\nSDSS. We compute the fraction of passive central and satellite galaxies as a\nfunction of stellar and halo mass, and redshift, and then derive the fraction\nof galaxies that were quenched by environment specific processes. Using the\nmock sample, we estimate that the timescale for satellite quenching is $t_{\\rm\nquench} \\sim 2-5$ Gyr; longer at lower stellar mass or lower redshift, but\nremarkably independent of halo mass. This indicates that, in the range of\nenvironments commonly found within the 3D-HST sample, satellites are quenched\nby exhaustion of their gas reservoir in absence of cosmological accretion. We\nfind that the quenching times can be separated into a delay phase during which\nsatellite galaxies behave similarly to centrals at fixed stellar mass, and a\nphase where the star formation rate drops rapidly ($\\sim 0.4-0.6$ Gyr), as\nshown previously at $z=0$. We conclude that this scenario requires satellite\ngalaxies to retain a large reservoir of multi-phase gas upon accretion, even at\nhigh redshift, and that this gas sustains star formation for the long quenching\ntimes observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 21:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-02-01"}

The cross-correlation signal between\nthese fields can provide a coherent and comprehensive picture of the neutral\nhydrogen (HI) content of our Universe in the post-reionization era, probing\nboth its mass content and volume distribution. We compute the auto-power\nspectra of both fields together with their cross-power spectrum at z = 2.4 and\nfind that on large scales the fields are completely anti-correlated. This\nanti-correlation arises because regions with high (low) 21cm emission, such as\nthose with a large (low) concentration of damped Lyman-alpha systems, will show\nup as regions with low (high) transmitted flux. We find that on scales smaller\nthan k = 0.2 h/Mpc the cross-correlation coefficient departs from -1, at a\nscale where non-linearities show up. We use the anisotropy of the power spectra\nin redshift-space to determine the values of the bias and of the redshift-space\ndistortion parameters of both fields; we find that the errors on the value of\nthese parameters could decrease by 30% when adding data from the cross-power\nspectrum in a conservative analysis. Our results point out that linear theory\nis capable of reproducing the shape and amplitude of the cross-power up to\nrather non-linear scales. Finally, we find that the 21cm-Lya cross-power\nspectrum can be detected by combining data from a BOSS-like survey together\nwith 21cm intensity mapping observations by SKA1-MID with a S/N ratio higher\nthan 3 in the range 0.06< k <1 h/Mpc.

The large number of\ngenerated NR waveforms consequently requires efficient data storage and\nhandling, especially since many more waveforms will be generated at an\nincreased rate in the forthcoming years. In addition, gravitational wave data\nanalyses often require the NR waveforms to be interpolated and uniformly\nresampled at high sampling rates.

This paper complements the original analyses of\nGW150914 with an investigation of the effects of possible systematic errors in\nthe waveform models on estimates of its source parameters. To test for\nsystematic errors we repeat the original Bayesian analyses on mock signals from\nnumerical simulations of a series of binary configurations with parameters\nsimilar to those found for GW150914. Overall, we find no evidence for a\nsystematic bias relative to the statistical error of the original parameter\nrecovery of GW150914 due to modeling approximations or modeling inaccuracies.\nHowever, parameter biases are found to occur for some configurations disfavored\nby the data of GW150914: for binaries inclined edge-on to the detector over a\nsmall range of choices of polarization angles, and also for eccentricities\ngreater than $\\sim$0.05. For signals with higher signal-to-noise ratio than\nGW150914, or in other regions of the binary parameter space (lower masses,\nlarger mass ratios, or higher spins), we expect that systematic errors in\ncurrent waveform models may impact gravitational-wave measurements, making more\naccurate models desirable for future observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 21:00:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2017 14:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-19"}

This finding is in tension with spatial power spectra\nof the data, which show no indication of this characteristic scale. We\ndemonstrate that this discrepancy is a result of the methodology adopted for\nmeasuring filament widths. First, we perform the previously used analysis\ntechnique on artificial scale-free data, and obtain a peaked width distribution\nof filament-like structures. Next, we repeat the analysis on three Herschel\nmaps and reproduce the narrow distribution of widths found in previous studies\n$-$ when considering the average width of each filament. However, the\ndistribution of widths measured at all points along a filament spine is broader\nthan the distribution of mean filament widths, indicating that the narrow\nspread (interpreted as a \"characteristic\" width) results from averaging.\nFurthermore, the width is found to vary significantly from one end of a\nfilament to the other. Therefore, the previously identified peak at 0.1 pc\ncannot be understood as representing the typical width of filaments. We find an\nalternative explanation by modelling the observed width distribution as a\ntruncated power-law distribution, sampled with uncertainties. The position of\nthe peak is connected to the lower truncation scale and is likely set by the\nchoice of parameters used in measuring filament widths.

One promising model for radio haloes is Fermi-II\nacceleration of seed relativistic electrons by compressible turbulence. The\norigin of these seed electrons has never been fully explored. Here, we\nintegrate the Fokker-Planck equation of the cosmic ray (CR) electron and proton\ndistributions when post-processing cosmological simulations of cluster\nformation, and confront them with radio surface brightness and spectral data of\nComa. For standard assumptions, structure formation shocks lead to a seed\nelectron population which produces too centrally concentrated radio emission.\nMatching observations requires modifying properties of the CR population (rapid\nstreaming; enhanced CR electron acceleration at shocks) or turbulence\n(increasing turbulent-to-thermal energy density with radius), but at the\nexpense of fine-tuning. In a parameter study, we find that radio properties are\nexponentially sensitive to the amplitude of turbulence, which is inconsistent\nwith small scatter in scaling relations. This sensitivity is removed if we\nrelate the acceleration time to the turbulent dissipation time. In this case,\nturbulence above a threshold value provides a fixed amount of amplification;\nobservations could thus potentially constrain the unknown CR seed population.\nTo obtain sufficient acceleration, the turbulent magneto-hydrodynamics cascade\nhas to terminate by transit time damping on CRs, i.e., thermal particles must\nbe scattered by plasma instabilities. Understanding the small scatter in radio\nhalo scaling relations may provide a rich source of insight on plasma processes\nin clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 21:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-01-11"}

Key to\ninterferometry is the concept of optical delay, which facilitates spectral\nanalysis in terms of time-harmonics. In contrast, when analyzing a beam in a\nHilbert space spanned by spatial modes -- a critical task for spatial-mode\nmultiplexing and quantum communication -- basis-specific principles are invoked\nthat are altogether distinct from that of `delay.' Here, we extend the\ntraditional concept of temporal delay to the spatial domain, thereby enabling\nthe analysis of a beam in an arbitrary spatial-mode basis -- exemplified using\nHermite-Gaussian and radial Laguerre-Gaussian modes. Such generalized delays\ncorrespond to optical implementations of fractional transforms; for example,\nthe fractional Hankel transform is the generalized delay associated with the\nspace of Laguerre-Gaussian modes, and an interferometer incorporating such a\n`delay' obtains modal weights in the associated Hilbert space. By implementing\nan inherently stable, reconfigurable spatial-light-modulator-based\npolarization- interferometer, we have constructed a `Hilbert-space analyzer'\ncapable of projecting optical beams onto any modal basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Nov 2016 21:21:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-10-24"}

The result of such a sensitivity analysis\nquantitatively expresses the dependency of the turnover frequency, being the\nmain output variable, on the rate constants entering the model. In the past the\napplication of sensitivity analysis, such as Degree of Rate Control, has been\nhampered by its exuberant computational effort required to accurately sample\nnumerical derivatives of a property that is obtained from a stochastic\nsimulation method. In this study we present an efficient and robust three stage\napproach that is capable of reliably evaluating the sensitivity measures for\nstiff microkinetic models as we demonstrate using CO oxidation on RuO2(110) as\na prototypical reaction. In a first step, we utilize the Fisher Information\nMatrix for filtering out elementary processes which only yield negligible\nsensitivity.

Finally we adopt a method for sampling coupled finite\ndifferences for evaluating the sensitivity measure of lattice based models.\nThis allows efficient evaluation even in critical regions near a second order\nphase transition that are hitherto difficult to control.

In addition to\ngravitational effects, the flow is driven by an electric field, which is normal\nto the substrate far from the flow. We study both the cases of overlying and\nhanging films, where the liquid rests above and below the substrate\nrespectively. Starting with the Navier-Stokes equations coupled with\nelectrostatics, a fully nonlinear 2D Benney equation for the interfacial\ndynamics is derived valid for waves that are long compared to the film\nthickness. The weakly nonlinear evolution is governed by a Kuramoto-Sivashinsky\nequation with a non-local term due to the electric field effect. The electric\nfield term is linearly destabilising and produces growth rates proportional to\nthe cube of the size of the wavenumber vector of the perturbations. It is found\nthat transverse gravitational instabilities are always present for hanging\nfilms and lead to unboundedness of solutions even in the absence of electric\nfields. For overlying films and a restriction on the strength of the electric\nfield, the equation possesses bounded solutions.

The main advantage\nof our method lies in that it consumes nearly as least as possible user traffic\nto satisfy all contracts, therefore more contracts can be accepted to produce\nmore revenue. It also enables the publishers to estimate how much user traffic\nis redundant or short so that they can sell or buy this part of traffic in bulk\nin the exchange market. Furthermore, it is robust with regard to priori\nknowledge of user type distribution. Finally, the simulation shows that our\nmethod outperforms the traditional state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 01:55:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-24"}

However, the faster convergence of restarting APG method relies on the\npotentially unknown constant in QGC to appropriately restart APG, which\nrestricts its applicability. We address this issue by developing a novel\nadaptive gradient converging methods, i.e., leveraging the magnitude of\nproximal gradient as a criterion for restart and termination.

Public\nclouds nowadays provide more and more elaborated types of VMs, but have yet to\noffer the most flexible dynamic VM assembly, which is partly due to the lack of\na mature mechanism for pricing tailor-made VMs on the spot. This work proposes\nan efficient randomized auction mechanism based on a novel application of\nsmoothed analysis and randomized reduction, for dynamic VM provisioning and\npricing in geo-distributed cloud data centers. This auction, to the best of our\nknowledge, is the first one in literature that achieves (i) truthfulness in\nexpectation, (ii) polynomial running time in expectation, and (iii)\n$(1-\\epsilon)$-optimal social welfare in expectation for resource allocation,\nwhere $\\epsilon$ can be arbitrarily close to 0. Our mechanism consists of three\nmodules: (1) an exact algorithm to solve the NP-hard social welfare\nmaximization problem, which runs in polynomial time in expectation, (2) a\nperturbation-based randomized resource allocation scheme which produces a VM\nprovisioning solution that is $(1-\\epsilon)$-optimal, and (3) an auction\nmechanism that applies the perturbation-based scheme for dynamic VM\nprovisioning and prices the customized VMs using a randomized VCG payment, with\na guarantee in truthfulness in expectation.

It deals with what is also known as sparse phase\nretrieval (PR), which is \\emph{NP-hard} in general and emerges in many science\nand engineering applications. Upon formulating sparse PR as an amplitude-based\nnonconvex optimization task, SPARTA works iteratively in two stages: In stage\none, the support of the underlying sparse signal is recovered using an\nanalytically well-justified rule, and subsequently, a sparse\northogonality-promoting initialization is obtained via power iterations\nrestricted on the support; and, in the second stage, the initialization is\nsuccessively refined by means of hard thresholding based gradient-type\niterations. SPARTA is a simple yet effective, scalable, and fast sparse PR\nsolver. On the theoretical side, for any $n$-dimensional $k$-sparse ($k\\ll n$)\nsignal $\\bm{x}$ with minimum (in modulus) nonzero entries on the order of\n$(1/\\sqrt{k})\\|\\bm{x}\\|_2$, SPARTA recovers the signal exactly (up to a global\nunimodular constant) from about $k^2\\log n$ random Gaussian measurements with\nhigh probability. Furthermore, SPARTA incurs computational complexity on the\norder of $k^2n\\log n$ with total runtime proportional to the time required to\nread the data, which improves upon the state-of-the-art by at least a factor of\n$k$.

The profiling method creates a process signature by reducing the\ncontrol-flow graph of a process to a set of minimum spanning trees and then\ncreates a hash of that set. The matching method first checks for similarity in\nprocess behavior by matching the received process signature with the local\nsignature and then shares the result with all replica datanodes for consensus.\nExperimental results show only 0.8% overhead due to the proposed technique when\ntested on the hadoop map-reduce examples in real-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 05:24:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-24"}

They consume\nmultigrid inputs and produce multigrid outputs; convolutional filters\nthemselves have both within-scale and cross-scale extent. This aspect is\ndistinct from simple multiscale designs, which only process the input at\ndifferent scales. Viewed in terms of information flow, a multigrid network\npasses messages across a spatial pyramid. As a consequence, receptive field\nsize grows exponentially with depth, facilitating rapid integration of context.\nMost critically, multigrid structure enables networks to learn internal\nattention and dynamic routing mechanisms, and use them to accomplish tasks on\nwhich modern CNNs fail.\n  Experiments demonstrate wide-ranging performance advantages of multigrid. On\nCIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, flipping from a single grid to\nmultigrid within the standard CNN paradigm improves accuracy, while being\ncompute and parameter efficient. Multigrid is independent of other\narchitectural choices; we show synergy in combination with residual\nconnections. Multigrid yields dramatic improvement on a synthetic semantic\nsegmentation dataset. Most strikingly, relatively shallow multigrid networks\ncan learn to directly perform spatial transformation tasks, where, in contrast,\ncurrent CNNs fail.

These galaxies contain a substantial young A-type stellar\ncomponent, but have only little ongoing star formation (SF). HI 21-cm line\nemission is found in approximately half of the nearby E+A galaxies, indicating\nthat they contain a reservoir of gas that could fuel active SF. Here, we study\ntwo HI-rich galaxies, which show a typical E+A spectrum at the centre and SF at\nlarger radii. We present new high spatial resolution radio interferometric\nobservations of the HI 21-cm emission line using the VLA and of the CO(1-0)\nemission line using ALMA. We combine these data sets to predict the SFR and\nshow that it does not correlate well with the SFR derived from H alpha on\nsub-kpc scales. We apply a recently developed statistical model for the small\nscale behaviour of the SF relation to predict and interpret the observed\nscatter.

The derived upper limit on the\nCO mass implies a molecular gas depletion time shorter than 20 Myr.

This finding adds to the\nexisting literature reporting a scale dependence of the molecular SF relation,\nshowing that the atomic and molecular phases are both susceptible to the\nevolutionary 'cycling' of individual regions.

Most recent progress in\nthis problem has been achieved through employing 2-D and/or 3-D Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNN) to encode video content and Recurrent Neural Networks\n(RNN) to decode a sentence. In this paper, we present Long Short-Term Memory\nwith Transferred Semantic Attributes (LSTM-TSA)---a novel deep architecture\nthat incorporates the transferred semantic attributes learnt from images and\nvideos into the CNN plus RNN framework, by training them in an end-to-end\nmanner. The design of LSTM-TSA is highly inspired by the facts that 1) semantic\nattributes play a significant contribution to captioning, and 2) images and\nvideos carry complementary semantics and thus can reinforce each other for\ncaptioning. To boost video captioning, we propose a novel transfer unit to\nmodel the mutually correlated attributes learnt from images and videos.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets, i.e., MSVD, M-VAD\nand MPII-MD. Our proposed LSTM-TSA achieves to-date the best published\nperformance in sentence generation on MSVD: 52.8% and 74.0% in terms of BLEU@4\nand CIDEr-D. Superior results when compared to state-of-the-art methods are\nalso reported on M-VAD and MPII-MD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 07:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-24"}

In this article, we present an\noverview of the recent advances in X-ray microscopy that allow researchers to\ndirectly watch spins move in time and space at the microscopically relevant\nscales. We discuss scanning X-ray transmission microscopy (STXM) at resonant\nsoft X-ray edges, which is available at most modern synchrotron light sources.\nThis technique measures magnetic contrast through the X-ray magnetic circular\ndichroism (XMCD) effect at the resonant absorption edges, while focusing the\nX-ray radiation at the nanometre scale, and using the intrinsic pulsed\nstructure of synchrotron-generated X-rays to create time-resolved images of\nmagnetism at the nanoscale. In particular, we discuss how the presence of spin\ncurrents can be detected by imaging spin accumulation, and how the\nmagnetisation dynamics in thin ferromagnetic films can be directly imaged. We\ndiscuss how a direct look at the phenomena allows for a deeper understanding of\nthe the physics at play, that is not accessible to other, more indirect\ntechniques. Finally, we present an overview of the exciting opportunities that\nlie ahead to further understand the fundamentals of novel spin physics,\nopportunities offered by the appearance of diffraction limited storage rings\nand free electron lasers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 08:52:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Dec 2016 14:10:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

One aspect prominent in the diffeological context has to do\nwith the choice of an appropriate substitute for tangent vectors and smooth\nvector fields, since there are not yet standard counterparts for these notions.\nIn this respect we opt for the simplest possibility; since there is an\nestablished notion of the (pseudo-)bundle of differential forms on a\ndiffeological space, we take the corresponding dual pseudo-bundle to play the\nrole of the tangent bundle. Smooth vector fields are then smooth sections of\nthis dual pseudo-bundle; this is one reason why we devote a particular\nattention to the space of smooth sections of an arbitrary diffeological vector\npseudo-bundle (one curiosity is that it might easily turn out to be\ninfinite-dimensional, even when the pseudo-bundle itself has a trivial\nfinite-dimensional vector bundle as the underlying map).

To better\ndifferentiate the top performers, additional criteria are required. Moreover,\nthe (test) images, on which the performance scores are based, predominantly\ncontain fully visible objects. Therefore, `harder' test images, mimicking the\nchallenging conditions (e.g. occlusion) in which humans routinely recognize\nobjects, need to be utilized for benchmarking. To address the concerns\nmentioned above, we make two contributions. First, we systematically vary the\nlevel of local object-part content, global detail and spatial context in images\nfrom PASCAL VOC 2010 to create a new benchmarking dataset dubbed PPSS-12.\nSecond, we propose an object-part based benchmarking procedure which quantifies\nclassifiers' robustness to a range of visibility and contextual settings. The\nbenchmarking procedure relies on a semantic similarity measure that naturally\naddresses potential semantic granularity differences between the category\nlabels in training and test datasets, thus eliminating manual mapping. We use\nour procedure on the PPSS-12 dataset to benchmark top-performing classifiers\ntrained on the ILSVRC-2012 dataset. Our results show that the proposed\nbenchmarking procedure enables additional differentiation among\nstate-of-the-art object classifiers in terms of their ability to handle missing\ncontent and insufficient object detail. Given this capability for additional\ndifferentiation, our approach can potentially supplement existing benchmarking\nprocedures used in object recognition challenge leaderboards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 09:38:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2016 14:06:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-28"}

In this paper, by using Araki's\nrelative entropy for states, we mathematically define and analyze the heat\nproduction of free fermions within external potentials. More precisely, we\ninvestigate the heat production of the non-autonomous C*-dynamical system\nobtained from the fermionic second quantization of a discrete Schr\\\"odinger\noperator with bounded static potential in presence of an electric field that is\ntime- and space-dependent. It is a first preliminary step towards a\nmathematical description of transport properties of fermions from thermal\nconsiderations. This program will be carried out in several papers. The regime\nof small and slowly varying in space electric fields is important in this\ncontext, and is studied the present paper. We use tree-decay bounds of the\n$n$-point, $n\\in 2\\mathbb{N}$, correlations of the many-fermion system to\nanalyze this regime. We verify below the 1st law of thermodynamics for the\nsystem under consideration.

The identification of heat production with an energy\nincrement is, among other things, technically convenient.

Capacitance-voltage spectroscopy (C(V)-spectroscopy)\nmeasurements are an established instrument to analyze the electronic structure\nand energy levels of self-assembled quantum dots (QDs). We perform C(V) in the\ndark and C(V) under the influence of non-resonant illumination, probing exciton\nstates up to $X^{4+}$ on InAs QDs embedded in a GaAs matrix for temperatures\nranging from 2.5 K to 120 K. While a small shift in the charging spectra\nresonance is observed for the two pure spin degenerate electron s-state\ncharging voltages with increasing temperature, a huge shift is visible for the\nelectron-hole excitonic states resonance voltages. The $s_2$-peak moves to\nslightly higher, the $s_1$-peak to slightly lower charging voltages. In\ncontrast, the excitonic states are surprisingly charged at much lower voltages\nupon increasing temperature.

All films investigated are phase-pure and of high quality with a sharp\ninterface between MnSi and Si. The investigated MnSi films are in a thickness\nregime where the magnetic transition temperature $T_\\mathrm{c}$ assumes a\nthickness-independent enhanced value of $\\geq$43~K as compared with that of\nbulk MnSi, where $T_\\mathrm{c} \\approx 29~{\\rm K}$. A detailed refinement of\nthe EXAFS data reveals that the Mn positions are unchanged, whereas the Si\npositions vary along the out-of-plane [111]-direction, alternating in\norientation from unit cell to unit cell. Thus, for thick MnSi films, the unit\ncell volume is essentially that of bulk MnSi --- except in the vicinity of the\ninterface with the Si substrate (thin film limit). In view of the enhanced\nmagnetic transition temperature we conclude that the mere presence of the\ninterface, and its specific characteristics, strongly affects the magnetic\nproperties of the entire MnSi film, even far from the interface. Our analysis\nprovides invaluable information about the local strain at the MnSi/Si(111)\ninterface. The presented methodology of polarization dependent EXAFS can also\nbe employed to investigate the local structure of other interesting interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 10:52:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-24"}

Recent advances in\nmulti-ferroic materials have paved the way for electric field induced low\nenergy and fast switching of nano-magnets using the magneto-electric (ME)\neffect. In this paper, we propose a voltage driven logic-device based on the ME\ninduced switching of nano-magnets. We further demonstrate that the proposed\nlogic-device, which exhibits decoupled read and write paths, can be used to\nconstruct a complete logic family including XNOR, NAND and NOR gates. The\nproposed logic family shows good scalability with a quadratic dependence of\nswitching energy with respect to the switching voltage. Further, the proposed\nlogic-device has better robustness against the effect of thermal noise as\ncompared to the conventional current driven switching of nano-magnets. A\ndevice-to-circuit level coupled simulation framework, including magnetization\ndynamics and electron transport model, has been developed for analyzing the\npresent proposal.

The two established metrics used for this purpose are price of\nanarchy (POA) and price of stability (POS), which respectively provide upper\nand lower bounds on this ratio. A deficiency of these metrics, however, is that\nthey are purely existential and shed no light on which of the equilibrium\nstates are reachable in an actual game, i.e., via natural game dynamics. This\nis particularly striking if these metrics differ significantly, such as in\nnetwork design games where the exponential gap between the best and worst NE\nstates originally prompted the notion of POS in game theory (Anshelevich et\nal., FOCS 2002). In this paper, we make progress toward bridging this gap by\nstudying network design games under natural game dynamics.\n  First we show that in a completely decentralized setting, where agents\narrive, depart, and make improving moves in an arbitrary order, the\ninefficiency of NE attained can be polynomially large. This implies that the\ngame designer must have some control over the interleaving of these events in\norder to force the game to attain efficient NE. We complement our negative\nresult by showing that if the game designer is allowed to execute a sequence of\nimproving moves to create an equilibrium state after every batch of agent\narrivals or departures, then the resulting equilibrium states attained by the\ngame are exponentially more efficient, i.e., the ratio of costs compared to the\noptimum is only logarithmic. Overall, our two results establish that in network\ngames, the efficiency of equilibrium states is dictated by whether agents are\nallowed to join or leave the game in arbitrary states, an observation that\nmight be useful in analyzing the dynamics of other classes of games with\ndivergent POS and POA bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 11:18:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-24"}

The reformulated energy function\nyields the same alternating estimation process, but more clearly reveals how\nblind deconvolution works. We then show the energy function can actually favor\nthe right solution instead of the no-blur solution under certain conditions,\nwhich explains the success of previous MAP based approaches. The reformulated\nenergy function and our conditions for the convergence also provide a way to\ncompare the qualities of different blur kernels, and we demonstrate its\napplicability to automatic blur kernel size selection, blur kernel estimation\nusing light streaks, and defocus estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 11:53:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 14:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-08-29"}

Furthermore, this feature vector evolves during the\nmovement performance so that a complete movement is fully represented by a\nmatrix M of size DxT , whose element M i, j represents the value of feature i\nat timestamps j. Many studies have addressed dimensionality reduction\nconsidering only the size of the feature vector lying in R D to reduce both the\nvariability of gestural sequences expressed in the reduced space, and the\ncomputational complexity of their processing. In return, very few of these\nmethods have explicitly addressed the dimensionality reduction along the time\naxis. Yet this is a major issue when considering the use of elastic distances\nwhich are characterized by a quadratic complexity along the time axis. We\npresent in this paper an evaluation of straightforward approaches aiming at\nreducing the dimensionality of the matrix M for each movement, leading to\nconsider both the dimensionality reduction of the feature vector as well as its\nreduction along the time axis. The dimensionality reduction of the feature\nvector is achieved by selecting remarkable joints in the skeleton performing\nthe movement, basically the extremities of the articulatory chains composing\nthe skeleton. The temporal dimen-sionality reduction is achieved using either a\nregular or adaptive down-sampling that seeks to minimize the reconstruction\nerror of the movements. Elastic and Euclidean kernels are then compared through\nsupport vector machine learning. Two data sets 1 that are widely referenced in\nthe domain of human gesture recognition, and quite distinctive in terms of\nquality of motion capture, are used for the experimental assessment of the\nproposed approaches. On these data sets we experimentally show that it is\nfeasible, and possibly desirable, to significantly reduce simultaneously the\nsize of the feature vector and the number of skeleton frames to represent body\nmovements while maintaining a very good recognition rate. The method proves to\ngive satisfactory results at a level currently reached by state-of-the-art\nmethods on these data sets. We experimentally show that the computational\ncomplexity reduction that is obtained makes this approach eligible for\nreal-time applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 13:18:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-24"}

Here we explain the behavior of\nsmooth FPT densities, for which all moments are finite, and demonstrate\nuniversal yet generally non-Poissonian long-time asymptotics for a broad\nvariety of transport processes. While Poisson-like asymptotics arise\ngenerically in the presence of an effective repulsion in the immediate vicinity\nof the target, a time-scale separation between direct and reflected indirect\ntrajectories gives rise to a universal proximity effect: Direct paths, heading\nmore or less straight from the point of release to the target, become typical\nand focused, with a narrow spread of the corresponding first passage times.\nConversely, statistically dominant indirect paths exploring the system size\ntend to be massively dissimilar. The initial distance to the target\nparticularly impacts gene regulatory or competitive stochastic processes, for\nwhich often few binding events determine the regulatory outcome. The proximity\neffect is independent of details of the transport, highlighting the robust\ncharacter of the FPT features uncovered here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 13:41:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-24"}

Recent work has\nidentified that at some point ultra-densification will no longer be able to\ndeliver significant throughput gains. In this paper, we provide a unified\ntreatment of the performance limits of network densification. We develop a\ngeneral framework, which incorporates multi-slope pathloss and the entire space\nof shadowing and small scale fading distributions, under strongest cell\nassociation in a Poisson field of interferers. First, our results show that\nthere are three scaling regimes for the downlink\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), coverage probability, and\naverage per-user rate. Specifically, depending on the near-field pathloss and\nthe fading distribution, the user performance of 5G ultra dense networks (UDNs)\nwould either monotonically increase, saturate, or decay with increasing network\ndensity. Second, we show that network performance in terms of coverage density\nand area spectral efficiency can scale with the network density better than the\nuser performance does. Furthermore, we provide ordering results for both\ncoverage and average rate as a means to qualitatively compare different\ntransmission techniques that may exhibit the same performance scaling. Our\nresults, which are verified by simulations, provide succinct insights and\nvaluable design guidelines for the deployment of 5G UDNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 13:46:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2017 12:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-04-06"}

In the present\nwork we resume Sakharov's original program for baryogenesis and propose a\ncentral role for gravity in the process. This is achieved through a non-minimal\ncoupling (NMC) between the gravitational field and both the strong interaction\nfield and the quark fields. When in action, the present mechanism leads to\nbaryon number non-conservation and CP violation. Moreover, the NMC induces\nreduced effective quark masses, which favours a first order QCD phase\ntransition.

In contrast, the specific heat is shown to be self-averaging with a\ndistribution function that tends to a $\\delta$-peak in the thermodynamic limit\n$L \\to \\infty$. While previously a lack of self-averaging was found for the\nfree energy, we here obtain results for quantities that are directly measurable\nin simulations, and implications for measurements in the actual lattice system\nare discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 14:32:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 09:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-03-13"}

Despite the general success of the end-to-end learning paradigm,\ntop performing approaches employ a two-step solution consisting of a\nConvolutional Network (ConvNet) for 2D joint localization and a subsequent\noptimization step to recover 3D pose. In this paper, we identify the\nrepresentation of 3D pose as a critical issue with current ConvNet approaches\nand make two important contributions towards validating the value of end-to-end\nlearning for this task. First, we propose a fine discretization of the 3D space\naround the subject and train a ConvNet to predict per voxel likelihoods for\neach joint. This creates a natural representation for 3D pose and greatly\nimproves performance over the direct regression of joint coordinates. Second,\nto further improve upon initial estimates, we employ a coarse-to-fine\nprediction scheme. This step addresses the large dimensionality increase and\nenables iterative refinement and repeated processing of the image features. The\nproposed approach outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on standard\nbenchmarks achieving a relative error reduction greater than 30% on average.\nAdditionally, we investigate using our volumetric representation in a related\narchitecture which is suboptimal compared to our end-to-end approach, but is of\npractical interest, since it enables training when no image with corresponding\n3D groundtruth is available, and allows us to present compelling results for\nin-the-wild images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 15:06:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 12:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-07-27"}

Although\nthe generic behaviour of the model is understood, the details are not.\nDifferent choices will necessarily lead to different outputs (for identical\ninputs). We can only proceed if choices that are \"close\" give outcomes are\nsimilar. Where there are local differences it suggests that there was no\ncompelling reason for one outcome rather than the other. If these differences\nare important for the historic record we may interpret this as sensitivity to\ncontingency. We re-examine the rise of Greek city states as first formulated by\nRihll and Wilson in 1979, initially using the same \"retail\" gravity model. We\nsuggest that, whereas cities like Athens owe their position to a combination of\ngeography and proximity to other sites, the rise of Thebes is the most\ncontingent, whose success reflects social forces outside the grasp of simple\nnetwork modelling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 15:22:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-19"}

There are two main differences with spectral\ntriples: the existence of time-orientation 1-forms and the non-existence of a\ndistinguished C*-structure on the algebra. If a \"reconstructibility condition\"\nis met, different, yet isomorphic, C*-structures exist. We define a natural\nnotion of stable causality for spectral spacetimes. We give an example of a\ncommutative spectral spacetime which is a Wick rotated version of the spectral\ntriple that must be used in order to recover the usual notion of distance on a\nfinite graph through Connes' distance formula. We show that this spectral\nspacetime is stably causal iff the time-orientation form induces no cycle. We\nalso provide a noncommutative example, the split Dirac structure, which we\nstudy in some details. This structure is defined thanks to a discrete spinor\nbundle on a finite graph, a discrete connection, and operators at the vertices\nplaying the role of gamma matrices.

We derive constraints from a combination of current and future\ncosmological datasets on the total neutrino mass $M_\\nu$ and on the mass\nfractions carried by each of the mass eigenstates, after marginalizing over the\n(unknown) neutrino mass ordering, either normal (NH) or inverted (IH). The\nbounds take therefore into account the uncertainty related to our ignorance of\nthe mass hierarchy. This novel approach is carried out in the framework of\nBayesian analysis of a typical hierarchical problem. In this context, the\nchoice of the neutrino mass ordering is modeled via the discrete hyperparameter\n$h_{type}$. The preference for either the NH or the IH scenarios is then\nencoded in the posterior distribution of $h_{type}$ itself. Current CMB\nmeasurements assign equal odds to the two hierarchies, and are thus unable to\ndistinguish between them. However, after the addition of BAO measurements, a\nweak preference for NH appears, with odds of 4:3 from Planck temperature and\nlarge-scale polarization in combination with BAO (3:2 if small-scale\npolarization is also included). Forecasts suggest that the combination of\nupcoming CMB (COrE) and BAO surveys (DESI) may determine the neutrino mass\nhierarchy at a high statistical significance if the mass is very close to the\nminimal value allowed by oscillations, as for NH and $M_\\nu=0.06$ eV there is a\n9:1 preference of NH vs IH. On the contrary, if $M_\\nu$ is of the order of 0.1\neV or larger, even future cosmological observations will be inconclusive. The\nunbiased limit on $M_\\nu$ we obtain with this innovative statistical strategy\nis crucial for ongoing and planned neutrinoless double beta decay searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 15:49:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2017 15:49:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-02-02"}

Using our homogenous resistivity model, those peak values\nwere 1.46~V~km\\textsuperscript{-1} and 25.8~A. We find that three 400 and\n275~kV substations are the most likely locations for the Irish transformers to\nexperience large GICs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 12:47:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-28"}

We apply the Huygens-Fresnel Wave-based Electric\nField Superposition (HF-WEFS) method combined with the radiating dipole\napproximation to compute the effects of scattering-induced distortions of focal\nexcitation fields on the far-field CARS signal. We analyze the effect of\nspherical scatterers, placed in the vicinity of the focal volume, on the CARS\nsignal emitted by different objects (2{\\mu}m diameter solid sphere, 2{\\mu}m\ndiameter myelin cylinder and 2{\\mu}m diameter myelin tube). We find that\ndistortions in the CARS signals arise not only from attenuation of the focal\nfield but also from scattering-induced changes in the spatial phase that\nmodifies the angular distribution of the CARS emission. Our simulations further\nshow that CARS signal attenuation can be minimized by using a high numerical\naperture condenser. Moreover, unlike the CARS intensity image, CARS images\nformed by taking the ratio of CARS signals obtained using x- and y-polarized\ninput fields is relatively insensitive to the effects of spherical scatterers.\nOur computational framework provide a mechanistic approach to characterizing\nscattering-induced distortions in coherent imaging of turbid media and may\ninspire bottom-up approaches for adaptive optical methods for image correction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Nov 2016 07:48:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2017 21:42:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}
